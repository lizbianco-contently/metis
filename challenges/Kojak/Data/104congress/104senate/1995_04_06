Mr. President, this request has been agreed to by both \nthe minority and the majority leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration \nof the conference report to accompany \n[[Page S5274]] S. 244, the paperwork reduction bill; that the \nconference report be agreed to; and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 244) \n     to further the goals of the Paperwork Reduction Act to have \n     Federal agencies become more responsible and publicly \n     accountable for reducing the burden of Federal paperwork on \n     the public, and for other purposes, having met, after full \n     and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 3, 1995.)\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to state that our bipartisan \nefforts to strengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act, which began in the \nlast Congress, has now in this Congress become bicameral. The conferees \nwere able to resolve the differences between the Houses so that before \nthe week is over the Congress will have concluded its work on a bill \nthat significantly improves upon current law.\n  As my colleagues know, the 1980 Act established within OMB the Office \nof Information and Regulatory Affairs [OIRA]. That offices was directed \nto review the paperwork burdens created by the Federal Government. All \ncollections of information from 10 or more persons must, with very few \nexceptions, be reviewed by OIRA for their need and practical utility \nand must receive a clearance number before they can become effective.\n  The fundamental purpose of this review process is to reduce the \npaperwork burden on the American public. Hence, the name given to this \nlegislation. However, before this legislation now pending, because of \nthe Supreme Court decision in Dole versus Steelworkers, not all \npaperwork burdens caused by the Federal Government had to be reviewed \nand cleared. The Court said that the act applied to paperwork that \nflowed from a private party to the Federal Government and not to \ninstances where the Federal Government required a person to provide \ninformation to another person.\n  As a policy matter, I have never favored the distinction made in the \nDole case. The conference report makes clear that neither House of \nCongress accepts this distinction. The Dole case is overturned, and the \nscope of OIRA's review authority is, as a consequence, enlarged by 50 \npercent. This change marks a major breakthrough in our paperwork \nreduction efforts.\n  In noting the major effect of this legislation, I do not mean to \nimply that it was a major issue with the House. It was not. In fact, in \nview of the breadth of this legislation, the issues in disagreement \nwere relatively few.\n  Perhaps the most significant disagreement concerned the duration of \nthe authorization of appropriations for OIRA. The Senate bill provided \n$8 million for each of the next 5 years, while the House had an \nindefinite and permanent authorization. The conferees compromised on \nthe Senate version for an additional year. This 6-year authorization \nwill prompt us to review the legislation at some future time, which was \nthe underlying rationale of the Senate provision.\n  The House argued that OIRA has clearly been established as a matter \nof policy, if not in law, as a central organ of the Federal Government \nand a key instrument of current regulatory reform efforts. The Senate \nresponded that it was not its position to sunset either the Paperwork \nReduction Act or OIRA. The lack of a permanent authorization of \nappropriations for OIRA has never before, even when it has expired, \ncaused OIRA to terminate.\n  I agree that OIRA has become a necessary and permanent\n   policeman of paperwork and regulation. But I also continue to hold \nmy longstanding commitment to limited authorizations. Six years is a \nsubstantial period of time. A lot can change in 6 years. In 2001, it is \nentirely appropriate that Congress review the status of our paperwork \nreduction efforts and the role of OIRA.\n\n  A second major issue of disagreement between the Houses concerned the \nannual percentage goals for Governmentwide reductions in paperwork \nburdens. The Senate set a 5 percent goal for each of the next 5 years. \nThe House set a 10 percent annual goal forever. Of course, all the \nconferees would like to see substantial reductions. The question was a \npractical one: what goal was realistically achievable? Once we had \ndecided on a 6-year timeframe, the issue became more focused. While the \nHouse conferees made clear that their 10 percent goal was to be set \nannually with respect to a new paperwork baseline that would include \nnew congressional paperwork mandates, Senate conferees were still \nconcerned that 10 percent a year for 6 years was unrealistic. After \nsome discussion, it was agreed that the paperwork reduction goals of \nthe Federal Government should be set at 10 percent for each of the \nfirst 2 years and 5 percent for each of the other 4 years.\n  A third major issue of disagreement concerned the House provision \nwhich permitted OIRA to charge the users of Government information more \nthan the cost of disseminating such information. While there might be \nsome instances where such an authority would be appropriate, the House \nprovision was not crafted in any such limited manner. The Senate \nconferees thought it was a little late in the legislative process to \nstart isolating circumstances where charges in addition to \ndissemination costs might be appropriate. Not having addressed this \nissue at all in the Senate bill, the Senate conferees asked that the \nHouse recede. And the House agreed.\n  Mr. President, the topic that captured more time in conference \ndiscussion than any other was that of redrafting section 3512, which \nprovides public protection against agency noncompliance with the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. Since 1980, the act has provided a fundamental \nprotection to every citizen that he or she need not comply with, or \nrespond to, a collection of information if such collection does not \ndisplay a valid control number given by OMB as evidence that the \ncollection was reviewed and approved by OIRA. And if the collection \ndoes not display a valid control number, the agency may not impose any \npenalty on the citizen who fails to comply or respond.\n  In order to strengthen and underscore congressional desire to protect \nthe public, the conferees included a definition of penalty at the end \nof section 3502 to make clear that the term not only applies to the \npayment of a fine but also to the denial of a benefit. What this means \nis that if an agency does not comply with this act, it is in serious \ntrouble. If an agency does not act on a citizen's request for a \nGovernment benefit because the citizen did not complete a form that \nfails to display a valid OMB clearance number, it is the agency--not \nthe citizen--that\n stands in violation of law. Once this is determined, the agency would \nnot only owe the citizen the benefits due but also perhaps interest as \nwell.\n\n  Now there are some who may grumble that this provision is too weak. \nSince 1980, section 3512 has included an alternative clause of public \nprotection requiring the collection of information to state that if it \ndid not display a valid OMB control number, it was not subject to the \nact. Some may view that second clause as a tautology. That is how \nagencies have interpreted it. But some others have believed that it \nrequires: First, that every effort by the Government to collect \ninformation, even those not covered by the act, be accompanied by a \nstatement advising that such collection is not required to have a \nclearance number; and second, that consequently a failure to provide \nsuch advice would subject the collection of information to the public \nprotection sanctions of section 3512, even though the collection was \nnot subject to the act.\n  Now the act specifies in section 3518 certain exceptions from the \nact. A subpoena is one example. Also, by definition, a collection of \ninformation falls under the act only if 10 or more persons are \ninvolved. My view is that since a subpoena is not covered by the act's \nclearance requirements and since a request for information made to nine \nor fewer individuals is likewise not covered, then in such cases the \nsanctions of section 3512 have no application. It is simply foolish, in \nmy opinion, to require an agency to inform a person it is \n[[Page S5275]] dealing with about the laws that do not apply.\n  So with the concurrence of all the Senate conferees, this second \nclause was rewritten to be both feasible and useful. It now requires \nthe agency to inform the person who is to respond to collections of \ninformation governed by the act that such person is not required to \nrespond to the collection of information unless it displays a valid \ncontrol number from OMB. This statement of how section 3512 operates to \nprotect the public technically need not appear on the collection of \ninformation itself. That is because the term collection of information \nincludes more than Government requests for information. An example of \nan additional item included within the definition might be a \nrecordkeeping requirement. In such case, the collection of information \nmight not be a Government form but instead a legal requirement about \nwhich the agency provides instructions.\n  While the conferees provided some flexibility regarding the second \nclause of section 3512(a), it is their intention that the agency inform \nthose who are to respond in a manner reasonably calculated to bring the \nmatter to their attention. If the collection is a Government form to be \ncompleted and submitted by a person, then that form should bear the \nnecessary statement to fulfill the requirements of section 3512(a)(2). \nIf the collection concerns something else, such as recordkeeping, then \nthe agency should make it section 3512(a)(2) statement as clearly as \npossible in some document, such as instructions\n regarding such recordkeeping.\n\n  Moreover, in section 3512(b) the conferees made clear that the \nprotections of section 3512 may be raised at any time during the life \nof the matter. The protections cannot be waived. Failure to raise them \nat any early stage does not preclude later assertion of rights under \nthis section, regardless of any agency or judicial rules to the \ncontrary.\n  I believe that as a result of our changes to section 3512 we have \nsubstantially strengthened that section and, in turn, the entire act. \nAny agency that fails to comply with the clearance provisions of this \nact does so at its peril. Any collection of information, unless \nexcepted by this act, must be cleared by OMB. And this applies to all \nagencies, including independent agencies.\n  Neither the House nor the Senate sought to change the policy of the \n1980 Act that all agencies, including independent agencies, have their \ninformation collections, even those by regulation, subjected to OMB \nreview and approval. So while exceptions are made for certain law \nenforcement and intelligence activities, none is made for duck hunting \nor the safety and soundness regulations of banking agencies, \nApparently, no difficulties have arisen in the last 15 years under the \n1980 Act. So no change is made from current law.\n  The final major item of disagreement concerned the standard by which \nregulations which include information collections are judged. Under \ncurrent law, OMB reviews such agency rules and comments thereon \napplying the standard of section 3508--whether the collection is \nunnecessary) and thereafter approves or disapproves after receiving the \nagency's response to OMB's comments. By what standard does OMB decide? \nCurrent law allows OMB to disapprove if the agency's response was \nunreasonable. The House sought to tidy up by cross-referencing section \n3508 rather than using the current law's formulation of unreasonable.\n  As a practical matter, there is no real difference between whether \nthe agency's response to OMB's comments are unreasonable in light of \nOMB's views on whether the agency's collection is unnecessary under \nsection 3508 and whether the collection is unnecessary under that \nsection. Since both standards--unreasonable and unnecessary--lack \nprecision, there is nothing in current law to stop OMB, unless \npersuaded by the agency's response, from disapproving a regulatory \ncollection because it would be unnecessary under section 3508.\n  Some of my Senate colleagues believe that the House position \nundermined an important difference--a zone of deference to be accorded \nagency rulemaking. The argument is that OMB may disapprove a regulation \nonly if the agency's response is unreasonable even if OMB believes that \ncollection is unnecessary. While the argument tracks the words of \ncurrent law, I am not persuaded that the zone of deference has any \ndimension to it at all. Nor do I see what benefit would derive from \nmaking a distinction between collections undertaken as part of a \nregulation and those outside of a regulation, which are\n covered only by section 3508. Either way, if the collections are \nunnecessary, they should be disapproved. What is the compelling \nargument for allowing unnecessary collections to burden the American \npublic simply because the agency's response was not unreasonable?\n\n  Ultimately, the conferees decided to keep current law because it \nsatisfied more conferees then did the House version's unambiguous \nlanguage. Current law satisfies the majority of conferees who believe \nthat nothing stops OMB from disapproving a regulatory collection found \nto be unnecessary while it allows others to argue that some \nmetaphysical zone of deference is preserved for regulatory collections.\n  Mr. President, when we last came to the floor on S. 244, the Senate \nadopted several amendments that did not directly bear upon the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. Only one of those amendments survived the \nconference. That amendment by Senator Coverdell sought to reduce small \nbusiness compliance burdens with the Quarterly Financial Report Program \nat the Bureau of the Census. With some minor modifications, this \nprovision has been transformed in conference from a pilot project to a \npermanent program change. The provision, as modified, has the support \nof its original sponsor and of the Census Bureau.\n  Two amendments dealing with the elimination of unnecessary reports to \nCongress--one by Senator McCain and one by Senator Levin--were dropped \nat the insistence of the House. Conferees had received correspondence \nfrom various congressional committees and agencies raising technical \nand other concerns about these provisions. Representative Clinger, who \nchaired the conference, indicated that he favored the purpose of the \nreports-elimination provisions but could not hold up the Paperwork \nReduction Act while various concerns with these nongermane amendments \nwere addressed. He said he would introduce a companion bill in the \nHouse and would seek to move the legislation there.\n  Finally, an amendment that expressed the sense of the Senate \nregarding the Oregon option was also dropped in conference at the \ninsistence of the House conferees.\n  Mr. President, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 passed both Houses \non rollcall votes with not a single dissenting voice. I am pleased to \nreport that the conferees have resolved all differences between the two \nbodies with the result that we have even a stronger bill than before. \nIt should be noted that we could not have moved so swiftly to passage \nand through conference without the bipartisan cooperation of Senator \nNunn, the chief sponsor of S. 244, and Senator Glenn, the ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. I commend \nthem for their hard work on this legislation not only in this Congress \nbut in the last. Their effort set a mark not only in the Senate but in \nthe House and made enactment of this legislation possible within the \nfirst 100 days of the 104th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this conference report.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise before \nmy colleagues today and urge their acceptance of the conference report \non our bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Paperwork Reduction \nAct. This day has been a long time in coming. At long last, we can take \nour final step toward presenting the President with a bill that I am \nsure he will sign and that I am equally confident will reduce paperwork \nand improve the management of Federal information resources.\n  Passage of this legislation is an accomplishment that I am very proud \nof. Reauthorization of the act was one of my major priorities during my \n6 years as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. After \nseveral years of discordant debate about the act's implementation, we \nfashioned a bipartisan bill that resolved outstanding issues and moved \nthe act forward to more clearly address new Information \n[[Page S5276]] Age issues. This bill was unanimously passed by the \nSenate on October 6, 1994.\n  Unfortunately, the House was unable to act before the end of the 103d \nCongress. The legislation that we have before us today is this same \nbill, with only a few minor changes. This year's House bill itself was \nalso modeled very, very closely on our bill. I am thus very proud of \nthe leadership our committee provided in the last Congress, the \nbipartisan cooperation that continued into this Congress, and the \naccomplishment that we now have before us.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act is a vitally important law. Originally \nenacted in 1980, and reauthorized in 1986, the act serves two closely \nrelated and very essential public purposes. First, the act is key to \nthe ongoing effort to reduce Government paperwork burdens on the \nAmerican public. Too often, our citizens--individuals, businesses, \nState and local governments, academic institutions, nonprofit \norganizations, and more--are burdened by having to fill out \nquestionnaires and forms that simply are not needed to implement the \nlaws of the land. Too much time and money is wasted in an effort to \nsatisfy bureaucratic excess.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 took up the battle by \ntransforming a leaky review process--created in 1942--into a strong \ncentralized OMB clearance process to control the information appetite \nof agencies all across the Federal Government. The Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995 strengthens this process, primarily by increasing the \npaperwork reduction responsibilities of the individual agencies, so \nthat we can make new progress in fighting Government redtape.\n  The act's second core purpose is to improve Federal information \nresources management. This is not a separate or secondary goal. \nReducing the costs and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \nGovernment information activities is an essential element of paperwork \nreduction. As the 1977 Federal paperwork Commission commented, how can \nFederal agencies reduce paperwork if they don't know what information \nthey possess or how best to use it? We simply cannot reduce paperwork \nburdens on the American people unless we can get more efficient and \neffective information activities out of Federal agencies.\n  Our entry into the Information Age signals an even more fundamental \ntruth. We cannot provide efficient and effective Government operations \nwithout efficient and effective information activities. Program \noperations, service delivery, agency policy formulation and decisions--\nall now depend increasingly on information technology.\n  The scale of this transformation of the Government from a paper-\ndriven to a computer-driven operation is staggering. The Federal \nGovernment is now spending over $25 billion each year on information \ntechnology. We have truly entered the Information Age. Automated data \nprocessing for program applications, electronic benefits transfer for \nfood stamps distribution, electronic data interchange to speed up \nFederal contracting, direct deposit for more efficient delivery of pay \nand retirement benefits, computer matching to catch tax cheats, high \ncapacity telecommunication networks and video-conferencing for more \nefficient work across the Nation and even the globe. These innovations \nare already a part of Government. They also suggest some of the \nopportunities still to come for improving Government operations.\n  Unfortunately, as oversight by our committee and others has shown, \nthe Government is not realizing the full potential of this \ntechnological revolution. The Federal Government is simply wasting \nmillions and millions of dollars on poorly designed and often \nincompatible systems. This must stop.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 took a first step on the road to \nreform when it created information resources management [IRM] policies \nto be overseen by OMB. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 strengthens \nthat mandate and establishes new requirements for agency IRM \nimprovements. These requirements focus on agency responsibility for IRM \nimprovement, including results-oriented performance standards. These \nstrengthened requirements add needed detail to the larger IRM \nframework, with its essential oversight role for OMB, to ensure that we \nhave both management results and accountability. The legislation \nbalances process controls with program and management responsibility to \nprovide IRM improvements without stifling micromanagement.\n  In serving these twin, closely related statutory purposes of \npaperwork reduction and information resources management, the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995 includes several notable accomplishments.\n  We reauthorize the act for 6 years. While the House proposed a \npermanent authorization, the conference agreement contains a definite \nreauthorization period. While the difficulties in reauthorizing the act \nbetween 1983 and 1986, and again from 1989 to the present, may suggest \nto some that the act ought to be permanently reauthorized, I draw a \nvery different conclusion. It is precisely because the act is so \nimportant, because it concentrates significant power in OMB--which is \nthe President's enforcer, if there ever was one--and because there has \nbeen so much controversy about OMB's actions under the act--and its \nrelated regulatory review powers--that every effort must be made to \nprovide and sustain serious congressional oversight.\n  Without a periodic reauthorization schedule, I am afraid that our \noversight would suffer. With the requirement for reauthorization, we \nare required to scrutinize the act and its implementation, and \npersevere in resolving differences and arriving at any needed statutory \nreforms. The reforms found in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 are \nthe product of this reauthorization process and proof of its \nimportance.\n  We strengthen the paperwork clearance process in several ways. The \nmost important reform is the establishment of new detailed requirements \nfor agencies to evaluate paperwork proposals and solicit public comment \non them before the proposals go to OMB for review. These new \nrequirements will, first of all, ensure the more thoughtful development \nof only truly ``necessary'' agency information collection proposals. \nJust as importantly, these requirements will also help agencies more \nclearly and\n thoroughly make their case for such proposals, and thus prepare for a \nfair hearing before OMB on what is or is not ``necessary for the proper \nperformance of the agency's functions,'' as the law puts it. Together, \nI believe, these expanded agency requirements provide the greatest \nopportunity for progress in the war against red tape.\n\n  We also strengthen the paperwork process by overturning the Dole \nversus United Steelworkers Supreme Court decision regarding OSHA's \nhazard communication standard, so that information disclosure \nrequirements are covered by the OMB paperwork clearance process. This \nends a controversy of several years and clarifies that the act covers \nall paperwork requirements, not just information that is collected for \nan agency's own use.\n  In other respects, the act's OMB paperwork clearance standards remain \nunchanged. In fact, the decision to overturn the Supreme Court ``Haz \nComm'' decision is only appropriate given the continuing integrity of \nthe procedure for OMB review of information collections required by \nregulation. As provided under the original 1980 act, after commenting \non regulatory paperwork requirements in a proposed rule, OMB may \ndisapprove a final rule paperwork requirement only if it finds that the \nagency's response to its comments are ``unreasonable.'' As Senator \nKennedy said at the time, ``[Without this provision,] this legislation \nwould permit OMB to overturn * * * [an agency rulemaking] decision \nwithout even requiring OMB to justify its decision publicly. This \nviolates basic notices of fairness upon which the Administrative \nProcedure Act is based, as well as concepts of due process embodied in \nthe U.S. Constitution.'' (S30178, November 19, 1980). With this \nlegislative history so clear, I am very pleased that the House receded \nto the Senate on this point in the current legislation--our committee \nand the Senate having already clearly decided to maintain unchanged the \npaperwork clearance standards of the act.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 also provides needed detail to \nthe act's general provisions on information dissemination. OMB policy \nguidance responsibilities are delineated, as are the operational \nresponsibilities of individual Federal agencies. The primary \n[[Page S5277]] theme running through these provisions is the obligation \nof Federal agencies to conduct their dissemination activities in such a \nway as to ensure that the public has timely and equitable access to \npublic information. A major element of this obligation is the mandate \nto make information available on a nondiscriminatory and nonexclusive \nbasis so as to avoid disadvantaging any class of information users. \nPublic information is public. It should not become a source of revenue \nfor agencies or a means by which to exercise proprietary-like controls \non information.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the development of a Government \nInformation Locator Service [GILS] to ensure improved public access to \ngovernment information, especially that maintained in electronic \nformat, and makes other improvements in the areas of government \nstatistics, records management, computer security, and the management \nof information technology.\n  These are important reforms. Of course, reaching broad bipartisan \nagreement on this legislation has involved considerable compromise. \nThere has been give and take on both sides. The result, like most \ncompromises, has displeased some. I believe, however, that the \nlegislation represents a practical compromise that addresses many real \nissues and moves the Government forward toward the reduction of \npaperwork burdens on the public and improvements in the management of \nFederal information resources. It should be supported for its very \nsignificant provisions.\n  Even with this accomplishment, it should be clearly understood that \nthe legislative compromise does not resolve conflicting views on the \nOMB paperwork and regulatory review\n controversies that have dogged congressional oversight of the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. As I said in my additional views in our \ncommittee report:\n\n       Support for the original act and for the current \n     legislation should not . . . lead anyone to overlook the \n     problems that have frustrated full implementation of the law. \n     Fifteen years of Committee oversight have produced a record \n     replete with criticisms, largely directed at OMB, for \n     unbalanced implementation of the Act. Slighting statistics, \n     records management, information technology management, \n     privacy and security, and other aspects of information \n     resources management, OMB devoted itself to a paperwork \n     clearance and regulatory review process that occasioned \n     repeated charges of interference with substantive agency \n     decision-making. I believe that this record should not be \n     obscured . . .'' (S. Report No. 104-8, p. 59):\n\n  This record should remind us of our continuing obligation to oversee \nthe act, at the same time that we move forward with the current \nlegislation to better fulfill its very important purposes.\n  In conclusion, the legislation before us strengthens the Paperwork \nReduction Act. It also remains true to the intent of the original 1980 \nact. Both the administration and the General Accounting Office concur \nin this judgment and support the legislation. I am very proud of our \naccomplishment in bringing this legislation to final passage of the \nconference report. This has been a cooperative bipartisan effort. We \ncould not be here without the hard work of Senator Nunn and Senator \nRoth, who is now chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I \nwould also single out Senator Bingaman, my good friend from New Mexico, \nwho, when he was on our committee, initiated the reauthorization effort \nin 1989. And, of course, as always, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan has \nplayed an important role, working to ensure that our committee's \nconsideration of the legislation helped the fight both against \npaperwork and for Government efficiency.\n  This really has been a long-haul effort. And through those years, a \nsmall group of staff have labored long and hard, again and again \nworking over drafts and coming up with legislative language to help us \nreach the point we are at today. I want to thank Frank Polk of Senator \nRoth's staff, Bill Montalto with Senator Nunn, and Len Weiss and David \nPlocher of my staff. We could not be here today without their work. \nFinally, I want to thank Jeff Hill and Bruce McConnell of OMB's Office \nof Information and Regulatory Affairs, and Dan Latta and Chris Hoenig \nof GAO's Accounting and Information Management Division. Their \ntechnical assistance throughout the legislative process was essential, \nand they deserve our thanks for their help.\n  We are now one short step from final enactment of the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995. I strongly urge my colleagues to join in \nsupporting this very important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, over the last several weeks, \nthe Senate freshmen have taken time on various occasions to come to the \nfloor to talk about the agenda that we believe was prescribed during \nthe last election, the agenda that the 11 of us, as new Republican \nSenators, would like to see pursued in the Senate.\n  Our plan was to talk in morning business about that this morning. As \nyou know, the order has been changed, and we respect that. But until \nsuch time as the majority leader and the minority leader are able to \npull up the bill, we would like to proceed to talk about some of the \nthings that we think are most important.\n  We call this the freshman focus, and we think we do bring to this \nbody something of a unique point of view in that each of us, of course, \njust came off an election, each of us campaigned for a very long time \nin our States, each of us talked to many people, and each of us \nbelieves that there was a message in the election and that the \nresponsibility of responsive Government is to respond to that election \nand to the voice of the voters as we see it.\n  So, Mr. President, we, I think, have going on here a great debate. It \nmay not take the form of great debate in terms of its physical \napproach, but the great debate is between the way we see things \nhappening, the way we see ourselves as a society and as a country \nentering into the new millennium, entering into the year 2000 in a \nrelatively short 5 or 6 years and what shape we see ourselves in as a \nnation going into that new millennium.\n  The great debate is whether or not we want to go into that new \ncentury continuing as we are financially, continuing as we are with the \nhuge debt that we have, continuing as we are with deficits of $250 \nbillion in that foreseeable future or, in fact, whether we want to seek \nto make some changes so that we go into that millennium, so that we go \ninto that new century, with a nation that is financially and fiscally \nresponsible, and now is the time we have to do that.\n  That is the great debate, the great debate that has been going on in \nthe House, the great debate that is going on here, the great debate \nthat will take place over the next year in terms of the budget. \nBasically, the debate is overspending.\n  We all have charts. Unfortunately, I am not armed with a chart this \nmorning. The chart would show, however, that spending has gone up in \nthis kind of fashion, spending has gone up in the neighborhood of 5 \npercent a year for many years and is designed to continue to go up at 5 \npercent a year for the foreseeable future. The President's budget this \nyear has a 5.5-percent increase in spending.\n  So we talk a lot about the deficit, the deficit which is a result, of \ncourse, of the difference between revenues and outlays, but really is \nthe result of spending. If there was a message that I think was \nuniversally discernible in November, it was that Government is too big \nand that Government spends too much. Most people agree with that.\n  If we are to have a reasonable debate, there needs to be a couple of \nthings agreed to, a couple of things have to be stipulated. One struck \nme some time back in our church in Cheyenne that we attend, and the \nmessage that the pastor had was that every day each of us has a \nresponsibility to make this a better place to live.\n  Whether a person is a Senator, whether a person is a carpenter, \nwhether a person is a rancher, we each, where we are, have a \nresponsibility to make this a better place to live.\n  We do it in our own ways. We each have something different to \ncontribute. \n[[Page S5278]] But, Mr. President, we have, in addition to the \ncitizenship responsibility, we have the responsibility of being \ntrustees for this country, being trustees for the spending \nresponsibilities of the United States--an awesome responsibility it \nseems to me, one that goes far beyond simply spending, goes far beyond \narithmetic, goes far beyond accounting. It goes into the character of a \nnation.\n  Whether or not we are able to pay for the things we want, whether we \nare willing to have a cost-benefit ratio and decide for ourselves if it \nis worth paying for, we pay for it. It is irresponsible to continue to \nput it on the credit card for our kids. Our credit card is maxed out.\n  Within the next month or 2 months, we will be asked to raise the debt \nlimit-- $5 trillion. Talk about charts that impressed me a little some \ntime ago, in 1970, the budget of this country was about $204 billion, \nin that category. Twenty-five years later, the interest payment on the \ndebt is more than the entire cost of the Federal Government in 1970--\nnot very long ago.\n  So the question in the great debate is how do we go into the 21st \ncentury? How do we go into the new millennium? That is what the \nfreshmen are focusing on.\n  There is a great deal more to the debate on this question today of \nrescissions, this question today of whether we can find $15 billion to \ntake out of spending, $15 billion that will not go on the debt. There \nis more to it than just this spending issue. It has a good deal to do \nwith national character.\n  So that is what it is about. That is what the freshmen are seeking to \ndo. Unfortunately, the opposition, rather than taking a look at where \nare we, where do we need to go, what changes do we have to make, what \nchanges did voters ask for, are saying, ``Oh, no, we cannot change. We \nwant to continue with the programs we have had. We want to continue \nwith the war on poverty''--which has failed. The war on poverty was \nstarted 30 years ago, and there are more people in poverty now than \nthere were then.\n  We have the greatest opportunity now than we have had for a very long \ntime, a great opportunity to take a look at where we are going. I \nsuggested there needs to be a stipulation in this great debate, and \nthat stipulation also has to be not only do we have a responsibility to \nmake it a better place to live, but also that people who want to make \nchanges have as much compassion and as much caring as do those who do \nnot. The idea that people wanting to make a change and wanting to take \na look at where we are going signifies that we want to throw everyone \nout on the street and there is no caring and that it is simply a \nmathematical thing is absolutely wrong. I am beginning to hear it. I \nhear it almost hourly from the opposition--the reason for not making a \nchange is because it is not compassionate.\n  Let me suggest if we want to take a look at the long range, we want \nto take a look at your kids, my kids and our grandkids, we need to have \na little compassion about that. We need to have a little compassion \nabout what kind of a financial position and responsibility for our \nGovernment will we have in the year 2000 unless we make some changes.\n  Of course they are difficult. Of course they are difficult changes. \nWe must make them. Americans voted for change in 1994.\n  We have the greatest opportunity we have had for a very long time to \ntake a look at programs and say are they fulfilling the objective? Is \nthat the best way to deliver services to people who need them? To take \na look at welfare and say, the purpose of welfare is to help people who \nneed help and to help them back into the workplace. A hand up, not a \nhandout.\n  That is what we ought to be looking for, and to measure those \nprograms and see if, indeed, they are successful, or is there a better \nway to do it. Do we need 165 programs designed to go from school to \nwork? Of course not. We need to put them together and look at duplicity \nand look at repetition and see if there is a more efficient way to do \nit. That is what this debate is about.\n  Frankly, we are having a hard time keeping that debate in the arena \nof finding better ways to help people help themselves. That is what it \nis for.\n  Mr. President, I hope as we go through it, there will be a \nstipulation that we are setting out to find a better way, a better way \nto help people who need help; a better way to provide incentives for \neveryone to work and take care of themselves; a better way for the \nbusiness sector to invest, to create jobs, so that we can help \nourselves; a better way to eliminate bureaucracy and duplicity so that \nwe can deliver services.\n  That is what it is about. That is the responsibility that we have.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I want to yield to my good friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, who certainly is one of the leaders in this effort \nto find better ways so that we have a society of self-improvement \nrather than dependence.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to commend the Senator from Wyoming for his \ncontinued effort to bring the freshmen here to the floor on a regular \nbasis to talk about where this Senate is going and how we are living up \nhere in the Senate to what the country said on November 8, and what the \nHouse is obviously very successfully doing in living up to their \npromises to the folks that they made when they ran for office back last \nyear.\n  The first thing I want to do is congratulate the House, having voted, \npretty strong showing last night, for a tax reform bill and a tax cut \nbill--both a tax cut bill and a tax reform bill. It is a progrowth \nbill, a bill that is going to create more jobs, it will help families, \neliminate the marriage tax penalty that has existed--which is a \ntremendous break--an encouragement for people to marry, an \nencouragement to supporting families.\n  It is a bill that says to seniors that we believe seniors have value \nand worth, that seniors can, in fact, work past the age of 65 and earn \na modest amount of money--$20,000, $15,000--and not lose your Social \nSecurity benefits, if you are age 65 to 70.\n  We think that that is important. It is an important sign to seniors \nthat we understand that they have value to give to the communities and \nto give it their businesses, and that we do not want to discourage \nseniors out of the work force and penalize them at a rate of over 50 \npercent in taxation if they make over $9,600 a year as a senior. We \nthink that that is a very positive thing that occurred in that tax bill \nlast night.\n  The adoption tax credit provision which encourages adoption, we \nbelieve, is also a very, very positive profamily kind of tax change. \nAnd the list goes on.\n  I want to commend them for the great work that they did in paying for \nthe program. It is not a tax cut that will increase the deficit. They \noffset it, more than offset it, with spending reductions in order to \npay for the tax reductions.\n  That is the kind of decision that we will have to be making, whether \nit is, in fact, better to have a person keep their money or is it \nbetter to have a person send their money here and for Washington to \nfigure how best to spend it, and of course take the cut for bureaucracy \nand write rules and regulations that make no sense, then send it back. \nThat is the difference.\n  I think it is a pretty easy call for most Americans. I am not \nsurprised that it passed over in the House, and I will not be surprised \nwhen it passes over here in the Senate.\n  On a larger scale, I want to congratulate the House for the great \nwork that they have done. In 91 or 92 days they passed nine major \npieces of legislation, nine major bills. The amount of work that they \ndid in working--and I know a lot of folks around do not believe that \nMembers of Congress and the Senate work very hard. I will say if we \nlook at what the House of Representatives has done in this first 90 \ndays, and the amount of hours they put in legislation in committees and \nin working groups and putting this stuff together to pass this kind of \nmassive change that they promised, I think a person might think \n[[Page S5279]] again as to whether Members of Congress do in fact earn \ntheir keep.\n  Let me suggest that the most important thing--I ask this question all \nthe time--the most important thing that came out of the House of \nRepresentatives was not the tax bill, was not the balanced budget \namendment, was not the line-item veto.\n  The most important thing was they kept their promise. They kept their \npromise. They ran and they said, ``If you elect us, we will do 1, 2, 3, \n4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10--we will do these 10 things. We promise you we \nwill bring them up and we will get a vote and we will work our darndest \nto try to make that happen.'' They could not promise passage because \nyou never know. But they promised they would try their best.\n  Do you know what? They introduced bills exactly the way it was \nwritten in the contract. They did not change it. They did not say, \nlook, I am going to cut taxes for middle-income people and then pass a \ntax increase. They did not say they were going to be for a balanced \nbudget amendment and then pass big spending increases. No, they did \nexactly--exactly what they promised the American public. And they \nsucceeded on 90 percent of it.\n  They are batting .900. Ted Williams would be proud--.900; 90 percent \nof what they said they would try to do, they did.\n  The only one they failed on was the constitutional amendment, which \nas most people know takes two-thirds of the body to pass, which is well \nbeyond the number of Republicans that there are in the House of \nRepresentatives. So: The first ever vote on term limits. They failed, \nbut 85 percent of the Republicans supported it. They got a majority of \nthe House to support it. It is building. It is on the track to \neventually pass, probably after the next election. So I think the \ncountry should look at the House of Representatives.\n  One of the big concerns I had when I came to the U.S. House, 4 years \nnow, now here in the Senate, is I think the public has lost trust in \nour institutions. They do not believe that we mean what we say or say \nwhat we mean; we are here and all we care about is getting reelected \nand having some power and being able to throw our weight around. What \nthe public really wants does not really matter. It is just this big \ngame down here.\n  Is it not nice to know that promises can be kept; that people do \nsometimes mean what they say? They made some hard decisions. A lot of \nthis stuff was not easy to do. A lot of it came, as you probably heard \nin the last few weeks, with a lot of criticism raining down on how \nmean-spirited this Contract With America is.\n  I know it is mean to cut off a lot of bureaucrats here in \nWashington--that is mean--and to give that money back to you. That is \nvery mean to the people who are here to protect the bureaucrats. I know \nit is mean to say people who are on welfare have to work at some point. \nThat is terrible. It is terrible that we should require people to work. \nIt is just unbelievable to me that argument was made on programs that \nwere trying to help people. We are trying to give more responsibility \nand freedom and choices back to people, but that is the way things are \nin this town. If we do not keep the power then it is mean, because of \ncourse we are the only ones who actually care about people. You do not \ncare about your neighbor, we do. You do not care about your family, we \ndo. We care about it more than you do.\n  I am sitting right behind the desk of the Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm. I will never forget a statement he made on one of these talk \nshows. Ira Magaziner was on and they were talking about the health care \nplan of Clinton's a couple of years ago and Magaziner was making the \npoint he does care about children, he does care about the young people \nin this country and the folks who are uninsured. He says, ``I care for \nyour children as much as you do.'' That is what he said to Phil Gramm, \nand what Phil Gramm said, I think, was classic. And that is: ``OK, what \nare their names? What are their names?\"\n  You see, we all care. But do we really care about that one person? Do \nwe really understand what their needs are? Not what ``the needs'' are, \nbut ``their needs?'' What ``their concern'' is? See, that is the \nproblem. We cannot deal with ``a concern.'' We deal with ``the \nconcerns.'' The problem is ``the concerns'' sometimes do not beat ``a \nconcern.'' And the closer we get to ``a concern'' and the closer we can \ntailor and allow the people who have the feeling and the relationship \nto deal with that concern, the better our country and the ``gooder'' \nour country is.\n  This line has been used a lot around here and it is so true, the de \nTocqueville line. ``America is great,'' he wrote in Democracy In \nAmerica, ``America is great because America is good.''\n  The people are good, they care about each other. They reach out to \ntheir fellow man. There are volunteer organizations that developed here \nin the 1800's and 1900's that just did not exist anywhere else in the \nworld because Americans cared about each other and felt that \nrelationship and kinship. And he said America is a great country \nbecause it is a good country. ``And when America ceases being good it \nwill cease being great.'' We are ceasing to be good because we have \ndelegated everything to this massive bureaucracy here in Washington to \nbe good for us.\n  You hear the people, as you will over the next few months, get up and \ntalk about: How can you be so mean as to not give money to--this or \nthat. Folks, it is not my money. See, I am taking that money from \nsomebody else who worked darned hard to make it. And who says I know \nbest how to spend their money to help somebody else? That is the basic \npremise of what is going on here.\n  If you want to talk about the revolution that is going on, that is \nthe basic premise. I care as much--I believe more--but I do not \nnecessarily think I am the best person equipped to make those decisions \nfor everybody. We can best make those decisions one-on-one, local \ncommunities and groups, as opposed to here in Washington, DC. That is \nthe fundamental argument.\n  So, when you look at the first 100 days and you see what has happened \nin the U.S. House of Representatives, and I believe what will happen in \nthe U.S. Senate, if you look at what we have accomplished and the hope \nthat we have given to Americans that we in fact can change, that \nAmerica, again, can be good, that America can be great, I think it is \nan inspirational story.\n  We have done something in the House--and I believe the Senate will \nfollow--we have done something that is more important than any one \nparticular thing, and that is, I hope, we have restored the faith that \nthe American public used to have in their institutions. Because if they \ndo not believe in us, if what we say is irrelevant, if they do not \nbelieve in anything we say on the campaign trail, that we are just a \nbunch of folks who say what we need to say to get elected--if they do \nnot have any faith in what we stand for, if they think all we are going \nto do is change our minds when we get down here, then democracy itself \nis in danger.\n  If people do not believe in us anymore, if we do not stand for \nanything anymore, if all we are is symbols of a corrupt institution \nthat does not respond to what the will of the public is, then democracy \nfails. It falls from within.\n  Whether you agree with what the House of Representatives has done, \nwhether you agree 10 percent, or 90 percent, or 100 percent, you have \nto stand back and say ``Well done. You did what you said you were going \nto do. We may not like it but, darn it, you did. And you have to tip \nyour hat to that.''\n  Hopefully here in the Senate, while we did not sign the Contract With \nAmerica, and no one in this institution did, and that is often \nrepeated, we have an obligation to do something. We have an obligation \nto follow through and let the country know that elections do matter; \nthat when the country speaks, we here in Washington, in both the House \nand Senate, listen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield time to the chairman of our \nfreshman group, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n   [[Page S5280]] Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from Wyoming for giving me some time to talk about this.\n  I do not think there is any subject nor any issue in America right \nnow that people are more concerned about than what is happening with \nthe budget and with the deficit.\n  I just had an experience a minute ago with two very dear people, and \nI would like to deviate a little. It fits very well into this. Two of \nthe most beautiful women in America are Yvonne Fedderson and Sara \nO'Meara. They started many years ago an effort to address the problem \nof child abuse. This blue ribbon is in recognition of Child Abuse \nPrevention Month that is taking place right now. Here is a bumper \nsticker. They started many years ago a program outside of Government to \ndo something effectively about the problem of child abuse in America.\n  We saw just yesterday a bill which passed the House of \nRepresentatives that also recognizes that the problems of this country \nare not going to all be addressed by Government. In fact, in many \ncases, Government is the problem.\n  This particular program, which was started by Sara O'Meara and Yvonne \nFedderson many years ago, has a hotline throughout the Nation. Anyone \nwho has an idea about or knowledge of child abuse can call 1-800-4-A-\nCHILD.\n  The reason I bring this up, Mr. President, is because this is a \nnational problem. It seems to me that in the last 40 years the very \nliberal Congress in both Houses has felt that you had to respond to \nthese problems by starting some new Government program. I suggest to \nyou that most of the programs which address the problems in the Nation \ntoday are not Government programs, they are programs in the private \nsector. This program is a perfect example. They have in every State and \nevery contiguous State--and perhaps the others too--a program where \npeople can call a hotline and do something about one of the most \nserious problems in America, which is child abuse.\n  The Government has a number of programs. But I suggest to you when \nyou look at the effectiveness of these programs it is far more \neffective to have one that is run by the private sector, that is \nstaffed by volunteers, than having one that is a Government program. \nOur problem is we have become accustomed to assuming that the problems \ncan be addressed by the Federal Government better than by the private \nsector.\n  In the bill that was passed yesterday in the House of \nRepresentatives, there is a tax incentive for families to take care of \ntheir own children as opposed to Government taking care of them. There \nis a tax incentive--not many people are aware of this--of $500 for \npeople to take care of the elderly. This is something that many people \ndid not know was in that bill, which just passed yesterday. The idea is \nfamilies in this country can take on a lot of responsibilities that \nGovernment has learned to assume.\n  I read something with interest the other day. It is an article by \nThomas Sowell. Thomas Sowell is an editorial writer. The name of his \narticle is ``A Dishonest Slogan.'' This ``Dishonest Slogan'' is the one \nthat is called trickle down. It seems as if the liberals feel that with \nGovernment, higher taxes are the answer to our problems--and this was \nsaid, by the way, on this Senate floor by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd--that we need higher taxes in America. \nThen when they talk about the fact that they are giving tax reductions, \nthey try to use slogans like ``trickle down.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at this point in the \nRecord, this article by Thomas Sowell be printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           A Dishonest Slogan\n\n                           (By Thomas Sowell)\n\n       If there were a prize for the most dishonest phrase in \n     politics, the competition would be fierce and the outcome \n     very uncertain. However, my nomination would be the phrase \n     ``trickle-down economics.''\n       The trickle-down theory is supposedly the notion that the \n     way to benefit the poor is to have the government provide \n     benefits to the rich, which will then trickle down to the \n     poor. But there is simply no such theory--not in Adam Smith, \n     not in John Maynard Keynes, not in Milton Friedman. Not in \n     anybody.\n       My specialty within economics is the history of economics \n     theories--but there is no history of any such theory.\n       Still, no political campaign is complete without liberals \n     accusing conservatives of applying trickle-down theories to \n     benefit the rich, instead of having the government give \n     benefits directly to the poor. With Republicans likely to \n     raise the issue of reducing the capital gains tax in the next \n     Congress, Democrats will no doubt cry that this is a ``tax \n     break for the rich'' based on ``trickle-down economics.''\n       Let's go back to square one. There is no investment income \n     to tax until after an investment has been made and people \n     hired--and after it all works out successfully, which is by \n     no means guaranteed. In short, the benefits to investors come \n     after the benefits to those they employ, not before.\n       When investments finally pay off, perhaps years later, it \n     would make no sense to call the eventual profit simply income \n     for the year in which it is received. That is why capital \n     gains are taxed differently from ordinary income.\n       Often there is no real capital gain at all, except on \n     paper. If you bought an asset back when the price level was \n     half of what it is today, and you sold the property for twice \n     what you paid for it, then you have just kept up with \n     inflation. If you sell it for 50% more than you paid for it, \n     you have actually lost part of the real value.\n       Even when your capital ``gain'' does not keep up with \n     inflation, the government still taxes you on it. Moreover, \n     these kinds of ``gains'' go into the statistics supposedly \n     showing that ``the rich are getting richer and the poor are \n     getting poorer.''\n       Despite tilting against the windmills of a nonexistent \n     trickle-down theory, the last thing the liberals want to do \n     is to give benefits directly to the poor. They may not have a \n     trickle-down theory, but in practice they make sure that any \n     benefits to the poor trickle down through layers of \n     bureaucracy and are siphoned off to pay the salaries, \n     consulting fees and research grants of all sorts of \n     ``experts'' with degrees.\n       That is why studies have shown that every man, woman and \n     child in America could be raised above the official poverty \n     level by direct transfers of money, at less than half the \n     cost of all the government's antipoverty programs. Lots of \n     people who are not poor by any stretch of the imagination \n     have to be taken care of out of antipoverty money.\n       Proposals to replace public housing programs, \n     ``retraining'' programs and other social experiments with \n     hard cash given directly to the poor have repeatedly run into \n     a buzz saw of opposition from liberals. They don't mind more \n     money being given to the poor--or to anybody else--but not at \n     the expense of programs that employ bureaucrats and \n     ``experts.''\n       These anomalies are not accidental. The welfare state is \n     ultimately not about getting more money into the hands of the \n     poor but about getting more power into the hands of \n     government. In program after program, the poor are to benefit \n     only insofar as they allow themselves to be directed and \n     manipulated by their self-anointed saviors.\n       When people get private sector jobs instead of government \n     handouts, the situation is completely different. Capital \n     gains tax reforms are needed simply to stop the government \n     from discouraging the investment that provides employment.\n       It is nonsense to call this ``trickling down'' because the \n     investment has to happen first, and workers have to be hired \n     first and paid first, before the investor has any hope of \n     reaping any gains. Since capital gains come last, not first, \n     they do not ``trickle down.''\n       Obviously, the higher the capital gains tax rate, the less \n     the incentive to invest and hire. If you want more Americans \n     employed, you don't punish people for employing them. \n     Otherwise, the investors have every incentive to invest their \n     money in some other country that doesn't have such high \n     capital gains taxes--or doesn't have capital gains taxes at \n     all.\n       But the liberals are so politically dependent on class \n     warfare, and on their own role as saviors of the poor, that \n     they are very slow to admit that there wouldn't be so many \n     poor for them to save if there were more jobs created by the \n     economy. On the other hand, if they are not playing the role \n     of saviors of the poor, how are they to get re-elected?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the idea is that nobody benefits from a \ncapital gains tax or some of these tax reductions until they have \nactually provided a stimulus to the economy. For example, if you have a \ncapital gains tax, the individual who will eventually benefit from that \ntax cannot benefit until he has already started a company, already \ninvested his money, already met a payroll, and already hired people. \nWhat the liberals in Congress refuse to recognize is that for each 1 \npercent increase in economic activity in America, it produces an \nadditional $24 billion of new revenue.\n  I am so sick and tired of sitting on the floor here listening to the \nliberal Members of Congress talk about how it did not work in the \n1980's, how we tried tax reductions in the 1980's and look what \nhappened to the deficit. Well, the deficit went up during that decade, \nbut \n[[Page S5281]] it did not go up because we had tax reductions. It went \nup because the Members of the House and the Senate have an insatiable \nappetite to spend money that is not theirs and are borrowing it from \nfuture generations.\n  I will give you an example. Back in 1980, the total revenues that \nwere derived from the marginal tax rates in America were $244 billion. \nThen, in 1990, the total revenues that were derived from the marginal \ntax rates in America were $466 billion. What happened during that 10-\nyear period? During that 10-year period, we had the greatest tax \nreductions in this Nation's history. Remember, the highest rate went \ndown from 70 percent to 28 percent. We had capital gains tax \nreductions. We had reductions all the way down so that people knew they \ncould keep more of the money that they made. This stimulated people to \ninvest in equipment, in company, in employment, and it did, to borrow a \nphrase that is often abused by our President, it did ``grow America.'' \nSo we almost doubled the revenue during that 10-year period when we had \nthe largest tax reduction.\n  I would like to mention one of the things that I told the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Thomas, that I would make a reference to; that \nis, the moral issue that we are dealing with right now. I gave a talk \nnot long ago where I had the pictures of two beautiful children on an \neasel behind me. Those two beautiful children I identified in the first \nhour as being my two grandchildren, Glade and Maggie. Each of them will \nbe celebrating their second birthday this month. They are beautiful \nlittle children.\n  When people talk about the programs they say are going to be cut when \nwe have passed a balanced budget amendment--and we will try to reach a \nbalanced budget--and they try to pull on the heartstrings of America \nand say that all these great, wonderful Government social programs are \ngoing to be cut, they neglect to tell you who is really going to be \npunished by these programs, who is really going to be punished if we do \nnot do something to bring the budget into balance, which we are going \nto do. And I do not want to sound partisan here, but by Republicans \ntaking over the House and the Senate, you are going to see some cuts. \nYou are going to see come growth caps. But you will see our budget come \nback into balance, and we are targeting right now the year 2002.\n  Let us look at what is going to happen if we do not do this in \nAmerica. According to the CBO and all the other analysts, where are we \nin America today if we do not have some type of a change in the program \nthat we have had? They have said that, if we continue to go on as we \nhave gone in the past, if we do not pass a balanced budget amendment, \nif we do not bring it into balance, that a person who is born today, \nduring his or her lifetime, will have to pay 82 percent of his or her \nlifetime income for taxes to support the Government programs. Stop and \nthink about that.\n  The other day, we had an interesting visitor. We had a number of \nvisitors from all over the world. This was during the National Prayer \nBreakfast. We had people from all over the world there. I was in charge \nof a group of the national visitors from the Ukraine, from Eastern \nEurope and some of that area. One man was here from Moldavia. He asked \nme a very interesting question. He said, ``Senator Inhofe, here in the \nUnited States, how much can you keep?''\n  I said, ``Pardon me? I do not understand what you are saying.''\n  He said, ``Well, when you earn something, how much do you have to \ngive the Government?''\n  I said, ``Well, that is a real interesting question.'' I kind of \nestablished a guess because there is not really a very simple answer to \nthat question when you stop and think about what the Government really \nabsorbs.\n  But he said, ``We are celebrating in Moldavia. We are so thrilled \nthat finally, after all these years of communism, we now have a free \neconomy. We now have a free society. We now can own property. We now \ncan buy businesses and we can work hard and pass on to future \ngenerations that which we reap.''\n  I said, ``In your country, how much do you have to give the \nGovernment?''\n He said, very proudly, ``We get to keep 20 percent.'' I said, ``How \ndoes that work?'' He said, ``Well, when you earn money, if you earn a \ndollar, you have to give 80 cents of that dollar to the Government.'' \nThey do not wait until year end, Mr. President. This is something that \nis ongoing. And then we looked around at each other and thought, here \nare these people, seeking their freedom, so excited about this, they \nare all through with communism, and they can benefit and they can \nenrich themselves and future generations and how happy they were, and \nyet they have to give to Government 80 percent of what they have.\n\n  Mr. President, that brings it really to the surface of where we are \ntoday. If we do not do something to change this path, we will be behind \nMoldavia. It will cost our future generations 82 cents on the dollar.\n  So I would like to think that this is not a fiscal issue. It is a \nmoral issue. We are going to see in the next few weeks the Republicans \ncoming out in the House and the Senate with a program, with a budget, a \nproposed budget that would eliminate the deficit by the year 2002. I \ndisagree with the way we are doing it. I hate to be the one who \ndisagrees with my own party. I have talked to different people who are \non the Budget Committee, and I say I think we are making a mistake when \nwe come out with a budget and say exactly where we are going to cut \nprograms, where we are going to expand programs. Why not do what we \nknow would work? Let us put spending caps on. If we initiate a \nresolution that says we are not going to let any Government program \nincrease more than 2 percent, we would not touch one program, not have \na reduction in one program, not have elimination of one program, and we \nwould be able to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  That is because--and most people do not realize it and you are not \ngoing to hear it said by a lot of the liberals here in Congress--our \nproblem is not where to cut programs but how to stop the accelerated \ngrowth. And when you hear people like the President standing up and \nsaying proudly, ``We are cutting the deficit,'' that is garbage.\n  There is an article everyone should read. It was in the Reader's \nDigest last year. It was called ``Budget Baloney.'' And in it they \ndescribed how Members of Congress say they are cutting the deficit. \nThey described it this way: They say let us say you have $5,000 but you \nwant to buy a $10,000 car. All you have to say is I really want a \n$15,000 car, but I will settle for a $10,000 car and I have cut the \ndeficit by $5,000.\n  That is the way they do things around here.\n  Let me suggest to you that there is going to be a come-home-to-roost \ntime. There is going to be a time when these individuals who have \nhabitually voted for expanded Government into our lives and are not a \npart of the revolution of November 8 are going to have to come back and \ntake the consequences.\n  I would like to show you just two charts that we put together back \nwhen we were debating the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  This chart shows the characterization of those Members of the Senate \nwho were voting for an amendment called the Right To Know Act. Now, \nwhat this was was an amendment to the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, and it said show us exactly where you are going to cut \nevery program. Obviously, you cannot do that 7 years in the future. But \nwe analyzed the voting behavior of the 41 Senate cosponsors of this \nbill. We find that every one of them voted yes on the $16 billion \nPresident Clinton tax stimulus program which was the largest increase \nin spending that we have had in one bill, I believe, in the history of \nthe Congress; that every one of the 41 who had signed on as cosponsors \nto this amendment was ranked by the National Taxpayers Union as either \na D or an F. In other words, the people who were behind this were the \npeople who were the big spenders in Congress.\n  Then the most revealing chart is the one that shows what is going to \nhappen to a lot of these people by showing what did happen to them in \nthe revolution of November 8.\n  On November 8, there were either defeated or retired in the Senate \neight Senators. Of the eight Senators, all eight voted for the spending \nincrease. This was the spending increase that put all kinds of \nsubsidized programs in \n[[Page S5282]] there, supposedly to stimulate the economy. All of them \nvoted for the tax increase. The tax increase was the 1993 tax increase \nthat President Clinton had. It was characterized as the largest single \ntax increase in the history of public finance in America or any place \nin the world, and those are not the words of conservative Republican \nJim Inhofe. Those are the words of Patrick Moynihan, who at that time \nwas chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Further down here they all had either D or F ratings by the National \nTaxpayers Union. In other words, they were the big spenders, and those \nare the ones who were defeated. They are not here. Look around. They \nare not here.\n  In the House of Representatives, 66 of them went out. Almost all of \nthe 66 voted yes on the stimulus bill, voted yes on the tax increase, \nand had a D or F rating by the National Taxpayers Union.\n  So I just suggest to you, Mr. President, that we make it abundantly \nclear to the liberals in Congress, the few liberals who are left, \nbecause most of them were wiped out in the November 8 revolution, there \nis going to be another wave coming up in 1996, and this is the \nopportunity for us to be fiscally responsible, for us to be able to \nstand up and say no to some of these useless programs that have \noutlived their usefulness and say yes to future generations, including \nmy two grandchildren, Glade and Maggie Inhofe. This is what is going to \nwork for America, and this is probably the centerfold of the revolution \nof November 8.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Subcommittee on \nAntitrust, Business Rights and Competition of the Committee on the \nJudiciary voted out S.627, the Hatch-Thurmond-Leahy bill clarifying the \napplication of our antitrust laws to major league baseball.\n  What we did was to remove the antitrust exemption given to major \nleague baseball. I hope that the full Judiciary Committee, the Senate \nand the other body will take this up and pass it relatively soon.\n  Baseball has for decades had a special exemption from the antitrust \nlaws, which laws apply to everything else, every other business in this \ncountry and every other professional sport. What this means is that \nbaseball and those who own it and run it are basically above the law.\n  Now they have shown what this means. They have shown great disdain \nfor the fans, for those who do not make the $1 million salaries, like \nthe people who park the cars, that sell peanuts and beer and hot dogs \nand soda at the various stadiums, for the communities that have taxed \ntheir people through bond issues to build stadiums, for those who make \nthe pennants and the T-shirts and the baseball caps, and even, in the \nState of Vermont, those who make the souvenir bats given out on bat \nday. Such people have been out of jobs over the past year because of \nthe baseball strike.\n  And throughout all of this, people, some acting in extremely high-\nhanded fashion, are able to say, ``Well, the fans be damned. Because we \nhave this exemption from antitrust, we can act together. We can do \nwhatever we want.''\n  The antitrust exemption was provided for baseball on the assumption \nthat those who control baseball would act in the best interest of the \ngame and the best interest of the fans, would do it responsibly and \nthat we would have a strong commissioner. The practical matter is they \nhave done none of this in the last few years.\n  I recall testimony in a hearing that Senator Thurmond and I had in \nwhich the question was asked: Let us assume baseball did not have an \nexemption from the antitrust laws and let us assume we saw the \nsituation, the sorry situation, we have seen for nearly a year in \nbaseball. If the owners came in and said, ``Oh, by the way, Congress, \ngive us something you have not given any other business. Give us an \nexemption from the antitrust laws.'' Would they not be laughed off \nCapitol Hill? Of course, they would.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike, both in the Senate and the House, \nwould say, ``We are not going to give you that. We are not going to \ngive you this special exemption from the antitrust laws that we don't \ngive to football or basketball or General Motors or Dow Chemical or \nMonsanto or Apple Computers or anybody else. We are not going to give \nit to you. And especially we are not going to give it to you because of \nthe way you have been acting.''\n  We would not pass a statutory exemption, and I daresay, Mr. \nPresident, there would not be one Member of the U.S. Senate that would \nvote to give them an antitrust exemption today, yet they have it.\n  So, I hope, by the same token, everyone in the Senate will join with \nSenator Thurmond, Senator Hatch, and myself--an interesting coalition, \nif ever there was one--and would withdraw the antitrust exemption. It \nis not deserved by baseball. It should not be continued for baseball. \nThey should be treated as anybody else.\n  Their behavior in the past year has shown why they should not have \nthat special exemption, if they ever really deserved it. But whether \nthey have deserved it or not, they have now lost it. We should take it \naway.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that this legislation will work its way \nthrough the committee process fairly quickly, come to the floor of the \nSenate, and be voted upon.\n  I have watched some of the activities of the baseball teams, I mean \nthings that are so petty, so petty. For example, the way they treat \nLittle League teams.\n  When I was a youngster and when my children were, the idea was, if \nyou had a Little League team, you built up some following for various \nteams. You proudly wore the logos of a team--the Red Sox, the Yankees, \nwhoever else it might be.\n  Now they say: ``Well, we will require each one of those children to \npay us $6 for the privilege of having their logo on their uniform.'' \nThis is just penny-ante baloney.\n  What it does, it says, ``We expect you to be fans supporting us, but, \nkid, you're going to pay for it.''\n  I recall as a child being at Fenway Park and seeing some of the \ngreats of baseball come by. If you held out a baseball, they would \nautograph it for you. And they were paid a tiny fraction of what is \npaid to these multimillionaires today who tell you, ``Yes, you can come \nin and for x number of dollars we may give you the autograph.'' This is \nspoiling the whole idea of baseball.\n  So, as I said, Mr. President, we ought to lift their antitrust \nexemption. They do not deserve it. They never really earned it in the \nfirst place, and they have done nothing to keep it today. Let us get \nrid of it. Let us treat them as the business they have become and let \nus stand up for the fans for a change.\n  I have seen a situation in the hearings where even the acting \ncommissioner of baseball in his testimony tried to mislead the Senate; \ngave conflicting testimony, gave testimony that turned out not to be \ntrue; and did not move to correct his testimony. This is the kind of \ndisdain that they show for the Congress.\n  Well, then let us not give them the exemption to the laws. You can \nhave disdain for the laws, you can have disdain for the game, you can \nhave disdain for your own responsibilities, you can have disdain for \nyour own fans, but we are not going to give you a special \n[[Page S5283]] exemption under the law to carry out that disdain.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5282-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5283-S5286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BUDGET BALANCING IS A THREE-STEP PROCESS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to comment on two things, one which \nhas just occurred and one which is about to occur, I hope. We know that \nlast night the House of Representatives passed historic tax relief for \nthe American people. I want to address that for a moment.\n  Second, we know there have been discussions between the majority and \nminority leader on an attempt to reach an agreement on a rescissions \npackage which we could conclude before the Easter recess.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives adopted a rescissions \npackage of about $17 billion and the Senate has been working on a \npackage somewhat less than that. It is our hope between the majority \nand minority we can come to an agreement on a package which would \nrepresent our effort to meet the House, if not precisely their figure, \nat least something close to it so that as the House and Senate take the \nrecess during the Eastertime, our constituents back home would know \nthat both the House and Senate were serious about saving money.\n  Mr. President, during the last campaign, as I was running for this \noffice, people asked me what it would take to balance the budget? I \nsaid it is a three-step process.\n  The first thing we can do is immediately try to save some of the \nmoney that the Congress has already appropriated. We know that every \nyear there is money appropriated that really cannot be spent very \neffectively. If we could make a head start on balancing the budget by \njust saving some of that money for next year, it would demonstrate our \ncommitment to a long-term goal of balancing the budget.\n  That is what the rescission package is about. I will come back to \nthat in a moment. The second step, of course, is the decisions that we \nmake throughout the year for that year's budget. The third step, of \ncourse, is the long-term balancing of the budget process which I have \ncontended can only be done effectively through the adoption of the \nbalanced budget amendment, because without the discipline of the \nconstitutional requirement to balance the budget I have always felt it \ndoubtful Congress would actually develop the willpower and the \ncommitment to see that difficult project through.\n  Those are really the three steps that I articulate.\n  In the second step, what I had said was each month throughout the \nlegislative year we deal with legislation that spends money. We can \nmake the conscious decision not to spend as much, to limit Federal \nspending. When it comes time to appropriate the funds, we can set \npriorities and we can end passing appropriations bills that limit the \ngrowth in Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, we have heard the figures that if we adopt a tax \nrelief plan for the American people we can still balance the Federal \nbudget by the year 2002 if we limit growth in Federal spending to 2 \npercent a year. We are not talking about draconian cuts, but talking \nabout limiting the growth in spending.\n  So the first step is to try to save money that we do not have to \nspend next year through a rescissions bill. The second step is to make \nthe tough additions each week, each month, as this year goes by, as we \npass the appropriations bills, to spend less money than we had \nanticipated spending.\n  If we do that each year for 7 years, we will have achieved a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, without the need for a constitutional \namendment.\n  We know that would provide more discipline, would give the Congress a \nbetter ability to control spending, but we will deal with the issue of \nthe constitutional amendment later this year and probably next year.\n  Let me go back to the first of those three steps, the rescission \npackage, because that is what has been before the Senate for the past \nweek.\n  The idea of rescissions--not a term that the American people would \nnecessarily relate to--but the idea of rescissions is to simply not \nspend money that we counted on spending, because we really do not have \nto spend it.\n  Here is an example: We appropriate money to the General Services \nAdministration to build a building. We say it will cost $2 million, so \nhere is the money for it. GSA lets out the bids but none of the \ncompanies that would bid on it gives the GSA a bid they want to accept. \nThe bids do not supply the right kind of construction or architect or \nsomething.\n  So the GSA does not let the bids for the contract, so the contract is \ndelayed a year. That $2 million which has been appropriated for next \nyear, really, cannot efficiently be spent next year. The construction \nproject on which it was supposed to be spent cannot be built.\n  Why should we force the GSA to spend that money on something? We can \nrescind the money. We can call that money back, and save it for this \nyear, and either decide to apply it to deficit reduction or apply it to \nsome other expenditure for next year.\n  There are a lot of different programs that we have been talking about \nrescinding money in. The net result has been an agreement that \nsomewhere between $13 or $14 billion and $17 billion, we can save the \nAmerican people--taxpayers--that much money in this coming fiscal year \nbecause we really do not need to spend that money even though the money \nhas been authorized to be spent.\n  Now we have had some disagreements in the Senate about whether we \nshould agree to the House level of $17 billion. There has been some \ndisagreement between the Democrats and Republicans as to where to save \nthat money.\n  I am hopeful that within a few minutes the majority and the minority \nleader will announce an agreement which represents not totally a \nRepublican view or a Democratic view but a view that both share, that \nwe need to save as much money as possible.\n  While it will not get to the $17 billion level that the House of \nRepresentatives has adopted, it will be close to that. It will be in \nthe range of $16 billion, I hope, and that we will then be able to \nquickly adopt that rescissions package, go into conference with the \nHouse so that as soon as we return from the Easter recess we can send \nto the President savings of between $16 and $17 billion.\n  Some people have said, why are we taking time to deal with that \nproblem when we have a much bigger problem of developing a budget of \nover $1 trillion? Beginning the process of reducing Federal spending \nover a period of 7 years to reach a balanced budget, perhaps in the \norder of magnitude of $1 trillion over the 7-year period.\n  What is $17 billion? Well, we have all quoted Everett Dirksen, who \nuse to speak in this Chamber, and who made famous ``A billion here and \na billion there, pretty soon you are talking real money.'' To the \nAmerican people, $17 billion is a lot of money, and it is a very good \ndownpayment on the savings that we have to make in the future.\n  Because of the consternation I have seen expressed on the floor here \nabout some of the savings even within the $17 billion package, it makes \nit clear to me that it will be a very hard process if we cannot agree \nto some of the things that are in the $16 or $17 billion package, how \nwill we agree to something 10 times greater than that or 100 times \ngreater than that?\n  Clearly, we have to start from the bottom up. Each program has to be \nprioritized, and we have to try and find savings everywhere we can. In \neach line of that Federal budget, there is something to be saved. When \nwe add it all up, it adds up to big dollars.\n  If we only look to the big programs, then we are forced to look at \nthings like Social Security and Medicare and defense. Frankly, most \nSenators understand that there is much about those programs which \nprecludes the Senate from making the huge savings that would have to be \nmade there if we ignore the smaller programs.\n  It is important to start at a level of rescissions. I am very, very \nhopeful that within a few minutes our leadership will indicate an \nagreement on a \n[[Page S5284]] rescissions package of $16 to $17 billion that we can \nadopt, and begin this process of balancing the Federal budget.\n  Just one more comment, since I see the Senator from Alaska is here \nand wishes to speak. I wanted to comment on what the House of \nRepresentatives did last night. It was historic, Mr. President. Never \nin the history of the country has a body as the House of \nRepresentatives in less than 100 days adopted the sweeping legislation \nthat the House of Representatives has now adopted. Nine out of the 10 \npoints in the Republican Contract With America were adopted, concluding \nlast night with the historic $180 billion-plus tax cut for the American \npeople. A tax cut which guarantees not to cost in terms of the deficit \nbut has added to the deficit reduction planning.\n  In other words, the House committed to reducing the Federal budget \ndeficit and achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002, and in \naddition, providing for $180 billion in tax cuts for the American \npeople.\n  This is in keeping with the commitment that many made in the last \nelection to our constituents and to the desires of the American people \nexpressed to Members in the last election.\n  I want to commend the House of Representatives and all of the people \nthere who thought it important enough not only to express the intention \nto balance the budget but also to allow American families to keep more \nof what they earn and to allow American businesses to generate the \ncapital, to create the jobs to employ the people, to create the kind of \nemployment that we know is necessary to bring people out of poverty and \ncreate a high standard of living for working Americans, for all of \nmiddle America.\n  This is an important commitment that needed to be kept. And it is up \nto the Senate, after we return from the Easter recess, to follow \nthrough on our part of that commitment. Our tax cut program may not be \nprecisely what the House program was. It might be a little bit less, in \nterms of money. We know that there is a little bit different point of \nview here.\n  I, for one, would be happy to adopt every penny of the tax cuts \nadopted by the House of Representatives. To me, every one of them is \njustified and I will be urging that we do that here on the Senate \nfloor. But even if it is not exactly identical, I think we can be proud \nand we can go back to the American people and say we kept our promises \nto you, we kept our commitment, if we are able to adopt a program of \ntax relief that is close to what the House adopted last night.\n  I think it is important for us in the Senate to say to our colleagues \nin the House, ``Job well done. You did what you promised you would do. \nYou set the stage for us to come in behind you and to finish the job \nand we are committed to doing that when we return from this Easter \nrecess.''\n  I think, as we prepare to go back and spend time with our \nconstituents, much has been achieved. We should be prepared to talk \nabout that. But most important--most important we should be prepared to \nlisten to our constituents when we go home now, to listen for 3 weeks \nto what they have to tell us. Have we been doing the right thing? Do \nyou want us to continue on this path? My guess is, when we come back, \nwe will be energized with the spirit of our constituents telling us to \ncarry on, keep on with that fight, balance the Federal budget, save \nthis money in rescissions and provide tax relief for American families. \nI think that will be their message to us. I cannot wait to get back and \nhear it.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague and a \nnumber of the freshman Senators for their initiative in pursuing \nappropriate action relative to cutting Federal spending. While I have \nbeen around here a little longer than they have, I think their energy \nand commitment is to be recognized, and I think the spirit of \nleadership in relationship to the tough decisions that have to be made \nare certainly evidenced in this new group that has joined our \nmembership.\n  I believe we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Technically, we have before us H.R. 1158, FEMA \nsupplemental appropriations.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask that I may extend my remarks concerning an \ninvitation to allow the President of Taiwan to visit the United States. \nI assume under the rescission package before us, unanimous consent \nwould be sufficient?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment to \nthe rescission package which would express the sense of the Congress \nthat the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, be allowed to visit the \nUnited States.\n  It is my understanding it is unlikely that I will have an opportunity \nto offer such an amendment. But I intend, at an appropriate time in the \nnear future to offer the amendment to another vehicle and request an up \nor down vote.\n  The amendment I intended to offer would have been identical to Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 9, which has 52 bipartisan cosponsors, including, \nI am proud to say, both the majority and minority leaders of this body. \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 9 passed the Foreign Relations Committee \nunanimously 2 weeks ago.\n  Specifically, that resolution calls on our President to allow \nPresident Lee of Taiwan to come to the United States, not on a state \nvisit but on a private visit. It is an identical resolution to House \nConcurrent Resolution 33, which was introduced in the House by \nCongressmen Lantos of California, Solomon of New York, and Torricelli \nof New Jersey. It passed the House International Relations Committee \nyesterday, I am told, by a vote of 33 to 0.\n  Obviously, the support is there. I hope the State Department will be \nsensitive to the recommendations of the Congress.\n  We have a rather interesting situation with regard to our relations \nwith Taiwan, as well as China, but clearly we should not allow the \nPeople's Republic of China to dictate who can visit the United States. \nAgain, we are not talking about an official state visit; we are talking \nabout allowing President Lee to make a private visit. He has received \ntwo invitations that the Senator from Alaska is aware of. One is to \ncome visit his alma mater, Cornell University, where he has been asked \nto make an address. Further, he has been extended an invitation to the \nU.S.-ROC Economic Council Conference. This is an organization whose \npurpose is to promote trade and commerce between Taiwan and the United \nStates. That organization will be meeting in Anchorage, AK, my home \nState, in September.\n  In both instances, the State Department has discouraged the issuance \nof these invitations and implied that they would not look favorably on \na request for a visa.\n  That is offensive to this Senator. The suggestion of the State \nDepartment is that allowing President Lee to visit the United States \nwould upset relations with the People's Republic of China. I think we \nhave to recognize the gigantic strides that have been made by Taiwan \nover the years. They ended their martial law. They have initiated free \nand fair elections. They have a very vocal press. Human rights have \nsteadily improved. They have the development of a strong second party. \nAnd Taiwan ultimately is a friendly, democratic, stable, and prosperous \nnation. They are the 5th largest trading partner of the United States, \nand the world's 13th. They buy twice as much from the United States as \nthe People's Republic of China. They are among the holders of the \nlargest foreign reserves of any country. They contribute to \ninternational causes.\n  But our country continues to give a cold shoulder to the leader of \nTaiwan, President Lee. It went so far that last May in Hawaii when \nPresident Lee was in transit from Taiwan to Central America, the State \nDepartment refused to allow President Lee an overnight visit. The State \nDepartment continues to indicate that a private visit will not be \nallowed. They suggest that the United States would allow transient \nstops. That means perhaps the airplane can stop for refueling and \nPresident Lee would be allowed to get off and perhaps spend the night.\n  One of the inconsistencies I would like to bring out--and this came \nup on a recent trip I made to both Taiwan and Beijing--is the expanding \nrelationship between Taiwan and the People's \n[[Page S5285]] Republic of China. I learned of an organization called \nthe Association for Relations Across Taiwan Straits. That is the \norganization in Beijing. On the Taiwanese side, there is the \norganization called the Mainland Affairs Council.\n  Although the People's Republic of China is telling the United States \nnot to have any relations with Taiwan because it would offend the \nPeople's Republic of China, there is a relationship between Taiwan and \nthe People's Republic of China through these two organizations that \nhave been established and that meet regularly. The Association for \nRelations Across Taiwan Straits and The Mainland Affairs Council talk \nabout everything but politics. They talk about trade, they talk about \ncommerce, they talk about hijacking.\n  I think it is fair to say the Chinese business men and women are \namong the best in the world. They are motivated, obviously, by the \nopportunity for trade and commerce. So they are discussing between them \nmatters of interest and matters that are beneficial to both. They have \neven announced proposals for direct shipping from Taiwan to the \nsouthern provinces in China that would bypass Hong Kong.\n  Here we have a situation of inconsistency, and it is beyond this \nSenator to understand how the State Department can overlook that. Trade \nand commerce is flourishing between Taiwan and the People's Republic of \nChina, yet the People's Republic of China dictates to us that we cannot \nextend a private visit to the President of Taiwan.\n  I have a great respect and fondness for their representatives.\n  I know the Ambassador. I have had the pleasure of meeting Chairman \nDeng. But the People's Republic of China bellows about virtually \neverything that we do-- United States pressure at the United Nations on \nhuman rights, world trade organization membership and anything we do \nwith regard to Taiwan. That is the litany. It is expected. We should \nrecognize it for what it is. But we should not be dictated by the terms \nand conditions which they mandate.\n  In my opinion, in the end the People's Republic of China will make \ncalculations about when and what to risk with regard to their \nphilosophy of doing business and participating in our markets. We \nshould simply do the same.\n  There is precedent for a visit by Lee. I will be specific. This \nadministration has welcomed other unofficial leaders to the United \nStates. The Dalai Lama called on Vice President Gore over the \nobjections from the People's Republic of China. Yasser Arafat came to \nthe White House ceremony. He was once referred to as a supporter of \nterrorism. Gerry Adams has been granted numerous visas over Great \nBritain's objection. In each case the administration, I think, made the \ncorrect choice to allow us to advance American goals. President Lee's \nvisit would do the same.\n  I would also call my colleagues' attention to the extended debates we \nhave had in this body about most-favored-nation status for China. I \nhave supported MFN for China, and most of my colleagues have also \nsupported it under the premise that engagement helps bring about \nchange. We can bring about greater recognition on human rights if we \nestablish a dialog, open trade, and commerce. So we apply it to China. \nBut with regard to Taiwan, we will not even invite the President of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan for a visit to the United States. This is a \nprivate visit. We are not talking about a state visit.\n  By the number of supporters on the amendment, 52 bipartisan \ncosponsors, the State Department should get the message of the \nprevailing attitude in this body. As I said when I started, I am not \ngoing to have an opportunity to offer this as an amendment before this \nbody on the rescissions package. But I intend to bring it up later for \nan up-down vote because that is perhaps the only way the State \nDepartment can understand the prevailing attitude.\n  Finally, the U.S.-ROC Economic Council conference is to be held in \nAnchorage in September. Visiting Alaska would not be a political \nstatement. We consider ourselves almost another country. We are out \nthere all by ourselves and I think it is appropriate that President Lee \nparticipate in an economic meeting. Lee's alma mater, Cornell \nUniversity, as I indicated earlier, is another completely private \nmatter.\n  So I call on my colleagues to vote to send a strong signal to the \nadministration at an appropriate time when I have an opportunity to \nbring up the amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record. \nThis is a letter from David W. Tsai, President of the Center for Taiwan \nInternational Relations.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Center for Taiwan\n\n\n                                      International Relations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1995.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: I am writing to urge you to \n     demonstrate your Administration's support for global \n     democratization by permitting President Lee Teng-hui of \n     Taiwan to visit the United States. In particular, you should \n     allow President Lee, a distinguished Ph.D. alumnus of Cornell \n     University, to visit his alma mater this summer, where he has \n     been invited to give the prestigious Olin Lecture to over \n     2,000 returning Cornell alumni all over the world. He should \n     also be permitted to address the Economic Council meeting in \n     Alaska as an honored speaker later this year. Such visits are \n     well-provided for within United States policy toward Taiwan. \n     In addition, the Administration should take advantage of \n     President Lee's visit to the U.S. by granting him an audience \n     with yourself.\n       President Lee, a political reformer, has significantly \n     advanced democracy in Taiwan. He is committed to the further \n     democratization of the island nation--a process which has \n     been encouraged and prodded along by the United States \n     Congress and six different administrations. He has played a \n     central role in the Taiwan model that so many nations are now \n     seeking to emulate. Today Taiwan is an emerging democracy and \n     an economic powerhouse. Yet while Taiwan has made great \n     strides in response to the calls for reform and has achieved \n     international economic distinction, the United States has \n     continued to treat Taiwan like an international pariah. Many \n     Members of Congress and the American public were outraged \n     last May at the Administration's refusal to allow President \n     Lee to stay overnight in Hawaii en route to a presidential \n     inauguration in Central America. It undercuts American \n     credibility and concern for human rights when a country like \n     Taiwan with its strong democratization record is treated so \n     badly.\n       It is in the American national interest to allow President \n     Lee to visit. In so doing, America will reaffirm its \n     commitment to freedom and democracy and to friendship with \n     the people of Taiwan. We cannot continue to let China dictate \n     U.S. policy or determine who can and cannot visit the United \n     States. It weakens the Clinton Administration and compromises \n     the U.S. world leadership to allow even the appearance of \n     taking orders from Bejing or being bullied by China.\n       As you know, President Lee's visit has strong bipartisan \n     support in both Houses of the U.S. Congress. Having visited \n     Taiwan three times yourself, you undoubtedly recognize \n     Taiwan's strategic importance to maintaining the balance of \n     power in East Asia. Also, Taiwan is important as a friendly \n     partner of the United States, particularly in trade, \n     education, and diplomacy. Today Taiwan is the seventh largest \n     trading partner of the United States and buys more than twice \n     as many annually from the U.S. as does the People's Republic \n     of China. Both the Taiwanese American community and the \n     American business community will support your favorable \n     decision to permit President Lee's visit. A visit to the U.S. \n     by the President of Taiwan is not only in America's national \n     interest but in line with the democratic traditional values \n     that the United States stands for.\n       Congressional and grass roots support for President Lee's \n     visit is building, and I urge you to take immediate steps to \n     welcome President Lee to the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         David W. Tsai, Ph.D.,\n\n                                             President, Center for\n                                   Taiwan International Relations.\n\n       This letter is also endorsed by the following Taiwanese \n     American organizations:\n       World Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce (President: Jentai \n     Tsai), N.Y.\n       Taiwanese Import and Export Association (President: Wen-chu \n     Huang), N.Y.\n       North America Taiwanese Medical Association (President: \n     Bernard Tsai, M.D.), Potomac.\n       Taiwanese Christian Church Council of North America (Chair: \n     Rev. David Chen), Santa Ana.\n       Taiwanese American Citizens League (President: David D. \n     Tsay, Ph.D.), Houston.\n       Society of Taiwanese Americans (Representative: Wilbur \n     Chen), Bethesda.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see my good friend, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, on the floor. I would be happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I have no \ndesire to have the floor. I thank the Senator.\n   [[Page S5286]] Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish my friend a good day and thank \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5283-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5286-S5287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MEXICO'S DEBT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly about another \namendment that I was prepared to offer. But, again, because of the \ncircumstances on the floor, it is not going to be presented. It is an \nissue that is ongoing. I would like to speak briefly on the merits of \nthe issue, although, as I have said, the amendment will not be offered.\n  This was to be a very simple and very straightforward amendment. It \nwould require the Government of Mexico to provide our Government with \ninformation relative to the names of the individuals or institutions \nthat are redeeming Mexico's debt when the redemptions are made with the \nfunds provided by the United States Government. As my friend in the \nchair, the Presiding Officer, will recall, this package is almost $52 \nbillion.\n  It is the contention of the Senator from Alaska that is a bailout \nthat has been crafted by the United States through the Treasury \nDepartment. It is my understanding that Mexico has already used some \n$13 billion to pay off the debt, of which $5 billion initially has come \nfrom the United States. Another $15 billion of American taxpayer money \nis at risk. That is money that came from the Exchange Stabilization \nFund that was set up when we went off the gold standard.\n  We are all aware of the fact that the administration came to the Hill \nto seek support for the Mexico bailout. But they could not get our \nsupport and decided that they would find another avenue to bail out \nMexico. And they came up with the $20 billion that is in the Exchange \nStabilization Fund, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for \nInternational Settlements, and others and the commitment now is some \n$52 billion.\n  It is rather interesting to reflect on that because the Senator from \nNew York and I had a colloquy some time ago. And both our recollections \nare that the current debt of Mexico, as communicated by the assistant \nto the President of Mexico at a meeting we had, was in the area of $70 \nbillion. The current debt is debt payable in a year. This debt is to \nmeet an obligation issued by the Mexican Government in the form of \nbonds. These are bearer bonds. That means we do not know who holds \nthem. It is like a check payable to cash.\n  The question my amendment attempts to address is who is being bailed \nout? Is it the Mexican people? Is it Mexican financial institutions? We \nhave not been able to get a definitive answer from the Department of \nthe Treasury. It is my opinion that the ordinary citizens of Mexico are \nnot being bailed out. In fact, the ordinary citizen of Mexico is \ncurrently facing interest rates that are clearly out of reach, in some \ninstances 75 and 100 percent. Mortgage rates are absolutely \nunrealistic. The reality of lost jobs, higher taxes, higher inflation, \nand when we look at the obligation of who pays this back, we find it is \nthe citizens of Mexico. It is the economy of Mexico.\n  Businesses operating in Mexico are not being bailed out by this \ncommitment, which is the first advance of some $52 billion. Mexico has \nalready used $13 billion to pay off the debt which comes from the \nUnited States; hence, the United States taxpayer.\n  Companies that have put brick and mortar in the ground for new plants \nand employ Mexican citizens are not the beneficiaries of this money. In \nfact, they are suffering from the havoc caused by the interest rate \nexplosion. They cannot borrow for inventory. They cannot borrow for \nexpansion. American mutual fund investors--let me repeat that--American \nmutual fund investors whose funds invest on the Mexican Bolsa are not \nbeing bailed out. In fact, these equity investors have seen the value \nof their holdings drop more than 50 percent, and in some cases the loss \nof these stocks are even larger. So the questions are, Well, where is \nthis money going? Who is it going to benefit?\n  Mr. President, you know who is being bailed out. So do I. The owners \nof the so-called tesobono debt. Most people do not even know what a \ntesobono is. In fact, this debt really did not exist a year ago. It is \nthe Mexican debt which, when it comes due, is paid in pesos.\n  It is rather interesting how the financial intrigue of this \nadjustment occurs. However, the important thing to recognize is the \namount of pesos that the debt-ridden holder receives at maturity is \nlinked to the peso-dollar exchange rate. Mexico, unfortunately, made a \ndecision to issue this type of debt early last year because it was \nfinding it more and more difficult to attract more investors to finance \nits debt.\n  That sounds rather curious, does it not, that they have to have \nforeign investors to finance their debt? Yet that is the reality that \nMexico faced. Canada has to have foreign investors to finance its debt. \nI noted the other day a figure which indicated that 29.6 percent of the \nCanadian budget was to pay interest on the debt. That is almost a \nthird. When you get into that area, the ball game is almost over. It is \nalmost over.\n  Now, the foreigners, of course, in order to invest, when they see a \nsituation that is less than stable, demand higher interest rates, and \nthey demanded as much as 20 percent from Mexico. Not only that, but \nthat demanded that the debt be linked to the peso/dollar exchange rate.\n   These are very shrewd investors, Mr. President. They know that money \ngoes to the highest return and the least risk. And they must have \nforeseen that the peso could be devalued, and they wanted to ensure \nthat they would suffer no currency risk.\n  That is exactly what happened, Mr. President. The peso went from 3.5 \nto the dollar to 6.5 in barely 2 months, and now that this debt is due \nthese investors are completely insulated from the financial crisis that \nis affecting all other sectors of the investment community and the \nworking community in Mexico.\n  One asks the question why? It is because the United States Government \nhas decided to give Mexico these billions of dollars to pay off these \ninvestors. Now, who are these investors? As I said, they are \nsophisticated investors. They are the investors who went out there and \ntook a risk because the attractiveness of 20 percent interest suggested \nthat risk was worth taking. These are not the ordinary Mexican people.\n  This was done because the United States Government has decided to \ngive billions of dollars to Mexico to pay off these investors. If we \nhad not come to the rescue, then these investors would have had to \nsuffer the financial consequences that everyone else in Mexico must \nface. Why should these investors be bailed out? We do not bail out the \ninvestors who put money in Orange County bonds. Why are these investors \nin Mexico so very special?\n  One of the reasons, obviously, we do not know who they are. That \nmakes them special. We know who the investors are who bought Orange \nCounty bonds. Who bought these tesobonos? We do not know. They could be \nAmerican investors, Japanese or German investors, they could very well \nbe some of the billionaires who live in Mexico City and are friends of \nthe controlling PRI party.\n  What we do know is that whoever owns this debt is really cashing in, \nand they are shipping their money where? They are shipping it out of \nMexico. In fact, so many tesobono owners were immediately converting \ntheir proceeds into dollars that the peso began to crash above seven to \nthe dollar, and then the Mexican Government decided to stop paying off \ntesobono debt in pesos and immediately paid the debt in dollars. Where \ndid the money come from? It came from the United States. Whose dollars \nare they using? They are using U.S. taxpayer dollars. We are bailing \nthem out. Why? We are being told it is to stabilize the monetary and \ncurrency system.\n  That is what we are told. If you buy some shares on the New York or \nAmerican Stock Exchange and lose money, we do not bail you out.\n  But if we had not bailed out the bond holders and the Mexican \nGovernment, what would they have done? They would have done as \neverybody else who runs in to credit problem. They sit down and work a \ndeal out. You know you cannot get 100 percent back on the investment. \nYou might get 40 percent. But that is the way the process works \n[[Page S5287]] in the ordinary debtor/creditor situation. Then we would \nknow who the holders of the tesobono debt are. They would have to come \nforth, submit their bearer bonds through investment brokers, \ncommercial, international banks. We would know who they are and they \nwould sit down and work out a deal. That is what should have been done.\n  I believe it is important that the American taxpayers know who the \nrecipients of this debt are. Some have said, what difference does it \nmake who they are? I think it is important when American taxpayer money \nis used to provide a guarantee on a foreign government debt to a very \nselect group of holders of debt. Not only are they going to get their \nprincipal back; they are going to get the interest back--20 percent.\n  You and I, where do we go to get 20 percent? I do not know. Maybe you \nget in line down there and buy some tesobonos. But we ought to know who \nthe beneficiaries are because we know that it is not the Mexican \neconomy that is the beneficiary. This is not going to do a thing for \nthe Mexican economy. Those holders of that debt are moving that money \nout of Mexico. Yet, the Mexican economy, the Mexican citizens are \nexpected to pay it back. In the conditions that exist in Mexico that is \nunlikely to occur.\n  Now, many of my colleagues make the point that we cannot indicate \nthat we are supporting a process and then not follow it through. The \nproblem with this sales package, Mr. President, is we did not \nunderstand it in the first place. We were told continually we were \ngoing to stabilize the Mexican economy. What we are doing is paying off \nthe debt of sophisticated investors who bought those tesobonos who are \nstanding in line to get United States dollars and will bail out and \nthey are not going to put that money back in Mexico.\n  There are assumptions that a large portion of this debt is held by \nAmericans, yet the Treasury Department claims that these bearer \ninstruments are of a nature where they do not know who owns the debt.\n  I do not know who controls the debt. But what if we found out that $5 \nbillion of the debt was owned by the Bank of Libya or maybe the debt \nwas owned by an investment house operating as a front for the \nGovernment of Iraq or Iran. Would not the taxpayer be curious? Do we \nnot have an obligation as we sign off on this money as a Congress to \nknow who those recipients are? Is it too much to demand that when \nAmerican taxpayer dollars are used by the Government of Mexico to pay \noff an investor or speculator the identity of that investor or \nspeculator be known? Because again, we are being told that this has to \nhappen to solidify the economy of Mexico. It is going to solidify the \nholders of those bearer notes.\n  What my amendment seeks to accomplish is to try to identify who those \nholders are. Mr. President, reality dictates that if my amendment \npasses and Mexico does provide the information we are seeking, we will \nprobably never know who really holds that debt. It will probably be \nreported in the name of the Bank of Panama, the Bank of the Bahamas, a \ncouple of major brokerage house firms, but I think it important that \nthis body focus on this principle: that it was an unnecessary and \nunwise action taken by this administration at the expense of the U.S. \ntaxpayer to favor the holders of an extraordinary type of foreign debt \nthat was issued out there to make them whole when we do not do it to \nany other investor when their investments turn bad. But we made an \nexception for these investors.\n  The New York Times reported last Sunday:\n\n       Most of those investors, a mix of rich Americans and other \n     foreigners, have swept up their hefty profits and immediately \n     transferred their money out of the country of Mexico.\n\n  Now, if that is true, Mr. President, we have not done Mexico a favor. \nWe have put a burden on the taxpayer and the Mexican economy because \nthey are the ones we expect to pay that back.\n  So that is the extent of my statement and my concern, Mr. President. \nAnd I urge my colleagues who have anguished over whether or not the \nCongress should take a position on this matter to recognize that we \nhave an obligation to the U.S. taxpayer to make an accounting of the \nworthiness of a $20 billion commitment, and that is not what we have \ndone.\n  I would feel entirely different in this matter if I felt this was an \ninvestment in the Mexican economy which would benefit the Mexican \ntaxpayer.\n  It is like, if you borrow money, Mr. President--and I know you are a \nbusinessman--and you could use that money to make more money, that is a \ngood thing. You are employing more people; you are building up \ninventory. But if you borrow money and you have to mortgage your income \nto pay it back, I may be doing you a grave disfavor.\n  That is the principle that I think is applicable in this particular \ncase of bailing out this select group of investors, whom we have no \nknowledge of at the expense of the Mexican taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I have concluded my statement. I intend to pursue this \nmatter at a later date when the opportunity arises with an appropriate \nvehicle.\n  In the meantime, I ask my colleagues to consider the merits of my \nstatement this morning relative to identifying who the beneficiaries \nare of our $20 billion commitment. This is just a part of the current \nMexican debt, which will in this year require some $70 billion in order \nto meet the obligations of the Mexican government.\n  I thank the Chair and I wish the Presiding Officer a good day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5286-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5287-S5288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          STRIKER REPLACEMENT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on March 23, I introduced S. 603--a \nbill to nullify Executive Order 12954 which prohibits Federal contracts \nwith any company that hires permanent replacements for striking \nworkers. This is the companion bill to H.R. 1176 introduced by Chairman \nGoodling of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. \nYesterday, Mr. Goodling's committee held a hearing on H.R. 1176, at \nwhich testimony was given concerning the fundamental flaws of this \nExecutive order. Many of the same issues were addressed in this Chamber \nwhen the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Chairman Kassebaum, ably \nled an effort to limit funding for the implementation of the Executive \norder.\n  We lost that fight, but the opponents of this Presidential power grab \nwill not rest until the Executive order is overturned and balance is \nrestored to this Nation's labor policies.\n  Today, I would like to speak briefly about just a few of the more \nrecent and compelling criticisms of the Executive order.\n  I share the opinion of those who conclude that the order is invalid \nbecause it exceeds the President's constitutional and statutory \nauthority. The Justice Department's legal memorandum in justification \nof the order cites a statute which was enacted in 1949 to implement the \nrecommendations of the Hoover Commission.\n  The Justice Department takes the position that this statute \nauthorizes the President to adopt any regulation which promotes economy \nand efficiency in Government procurement. However, there is no Supreme \nCourt decision that supports the Justice Department's interpretation of \nthis statute as conferring such sweeping Presidential authority.\n  Moreover, the Congressional Research Service recently concluded that \nExecutive Order 12954 ``may not survive even the most restrained \njudicial scrutiny.''\n  We must be clear about the legal foundation which restricts the \nPresident's authority to issue an Executive order regarding a central \ntenet of national labor policy.\n  The National Labor Relations Act itself authorizes the hiring of \nreplacement workers--and by so doing, limits Presidential authority to \nregulate the relationship between management and striking employees. \nThe President has \n[[Page S5288]] not been granted authority under any statute to alter \nthis carefully balanced congressional design.\n  If this order is not overturned, just imagine the possible \nconsequences of allowing the President to bypass Congress and issue \ndirectives on any and all matters relating to Federal contractors.\n  For example, President Clinton would be permitted to unilaterally \nimpose on Federal contractors a mandate to implement the type of health \ncare plan which he advocated last year and which was so thoroughly and \nsoundly rejected by Congress and the American people.\n  In issuing Executive Order 12954, President Clinton has made a \nsweeping assertion of Presidential power which is completely at odds \nwith our constitutional system of separated and enumerated powers. It \nshould not be allowed to stand, and during the 104th Congress we should \ncommit ourselves to reversing this ill-conceived precedent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from North Carolina withhold \nhis request? The Senator from Illinois is seeking the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am sorry. I did not see the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  I withdraw the request for a quorum call.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized. The \nChair apologizes. I was raptured by the Senator from North Carolina, \nand my head was turned the wrong way. I wish her a good day.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5287-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5288-S5290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   WINNERS AND LOSERS OF THE CONTRACT\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the first \n100 days of Congress, and the winners and losers of the Contract With \nAmerica.\n  We have heard a lot from those who would compliment the leaders in \nthe House for their speedy answers to some of this Nation's most \npressing problems. Many will say that they have made history for their \nability to address so many issues in a mere 100 days. I dare say, \nthough, that if the Contract With America makes history, it will not be \nfor its achievements, but for the reckless manner in which critical \nissues were considered, issues that have will have a severe negative \nimpact on the lives of countless Americans.\n  At the outset, I want to say that we all know that spending must be \nreduced. We all know that the deficit must be brought under control. \nThis is why I supported the balanced budget amendment. But out jobs as \nMembers of Congress means prioritizing the needs of the American people \nwithin our fiscal constraints. What the Contract With America does is \ngive the wealthy a higher ranking over working class families and \nchildren in this country.\n  I can sum up the winners in the last 100 days easily, the super \nwealthy and the billionaires. Unfortunately the list of losers is much \nlonger, children, students, hard working middle-income families, and \nthe list goes on. The losers are those who would greatly benefit our \ninvestment in the people of this great Nation, quality education for \nour children, job training for young people and adults, efforts \ncalculated to help prepare this Nation for the future.\n\n\n                           Winners/Expatriots\n\n  Who are some of the winners in the first 100 days? Some of the \nwinners have been big. The big winners include 24 billionaires who \nescape $1.4 billion in income and estate taxes by renouncing their \ncitizenship, the expatriots who abandon this great land that has helped \nthem gather their wealth. Democrats tried to close that loophole in the \nFinance Committee we were outvoted by the Republican majority.\n  Our current tax laws are not neutral. To favor those that would \nrenounce their citizenship over hard working loyal American citizens \nwho are struggling to get by.\n  A few dozen ex-patriots take advantage of this loophole in Federal \ntax laws by removing their assets beyond the reach of U.S. taxing \njurisdiction just before renouncing their U.S. citizenship, thereby \navoiding taxation of the appropriated value of their assets.\n  While they enjoyed the benefits of U.S. citizenship--police \nprotection, roads, schools, national security, and countless of other \nGovernment services--they looked for ways to get around paying their \nfair share of taxes.\n  Although the Senate Finance Committee voted to eliminate this \nloophole, the provision was restored in conference. This is nothing \nshort of astounding. At the same time that Republican leaders in the \nHouse were proposing massive cuts to be placed on the backs of the \nchildren and families of this country, the House Republicans chose to \ncontinue granting massive benefits to billionaires.\n\n\n                       Winners/House Tax Package\n\n  Among the other winners, are those that would benefit from the House \ntax and spending package that has been labeled the crown jewel of the \nContract With America. I fail to see the glitter in this jewel.\n  Among the tax cuts is a provision which will give families that pay \ntaxes eligibility for a $500 tax credit for each child under the age of \n18, including families earning more than $200,000 a year.\n  But what this crown jewel does is reverse an original proposal which \nwould have made the credit partially refundable, meaning that some low-\nincome working families, who pay no income tax but who do pay \nsubstantial social security and Medicare taxes, could have received the \ncredit. This version is now nonrefundable. And what that means is that \nthose earning $200,000 will not be affected, but that the working poor \nof this country have once again lost out.\n\n\n                             Losers/Opening\n\n  And who else loses, well, these tax loopholes and tax breaks are paid \nfor at the expense of middle Americans who will have to pay more to \nsend their children to college or to a child care program. These breaks \nare also being paid for by the children in this country, thousands of \nkids, who are on waiting lists to attend a Head Start Program. For \nexample, in my hometown of Chicago, only 26 percent of all poor \nchildren qualifying for Head Start are able to attend a program because \nof the shortage of slots available.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about the many other \neducational programs that will suffer as a result of the past 100 days. \nI would also like to review, in somewhat greater detail, the \nconsequences of these ill-considered actions to decimate programs that \ninvest in this country's future.\n  Mr. President, it is an understatement to say that it is\n   vital to the interest of our Nation that we maintain quality public \neducation for all Americans. Education is not just a private benefit, \nbut a public good. It is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy and as \na society, we all benefit from a well educated citizenry. What quality \neducation results in is the means by which we prepare our children to \nsucceed, to earn a living, participate in the community and give \nsomething back to their communities.\n\n\n                   losers/education and the workforce\n\n  Education is also the vehicle to understanding the technology that \nhas reshaped our workplace. This country is experiencing a new era in \neconomic competition. If we are to succeed and retain our \ncompetitiveness into the 21st century, there must be a renewed \ncommitment to education in this country.\n  The results of a failed commitment to our educational system will \nhave direct ramifications on this country's work force--the private \nsector--and this country's economy. Every day, businesses across this \ncountry are trying to cope with the fact that a great percentage of the \nwork force is functionally illiterate. Every day, thousands of \nAmericans are being told that they do not qualify for jobs because they \nlack a high school diploma, or a college degree.\n  Mr. President, our continued commitment to education will mean jobs \nfor the American people.\n  Nonetheless, as other leaders of our countries continue to recognize \nthe increasing importance of education, many in this country continue--\nand I am sorry to say, many Members of Congress--continue to wear \nblinders. \n[[Page S5289]] We must not retreat from this commitment.\n\n\n                         house rescissions bill\n\n  The rescissions bill sent to this chamber by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives would cut $1.7 billion from the 1995 Department of \nEducation budget. It enacted this legislation would cut: $481 million \nfrom the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program; $261 million from \nvocational education and literacy programs; $186 million from the Goals \n2000 program; $113 million from chapter 1, and $50 million from \nbilingual education programs.\n  The House has also recommended rescinding critical funding for \nprograms which advance our Nation's education technology \ninfrastructure, which I will also address. These cuts include:\n  $30 million from the Educational Technology Program, a program which \npromotes equal access for all elementary and secondary students to the \neducational opportunities made available through advances in \ntechnology.\n  $10 million from the Star Schools--a program designed to improve \ninstruction in math, science, foreign languages, and other subjects \nthrough telecommunications technologies. It also supports eligible \ntelecommunications partnerships organized on a statewide or multistate \nbasis to develop and acquire telecommunications equipment, \ninstructional programming, and technical assistance.\n  $2.7 million from the Ready to Learn Program, the first national goal \nwhich states that all children should start school ready to learn. The \nprogram helps local school districts meet this goal by supporting the \ndevelopment and distribution of educational television programming for \npreschool children.\n\n\n                               gao report\n\n  Mr. President, last year, I asked the GAO to conduct a nationwide \nstudy on the condition of our Nation's public school facilities. \nEarlier this week, I elaborated on the second of those reports--\nreleased this week by GAO--which focuses on our Nation's education \ntechnology infrastructure needs. I would like to just briefly comment \non this critical subject again.\n  This GAO report concludes that our Nation's public schools are not \ndesigned or sufficiently equipped to prepare our children for the 21st \ncentury. More specifically, the GAO report found that more than half of \nour Nation's schools lack six or more of the technology elements \nnecessary to reform the way teachers teach and students learn \nincluding: computers; printers; modems; cable tv; laser disc players; \nVCR's, and TVs.\n  In fact, the GAO report found that even more of our Nation's schools \ndo not have the education infrastructure necessary to support these \nimportant audio, video, and data systems. More importantly, this second \nGAO report confirmed our worst fears, the availability of education \ntechnology in our Nation's public schools is directly correlated with \ncommunity type, the percentage of minority students, and the percentage \nof economically disadvantaged students.\n  Mr. President, this is simply unacceptable and the proposed cuts to \neducational programs are also simply unacceptable. There is no reason \nwhy our Nation's children should not have equal access to the best \neducation technology resources available.\n\n\n                        education infrastructure\n\n  Let me mention briefly the first GAO report, released in February, on \nthe state of school facilities. This report found that our Nation's \npublic schools need $112 billion to restore their facilities to \n``good'' overall condition.\n  And what is the Republican response to our Nation's schoolchildren? I \nam sorry to report that the House rescissions bill would also slash \nfunding for all new education initiatives, including the education \ninfrastructure act which I introduced last April to help local school \nboards improve the physical conditions of our schools and ensure the \nhealth and safety of their students.\n\n\n                   education cuts impact on illinois\n\n  While the Senate bill does restore some of the educational funding, \nit is not enough. The cuts are still deep and will have a great impact \non children throughout this country. I would like to use my State of \nIllinois as an example. Some of the Senate-recommended cuts will result \nin the following loss to the children in Illinois alone: Disadvantaged \nStudents Program, (Title I): -$3.4 million; Safe & DrugFree Schools: \n-$4.3 million; Goals 2000: -$2.4 million.\n                            Higher education\n\n  The contract's attack on education does not stop at the grade school \nand high school levels. College students and middle-income American \nfamilies will also pay a higher price.\n  For example, the proposed elimination of four higher education \nprograms--supplemental educational opportunity grants, Federal work \nstudy, Perkins loans, and the State student incentive grants, along \nwith the elimination of the ``in-school interest forgiveness exemptions \non student loans''--will increase the cost of college for American \nfamilies by $20 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Eliminating the subsidy on school interest forgiveness alone would \nmean the following for middle-American families: 4.5 million current \nborrowers will accrue interest on their loans while they are still in \nschool; a student who borrows $17,125 over 4 years would owe $3,150 or \nmore and have his or her monthly payments increased by more than 18 \npercent and, in my State of Illinois, the number of students who will \npay more for student loans will increase by 198,053.\n\n\n                               AmeriCorps\n\n  The contract's attack on young people continues. Republican attempts \nin the House to gut the AmeriCorps Program would eliminate \nopportunities for thousands of students to serve their country while \nearning money for their own education. A promise that has been made to \nthese thousands of young Americans; the communities they serve; the \ncharitable groups they serve with; and, the partners who share the \ncosts of the National Service program, will be broken. Thousands of \nworking families who depend on the promise of college scholarships for \nservice, will lose this valuable financial assistance.\n  The House rescission on AmeriCorps will mean that the almost 700 \nprojected number of students who could take part in the program in \nfiscal year 1995 will be rejected.\n  Mr. President, I would like to use City Year Chicago--the model \nprogram that AmeriCorps is based on--as an example of some of the \noutstanding and desperately need work that is being done by students in \nthe Chicago area. Some of the community service work includes: The \nAlter Group Team--Members work with Bethel New Life, a community \ndevelopment corporation in the Garfield Park neighborhood, a low-income \narea in Chicago. Projects include designing and piloting a computer-\nliteracy program for adults and assisting in the renovation of both a \nhospital, which will become senior housing and a school, which will \nbecome transitional housing for battered women.\n  The First Chicago/Harris/LaSalle/Northern Trust Team--Members are \nrunning a teaching assistant program at the Brian Piccolo Elementary \nSchool in West Humboldt Park, a public elementary school serving \napproximately 966 African-American and Latino students. Each team \nmember works as a teaching assistant in a classroom, tutoring children \nwith special needs, assisting in bilingual classes, or helping to \nimplement special art or education programs.\n  Mr. President, these are just two examples of what's being done under \nthe AmeriCorps Program after only 6 full months of operation. I would \nlike to submit for the Record, a complete list of the AmeriCorps \nCommunity Service Programs underway in Chicago, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the list be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Across this country, more than 20,000 AmeriCorps \nmembers have begun to serve their neighbors; children, the elderly, \nstudents, and persons with AIDS.\n  AmeriCorps members have taught or tutored more than 9,000 pre-school, \nelementary, and junior high school students in basic educational \nskills. They have launched after-school and summer tutoring programs \nfor more than 4,600 kids. And they have organized hundreds of community \nservice projects, cleaning up neighborhoods and providing food for the \nelderly.\n                         [[Page S5290]] Closing\n\n  In closing, I want to make clear what I am for and what I am not for. \nAs I stated at the start of my remarks, a lot of what the spending \nprocess includes is prioritizing. By providing the needed and long \noverdue support for educational programs, job training programs, and \nprograms for children, we invest in this country's future. Cutting \nthese opportunities is clearly in the wrong direction. We must not \nretrench on our commitments to young people and American families.\n  Mr. President, before the celebrating of the contract and the first \n100 days begins, the American people need to understand who's been \ninvited to this party. If you are a billionaire, or part of the small \npercentage of the superwealthy elite in this country, your invitation \nhas been signed, sealed, and delivered.\n  For the rest of American people--the children, students, or hard-\nworking, middle-income Americans--I dare say, your invitation has been \nlost in the mail.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     City Year Chicago--Community Service Update--as of March 1995\n\n\n                          The Alter Group Team\n\n       The Alter Group Team is working with Bethel New Life, a \n     Community Development Corporation in the Garfield Park \n     neighborhood. In the mornings, the Alter Group Team members \n     participate in a variety of group and individual projects \n     under the direction of Bethel New Life staff. Corps members \n     are designing and piloting a computer-literacy program for \n     adults; organizing community improvement and gardening \n     projects; helping to organize a volunteer week and other \n     community events; and assisting in the renovation of both a \n     hospital which will become senior housing and a school which \n     will become transitional housing for battered women. In the \n     afternoons, the team members tutor students in the after \n     school program in Bethel's affiliate elementary school.\n\n\n       The First Chicago/Harris/LaSalle/Northern Trust Bank Team\n\n       The Bank Team is running a City Year in Schools Program at \n     the Brian Piccolo Elementary School in West Humboldt Park, a \n     public elementary school serving approximately 966 African-\n     American and Latino students. Each team member works as a \n     teaching assistant in a classroom, tutoring children with \n     special needs, assisting in bilingual classes, or helping to \n     implement special art or physical education programs. Corps \n     members also act as role models for the young students by \n     establishing an environment of common goals and values and \n     promoting the City Year values of team work and inclusivity. \n     When the school day is finished, the team continues working \n     on a project designed to improve students' self-image and \n     enliven the school environment through the creation of \n     inspirational banners.\n\n\n                             the amoco team\n\n       The Amoco Team also works in partnership with an elementary \n     school: the John Spry Community School in Little Village. \n     Spry is a pre-kindergarten through eighth grade school with \n     approximately 1,300 students. By working individually in \n     classrooms as teaching assistants, City Year corps members \n     are helping to give students the confidence to excel \n     academically. They lead small groups in math and reading, \n     work closely with troubled students and teach lessons in \n     English as a Second Language and art. The Team also \n     participates in such special programs as the celebration of \n     Young Readers Day, for which corps members rotated classrooms \n     and read to over 700 children. The creation of perfect \n     attendance and honor roll certificates for the entire school, \n     and the renovation and reorganization of the Spry School \n     Library for reopening can also be credited to the team \n     members. The Amoco Team is currently working on a violence \n     prevention curriculum, which the team will take to classrooms \n     throughout the school.\n\n\n             the ronald mcdonald children's charities team\n\n       The Ronald McDonald Children's Charities Team is helping to \n     run an after school club at the Chicago Youth Centers-Lower \n     North in Cabrini Green for over 100 children. The team's \n     service is focused on expanding the curriculum offered at the \n     youth center and strengthening the educational components of \n     the program. The team members not only tutor the young \n     children in the program, but create and run after school \n     clubs such as Arts and Crafts, No-Bake Cooking, Tumbling, \n     Volleyball/Softball, Basketball, and Chorus. Along with their \n     work with the After School Club, the team is succeeding in \n     changing the face of the Youth Center. The team has painted \n     most of the building's interior surface, repaired the outside \n     fence, created a mural in the gymnasium, and completed many \n     other physical service projects at the Center. When not at \n     the Center, the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities Team \n     works in partnership with Careers for Youth and Uptown \n     Habitat for Humanity on the West side. They are painting and \n     installing light fixtures in a two-flat apartment building, \n     so that a family can move in this Spring.\n\n\n                 the digital equipment corporation team\n\n       The Digital Equipment Corporation Team runs an after school \n     club for approximately 80 children at the Price School in the \n     Grand Boulevard community through Chicago's Youth and Family \n     Resource Center. Under the supervision of the Digital Team, \n     the children study and work on their homework for two hours \n     tech day. Corps members give the special attention and \n     individual tutoring that is often difficult for teachers to \n     provide in a classroom context. Following completion of their \n     homework, the children can participate in one of the Digital \n     Team's After School Clubs: ``An Exploration of Culture;'' \n     Art; Rap Session (a discussion group); Dance; Music; Reading \n     and Writing Workshop; and Athletics.

Mr. President, I would like to take up another \nsubject that is probably as controversial as the Contract With America \nand what has happened in the last 100 days.\n  I recently met with a group of concerned women in Illinois to discuss \nthe continued relevance of affirmative action. The idea of the meeting \narose quite naturally. As with any other debate that is happening here \nin Washington, I try to reach out to those in my State who will be \nimpacted by changes that Congress might make, in order to get the input \nof their collective wisdom.\n  The meeting was arranged when we, at last, had a few days to spend \nback in the State. As you know, Mr. President, we have not been able to \nget back home as much as we would like. So the meeting was arranged \nsomewhat hastily; we did not have a great opportunity to plan for it. \nNor were we able to provide interested parties with much in the way of \nadvance notice.\n  However, as it turned out, the meeting was a resounding successful. \nFrankly, I do not think I could have even imagined how successful it \nwould be, or how many people would rearrange their plans to meet with \nme on a moment's notice.\n  My office was filled with women who spanned the political and \neconomic spectrum. There were women who had spent their lives doing \ngrassroots political organizing, and women who had spent their lives \nworking in corporate America. There were women who had started their \nown businesses from scratch, as well as women working in unions and \nassociations. Many of the women present had also spent years \nexclusively as homemakers.\n  Despite the diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds represented at \nthe meeting, there was a near unanimity of response. The women in that \nroom wanted to know why Congress would choose this moment in time to \nturn its back on the promise of equal economic opportunity, when so \nmuch work remains yet to be done; at a time when, despite all of our \nefforts, a glass ceiling still works to prevent qualified women and \nminorities from making full use of their collective talents.\n  The women at the meeting wanted to know how Congress could ignore the \noverwhelming evidence that affirmative action benefits not only \nindividuals, but employers and society as well. Finally, they wanted to \nknow what they could do to help preserve this country's commitment to \nequality, opportunity, and fairness.\n  Every woman at that meeting agreed that she would have been denied \nopportunity in the absence of affirmative action. Every woman agreed \nthat she had been provided with opportunities because the climate \ncreated by affirmative action helped to encourage diversity and \ninclusion, and helped to open up fields of endeavor that might have \notherwise been closed to her. And, more importantly--or as \nimportantly--every woman there could recall a roadblock that had been \nplaced in her way \n[[Page S5291]] as she tried to become an equal participant in the \nmarketplace.\n  The barriers to equal opportunity, and the roadblocks that one runs \ninto because of gender are not subjects that most women generally \ndiscuss. Frankly, most women would prefer to meet the potholes and the \nruts in the road, to confront them head on and overcome them, if \npossible, and then move on. Yet every woman present agreed that \ncongressional efforts to repeal affirmative could only serve to put \ncement on the glass ceiling, and to make those hurdles higher. If that \nhappens, Mr. President, these women will come out of the woodwork. \nLetters and phone calls will pour in from across this Nation, Mr. \nPresident, as women tell their stories. The sentiment in that room can \nbe summed up quite simply: Women cannot, and will not, turn back.\n  The simple fact is that many of these women were in professions that \nwomen could not even enter 20 years ago. Many of the women in the room \nhad been hired for jobs or had received promotions that would have been \nunthinkable in 1965, or even 1975. And all of them felt that the \nexistence of affirmative action in the laws and in executive orders in \nthis country had opened doors, had created a climate of diversity, had \ncreated an environment for their inclusion.\n  Finally, despite the progress they had made, all of these women felt \nthat there were still barriers to their advancement, that the glass \nceiling was all too real. They concurred that efforts by this Congress \nto retreat from the commitment to equal opportunity in the workplace \nwould have the effect of putting cement on that glass ceiling, and make \nit much more difficult for women to participate in the economic, \npolitical and social life of this country.\n  Given the enthusiastic reaction at the meeting that took place in my \noffice, I was frankly not surprised to learn 2 days ago that a \nCoalition for Equal Opportunity is being formed in Illinois. At a press \nconference on the 17th of April, more than 40 women's, civil rights, \nlabor, religious, and business organizations will announce their \nintentions to work to preserve equality and fairness in Illinois and \nthroughout the Nation. They announced their intention to begin to \ngalvanize and work to explain to women what affirmative action really \nmeans--the truth of it.\n  I gave a statement on the floor the other night, Mr. President, in \nwhich I went some detail about the truth of affirmative action--what \nthe myths are, what the realities are, and how women and minorities \nwill be affected by efforts to repeal it.\n  For those who may be wondering if the reaction of that group is \natypical, I can assure you, it is not. There is a tendency in \nWashington to get wrapped up in what is happening here on the Senate \nfloor. Sometimes, we can lose sight of what people are saying out there \nin the real world, what is actually going on in communities.\n  It is interesting to note that there is an old expression, ``How does \nit play in Peoria,''--a town that is, of course, in my State of \nIllinois. How does it play in Peoria? This is a short-hand way to cut \nthrough the beltway issues and get to what the people out in the heart \nof the country think about the issue.\n  There was a major story that recently appeared in the Peoria Journal \nStar, a major newspaper in Peoria, that gives us a sense of how this \nissue, the affirmative action debate, is playing in Peoria.\n  The headline of the article is entitled, ``Toward a Middle Ground: \nRe-Think Affirmative Action, But Don't Kill It; Issue Demands \nCaution.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the article be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would like to discuss a few points made by that \narticle, because I think it is helpful for those of us in this body to \nbe aware of how some people in America's heartland feel about the \naffirmative action issue.\n  First and foremost, the people in Peoria are echoing the conclusions \nreached last week by the Department of Labor's glass ceiling \ncommission: affirmative action makes good business sense. As the \narticle states:\n\n       A half-dozen Peoria area employers and educators contacted \n     over the last week said they make special efforts to promote \n     diversity not because the Federal regulators are on their \n     backs, but because it's in their interest. In some \n     circumstances and with some individuals, a black cop or \n     teacher can be more effective than a white one. A rape victim \n     may be more willing to tell her story to a female reporter. A \n     Hispanic salesman may be better able to reach that market. \n     It's not just black students who benefit from attending \n     college; whites are more fully educated--wiser if you will--\n     for having black classmates and roommates.\n\n  Mr. President, these are businesses in Peoria, not New York or even \nChicago. This is Main Street, not Pennsylvania Avenue. And these Main \nStreeters recognize that affirmative action is more than a private \nbenefit; it is a public good. If we can open opportunity to a student \nor a job applicant who has been previously excluded from consideration, \nobviously, that person benefits. What is less obvious, but just as \nimportant, is that society benefits as well.\n  The Journal Star's article continued on to point out that, while \nAmerica has made great strides in equal opportunity, there is still \nmuch work to be done. The dream of America as a colorblind society has \nnot yet been realized even though all of us want, I think, to move in \nthat direction. There are still entire professions, entire companies \nand even entire industries that remain virtually off-limits to women \nand minorities, particularly in the upper-levels. The glass ceiling \nreport reached that conclusion after years of painstaking research; in \nreality, all people need to do is look around their boardroom or their \nclassroom to figure out what is really going on. As Clarence Brown, \npersonnel director at Peoria's Bradley University, stated:\n\n       Everyone still believes the Government is forcing \n     businesses to hire minorities--it's not. At every workshop, \n     somebody brings that up. We say, look around you, and in most \n     of those workshops there are no minorities at all, and most \n     of the people there are white males.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have said before and will say again, I agree that \nall affirmative action programs should be subject to review. Everything \nthat we do in Government, if the Government is to function effectively, \nfrom time to time, be subject to scrutiny and accountability. But there \nis a difference between review and retreat.\n In fact, the issue we are facing right now is that we make certain \nthat retreat does not mean retrenchment. It is important that efforts \nto promote diversity are fair to everybody. It is important that the \naffirmative action initiatives do what they say they do and that we \nweed out the companies that run amuck and bureaucrats that run amuck \nand make a rash of regulations that are illogical.\n\n  So review in and itself can be an opportunity for improvement of \naffirmative action but it should never be used as an excuse for \nretrenchment from our commitment to fairness.\n  As the Peoria Journal Star article concludes:\n\n       It would be a mistake to abandon the broad commitment to \n     act affirmatively to make for a more inclusive America: To \n     recruit, to recognize the value in diversity, to provide more \n     opportunities to those, regardless of sex or color, who have \n     too little from the moment of birth.\n\n  In other words, an absence of discrimination is not enough. The \nFederal Government, employers, and our universities must reach out \nbeyond the traditional groups and ensure that all people are given the \nopportunity to succeed in America.\n  Some have argued that, even if the Federal Executive order on \naffirmative action is repealed, businesses will continue to seek out \ndiversity because it is the right thing to do. It affects the bottom \nline in a positive way. That is possible. But I do not think promotion \nof diversity would proceed as rapidly in the absence of legal guidance. \nIndeed, it is likely to slow down and some of the evidence suggests \nthat where the legal requirement has changed affirmative action efforts \nhave slowed down.\n  The more probable scenario is described this way in the article from \nthe Peoria paper:\n\n       The other possibility is that ending Federal affirmative \n     action mandates will make our workplaces and campuses look \n     more Germanic than American. The commitment to minority \n     recruiting will fade as time passes. Blacks shackled by poor \n     schools and single-parent families will be more disadvantaged \n     than they already are in competition for \n     [[Page S5292]] spots in good colleges, necessary to put them \n     in competition for good jobs. Minorities and women who would \n     be otherwise competitive will run up against the good-old-\n     boys network and the human tendency toward the familiar--to \n     give the job to somebody who looks and things as you do.\n\n  Is that what we want from America? That scenario runs counter to the \nAmerican dream, the dream of opportunity for everyone, the dream of \ntraveling as far as your abilities will take you; or, as many parents \nput it to their children, the dream that any one of us could one day \ngrow up to be the President of the United States. If that dream is to \nhave any basis in reality, we cannot retreat from our commitment to \naffirmative action. To those who will easily dismiss the Peoria Journal \nStar observations, and my remarks on this subject, again I have already \nmade one more detailed speech about this issue, and I intend to make \nothers about this issue to focus in on particular parts of the debate \nand particular issues going to the facts of this issue, I would like to \nremind whoever is listening that Illinois has long been a bellwether \nState on the issue of equal opportunity.\n  As far back as 1914, a woman's organization known as the Kappa \nSuffrage Club realized the link between equality of women, and equality \nfor minorities, and worked for the election of the first black alderman \nin the city of Chicago. The League of Women Voters was founded in \nIllinois in 1919 by Carrie Chapman Catt, who stated at the time that \n``Winning the vote is only an opening wedge, but to learn to use it is \na bigger task.''\n  I know that there are attempts by some to turn the affirmative action \nissue into a cynical debate about race. We cannot allow that to happen. \nThere are too many problems facing this country--problems of job \ncreation, deficit reduction, education--that need our collective \nenergy. To divide Americans one from the other is not only \ncounterproductive, it is irresponsible.\n and I submit irresponsible debate. Affirmative action is about \nopportunity, and affirmative action is about giving our country the \nability to compete in the world economy, in this world marketplace on \nan equal par and with the capacity to tap the talents of 100 percent of \nthe people of this country.\n\n  As our country is able to tap the talents of 100 percent, we grow \nstronger as a nation and we are better able to participate and to \ncompete. To close that door to, put cement on the glass ceiling at this \npoint in time, it seems to me, turns this country in the absolute wrong \ndirection and will put us on a course that I hate frankly to imagine.\n  I hope that over the months as we discuss this issue that people who \ncare about it will, one, focus in on the fact and, two, hear the voices \nof reason coming from the America's heartland. We all stand to gain \nfrom the wisdom of people who are out in the real world trying to make \nour country work as one America.\n  If any objective should command our complete consensus, it is \nensuring that every American has a chance to succeed. And in any event, \nthe facts will not support tagging blacks and other minorities with any \nfailures of affirmative action programs.\n  Mr. President, I will close on a note of caution from the Peoria \nJournal Star:\n\n       There are fewer threats to the Nation's future that a wide \n     divide between angry whites and disenfranchised blacks.\n\n  Those who would seek to enlarge that divide by using affirmative \naction as a racial ``wedge'' issue may score short-term political \npoints; but they do so at the expense of America's long-term future. \nBefore we travel down that road, I urge everyone to consider the voices \nof reason coming from America's heartland. We all stand to gain from \ntheir wisdom.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Peoria Journal Star, Mar. 12, 1995]\n\nToward a Middle Ground: Rethink Affirmative Action, But Don't Kill It; \n                         Issue Demands Caution\n\n       Call it the revenge of the angry white guys.\n       Claiming white males denied access to a janitorial training \n     program, the United States Justice Department last week sued \n     Illinois State University. ISU President Thomas Wallace \n     responded that the program has been set up to integrate a \n     largely white, male work force. White men weren't precluded \n     from joining, Wallace said. But the Justice Department \n     alleges none were among the 60 people trained and hired \n     between 1987 and 1991.\n       It's not often lately that the feds have gone to bat for \n     white guys, especially those who allege they are being denied \n     an opportunity to become janitors because of gender or skin \n     color. Before affirmative action sought to put the power of \n     programming behind the pledge of opportunity, most of the \n     positions that paid Buick-buying money went to white men. Why \n     would they mind if custodial jobs went to blacks?\n       We have come not quite full-circle in the 30 years since \n     President Lyndon B. Johnson committed the country to \n     guaranteeing black Americans ``not just equality as a right . \n     . . but equality as a fact.'' What followed was a host of \n     federal programs--the Library of Congress lists 160--which \n     seek to increase the number of minorities and women in \n     college and medical school, behind jackhammers and at the \n     kneehole side of vice-presidential desks. That it did, though \n     imperfectly (women benefited more fully than blacks) and with \n     fallout.\n       The fallout is the growing resentment of whites. Only a few \n     take their cases to court: the Colorado contractor who lost a \n     federal highway job to a minority firm which submitted a \n     lower bid and the white schoolteacher, hired on the same day \n     as a black, who was laid off when her employer opted for \n     diversity over a coin-toss.\n       More often, white males who believe they've been victimized \n     take their cases to their buddies: They can't get hired, they \n     can't get into law school, they don't have a shot at a \n     promotion because they are being discriminated against. But \n     with some notable exceptions, it's not the best case. For the \n     work force, especially at higher reaches and in the \n     professions, remains predominantly white and largely male.\n       ``Everyone still believes the government is forcing \n     businesses to hire minorities--it's not,'' says Clarence \n     Brown, Bradley University's personnel director. ``At every \n     workshop somebody brings that up. We say look around you, and \n     in most of them there are no minorities at all and most of \n     the people there are white males.''\n       Yet most employers and universities do make special efforts \n     to make their offices and their student bodies look more like \n     America.\n       A half-dozen area employers and educators contacted over \n     the last week said they do so not because federal regulators \n     are on their backs, but because it's in their interest. In \n     some circumstances and with some individuals, a black cop or \n     teacher can be more\n      effective than a white one. A rape victim may be more \n     willing to tell her story to a female reporter. A Hispanic \n     salesman may be better able to reach that market. It's not \n     just black students who benefit from attending Bradley; \n     whites are more fully educated--wiser, if you will--for \n     having black classmates and roommates.\n       A colorblind society, free from all discrimination, is a \n     wonderful goal, but it's not the reality. And so most of \n     those questioned say they'd remain committed to the wisdom of \n     diversity, in the absence of legislation. That's one of the \n     arguments made by those who call for dismantling federal \n     affirmative action programs.\n       But it's also an argument that ends up running in circles. \n     To wit: Race and sex should not be considered. Laws that \n     require their consideration should be repealed. Without laws, \n     employers and institutions will continue their voluntary \n     efforts to attract more minorities because a diverse work \n     force is in their interest. Hence, race and sex will be \n     considered--and all those white guys who think that's why \n     they failed to get hired or promoted will be angry still.\n       The other possibility is that ending federal affirmative \n     action mandates will make our workplaces and campuses look \n     more Germanic than American. The commitment to minority \n     recruiting will fade as time passes. Blacks shackled by poor \n     schools and single-parent families will be more disadvantaged \n     than they already are in competition for spots in good \n     colleges, necessary to put them in competition for good jobs. \n     Minorities and women who would be otherwise competitive will \n     run up against the good-old-boys network and the human \n     tendency toward the familiar--to give the job to somebody who \n     looks and thinks as you do. There will be fewer black doctors \n     and business executives and teachers.\n       All this is a long-winded way of saying that affirmative \n     action is an extraordinarily complex and explosive issue. \n     It's admirable that we want to be a society free of racial or \n     sexual bias, but we are not. What to do about that remains a \n     huge and divisive issue.\n       A story in this newspaper a couple of weeks ago reported \n     that President Clinton had decided to review all affirmative \n     action plans to search for a middle ground: ``Affirmative \n     action review carries a no-win risk,'' read the headline. Yet \n     a compelling case can be made for an effort to find a middle \n     ground on this issue.\n       The House began last month by repealing legislation that \n     granted tax breaks for companies that sell broadcast stations \n     to minorities. No sound argument could be made for filling \n     the pockets of rich white men so blacks could get into \n     broadcast. Minority set-asides deserve a look; so do bidding \n     rules that result in more expensive contracts because race or \n     gender offset a low bid.\n        [[Page S5293]] But it would be a mistake to abandon the \n     broad commitment to act affirmatively to make for a more \n     inclusive America: to recruit, to recognize the value in \n     diversity, to provide more opportunities to those, regardless \n     of sex or color, who have too little from the moment of \n     birth. There are fewer threats to the nation's future than a \n     wide divide between angry whites and disenfranchised-blacks. \n     If ever an issue demanded a middle ground, free of reckless \n     passion, this is it.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, I want to state first of all that, as we \nget to the end of the Republican contract of 100 days, it is time to \ntake stock. Everyone is taking stock of what is in the contract, what \nis passed, what has not passed, what is not in the contract.\n  The piece I want to discuss today is something that just is not \nincluded; that is, whether we are going to ban the practice of allowing \ngifts and special benefits from private interests to Members of \nCongress.\n  I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, and the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, for \nkeeping up this fight during a series of months when in effect it \nappears that the effort to ban the gifts has been ruled out of order. \nIt is not part of the contract. So we do not come out here and talk \nabout it.\n  This came up in the very first week when we addressed something that \nDemocrats have supported that was included in the Republican contract--\nthere have not been many--namely to make sure that Members of Congress \nhave to live by the rules that we make for everyone else. It makes \nsense. It passed overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, and a lot of us \nthought--certainly the three Senators behind the gift ban--what a \nperfect opportunity the first week to get rid of this outrageous \npractice.\n  So we tried to put it on the bill. We were defeated by almost a pure \nparty line vote.\n  It is not very surprising in light of the fact that the new majority \nwanted to set the agenda. I understand that. We protested. But I \ncertainly did not see it as outrageous given the fact that it was the \nfirst week and that there would be other opportunities. At that point, \nthough, we received something that I think most of us perceived as an \nassurance that the gift ban issue would come up in a timely manner. \nThis is not something that needs to be evaluated at length anymore such \nas welfare reform or the whole issue of how to cut the Federal deficit. \nThose are very complicated subjects. This is an easy subject. It is not \nthe kind of thing that should wait until later this year or the end of \nsession. It is important that the gift ban be enacted now so that the \nnegative effect it has on this institution and the perceptions of this \ninstitution are mitigated now. But that is not what has happened.\n  The distinguished majority leader on January 10 said that it was his \nintent to try to move the bill as quickly as he could. He said:\n\n       I am not certain about any date. I am not certain it will \n     be May 31. It could be before, maybe after May 31.\n\n  Some of us hoped at least the end of May would be a good target time \nto solve this problem, certainly by the Memorial Day recess.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, that is not the position now. We have \nreceived a list not too long ago of must-do items entitled, ``The must-\ndo list for Memorial Day Recess, nonexclusive.''\n  Among the items listed on there are some very important items: The \ndefense supplemental appropriations bill, the line-item veto, which we \nhave taken care of in this House, regulatory moratorium bill, which we \nhave moved out, product liability, the self-employed health insurance \nextension--we have taken care of that--FEMA supplemental, which we are \ndealing with now, crime bill, budget resolution, telecommunications \nbill, and various other items are listed as likely.\n  Nowhere on that list is there any suggestion either that we will be \ntaking up the gift ban, or that we are likely to take up the gift ban \nbefore the Memorial Day recess, so I am beginning to get concerned. The \nmajority leader had given us what I thought was a pretty strong \ncommitment this bill would be taken up in a reasonable time but we are \nnot getting that indication now. And I am beginning to wonder why.\n  Mr. President, a lot of things have not surprised me about these \nfirst 100 days of the Republican contract. That does not mean I like \nthem, but they did not surprise me. I am not surprised that the House \nof Representatives, that talked so loudly about deficit reduction, \nyesterday passed a $200 billion step in the wrong direction in the form \nof tax cuts for everyone including some of the very wealthiest people \nin our society. I am not surprised. The Republican contract was voodoo \nmathematics from the beginning. It is about having your cake and eating \nit, too, saying you are for deficit reduction, saying you are for \nbalancing the budget and then as fast as you can trying to make sure \nthat everybody in the country is happy with you by giving you a tax cut \nthat you cannot afford. I am not surprised by that.\n  I was not surprised but dismayed that the Republican contract does \nnot even mention campaign finance reform. The American people want \ncampaign finance reform, but it is very easy on that issue to confuse \npeople, to say that if the Democrats write the bill, it is going to \nhelp out the Democrats; if the Republicans write it, it is going to \nhelp the Republicans. And it is terribly confusing because it involves \nso many different issues of PAC's and campaign limitations, \ncontribution limitations. I think it is a tragedy that it was not a \npart of the contract and before us. But that does not surprise me. I \nwould have expected that especially after the effort to kill the \ncampaign finance reform bill in this body last year.\n  I am not surprised about the complete ignoring of the whole health \ncare issue in the Republican contract, which everybody in the Senate \nsaid was an important issue; everybody said they wanted universal \ncoverage somehow and acknowledged the 40 million Americans with no \nhealth care coverage. Everybody said we have to deal with it somehow, \nbut there is no action on it. There is hardly mention of it.\n  Again, though, Mr. President, I am not surprised. I saw that one \ncoming. Health care became a symbol of something that Government should \nnot get involved in at all during the 103d Congress, and I think that \nis a regrettable result.\n  What I am surprised by, Mr. President, is that the folks running the \nRepublican contract believe that it is just fine to not include the \ngift ban and not take it up in a timely manner. It is not important \nenough apparently to be handled in the first 100 days. I thought it was \njust too obviously inconsistent with the tone and the spirit of the \nRepublican contract and the November 8 elections to ignore the fact \nthat the gift ban is one of the greatest symbols of the corruption that \nexists in this town. That is what I would have thought. After \neliminating the free gym, the free health care, the special stationery, \nand all the little perks that certainly should go--and I am glad they \nare gone--I would have thought it was just incredible that either party \nfelt safe and secure not trying to get rid of the use of gift giving to \nMembers of Congress. It seems like just offering up raw meat to the \nfolks who do the ``Prime Time'' television show, begging them to come \nand photograph Members of Congress on tennis trips paid for by special \ninterests.\n  That is what I would have thought. But that is not the perception. \nThat is not the approach. The approach is to stonewall the gift ban \nissue. And why would Members of Congress continue to allow that \nperception to exist? Well, I guess the conclusion I have come to is \nbecause the giving of gifts to Members of Congress by private \ninterests, by special interests--not by the Government--is not any old \nperk given by the Government like the haircuts and \n[[Page S5294]] other things that have been discovered here and, I hope, \nchanged. It is something different.\n  The practice of gift giving and special interest influence behind \nclosed doors is a key link in a chain of influence, Mr. President, a \ncircle of influence that operates in this town to create a culture of \nspecial interest influence. Among the links in this chain are the \npractice of the revolving door--Members of Congress and staff members \nworking a while here and then finding a nice job downtown and finding \nout that they can, in effect, trade on their experience here to get a \njob lobbying later on. That is one link.\n  Another major link, of course, is the horrible problem of the way our \ncampaign financing system works--the news today in the Washington Post \nof the incredible numbers of new contributions coming into the national \nRepublican committee now that they are in charge of both Houses. You \ncan mention the book deals. You can mention the piece of legislation \nthat is before us in the Senate Judiciary Committee today, the so-\ncalled regulatory reform bill.\n  Mr. President, in that bill it is seriously proposed and apparently \nis going to be passed that the review of these regulations, when they \nget to the highest level, will not be done by a disinterested group but \nwill include a so-called peer review panel that will include the very \ninterests that have a financial interest in the outcome of what happens \nwith those rules.\n  That is a link in this chain. And so is the practice of giving gifts \nand free trips by lobbyists to Members of Congress.\n  The gift giving practice is the piece of the chain of special \ninfluence that has to do with feeding and pampering Members of \nCongress, and it is part of a system that tears the people of this \ncountry away from the people they thought they elected to represent \nthem.\n  It is no wonder that the Republican contract does not mention the \ngift ban. It is no accident that the 104th Congress blocked action on \nthat issue so far. Is it not interesting, if you listen to the talk \nshow hosts, the rather conservative talk show hosts that talk about all \nthe perks in Congress, they will talk about the pension problems here \nand the fact that the pension system needs reform, which I agree with, \nthey will talk about anything that has to do with a Government perk but \nthey seem to not talk about this practice of meals and gifts and \nspecial benefits, personal benefits to Members of Congress. The only \ntime I have ever heard it discussed on one of those shows was on the \nJim Hightower show. He was interested in pointing out what happened the \nfirst week of Congress. But basically it is not mentioned.\n  I can tell you the failure to mention it is not because it is \nsomething very difficult to enact or follow. A gift ban works very, \nvery well. I have said many times in the Chamber--I guess I will be \nsaying it many more times--we have had a law basically banning all \nthese kinds of gifts in Wisconsin for 20 years. It has worked extremely \nwell. Although we certainly have problems with special interest \ninfluence in our Government as well, it is a very different culture in \nWisconsin government because of the Wisconsin gift ban. The type of \nthing that happened that was described in the Washington Post this week \ncould not happen.\n  In an article in the ``In The Loop'' section a couple of days ago, \nentitled ``Hospitality Sweet,'' a recent fact finding trip was \ndescribed as follows:\n\n       Some House Republicans have come up with a neat way to \n     fulfill their promise of slashing the cost of Congress. When \n     members of the Resources Committee recently held field \n     hearings on endangered species and wetlands in Louisiana, the \n     trip included dinner at Armand's in the French Quarter.\n       Who picked up the tab? The not-so-disinterested Louisiana \n     Farm Bureau Federation, Midcontinent Oil and Gas Association, \n     American Sugar Cane League and Louisiana Land and Exploration \n     company.\n\n  And then:\n\n       A week later, it was dinner in San Antonio, sponsored and \n     paid for groups like the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, \n     Texas Sheep and Goat Raisers, San Antonio Farm and Ranch Real \n     Estate Board and Texas Association of Builders.\n\n  Mr. President, there was a rather lame response from one of the staff \nmembers of the House Members trying to explain why there was no problem \nwith this.\n  Mr. Johnson said:\n\n       We just consider this to be local hospitality. It's an \n     opportunity for Members to discuss issues with people from \n     Louisiana.* * * We didn't solicit any of these companies. I \n     feel confident if any environmental groups had come forward \n     and offered to have a luncheon or media opportunity we would \n     have tried to accommodate them.\n  Mr. President, if they try to accommodate all these meals, they are \ngoing to have to go to a weight-loss clinic pretty soon.\n  In Wisconsin, you cannot do this. If you want to meet with \nconstituents and sit down with them at a meal, that is fine, but you \nhave to pay your own way. Sometimes the waiter or the waitress is a \nlittle irritated because they have to write out separate checks. But \nthat is the worst thing that happens. You pay your own way. You do not \ndo the kind of stuff that was done just recently by the House \nRepublicans who said they felt they had to do this in order to \ninvestigate concerns in their State.\n  Mr. President, the problem is not that we cannot enact a gift ban or \ncomply with one. It is just too darn simple to get rid of this horrible \npractice.\n  Mr. President, let me just be clear. I consider this gift ban issue \nto be very, very important. But I do consider it to be sort of the kid \nbrother to the bigger issue, which I consider to be campaign finance \nreform.\n  I am not suggesting in any way that getting rid of gift-giving would \nsolve the problem of special interests and the problem of lobbying. I \nthink the answer there is to limit the amount of money, total amount of \nmoney, that can be spent, or at least make sure that those who abide by \nthe limits get an advantage to make up for the loss of advantages of \nthe greater spending.\n  I also think you ought to get a majority of your campaign \ncontributions from your own home State, something many Republicans have \nproposed. I think that would really dilute and limit the influence of \nspecial interests and lobbyists in the campaign finance context.\n  But this is different. This is about personal enrichment. This is \nabout, in effect, having an opportunity to subtly buy the time, the \nprecious time, of Members of Congress. This is about creating a feeling \nof personal, not professional, obligation between one individual and \nanother, one who happens to be a Member of Congress, one who happens to \nbe a lobbyist for a special interest. This is about the opportunity to \nuse gift giving and buying dinners and giving trips to achieve undue \naccess to Members of Congress.\n  It is part of a chain, as I have had said, it is part of a circle of \ninfluence that I think has broken down the trust between the American \npeople and their elected representatives.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from \nWisconsin talk about gifts. I had come over to speak about something \nelse, but in many respects it relates to the issue of gifts. I thought \nI would ask the Senator a question about it.\n  Last evening, the House of Representatives passed a tax cut bill, \nabout $190 billion lost in revenue for the Federal Government in the 5-\nyear period, about $630 billion lost in revenue during the next 10 \nyears.\n  The same people who were the loudest proponents of changing the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget now have taken a bunch of \npolls and have found out if they offered a tax cut, it would be very \npopular. So they pass a tax cut bill.\n  It is the wrong way to balance the budget. The first step is to cut \nFederal spending and to use the money to cut the Federal deficit. Then \nwe should turn our attention to the Tax Code and try to promote some \nfairness in the Tax Code.\n  But I find it interesting looking at the numbers in this bill passed \nby the House last evening. Last night they talked about this being a \ntax cut for families; this is a family-friendly tax cut to kind of help \nout working families. This morning I looked at the numbers. If you \nadded it all up together--the child credit, capital gains cuts, \neliminating the alternative minimum tax for corporations and a whole \nseries of other things--and figure out who \n[[Page S5295]] benefits, here is what the numbers show. It shows that \nif you are an American with over $200,000 in income, you get an $11,200 \ncut in your tax bill. If you are an American who has an average income \nof less than $30,000, your tax cut under the House bill was a whole \n$124. In other words, if you are earning above $200,000, you can expect \nto get a check in the mail for $11,200. That is a pretty good gift.\n  These folks say this is for working families. Well, working families \nthat make over $200,000 a year get an $11,200 tax cut--at a time when \nwe have debt up to our neck trying to figure out how we try to deal \nwith this Federal deficit--and then the working families earning \n$30,000 or less get an $124 tax cut.\n  It is the old cake-and-crumbs approach. Give the cake to the very \nrich and the crumbs to the rest and say, ``Everybody benefits.''\n  We are told that broad capital gains tax cuts help everybody. That is \nkind of like saying, OK, you take 40,000 people and put them over in \nCamden Yards; fill every seat. And then say, ``I'm going to pass out \n$100 million to these folks.'' And you pass out $1 to 39,999 people and \nto the other person you give all the rest of the money. And then you go \noutside and crow that everybody in that place got some money. Yes, they \ndid--but one person got almost all of it and all the rest of them got \njust a little. So you can make the claim that everybody benefits, but \nthe fact is one person got most of the benefits.\n  So that is the circumstance of the tax cut. At a time when we should \nbe dealing with the deficit honestly, we have people taking polls and \ncutting taxes that promote enormously beneficial gifts to the very \nwealthy in this country.\n  Has the Senator had a chance to take a look at what happened last \nevening and what I think is essentially gifting to the wealthiest \nAmericans in this generous tax cut proposed by the majority party in \nthe House?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to respond to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I did not want to see that headline this morning, but I did. And I \ndid have a chance to take a look at it.\n  Let me say, first of all, to the Senator from North Dakota that long \nbefore I had the honor of being elected to this body, I admired the \nSenator from North Dakota when he was in the other body as one of the \ntrue leaders in the Congress on the issue of tax reform and tax \nfairness. He knows this stuff.\n  And so when he speaks about what this is all about, and what the tax \ncut for all Americans supposedly, but especially for wealthy Americans, \nis all about, he knows exactly what he is talking about. He was a key \nforce for the positive aspects of the 1986 tax reform, parts of which I \nthink are at least an example of when Washington got some things right. \nSo I think his comment is very appropriate.\n  What I want to say in response, since I know the Senator wants to \nspeak at more length about the tax cut, is that there is a common \nthread between the various parts of the contract. There is a connection \nbetween the fact that the gift ban is not mentioned in the contract and \ncampaign finance is not mentioned in the contract, but the tax cuts are \nthere for the wealthy, the so-called regulatory reform is included for \nthe very interests that probably still do need some regulation. The \ncommon thread is this:\n  If you have a lot of resources and you have a lot of lobbyists here \nin Washington, you are not going to get nicked by the Republican \ncontract. You just are not. If you are on welfare, you are going to get \nnicked. If you have a lunch coming to you at school, you are going to \nget nicked. But if you have any kind of serious interest supporting you \non this Republican contract, you are not going to get nicked.\n  It is worse than that. This giant $190 billion piece of legislation \nthat the House passed makes a complete farce out of the notion that the \ncontract has anything to do with deficit reduction. Everyone knows it.\n  I have to say to the Senator from North Dakota and the Chair, I was \nthe first Member of Congress--I am proud of this--of 535 Members of \nCongress, I was the first one to say ``No tax cuts.'' I said it the day \nafter the November 8 election and I said it the day after the President \nproposed his tax cut. The Los Angeles Times said there was one lone \nvoice that thinks this should not happen.\n  It is not nice to say, ``I told you so.'' I do not get to say it very \noften. On this one, it feels good to say it; that the people of this \ncountry know better than the people in this town and the people in this \ntown are beginning to wake up, especially in the Senate, that it is a \ntotal fraud on the American people to say you are for balancing the \nbudget and then start handing out $200 billion or $700 billion in tax \ncuts, tax gifts. The sad thing is, it is the repeating gift after gift \nafter gift after gift to the same people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Congress in 1986 changed the tax law. And maybe it \ndid not do such a great job. But it really tried to eliminate all the \nartificial things in the tax laws that promoted artificial investments \nand tried to let the marketplace make the decisions about where the \ninvestments would go.\n  Prior to that time, we had a circumstance in this country where you \ncould pick out some of the biggest names in American corporate life and \nfind out that they made billions of dollars in profits, and what did \nthey pay in taxes? Zero. Nothing.\n  So in 1986, we put in place an alternative minimum tax that worked, \nand we said, ``You can't make billions of dollars in profits and end up \npaying nothing.'' The folks who work for a living pay taxes. They \ncannot get by without paying taxes. So we constructed an alternative \nminimum tax that worked.\n  The legislation they passed last night in the House of \nRepresentatives says, ``Let's get rid of the alternative minimum tax \nfor corporations''--with 2,000 corporations benefiting to the tune of \nwashing away $4 billion in revenue annually. The way I calculate it, \nthat is about a $2 million a corporation every year. Talk about gifts? \nThere is a gift. I bet there was not much debate about that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may respond briefly, I am very glad \nthe Senator mentioned some of the specifics of the 1986 bill, because \nas he was speaking, I realized, in 1986, we had a Republican President \nand, I believe, we still had a majority of Republicans in the Senate. \nAlthough that bill had flaws, there were changes in accelerated \ndepreciation, and limits to the practice of using tax loss farming, \nwhich was something of great concern to farmers in Wisconsin. There \nwere limits on some of the most visible aspects of tax deductions that \nseemed to be unfair.\n  What is ironic, Mr. President, is that here we have now, again, the \nmajority of the Republican Party in the U.S. Senate--as well as the \nother body--and they are doing just the reverse.\n  There was a book written about the success of the 1986 bill called \n``Showdown at Gucci Gulch.'' Gucci Gulch, of course, is where all the \nlobbyists were with their Gucci shoes, and it was a Republican, the \nSenator from Oregon, who I believe chaired that famous meeting. Tax \nloopholes were limited. Here we are, again, many years later with just \nthe reverse happening: The restoration of some of these special deals \nat a time when the deficit is far worse than it was in 1986.\n  So let me simply conclude, Mr. President, by saying what I have told \nmy constituents back home regrettably. They say, ``How is it going out \nthere in Washington? How is the Republican contract working out? Are \nyou cleaning things up?'' And I have to tell them the truth, and the \ntruth is that the lobbyists in Washington have never had bigger smiles \non their faces than they do now. This is the happiest time for \nlobbyists in America in many, many years, because they are running the \nshow.\n  And as a final example, there was a rather disturbing occurrence in \nfront of the Senate Judiciary Committee recently where our staff \nmembers were told to come to a staff briefing by the Republican \nmajority staff on the regulatory reform bill.\n  As I understand it, although I have not been here for very long, it \nis normal practice for majority staff folks to brief the minority staff \non what is going to be proposed by the Chair. But \n[[Page S5296]] they were not briefed really by the majority staff. They \nwere briefed by a couple of attorneys. And when they were asked who \nthey were they said, ``We're the folks who represent 12 to 15 \ncorporations that basically wrote this thing.'' Apparently, several \ntimes, when questions were asked about details of the document, the \nRepublican majority staff was even overruled by these attorneys, \nlobbyists from downtown Washington.\n  I think that is another symbol, another link in the chain of special \ninfluence that I am afraid has infected this town more this year than \nat any time in recent history.\n  So, Mr. President it is time to pass the gift ban. It is time to \nclean that up on the bipartisan basis that I thought we were going to \ndo last time with an overwhelming 93-to-4 vote.\n  I am very delighted to yield in order to allow further discussion of \nwhat I consider to be an even more important issue: The need to let the \nSenate do its job by getting rid of this foolish tax cut at a time when \nall available dollars have to be devoted to eliminating the Federal \ndeficit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the presentation of my \ncolleague from Wisconsin. I note the Senator from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, is on the floor, I think intending to speak a bit about the \ntax-cut bill that was passed by the House of Representatives last \nevening.\n  Might I ask about the order of the Senate. Are we in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the Senate is on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. As the Senator will note from the remarks that we \nhave heard before the Senate, it would be in order to ask unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5293-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5296-S5297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IT MAY BE POPULAR, BUT IT IS NOT RIGHT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not take a great amount of time \nbecause I made some points here already. I did want to come and speak \nbriefly about the action last evening with respect to one portion of \nthe Contract With America in the House of Representatives.\n  As almost everyone understands, the Contract With America is a \ndocument that resulted from substantial polling of focus groups that \nthe Republican Party did all across this country. They were polling to \ntry to understand what is popular, what do people want, what do people \nthink we should do, how will they react positively to words and phrases \nand ideas, and they put that together in a contract.\n  It is not surprising to me that one would discover the answer to a \nquestion, ``Would you like lower taxes,'' that the answer ``yes'' would \nbe the popular answer. ``Yes, of course, we'd like to have lower taxes. \nWe'd like to have a tax cut.'' I understand that. I understand any poll \nin this country would achieve that result.\n  But there are times when we have to choose between what is right and \nwhat is popular. Although I think it may be popular for them to be \ntalking about tax cuts, I am convinced it is right only for us to talk \nabout how to get this country's fiscal policy under some control. We \nare up to our neck in debt. We are choking on fiscal policy debt, \nbudget debt and trade debt, and we must straighten it out.\n  Not more than a month or two ago, we had people on the floor of this \nSenate trying to change the U.S. Constitution in order to require a \nbalanced budget. Among those who bellowed the loudest about changing \nthe U.S. Constitution are some of the same ones who now say what we \nwant to do is not balance the budget, we want to cut taxes. This is a \nstew that we have tasted before. This recipe was concocted in 1981, and \nit resulted not in a balanced budget, as was promised by 1984. In fact \nit resulted in staggering massive public debt over the last decade and \na half. Mr. President, nearly $4 trillion ago in debt we learned the \nlessons of this dilemma.\n  Our job is very simple. It is to aggressively cut spending and to use \nthe money to cut the Federal deficit. And even to start paying down on \nthe national debt and then turn our attention to finding out how we can \nchange the tax system; yes, then to give some relief, but especially to \ngive relief to middle-income working families who had to bear the \nburden of this Tax Code over all these years.\n  But to decide now at a time when we have this staggering debt, to \ndecide now that what we need to do is the popular thing to simply \npropose a tax cut of $200 billion or in the next 10 years nearly three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars loss of revenue is preposterous. It may \nbe popular, but it is not right.\n  I had not spoken about the specifics of the tax cut yesterday because \nit will not surprise anybody to learn the specifics. It is the same old \nRepublican philosophy: Call it a tax cut for the rest, and give a big \ntax cut to the rich. Call it a tax cut for families, and give a big tax \ncut to rich families.\n  Class warfare? No, it is not class warfare to talk about that. It is \ntalking about who gets what check in the mail as a result of these tax \nreductions.\n  If you are a family that has over $200,000 in income, the bill that \npassed last evening in the House of Representatives is going to give \nyou an $11,200 a year average tax cut. If you are a family with less \nthan $30,000 in income, you are going to get all of $124 and, in fact, \na whole lot of folks are going to get nothing. If you make $15,000 a \nyear and have three kids, that child tax credit means nothing to you. \nZero. There is no $500 a child. You get zero.\n  The fact is, this tax bill is the same old thing from the same old \nboys that have always proposed this kind of remedy: It gives a very \nlarge tax cut to the very, very wealthy and gives a few crumbs to the \nrest.\n  Why? They believe if we pour in a lot of money at the top that \nsomehow the magnificence of the top will spend this in a way that will \nhelp the rest.\n  I happen to think that the American economic engine runs and works \nbest when we give working families something to work with. If we give a \ntax cut--and I do not think we ought to until we have solved the \ndeficit problem in this country--we ought to provide real tax relief to \nreal working families.\n  It is interesting to me as I have said, that the very same people who \nhave fought the hardest to change the Constitution because they say we \nmust balance the Federal budget are the first ones out of the chute who \nsay now that we have had this debate about politics and polls over the \nConstitution, we will have another debate about politics and polls \nabout our favorite subject: Cutting taxes, or cutting tax now, which we \nknow exacerbates the deficit.\n  It does not reduce the Federal budget deficit, but expands and \nexplodes the Federal budget deficit. Only those who do not care about \nthis country's deficit could be proposing something that irresponsible \nat this point in this country's history.\n  Yes, I said I know it might be popular but it is not right. We all \nought to put our shoulder to the wheel and do what is right. We know \nwhat is right--cut spending and use the money to cut the deficit.\n  Those who are off trying to suggest we should give tax cuts to the \nrich when we are choking on Federal debt in this country do no service \nto this country or its future or its children.\n  We are seeing a bill come out of the House of Representatives that \nhas the same old proposals. I mentioned to the Senator from Wisconsin a \nproposal to eliminate the alternative minimum tax. I could bring names \nof companies--I will not, but I could bring names of companies to the \nfloor--that every single American would recognize immediately, \ncompanies that made $1 billion, $500 million, $3 billion, $6 billion, \nand paid zero in Federal income taxes. Paid less money in Federal \nincome taxes than some person out there working for $14,000 a year, \nstruggling, working 10 hours a day, working hard all year, and they end \nup paying a tax.\n  An enterprise making $6 billion over a few years ends up paying zero. \nSo we change that and said, ``You cannot end up paying zero any more. \nYou have to pay an alternative minimum tax at the very least.''\n   [[Page S5297]] It is called fairness. What did the House of \nRepresentatives do? They passed a bill that says we do not care about \nfairness. We will abolish alternative minimum tax and go back to the \ngood old days of zero tax obligation for some of the biggest special \ninterests in this country.\n  At the same time, they are saying, ``Let's give away the store in \nthose circumstances,'' and just that provision--the one provision on \nthe alternative minimum tax--gives away $4 billion to 2,000 companies. \nMr. President, $4 billion washed away to 2,000 companies. That is $2 \nmillion a company.\n  I do not know how that is justifiable in the circumstances of the \nfiscal policy problems and deficit dilemma problem we have in our \ncountry. How is it justifiable? How will the proponents justify coming \nto the floor of the Senate and saying, ``We don't have enough money \nanymore to provide an entitlement to a school hot lunch to a poor kid. \nWe will eliminate the entitlement status to a hot school lunch,'' \nbecause we frankly cannot afford it.\n  But we can afford to give somebody with a $400,000 or $200,000 annual \nincome a check for $11,200 a year and say, ``Partner you are lucky. \nHere is a big tax break for you.''\n  We are running this big deficit and we have to cut back on dozens of \nprograms dealing with issues of nutrition, issues of child abuse on \nIndian reservations, just name it, cutting back all of them, because we \ncannot afford it.\n  They say, ``But we can afford to hand over a very large tax refund to \nsome of the biggest economic special interests in this country.''\n  I know when I finish speaking, and when the Senator from Arkansas \nfinishes speaking, there will be people who say, ``Well, it is the same \nold complaint: Class warfare.'' You should not stand up and talk about \nwho actually gets the benefit. Because if we talk about who gets the \nbenefit, and you describe someone with $200,000 income getting an \n$11,200 check, and someone with $30,000 income getting $124, somehow \nyou are being unfair.\n  It is unfair to point that out to the American people. That is not \nclass warfare. That is a discussion of what is real about the proposals \nto change our revenue system.\n  I will support substantial changes in our whole revenue base when we \nare through this process of honestly trying to get this budget deficit \nunder control.\n  Frankly, our revenue system does not work as well as it should. Our \nrevenue system ought to be changed in a wholesale way to encourage \nsavings. Our revenue system ought to be changed in a substantial way to \ntax more consumption than we tax and to encourage savings.\n  We ought not keep taxing work every chance we get. We hang every \nsocial good on a payroll tax. Frankly, our payroll taxes are too heavy. \nI bow to no one to my interest and desire to try and change our tax \nsystem. I do not believe it is right at this time, given the problems \nour country faces, to propose as a matter of public policy, very large \ntax cuts to very big special economic interests, and then come to the \nfloor of the Senate and the House and crow about how Members want to \nchange the Constitution to eliminate the Federal budget deficit.\n  Anybody who wants to eliminate the Federal budget deficit can do it \nhonestly. The honest way is to aggressively reduce Federal spending in \nareas where we ought to reduce Federal spending, and continue to make \ninvestments where we ought to make investments, especially in the lives \nof children and then use the savings from reducing Federal spending to \nreduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  When we have set this country on a course in a constructive path to \nsolve that problem, we ought to turn to the Tax Code. When we turn to \nthe Tax Code, we should not have middle-income families turn out to be \nthe losers.\n  Every single time somebody monkeys with the Tax Code, especially the \nmajority party, somehow middle-income families end up getting less or \nend up paying the bill to provide tax cuts and big tax rebates and big \ngenerous refunds to the wealthiest Americans.\n  We ought to have learned in the last 50 years what works and what \ndoes not work. What works is to give working families something to work \nwith. The biggest advantage we can provide working families in this \ncountry today is to reduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  We do that by cutting spending and using the savings to reduce the \ndeficit. When we finish that job, then I think we can turn to the Tax \nCode. And I think we will do a substantially different job than was \ndone over in the House of Representatives for fair tax cuts, for a fair \ntax system, for those people in this country who work hard and who have \nborne the cost of Government for far too many years.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this subject along with \nsome charts tomorrow. I notice my friend from Arkansas, a man noted for \ncharts, has brought charts to the floor, so I am anxious to hear what \nhe has to say. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed for up to 10 minutes as in morning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5296-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5297-S5298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TAX FAIRNESS\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I cannot add or detract from what the \nSenator from North Dakota has just eloquently said.\n  I do have some charts that perhaps are a little more graphic, but I \nalso want to say that one of the things that my wealthier friends not \nonly back home but across the country say to me is, ``The thing I do \nnot like about Democrats is they promote class warfare.''\n  The Senator from North Dakota alluded to that. I do not believe in \nclass warfare. I believe in fairness, justice, and the judicial system, \nas well as in our economy.\n  What happened in the House last evening is one of the most bizarre \nthings I have witnessed in my 20 years in the U.S. Senate. A tax cut--a \ntax cut--of about $180 billion over the next 5 years but which balloons \nto about $600 to $700 billion for the 10-year period.\n  In other words, $180 billion for the first 5 years, and between $400 \nand $500 billion for the next 5 years.\n  They say they will identify cuts to pay for it. We see in the House \nthey can do that because they only have to project 5 years out. Our \nbudget in the Senate requires the Senate to come up with a 10-year \nprojection.\n  To get on with the story, I do not like class warfare but how do we \nsay to the American people that the tax bill that passed last evening \nprovides a tax cut for people who make over $200,000 a year, provides \nthem a tax cut of $11,266--and that is per year--and provides an \naverage for those who make zero to $30,000 a year, gives them $124 a \nyear.\n  Mr. President, for the people who make less than $30,000 a year, the \ntax cut last night will not even buy a 13-inch pizza for the family to \nenjoy on Friday nights. Are we engaging in class warfare to bring up \nthis fact? Is it class warfare to point out the unbelievable unfairness \nof this situation? I ask the American people and my colleagues, if you \nare going to provide a tax cut, how do you say to the American people \nthat those who make over $200,000 a year are going to get a $11,000 tax \ncut and people who make $30,000 or less get a $124 tax cut? Class \nwarfare? It is utterly the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.\n  Who do you think needs the tax cut most, the guy making $200,000 a \nyear or the guy with a wife and two kids making $30,000 a year?\n  Let's discuss the capital gains part of the tax bill. Capital gains \noccur when you buy and sell stocks or other property. I agree with \nFelix Rohatyn, who I watched on CNBC yesterday, who said, ``I have \nnever understood what economic benefit this country derives when \nsomebody sells General Electric and uses the money and buys DuPont \nstock.'' What does that do for the economy, except fatten some broker's \nfees?\n  But look at this chart showing who benefits from the capital gains \ntax cut. Who benefits from it? You guessed it. Those who make $100,000 \na year or more are going to get 76 percent of the benefit of this \ncapital gains tax cut. What does this poor stiff get who makes only \n$30,000 a year? Only 6.4 percent of the capital gains tax cut. Class \n[[Page S5298]] warfare? Who believes that is fair, Mr. President? Who \nbelieves that the people making $100,000 a year or more--which includes \nevery single Member of Congress--who believes we ought to be getting 76 \npercent of this tax cut. How can I believe that this is fair while the \npeople of my State--where the median family income is less than $30,000 \na year--will get only 6.4 percent of the cut?\n  Mr. President, here is a USA Today poll. It points out what I have \nbeen saying for months around here. I never lost a friend voting for a \ntax cut. It is so wonderful to be able to vote for a tax cut and go \nback home and say, ``Look what we did,'' and beat our chests. I get \nletters from people who want their taxes cut. But I get more letters \nfrom people who want the deficit reduced. People who are making $30,000 \na year or less would gladly give up that $124 tax cut in return for a \nbalanced budget. Do you know why? Because if we balance the budget, it \nwill hold down inflation and interest rates. Mortgage interest will be \nless, interest on car loans will be less, the economy will be more \nstable, the dollar will stabilize. Why in the name of God are we \nconsidering this tax cut when polls like this one indicate that 70 \npercent of the people in this country say they want the deficit reduced \nbefore they want a tax cut? Only 24 percent of the people in this poll \nsaid, ``I want the tax cut over deficit reduction.''\n  Do you know who the House agreed with when they passed the tax cut \nlast night? Not with the 70 percent of the people who say, ``Deficit \nreduction first.'' And, actually, not with the 24 percent of people who \nsay they want a tax cut more than they want deficit reduction. No, the \nHouse agreed with this 5 percent of people who say, ``We want both.'' \nThat is what the House is saying. ``We are going to cut your taxes and \nbalance the budget, too.'' Think about it--5 percent of the people in \nthis country saying we want both--and that is where the House comes \ndown.\n  We tried that $3.5 trillion ago in 1981. Here is a graph that shows \npointedly and precisely what happened. In 1981--and I remember it \nwell--Ronald Reagan's press conference, after Congress passed his tax \ncut plan. He said, ``You have given me the tools. Now I will do the \njob. We will balance the budget by 1984 and with a little luck we will \nbalance it in 1983.'' Those were Ronald Reagan's words.\n  Well, it did not happen. Instead the deficit shot up to record \nlevels. I want it put on my epitaph that I was 1 of the 11 U.S. \nSenators who voted against those 1981 tax cuts. I said, ``You will \ncreate deficits big enough to choke a mule.'' They turned out to be big \nenough to choke an elephant.\n  Look at this chart. Here was our deficit in 1981 and here is how the \nReagan administration said they would reduce the deficit. That was the \npromise. That was the siren song that an irresponsible Congress bought \ninto.\n  But what happened? The deficit did not go down as promised. Look \nwhere it went. By the time we were supposed to have a balanced budget \nin 1983, we had $200 billion deficits and we have never had one less \nthan that since.\n  Ironically, I can remember the last year Jimmy Carter was President, \nthe deficit was $65 billion and people were threatening to impeach him. \nUnthinkable.\n  No, Mr. President, I am not voting for a tax cut. I am going to vote \nthe way 70 percent of the people of this country want me to vote. When \nit comes to fairness, the tax cut, even if desirable, is hopelessly \ninequitable and unfair. The greatness of this Nation, the greatness of \nthe Constitution, is it says each one of us counts. We are all \nsomebody.\n  Whether you like Jesse Jackson or not, I always like it when he has \nthose kids say, ``I am somebody.'' The soul of America is that each one \nof us counts. And no one of us should count for $12,000 or $11,000 a \nyear more than the people who did not happen to be born quite so \nwealthy.\n  This chart shows where the deficit has been going since Bill Clinton \nbecame President. There it is in 1995. Here are his projections for the \noutyears and here is the projection the American people want. They want \nthat deficit to continue going down. They do not expect miracles, but \nthey do expect a responsible, thoughtful Congress to give this Nation a \nchance. Give our children a chance. You are not ever going to achieve \nthe greatness of this Nation by cutting student loans, or AmeriCorps, \nwhere people can pay off their student loans.\n  When the families of America sit around the dinner table in the \nevening and talk about what they love most, it is not the tax cut. It \nis not that Mercedes out in the driveway. It is not that nice big \nsplit-level home. It is not the farm out back or that posh office \ndowntown. What they talk about most is loving their children. In light \nof that, what do you think the ordinary American person with a family \nbelieves--that he or she should get a few dollars more in spendable \nincome or that this Nation ought to start living within its means so \nthat those children have a real opportunity, not a saran-wrapped \nopportunity, but a real one.\n  I come down on the side of all of those American families. My \nchildren are all grown. I have two grandchildren. They deserve better \nthan they are going to get if we do not reverse our overspending ways; \nif we do not show the kind of responsibility they have a right to \nexpect of us.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate will show a great deal more \ndiscretion in dealing with this, and if we do not, if we do not, the \nchart you saw a moment ago of what happened from 1980 to 1995 will just \nbe compounded.\n  Mr. President, I have taken more time than I really intended to take. \nI feel very strongly about it and will speak again on the subject and \nagain and again. My side may lose just as 11 of us lost in 1981. But I \nam absolutely certain without intending to be arrogant or self-serving \nthat it will be one of the greatest travesties ever to befall this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5297-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5298-S5300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we had hoped that we might have an agreement \nreached on the rescissions bill. But apparently that will not be \npossible. So there will be a cloture vote at 2 o'clock. We will file \ncloture again today for a vote on Saturday because we intend to finish \nthis bill before we leave for the Easter recess; spring recess.\n  I would hope that our colleagues on the other side would understand \nthat we, this Senator and the Democratic leader, worked in good faith \nmost of yesterday into the evening until 9 or 10 o'clock. So did other \nMembers on our side of the aisle, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nboth Senators from Arizona. And we believe we gave up a great deal to \nget an agreement. I thought there was an agreement until I read it in \nthe morning paper.\n  So I was surprised when I later learned that our colleagues on the \nother side did not agree to the agreement we thought we had agreed to.\n  Having said that, I hope we can invoke cloture. If we do that, a lot \nof these amendments will disappear. I do not know how we can deal with \n100-and-some amendments that are out there. But if cloture is obtained, \nthat will shorten the process a great deal.\n  I do not know where the hot buttons are on the other side. I maybe \nknow of one or two of them. But it seems to me many of the so-called \n``cuts'' were in effect funny money and many of the add-ons are not \ngoing to be spent either. But if both sides felt they had a good \nposition, I fail to understand what may have derailed the whole \nprocess.\n  But there will be a cloture vote at 2 o'clock. The second-degree \namendments must have been filed by 1 o'clock. So it is too late to file \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  It is still my hope that Senator Daschle and I can bring everybody \ntogether here. I think we are pretty much together on this side. What \nwe want is an agreement with no amendments. We do not want an agreement \nand then have everybody say we have 10 amendments here and 10 \namendments there. If you have an agreement, you have an agreement. \nRight now we do not have an agreement.\n  So I just urge my colleagues to be patient, to take two aspirins, \ntake a nap, whatever. If we finish this today, we \n[[Page S5299]] will finish some conference reports, and hopefully we \nwill be in session tomorrow but no votes. If we do not finish today, we \nwill be in session tomorrow with votes and we will be in session on \nSaturday with votes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Certainly. I yield.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The announced consent agreement has not been propounded \nyet has it?\n  Mr. DOLE. Only with respect to the adoption of the Jordan amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How many amendments do you anticipate would be allowed \nunder an agreement?\n  Mr. DOLE. We thought we had narrowed it down to about four on each \nside. We thought some of those were acceptable. Some who had problems \nwith the CPB, said, ``Well, give us $20 million somewhere else in \nspending restraints.'' So they have to be ``this or nothing.''\n  I think, as has been the attitude certainly of the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, as we both know, it can still come together, and I \nhope it would because we could finish late afternoon and that would be \nprobably the last vote until we come back from recess.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am incredibly disappointed at the outcome of this \nnegotiation. I had hoped that the good-faith effort of the majority \nleader who stayed here late last night and worked on this bill late, \nand diligently, and I think more than bent over backward to accommodate \nleadership on the Democratic side to help them restore some of the \nmoney that they felt was so desperately needed for programs that they \nhave long fostered and supported in this institution.\n  We have been working with the majority leader, several members of the \nfreshmen class, Senator Kyl from Arizona, Senator Ashcroft from \nMissouri, Senator McCain from Arizona, and myself have been working to \ntry to craft an amendment that recognizes the concerns of the minority \nand at the same time preserve some of the objections that we had to the \nbill. Frankly, we thought we were pretty generous.\n  The minority leader came in and asked in the original amendment, the \namendment that was pending, for almost $1.3 billion in more spending, \nmore spending on almost all social programs; just more social program \nspending. These were not, just so you understand, the bill that came to \nthe floor of the House--the Hatfield substitute was not--had increases \nin these programs. Every one of these programs that the minority leader \nasked for already had an increase from last year. They already had an \nincrease, and in many cases huge amounts of increases. But they cut \nback a little bit on the rate of the increase with the Hatfield \nsubstitute.\n  The Democratic leader did not like that. So he jacked it back up. OK. \nWe said, fine. You want to jack up some programs and put them back to \nthe level that they were before, which was a dramatic increase over \nwhere we were last year, you think those are the most important, we \nunderstand the sensitivity you have, we are willing to work on that.\n  As Senator Dole, and other freshmen, came forward with an amendment, \nwe said we believe we should offset these expenditures not with money \nfrom a year or two down the road--which is what the minority leader, \nthe Democratic leader--they pulled back money out that was funny money \nfrom years down the road. You want to spend money this year, let us \ntake money out this year. That is the way we should do things around \nhere, not spend more money this year and find funny money down the road \nto pay for it.\n We have been doing that a long time around here. Let us get serious.\n\n  And so we got serious. We made a serious compromise. And we thought \nwe had a serious compromise agreement that would have accomplished \nthree major things. No. 1, it would have given the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, and folks on his side almost all of what they wanted \nin this increase in social spending--almost. Instead of $1.3 billion, \nwe give $800 million in more spending--$800 million in more spending on \nmany programs that are not exactly well received on this side of the \naisle, like the AmeriCorps Program. We gave them an increase in the \nAmeriCorps Program from what the Appropriations Committee had \nsuggested. We allowed an increase of $100 million in a program that in \nour amendment we wanted to cut by $200 million.\n  So from where we started, we gave them a $300 million increase. That \nwas not good enough. We gave them all the money they wanted in WIC, \nschool-to-work, child care, Head Start, $60 million of the $67 million \nthey wanted for Goals 2000, title I, impact aid, safe and drug-free \nschools, Indian housing, housing modernization, community development \nbanks--every social program, all the way down, they got almost all of \nwhat they wanted. We took some of their cuts. Some of the things they \nused in the original Daschle amendment to pay for this bill we \naccepted, we accepted as ways to pay for this.\n  And we said, OK, in exchange for not getting all that you wanted, we \nwill not take all that we wanted. We will get rid of a lot of the \nproposed reductions that we wanted. And we put on the table some pretty \nminor things, folks--reducing the foreign operations, foreign aid by \n$25 million--$25 million; libraries by $10 million--and by the way, the \nlibraries money was the President's rescission; that is the President's \nsuggestion to us to take this money out, said it was not needed--\nFederal administrative travel, something that they agreed to, that they \nsuggested we increase, we increased to a cut of $225 million. By the \nway, that is out of a $107 billion budget we are taking out $225 \nmillion for Federal travel, hardly something that the public is \nconcerned about, that we are not traveling enough around here; water \ninfrastructure; and, oh, the sticking point. We took out of their \nsacred little cow $21 million of $312 million. We took $21 million out \nof the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  In the end, we would have had savings of $1.6 billion. They had \nadditional spending of $800 million which would get us a net deficit \nreduction out of this amendment of $800 million. So we both win. They \nget $800 million more spending, we get $800 million in deficit \nreduction, so everybody sort of stands even.\n  I always thought that is what compromises were all about. And so I am \nhopeful that in the next 45 minutes, the other members of the \nDemocratic caucus who seem to be holding up this compromise take a look \nat this and realize it is in the best interests of this body and this \nCongress and this country to move forward with this compromise piece of \nlegislation and get this enacted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a paper entitled \n``Possible Compromise'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                          Possible Compromise\n\n                         [Dollars in millions]\n\n                                                                   Cost\nAdd-Backs:\n  Women, Infants, Children........................................$35.0\n  School to Work...................................................25.0\n  Child Care........................................................8.4\n  Head Start.......................................................42.0\n  Goals: 2000......................................................60.0\n  Title I Education................................................72.5\n  Impact Aid.......................................................16.3\n  Safe and Drug-free Schools......................................100.0\n  Indian Housing...................................................80.0\n  Housing Modernization...........................................220.0\n  Americorps......................................................105.0\n  Community Development Banks......................................36.0\n                                                               ________\n\n      Total.......................................................800.2\n                                                               ========\n\n                                                                Savings\nOffset:\n  Foreign Operations..............................................$25.0\n  HUD Section 8 Project Reserves..................................500.0\n  Airport Improvement.............................................700.0\n  Libraries........................................................10.0\n  Federal Admin. and Travel.......................................225.0\n  Water Infrastructure.............................................62.0\n  IRS..............................................................50.0\n  Corp. for Public Broadcasting.................................\\1\\21.6\n                                                               ________\n\n      Total......................................................1597.0\nDeficit Reduction.................................................796.8\nAddendum: Items in Dole amendment used in Defense Conference:\n    Foreign Ops...................................................$40.0\n    Legal services.................................................15.0\n\n\\1\\$3.4 million in 1997.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, today I want to discuss a Bureau of \nJustice Statistics special report that is supposed to be released in \nthe very near future. I am very disturbed about what I consider to be \nthe political manipulation of a Government report.\n  This draft report concerns tort cases in State courts. One of the so-\ncalled findings of what is, undoubtedly, a flawed report, is that tort \ncase filings have remained steady and that there is no tort litigation \nexplosion.\n  I believe this document by the Bureau of Justice Statistics was \nclearly prepared for political reasons. This is underscored by the fact \nthat the study conveniently omits any study of the cost of torts; it \nomits all Federal liability suits; and it is a scientifically flawed \ntelephone-based survey on only a fraction of the counties in the United \nStates. In addition, the report does not even address many of the \nimportant issues regarding tort reform.\n  Included in this report are some of the results from a study of tort \ncases in State courts. The study claims that the basis of this report \nis a representative sampling of the courts in which half of all tort \ncases nationwide are adjudicated. I disagree with that, Mr. President.\n  First of all, the report only involves 16 States and a total of 75 \ncounties out of our more than 3,000 counties, but there is nothing \nscientific about their selection. They are simply the 75 most populous \ncounties, and even if they were selected randomly, the results would \nnot have been much better. Filings are not random occurrences; the \nnumber of filings in any set of counties cannot possibly represent \nanything but the counties that are being surveyed.\n  Worse, this study does not even involve the use of the most \nrudimentary sampling techniques. It relies on only the 75 largest \ncounties and further stratified them so that only samples of the data \nin some of the counties were used.\n  After reading over this study, you will find that there is a lack of \nrational sampling methodology in selecting which counties would be \nused. There is absolutely no evidence contained in this Bureau of \nJustice Statistics special report that the counties selected are in any \nway representative of the entire United States.\n  However, once the counties were selected, only a few of those were \nused to select various kinds of data. The counties were divided into \nfour strata, although it is not clear how the strata were defined. In \nthe first strata, all 14 counties were selected for the first stage of \nthe study; in the second strata, only 12 of 15; in the third, only 10 \nof 20; and in the fourth, only 9 of 26. In the second phase, the study \nrelied on interval or random samples. It seems unusual to use more than \none sampling method as they have here.\n  In this study, it reads:\n\n       Contrary to the belief that there has been an explosion of \n     tort litigation, tort case filings have remained stable since \n     1986 according to multi-State data.\n\n  Now, there is no rational way to identify whether there has been an \nexplosion in tort filings or not from this study, since the data is \nlimited to 1990 for the first phase of the study and for a 1-year \nperiod from mid-1991 to mid-1992. It should also be pointed out that \nthe study was based on phone interviews in only 45 of the 75 largest \ncounties.\n  Now, to determine whether there was an explosion in tort filings, it \nseems to me that you would need to start with data at least as far back \nas 1970, or maybe as late as 1980, and run a longitudinal analysis to \nsee what happened. The study simply declares out of thin air that \n``multi-State data'' since 1986 proves that there has not been any such \nexplosion. Another concern I had was the fact that no financial data of \nany kind was shown anywhere in the report. Let me stress that again. In \nthis whole study of tort liability explosion, there is no financial \ndata of any kind involved in the report.\n  This means that there is no way to identify the most important of all \nindicators. The report simply omits any discussion of whether the size \nof tort awards had changed over the years.\n  Because there are no financial data, there is no way to see if venue \nshopping is real or not. For example, we know that awards in certain \ncounties in Texas are extreme. However, you would not know that from \nthis report.\n  The report also conveniently fails to provide any information on the \neffect of large tort awards on settlements. In other words, one could \nask, are settlements made more often now without regard to the merits \nof the case because of the threat of an expensive suit? This study does \nnot answer that question, and it does not do it, of course, because it \nalso conveniently failed to include any data on award amounts.\n  Lastly, this report does not limit itself to the torts with which we \nare most concerned, those that affect products, like product liability, \nthose that affect premises liability and medical malpractice. It does \nnot include any of those. Instead, it includes auto torts, which make \nup more than 60 percent of all tort cases considered. This seems to \nmake every other tort look minor, even though auto torts are very \ncommon. Generally, they are very quickly settled and, generally, they \ninvolve only one or two parties and relatively small amounts of money. \nBy adding auto torts, the average time for the disposition of all torts \nfalls to about 19 months, whereas the auto torts average less than 17 \nmonths.\n  Yet, all other torts average more like 2 years, involve more parties \nand they involve much larger amounts of money.\n  These are just a few of the criticisms that can be leveled at this \nflawed and ill-conceived report. But the more telling criticism has to \ndo with the timing of its release. I am concerned about the possible \npolitical manipulation behind the report. We all know that President \nClinton, and one of the most powerful special-interest supporters, the \nTrial Lawyers Association, opposes tort reform. Apparently, the \noriginal plan was to have the report out before the House considered \ntort reform. The goal now seems to be to release it before the Senate \ntakes up tort reform. The Bureau of Justice Statistics claims the study \nhas been in the system for several years. If this is so and they, \nindeed, had several years to compile this study, why is it so limited \nand so conveniently timed?\n  I strongly believe that this document by the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics was clearly prepared for political reasons. Once again, this \nis underscored by the fact that the study conveniently omits any study \nof the cost of tort, no study of the cost of torts. It omits all \nFederal liability suits and is a scientifically flawed telephone-based \nsurvey of only a fraction of the counties in the United States.\n  In addition, the report does not address the real issues, such as \nwhat effect do large awards have on settlements, and is there extensive \nvenue shopping for those counties which consistently make the most \noutrageous awards?\n  You could hypothesize about the answers to these questions. That is \nwhy \n[[Page S5301]] our civil justice system is in need of reform, and \nstudies like this, I think, cloud the issue. If this report comes out \nas written, the Justice Department should be embarrassed, the people in \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics should be ashamed that they allowed \nthemselves to be used for political purposes, and I hope the Justice \nDepartment will try to reestablish some credibility and integrity by \nrefusing to release this report or at least require it to meet minimum \nscientific standards.\n  I also hope and even challenge the media to look into this matter and \nshine some light on the political maneuvering that is going on over at \nthe Justice Department.\n  The Assistant Attorney General, or Associate Attorney General, Mr. \nSchmidt, will be briefed on this tomorrow. He has an opportunity to \nmake sure this study, if it is going to be used as a basis, is done in \na more scientific and intellectually honest way and, most importantly, \nit seems to me, since this study has been supposedly going on for a \nlong period of time, that we do not let it come out at just about this \ntime that the Senate is going to discuss the issue of tort reform.\n  There has to be the integrity of an agency, as the Justice \nDepartment, particularly under this Attorney General, seems to have a \ngreat deal of independence and integrity, to make sure that there is \nnot this sort of manipulation that is going to undercut the principal \napproach to running the Department that our Attorney General has \nassumed.\n  I hope that my speaking at this point will encourage another look-see \nat this report, and I hope that the report that I have seen will not be \nthe one that comes out. I think there are plenty of checks and balances \nwithin our system to see that it does not, and I hope those checks and \nbalances will work in this instance. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5300-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5301-S5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last night, the majority leader and I \nannounced that we had a tentative agreement with regard to the pending \nlegislation. We had hoped that as a result of our negotiations, which \nhave been conducted in good faith on both sides, it would lead, \nhopefully, to an opportunity to come to some closure in the not-too-\ndistant future on this important matter.\n  Unfortunately, as a result of differences on both sides of the aisle \nwith regard to the agreement, amendments are likely which would \nsignificantly alter the result of the negotiations that have been \nongoing.\n  As a result, the real prospect that the agreement could be \nsuccessfully concluded in debate on the floor this afternoon becomes \nincreasingly unlikely. I am disappointed because I feel it was an \neffort made on the part of many Senators--Republicans and Democrats--to \nbridge our differences to accomplish what we all want.\n  The amendment that I have had pending has now been pending for a \nweek. Unfortunately, we have not had the opportunity during these \nnegotiations to vote on it or on any other Democratic amendment. We \nhave been hopeful that over the course of the last several days, we \ncould have come to some conclusion about the agreement or about at \nleast a time limit relating to the amendments, and come to some \nconclusion this week in one way or the other. That now does not look \npossible.\n  But the fact is, because we have not been given an opportunity to \nhave votes on these amendments, we will come to the cloture vote this \nafternoon not having had one vote on one Democratic amendment. As a \nresult, I urge my colleagues to protect our right to offer these \namendments. I urge my colleagues to recall how important it is that the \namendments that we have offered over the course of the last couple of \nweeks dealing directly with the concerns that have been raised on this \nfloor now for more than 7 days, that we have the opportunity to have \ngood debates about those issues prior to the time we come to closure on \nthis vote.\n  As I have said on several occasions, we really have three goals here:\n  The first goal is to ensure the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration is adequately funded.\n  The second goal is to ensure that we provide the necessary deficit \nreduction that this rescissions package will allow, and we are now at a \npoint of $15 billion in the total deficit reduction package.\n  And the third goal was one that all of us on this side of the aisle \nfeel especially strongly about.\n  That is, if we are going to do it, we should do it right. If we are \ngoing to do it, we should ensure that we do not eat the seed corn. We \nshould ensure that as we remember our priorities, we remember our kids \nand working families who are struggling to ensure that they can be \nproductive citizens in this country.\n  Those are the three goals. Our whole effort, the amendment that we \nhave pending, is designed to accomplish those three goals. Without that \namendment, unfortunately, all we do is accomplish the first two goals. \nWe provide adequate funding for FEMA. We provide for necessary deficit \nreduction, but we do it at the expense of kids. We do it at the expense \nof people who are counting on these investments so they can be the \nproductive, working people that they want to be.\n  That is what this debate was about. So this cloture vote is very \nimportant. It is a cloture vote that will allow Members the opportunity \nto accomplish all three goals. Without defeating cloture we will not \nhave that protection.\n  I want to emphasize as loudly and as plainly as I possibly can, our \ndesire is not to hold up this bill. Our hope is that we do not have to \nhold up this bill. Our hope is that before we leave here, Democrats and \nRepublicans can come to time agreements on amendments. We will have up-\nor-down votes on the amendments that are proposed on this side and do \nso in a way that will allow Members to get our business accomplished.\n  We will finish, we will have final passage, and we can all go home \nsatisfied, however the votes may fall. We only hope we will be given \nthe opportunity to have up-or-down votes on these issues because that \nis critical to the degree of enthusiasm, the degree of support that we \nultimately will have for the bill itself.\n  I think it is very clear that for a lot of different reasons, we have \nnot been given a right today to offer those amendments, and it is \nequally as clear that, unless we block cloture this afternoon, we will \nnot have that right after 2 o'clock today.\n  So, Mr. President, I come to the floor to express regret. In good \nfaith we have not been able to accomplish what I sincerely had hoped we \ncould accomplish. Having said that, we now must accomplish what our \noriginal intent was, which was try to protect all three goals as we \nmove toward final passage of this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to weigh carefully their decision on this \ncloture motion. I hope that we can defeat it, not in the interest of \nextending debate, not in the interest of prolonging this issue any \nlonger than we have to, but in the interest of accomplishing the three \ngoals and protecting our rights to offer amendments and improve \nlegislation as these occasions arise.\n  So, Mr. President, to accommodate my colleagues who have amendments \nto the bill, it is important at this point, from a parliamentary \nprocedure motion only, to withdraw my amendment to allow others to \noffer the amendments that they will so offer. I will certainly come \nback at a later time and describe, as we intend to, the importance of \nthe amendments that will make in the composite what our amendment was \noriginally designed to do as it was laid down last Friday. We will do \nthat at a date or at a time later, perhaps today.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 445 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at this time I withdraw my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has that right. Amendment \nNo. 445 is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 445) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As a result, the second-degree amendment No. \n446, which was pending thereto, falls.\n   [[Page S5302]] Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, may I ask the Chair if we \nare in morning business at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 1158.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Pryor pertaining to the introduction of S. 687 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just rise to really express my great \ndisappointment that, after working for over a week, no agreement has \nbeen reached on this legislation. Now we will be going to a cloture \nvote at 2 o'clock. I certainly hope that cloture will be invoked. I \nremind my colleagues if that is done, we still will have lots of time \nto debate--30 hours, I believe. Germane amendments would still be in \norder. I think most of the key amendments that colleagues on that side \nof the aisle have been interested in would be germane.\n  But as it stands right now, I believe there are some 72 amendments on \none side pending and a number on the other side. We still have 100 \namendments at the desk. Many of them are obviously not germane and \nreally nobody ever intended for them to actually be voted on, I \nsuspect.\n  But after a week of negotiations, we basically came up emptyhanded. I \nknow there was a lot of good-faith effort. I thought a reasonable \nagreement had been worked out between the Daschle amendment and the \nDole amendment that was pending, with an understanding there would \nstill be a few amendments that would be offered on both sides--two, \nthree, four, five, whatever--but that we would find a way to bring it \nto conclusion.\n  Here we are Thursday afternoon. Presumably, we are going to go out \ntonight or tomorrow or Saturday or sometime for the Easter recess \nperiod. I just have to raise this specter. Are we now going to just let \nthis die off, go off into the night with no results? No Department of \nDefense supplemental appropriations? No Jordan aid? No rescissions \npackage? Is this the total white flag of our effort to begin to \nseriously deal with the needs for supplemental appropriations, \ncommitments that have already been made and paid for in the Department \nof Defense, in disaster aid? And the first opening effort, the first \nshot to begin to deal with the deficit? Are we not going to be able to \ndo any of that? Just collapse in a puddle of nothingness here in the \nSenate?\n  I cannot believe my colleagues would want to allow this to happen. We \nneed to find a way to begin to make some savings. This bill provides \nsome savings. The distinguished Democratic leader just said he would \nlike to see this bill passed. The President has said he would like to \nsee this legislation passed. We want it passed. Everybody wants it, but \nwe do not seem to be able to get it.\n  I really think we need to work----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. To be able to find an agreement to bring all these issues \nto conclusion, one that I think would be basically satisfactory to both \nsides. Sure, we disagree on how we should get there. But maybe we \nshould have just started voting, taking up issues and voting on them a \nweek ago. But there was a feeling that we could reach an agreement, and \nthat negotiating started I think last Thursday, and here we are a week \nlater, emptyhanded.\n  So I really urge my colleagues here this afternoon to vote for this \ncloture motion so we can limit the list of amendments to somewhat of a \nreasonable number, at least germane amendments, and begin to get some \nlimit on the time so we can bring all these issues to a conclusion. \nThat is all we are asking for. That is all we were seeking yesterday.\n  I think it would certainly serve us well if we would invoke cloture \nhere and then go forward.\n  Failing that, let us see if we cannot enter into some time \nagreements, some understanding about the limit of amendments. There has \nbeen no reduction really in the number of amendments that are pending \nout there. So I will be glad to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, if he would like for me to yield. We are going to have \nto vote here in a minute.\n  Does the Senator want me to yield? I yield to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Does the Senator from Mississippi yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I cannot figure out for the life of me who over here is \nslowing down the defense supplemental appropriations bill. Could you \nname anyone who is slowing down that particular bill over here?\n  Mr. LOTT. They are all related, if I might respond to the Senator.\n  Mr. PRYOR. We have been overly anxious to get that bill out and get \nit sent to the President. We are anxious to get this bill acted upon. \nAll last week, we were involved basically with an amendment offered by \na Republican Senator, our friend Senator D'Amato, from New York, \nrelative to Mexican aid. We have been trying our very best to start \nvoting on some amendments offered on this side, and we have yet to have \nbeen afforded that opportunity.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will respond to the Senator, there has been an effort \ngoing on to try to work out a process where we could vote on the \nrelated amendments, a number of amendments, and bring it all to a \nconclusion. We have not had the Mexican amendment really before us for \nquite some time. That was set aside last week so we could move on to \nother issues. We are about 3 degrees down the line past that amendment.\n  But in an effort to move this legislation, I think an agreement had \nbeen worked out that would have dealt with that and a number of other \nissues so we could bring it all to a vote. But they are related. All of \nthese are related. We have to decide what we are going to do with the \nJordan aid, where is it going to go? Of course, it is on this bill but \nit is not on the DOD appropriations bill, as I understand it, right \nnow. So we are trying to get all these to positions where we can \ncomplete all this legislation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield? I just wanted to follow up on a \ncomment you made, which is the----\n  Mr. FORD. May I say to the Senator that you go through the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, of the 72----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield for a comment to the Senator from \nPennsylvania; for a question to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, is it not true, I ask the Senator from \nMississippi, that 41 of the 72 Democratic amendments would be germane \nafter this cloture vote? So 41 of the amendments that have been filed--\n41 is hardly a paltry sum--would be germane after this cloture vote \nwould have been acted upon?\n  Mr. LOTT. I might respond, Mr. President, that is my understanding. I \nthink most all of the portions of the pending Daschle amendment, with \nmaybe one exception, could be offered under this cloture vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My second question would be, of the Daschle amendment \nadd-backs that we have debated here for several days, is it not also \nthe Senator's understanding that every single one of those add-backs \nwould be eligible to be added back after cloture, with the exception of \nthe Goals 2000 provision which is neither in the House nor the Senate \nbill?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I might respond, I have not looked at every \none of them on that list to make sure or find out if that would be \ntrue, but I understand there is--maybe the Goals 2000 would be the only \none not open to be offered after the cloture vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor, in view of the time, for \nthe cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I hear all this blame put on us. In the last \n2 years, all the blame has been the other way. I wish some of the \nleadership on the other side would give me an hour \n[[Page S5303]] so they could explain to me how they provided for \ngridlock in the last session so I would be better at gridlock this \nsession.\n  You are now 6 days late on the budget. In the last 2 years, we have \nhad the budget on time. It was due April 1. It is due out here, by both \nHouses, on April 15. We hear all this moaning and groaning and \ncrocodile tears as it relates to we will not do that; we want to start \nsaving; we want to start saving--but we have a budget that is due to \nput us on the track to 2002 and you are 5 days late, and we are not \ngoing to get it probably until May.\n  I say to my friend, let us get a budget out here. Let us really start \ndoing things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could proceed for 1 moment--1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I still hope we can work this out. We were \nabout that close, or closer. The Democratic leader and the Republican \nleader worked throughout the day with other Senators on both sides. We \nthought we had an agreement.\n  We thought we had an agreement. I still hope it is possible to get \nthe agreement. If that happens, we could finish our work very quickly \ntoday and there would be no votes tomorrow or Saturday. But if not, \nthen I do not think we have any other choice other than to try to \ncomplete this bill tonight with or without cloture.\n  So I still think there is a genesis of an agreement here. I would say \nto the White House, I hope that you will help us reach an agreement, \nbecause, until there is an agreement, there will not be any defense \nsupplemental taken up in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5301-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Chafee, Thad \n           Cochran, Mark Hatfield, Pete Domenici, Dan Coats, and \n           Judd Gregg.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, who is on the floor, it is still my hope that we can \nreach some agreement. It seems to me we are not that far apart. We \nought to be able to do it.\n  I am certainly prepared to sit down with the Democratic leader, or \nanyone else, if there is a problem. But, just in case we cannot work it \nout, then I have filed a cloture motion, because I do think it is \nimportant that we finish this bill so we can take up the defense \nsupplemental bill and some other things after that.\n  But I am prepared and I think the Democratic leader is prepared and, \nhopefully, our colleagues are prepared. It seems to me we have one of \ntwo choices. Either we try to finish this tonight with no votes \ntomorrow, or we will be here tonight and tomorrow and maybe Saturday. \nBut, that is up to our colleagues. I cannot believe any of these \namendments are so critical they cannot wait until the next supplemental \nor until the appropriations bills start arriving.\n  I think there was a lot of give and take on each side in good faith. \nI thought we were almost there. But if we make an agreement and \neverybody says, ``Well, I will make the agreement but I want to go back \nand offer an amendment to try to undo the agreement,'' then we do not \nhave an agreement. Either we have an agreement or we do not have an \nagreement.\n  I can agree, if you let me have 25 chances to improve on what I have \nalready agreed upon, but I do not think that is an agreement.\n  I hope that we can resolve everything so that, when it comes to the \nfloor, I can persuade the Senator from New York to withdraw the \namendment with reference to Mexico. He has not done that yet. We have \nthe Jordan aid in this package that I know the administration is very \nconcerned about.\n  So I hope there would be some way to bring it together in the next, \nsay, 45 minutes to an hour.\n  I also remind my colleagues on this side of the aisle, there is a \nRepublican conference in progress in S. 207 which will end, hopefully, \nat 3 o'clock.\n  I am happy to yield the floor or yield to my colleague from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I said before the vote, it was not our \ndesire to hold up this bill. I will reiterate my sincere desire to work \nwith the majority leader in finding an agreement.\n  What I hope we might be able to do, perhaps, is to maybe run two \ntracks, get some debate and offer some of these amendments. We could \nmaybe work out some short time agreements and have a good debate, \nrather than just putting the Senate in a quorum call, and then work \nsimultaneously to see if \n[[Page S5304]] we might not be able to address some of these concerns.\n  I agree with the majority leader. We are close and perhaps we can \nfind a way to accommodate many of the concerns raised on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  But perhaps at the same time we might be able to accommodate some \nSenators who have been waiting patiently to be able to offer \namendments. If we could do that, perhaps that might even accelerate our \nprogress.\n  I reiterate my sincere desire, and I think the desire on this side, \nto work in earnest and try to accommodate everyone and successfully \ncomplete this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield? We are prepared to vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. I do not think we need any \nadditional debate on that. I am for it, not that it makes any \ndifference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are quite prepared to vote. I do not think we need \nadditional time. We wanted to do that at the earliest possible \nconvenience. We welcome the opportunity to have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the distinguished Senator from New York will be \ninterested in speaking to the amendment prior to the time we vote, but \nI am sure there could be some relatively brief time agreement that we \ncould work out to accommodate him, and others, who may yet want to \nspeak. But I do not think it will take that long. I suggest we do that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Why do we not agree to have the time between now and 3 \no'clock equally divided and then vote at 3 o'clock? I think the Senator \nfrom West Virginia also wants to speak on some other issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. I can wait.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will let me consult with the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, to see how much \ntime he may require, we can resolve this matter very soon.\n  Mr. DOLE. While the minority leader is checking, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5303-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5304-S5323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FIRST 100 DAYS OF SO-CALLED REVOLUTION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow we will hear about the first 100 days of the \nso-called revolution, and about the success of the misnamed contract \nwith America. I call the contract misnamed because so many Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle claim never to have signed it, and many \nAmericans have no idea what it is, much less any idea of its various \nprovisions. The term ``contract'' is usually reserved for binding \ndocuments which two or more parties have agreed to and signed. But, not \nso with this so-called contract with America. It is simply the wish \nlist of the extreme faction of one political party, packaged to sell \nbetter by giving it the legitimacy of the word ``contract.'' It is \nclever, essentially meaningless ad-man lingo, probably conjured up by \nsome pollster.\n  But, in any event, the Nation will, no doubt--at least part of the \nNation--be glued to the TV sets on Friday evening to hear the 100-day \nreport on the progress of the so-called contract, as promised. But \neverything about this made-for-TV drama will be somewhat of a fantasy.\n  First, as I have already indicated, the contract is merely a made-up \ndevice. Second, the so-called 100-day report is not occurring after 100 \ndays. Friday, April 7, will only be the 94th day since the convening of \nthe 104th Congress. The real 100th day will occur on Thursday, April \n13th, smack in the first week of the April congressional recess. So we \nwill be getting the report on the so-called contract, which is not \nreally a contract, on the so-designated 100th day, which is really only \nday 94. But, then of what import are messy details when one is busy \nmanufacturing non-news while conducting a pseudo revolution?\n  We will undoubtedly hear of the wild success of the so-called \ncontract when, in fact, only two of its provisions have been enacted \ninto law, and these two were relatively noncontroversial. In reality, \ntwo of the contract's major tenets, the balanced budget amendment and \nthe term limits proposals have gone down to defeat, while a third, a \nmisnamed proposal being loosely called line-item veto which, by the \nway, may be found to be unconstitutional, may be stuck in a House/\nSenate conference for perhaps a long time. Only in Washington would \nthis type of report card be touted as successful. Rather than a 100-day \nreport on the progress of the contract, this coming performance might \nbe better billed as a 94-day alibi for the failure of an extremist \nagenda.\n  The truth of the matter is that the so-called contract is pretty much \nof a flop. And just like a bad play in the theatre, a bomb is a bomb. \nYou can punch up the dance numbers, spice up the dialog and gussy up \nthe costumes a little bit, but in the end a flawed script will flop and \nnothing on God's green earth will save it.\n  Likewise, at the end of this particularly bad show this so-called \ncontract will also be judged a flop and a failure. That will happen \nbecause the contract is a giant gimmick comprised of other lesser \ngimmicks, and it does not address real problems in our Nation. It \nmerely packages several old canards which are holdovers from the last \npopular Republican administration and calls them reform. It reruns a \nlot of 1980's political bumper sticker slogans and calls them a program \nfor change. The Revolution has come to Washington! Rejoice all mad-as-\nhell citizens! Well, if this is a revolution, it must certainly be \ncalled the retread revolution. Term limits, balanced budget amendment, \nline item veto, enhanced rescission, separate enrollment, tax cuts--\nthere is a tough one; there is a tough one--all of these old bald tires \nhave been around for years.\n  And what about those tax cuts? Mr. President, earlier this year the \nHouse of Representatives passed the balanced budget constitutional \namendment in just 2 days--2 days.\n A similar measure failed to pass the Senate by only two votes. During \nthe debate on these proposals, Republicans nearly drowned the American \npeople in a sea of rhetoric proclaiming the need for such an amendment.\n\n  Deficit reduction, it was claimed, was the most pressing issue facing \nCongress today. We heard a lot about our responsibility to future \ngenerations, about the need for fiscal discipline, and about the need \nto make tough choices. The American people were told that there would \nbe shared sacrifice among all for the good of the Nation. Everyone was \ngoing to do his fair share to beat back the economic dragon of deficit \nspending.\n  For weeks we heard lofty speeches in this body over the need to \nreduce deficits. Now, for the House to come right along behind that \ndebate and enact a huge tax cut financed by cuts in general spending \nmakes a mockery of all the hot air we heard in this body about deficit \nreduction. To suggest squandering our budget savings on tax favors for \nthe well to do and for big corporations is just plain crazy. For the \nHouse of Representatives to pass a tax cut giveaway which will cost the \nAmerican people $189 billion over 5 years and approximately $700 \nbillion over 10 years is clearly walking away from any serious attempt \nto reduce the deficit.\n  We will hear a lot of talk about the winners and the losers under the \nso-called contract in the coming days. But, in my view, there are no \nwinners when what should be a serious attempt to address the Nation's \nproblems is replaced with glitzy media shows, overblown rhetoric, one-\nline solutions, and junk legislation enacted in a rush to meet a phoney \ndeadline, and huge tax cuts designed to benefit the well to do. We all \nlose. We all lose when that kind of superficial excuse for leadership \nis offered to the people as a substitute for the real thing.\n  The truth is that Barnum and Bailey's is not the only show in town \nthis week. All of this touting of a revolution and praising of a \nnonexistent contract with America is nothing more than a less \nentertaining version of the same sort of circus.\n  This contract is a sham and it will ultimately be judged a failure \nbecause the American people will never choose \n[[Page S5305]] the so-called contract over the Constitution, the \nConstitution of the United States of America. It will fail because it \nis mostly form devoid of substance. It will fail because it opts out of \ntrying to find solutions to real problems, and instead tries to rig the \ngame and rearrange our cherished checks and balances in order to \nfurther a misguided political agenda. And it will fail because it plays \non people's fears and anger, instead of nourishing their hopes and \ntheir dreams.\n  It will also fail, I believe because of the genius of the Framers in \ntheir crafting of a U.S. Senate, designed to slow things down, educate \nthe public and talk things through in extended debate.\n  For my part, I only wish that tomorrow night, instead of the touting \nof some made-up, fabricated so-called Contract With America in a \npartisan attempt to manufacture fervor for a political agenda, the \nAmerican people will hear a detailed explanation of how the last 94 \ndays have once again demonstrated the innate wisdom, power, and \ngrandeur of the only contract ever agreed to by the people of America \nand sworn to by all of the Members of the Senate and the House. That \ncontract is the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have consulted with colleagues on this \nside and I think as a result of our discussions in recent minutes that \nwe will be able to enter into a fairly short-time agreement on this \nparticular amendment.\n  Whatever length of time the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nwould like to speak I think will be all the time required on this side. \nWe would be prepared to vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could we have 15 minutes, evenly divided? \nI will be glad, as I had previously indicated to the leadership, make a \nbrief presentation. And I am glad to accommodate the timeframe. I could \ncomplete my statement in a shorter period, or take a few extra minutes.\n  I will be glad to begin, and when the leaders work out a time \nagreement, I will accommodate it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the Senator begin his remarks, \nand in the meantime we will try to work out an agreement.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 448 to Amendment No. 420\n\n (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate regarding tax avoidance by \n             certain former citizens of the United States)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will consider the \namendment numbered 448. To again familiarize the Members of the Senate \nof its intent, I will read it. It is a brief amendment.\n  This amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate that \nCongress should act as quickly as possible to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide for taxation of accrued gains at the \ntime that a person relinquishes U.S. citizenship; and it is the sense \nof the Senate that the amendment referred to should take effect as if \nenacted February 6, 1995.\n  This is defined as the billionaires' amendment.\n  Just to review the amendment very quickly, Mr. President, it was part \nof the small business health care deduction bill to permit the self-\nemployed to deduct 25 percent of their premiums.\n  It had been included by the Finance Committee, and was a part of the \nlegislation which we passed. This provision addressed a serious \nloophole in the Internal Revenue Code.\n  That loophole can be explained as follows: An individual can \naccumulate massive sources of wealth, owe their fair share of taxes to \nthe Internal Revenue Code, renounce their American citizenship, become \nwhat I consider to be a Benedict Arnold, change their residency to \nanother country, and effectively avoid and evade any responsibility to \npay their fair share of taxes on all unrealized gains.\n  It has been estimated that the cost of this tax avoidance is $3.6 \nbillion, including both American citizens and permanent resident \naliens.\n  It is important to note that the measure reported out of the Finance \nCommittee related only to American citizens. I am hopeful that the \nFinance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee, when they revisit \nthis issue, will consider the administration's proposal, which would \ninclude both American citizens and permanent resident aliens.\n  This provision only affects about 25 Americans a year. But the \ncumulative loss to the Federal Treasury is $1.5 billion over a 5-year \nperiod and $3.6 billion over a 10-year period.\n  This matter is of major importance, Mr. President, because the Senate \nis now debating the rescissions legislation, rescissions meaning cuts \nin a number of different programs. These are programs that the Congress \nhas authorized, and for which we have made appropriations. The \nPresident has signed these measures into law, and now Congress is \nrevisiting these commitments and deciding how to cut the various \nprograms.\n  The Daschle amendment that is before the Senate would restore funding \nfor some of these programs: the voluntary community service program \ncalled AmeriCorps; the drug-free schools program, which assists \nparents, schoolteachers, and school boards with the problems of \nsubstance abuse and violence in the schools; the chapter 1 education \nprogram, which assists disadvantaged children; the Goals 2000 Program, \nwhich would provide sufficient funding for 1,300 school districts \naround the country for needed reforms and improvements in academic \nachievement; the well-known Head Start Program, that has been extended \nto 0- to 4-year-olds, so that intervention can take place to help \nchildren, particularly toddlers, as defined by the Carnegie Commission \nreport; the Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC], which \nprovides expectant mothers with high-quality nutrition; the School-To-\nWork Program, that is being reviewed now before our Human Resources \nCommittee and will provide one-stop shopping for youth trainees;\n and the child care program, which is so essential for working families \nto ensure that their children are adequately cared for.\n\n  The amendment restores approximately $700 million in these programs. \nOther programs in the amendment for training and housing total $700 \nmillion. That requires a restoration of $1.4 billion, and we have spent \ndays debating this amendment. By and large, most members of the Senate \nhave voted in favor of these programs. A handful have not, but by and \nlarge it has been a bipartisan effort.\n  At the same time, we are not recovering the $1.4 billion from those \nAmericans who are renouncing their citizenship and turning their backs \non America. If they were not renouncing their citizenship, they would \nowe that money to the Federal Treasury. We have not recaptured that \nmoney. It was dropped in the conference committee on the small business \nlegislation. The small business legislation with the appropriate \nlanguage, which had been accepted in the Finance Committee, accepted on \nthe floor of the Senate, and went to the conference, came back without \nthe necessary language.\n  With this amendment, we are saying that the membership feels that \nthis loophole must and should be closed, and will be closed at the \nfirst opportunity. And the date will be made retroactive to the date of \noriginal introduction by President Clinton, who has taken a personal \ninterest in closing this loophole.\n  The majority leader has indicated that he will support it. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee has said that he will support it. The \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, as well as Senator Bradley and \nother members of the Finance Committee, have all expressed their \nsupport.\n  The vote is important because we want to make sure that the Senate's \nhand is strengthened when the measure goes to conference. Hopefully, \nthis will be a unanimous vote, which will further strengthen the hand \nof the Senate. It will be a clear indication that the Senate of the \nUnited States wants this loophole closed, and that the renunciation of \ncitizenship, after an individual has taken advantage of the American \nfree enterprise system, and the avoidance of the responsibility to pay \na fair share of taxes, is unacceptable.\n  An individual has every right to renounce his or her citizenship and \nleave America, and we have some 800 every year who do so. We are not \nsaying that they cannot leave. We are saying that \n[[Page S5306]] if they decide to leave, they should pay their taxes \nprior to their leaving.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Let me finish with one thought.\n  This provision is not a new concept. The concept itself is already \nincluded in the Internal Revenue Code but is drafted such that it does \nnot protect against this egregious loophole. This new provision will \nclose the loophole.\n  I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I know he has been \nwaiting for a week to offer this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I know \nalso this was dropped from a previous piece of legislation that has \nbeen through this Chamber and I cannot conceive of anyone in this \nChamber who would vote against this proposition.\n  As I understand the current tax law--and I might ask the Senator to \nconfirm this--that if you have accumulated substantial assets and \nwealth in this country and have substantial gains on those assets and \nthen decide to renounce your citizenship and leave the country, we'll \ngive you a special deal. You do not have to pay tax on the way out on \nyour gains.\n  I am going to bring something to the floor later this session on \nanother perverse tax incentive that says, ``Close your manufacturing \nplant in America and move it overseas and we will give you a tax break \nfor that as well.''\n  As I understand it, what the Senator is offering is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment saying let's close the loophole by which people can \nrenounce their citizenship and leave this country with substantial \namounts of accumulated gains in income and end up paying no taxes. Is \nthat the current tax circumstance?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has stated it accurately and correctly. It \nis a provision that is probably as inoffensive to all fair-minded \nAmericans as any other before this body. As we debate our priorities on \nthe floor, we have an opportunity to reduce the deficit or invest these \nresources in our children and our educational system.\n  We can give a clear, resounding message to our members of the Finance \nCommittee so that this egregious loophole will be closed at the next \npossible opportunity.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is the Senator prepared to vote at, say 5 after 3?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to vote at 5 after 3.\n  Mr. DOLE. Up or down on the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment 448.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendments will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report this amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment (No. 448) to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX AVOIDANCE.\n\n       (A) In General.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress should act as quickly as possible to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to eliminate the ability of \n     persons to avoid taxes by relinquishing their United States \n     citizenship.\n       (b) Effective Date.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     amendment referred to in subsection (a) should take effect as \n     if enacted on February 6, 1995.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Did we get the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have not gotten the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are ordered, vote at 5 after \n3.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield the floor if \nothers want to address the issue. I will just take a few moments to \nmention one or two other facts.\n  The question was raised about this provision's constitutionality. I \nwill place more complete statements in the Record, but I will now note \nthe opinions of three very thoughtful international law experts. Prof. \nAndreas Lowenfeld of NYU said:\n\n       I am confident that neither adoption nor enforcement of the \n     provision in question would violate any obligation of the \n     United States or any applicable principles of international \n     law.\n\n  Prof. Detlev Vagts of the Harvard Law School said:\n\n       The proposed tax does not amount to such a burden upon the \n     right of repatriation as to constitute a violation of either \n     international law or American constitutional law. It merely \n     equalizes over the long run certain tax structures.\n\n  And Michael Matheson, a legal advisor at the State Department, said:\n\n       This provision does not conflict with international human \n     rights laws concerning an individual's right to freely \n     emigrate from his or her country of citizenship . . . . These \n     are comparable taxes to those which U.S. citizens or \n     permanent residents would have to pay were they in the United \n     States at the time they disposed of the assets or at their \n     death.\n\n  The overwhelming international law opinion on this measure is that it \nin no way restricts the constitutional right of exit or of renunciation \nof one's citizenship.\n  These international law experts understand this measure, and \nrecognize that these individuals have accumulated this wealth through \nthe American economic system, and have a responsibility to pay their \nfair share of taxes. As they understand it, the amendment would only \nrecover what is owed to the Internal Revenue Service, which is part of \none's responsibilities of citizenship.\n  Mr. President, we have appreciated the strong support that we have \nreceived on this measure.\n  This matter was brought to the attention of the President of the \nUnited States a number of months ago, and he personally pursued it with \nthe appropriate committees and the Treasury Department. Through his \nindividual oversight, the matter was spotted and will be corrected.\n  With the vote today, we are telling our good friends in the House of \nRepresentatives that we are serious about this measure, and that it is \na significant issue of justice. The renunciation of one's citizenship \nis deplorable, but it is a right that we respect. But the renunciation \nof citizenship by individuals so that they do not have to pay their \nfair share of taxes is wholly unacceptable. It is sufficiently \ncompelling to generate a resounding vote.\n  Mr. President, I would just take another moment of the Senate's time. \nWe were questioned earlier about the revenue estimates. It is \ninteresting that the figures of both the Senate Finance Committee and \nthe administration are very similar. The administration's proposal \nestimated a cost of $1.5 billion, and the Finance Committee estimated a \ncost of $1.359 billion. Those figures are remarkably close. The Finance \nCommittee's estimate was less than the President's figures because the \nFinance Committee estimated the cost for only American citizens, not \npermanent resident aliens. If we included permanent resident aliens, \nthe committee estimate would perhaps exceed the President's estimate. \nNonetheless, we have two solid estimates approaching $1.5 billion.\n  The President's proposal estimates a cost of $3.6 billion over a 10-\nyear period. That is a very substantial amount, which, if not \ncollected, will either add to the Federal deficit or deny us the \nopportunity to invest in our first order of priorities, our children \nand our education system, through the Head Start Program, the chapter 1 \nprogram, child care programs, job training programs, the student loan \nprogram, and our School-To-Work program. All of these programs reach \nout to the youngest of our citizens to make certain that they are going \nto get a healthy start, an even start, and a fair start in life, and be \nable to provide for themselves and for their own children in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a November 21, 1994, \narticle from Forbes magazine that explains this egregious tax loophole \nbe printed in the Record.\n  I look forward to the vote itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From, Forbes, Nov. 21, 1994]\n\n                            The New Refugees\n\n                  (By Robert Lenzner and Philippe Mao)\n\n       ``Over and over again courts have said that there is \n     nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep \n     taxes as low as possible. Everybody does so, rich or poor, \n     and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more \n     than the law demands: taxes are enforced exactions, not \n     voluntary contributions. To demand more in the name of morals \n     as mere cant''--Judge Learned Hand.\n       ``I talk to a new client interested in expatriating every \n     week. Many people can't pay the federal tax rate and live in \n     the style they want.'' So said Francis Mirabello, the head of \n     the personal law department at the Philadelphia office of \n     Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, speaking at a Bermuda conference on \n     offshore money early this fall.\n       Expatriating? Give up U.S. citizenship? Who in his right \n     mind would give up his U.S. citizenship? Lots of people. You \n     could practically fill a Boeing 747 with well-heeled U.S. \n     citizens who have taken of foreign citizenship rather than \n     submit to what Learned Hand called ``enforced exactions'' at \n     a level that amounts to virtual confiscation. The exodus may \n     speed up under an Administration that campaigned for office \n     on a tax-the-rich platform.\n       In 1981 Ronald Reagan lowered taxes. The following year not \n     a single American gave up his citizenship. In 1993 the \n     expatriate community grew by 306 names.\n       The expatriates of recent years have included:\n       Michael Dingman, chairman of Abex, and a Ford Motor \n     director. Dingman is now a citizen of the Bahamas and lives \n     there.\n       Billionaire John (Ippy) Dorrance III, an heir to the \n     Campbell Soup fortune. Dorrance is now a citizen of Ireland \n     and lives there as well as in the Bahamas and Devil's Tower, \n     Wyo.\n       J. Mark Mobius, one of the most successful emerging market \n     investment managers. Born a U.S. citizen, Mobius has the \n     German citizenship of his ancestors and lives in Hong Kong \n     and Singapore.\n       Kenneth Dart, an heir to Dart Container and his family's $1 \n     billion fortune. He is a citizen of Belize and works in the \n     Cayman Islands.\n       Ted Arison, founder of Carnival Cruise Lines. He kept \n     Israeli citizenship and now lives there.\n       These newer emigrants join others of longer standing, \n     including Robert Miller, the co-owner of Duty Free Shoppers \n     International Ltd. Miller has a British passport obtained in \n     Hong Kong, though he was raised in Quincy, Mass.\n       The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world that \n     imposes significant income and death taxes on the worldwide \n     income and assets of every citizen, even if the citizen is \n     domiciled elsewhere. Even Canada, semisocialist, did away \n     with estate taxes.\n       ``Expatriation has been called the ultimate estate plan,'' \n     says William Zabel, senior partner of Schulte Roth & Zabel, \n     one of the nation's foremost authorities on trusts and \n     estates, and author of the upcoming book The Rich Die \n     Richer--And You Can Too.\n       The arithmetic is simple and brutal. A very rich Bahamian \n     citizen pays zero estate tax; rich Americans--anyone with an \n     estate worth $3 million or more--pay 55%. A fairly stiff 37% \n     marginal rate kicks in for Americans leaving as little as \n     $600,000 to their children. The marginal rate--what you pay \n     on an additional dollar of assets--ranges upward from there \n     to 60%. You get a credit for some or all of your state \n     inheritance taxes, but your combined rate will still be in \n     this range, or higher.\n       There are huge potential income tax savings, too, in giving \n     up U.S. citizenship. St. Kitts-Nevis and the Cayman Islands, \n     among others, levy no income taxes. Little wonder so many of \n     the expatriate Americans have gone to the Caribbean for a \n     year-round suntan.\n       Not that living in the Bahamas is any great sacrifice. \n     Michael Dingman is building a 15,000-square-foot home at the \n     exclusive Lyford Cay club in Nassau that will include a dock \n     for his personal yacht. Cost: more than $10 million, but--who \n     knows?--he might save more than that much in taxes.\n       The heirs of John (Ippy) Dorrance III, the Campbell Soup \n     heir, won't have to pay Uncle Sam the maximum bite of 55% of \n     the 26.7 million shares of Campbell Soup that make up most of \n     his $1-billion-plus fortune. His new fatherland, Ireland, \n     levies a 2% estate, or probate, tax. In any event, Dorrance \n     doesn't escape the full federal income taxes. There's a U.S. \n     withholding tax of 30% on the $30 million he gets in \n     dividends every year from Campbell.\n       Many of these expatriates agonize over the decision, \n     however. ``I have serious reservations about expatriation for \n     patriotic and practical reasons,'' says tax expert Zabel. \n     ``It is extraordinarily difficult for Americans to get back \n     their citizenship once it is given up. To get it back you \n     have to start like any other nonresident alien, with a green \n     card, and go through the naturalization process.\n       ``Before expatriating I make my clients consider all the \n     limitations on loss of citizenship--like giving up the \n     ability to travel to the U.S. more than 120 days a year.''\n       But losing that American passport isn't as hazardous as it \n     once was. Profligate government policies are steadily eroding \n     the value of the U.S. dollar, making overseas investments \n     increasingly preferable for the wealthy. Investments in \n     emerging markets look increasingly attractive. The end of the \n     cold war means wealthy Americans can live in many developing \n     nations safely. Global communication and jet travel \n     facilitate an offshore lifestyle. What with computers and \n     cable TV, you can be as well informed, and as quickly, living \n     in Antigua as in New York City.\n       It certainly seems that way to Frederick Krieble, a \n     director and former treasurer of Loctite Corp., the Rocky \n     Hill, Conn. manufacturer of sealants and adhesives. Krieble, \n     whose father, Robert, was formerly Loctite chairman, moved to \n     Turks and Caicos Islands, where he runs an investment \n     company. Krieble owns almost 1 million shares of Loctite, \n     worth over $43 million.\n       ``It's 85 degrees, but the market's down 35 points,'' \n     Krieble told Forbes recently. When he heard we wanted to \n     discuss the subject of expatriation, Krieble clammed up. ``I \n     don't wish to discuss that. Have to run now.''\n       Yes, it's a bit embarrassing, but consider the \n     consequences: decimation of your estate and huge reductions \n     in your aftertax income.\n       Thus many money managers, senior executives and self-made \n     entrepreneurs are on the phone quizzing their lawyers and \n     accountants about how to leave the high-tax U.S.\n       Jane Siebels-Kilnes, a vice-president of Templeton, \n     Galbraith & Hansberger, in Nassau, told Forbes she was \n     ``following in the footsteps of Sir John Templeton,'' who \n     gave up his U.S. citizenship in 1962 and moved to Nassau. \n     Thus when Templeton sold his mutual fund management company \n     in October 1992, he may have saved more than $100 million in \n     capital gains taxes. Templeton, an extremely generous and \n     public-spirited man, gives most of his money away. Apparently \n     he wants to decide who gets the benefits rather than letting \n     Donna Shalala or Mario Cuomo decide.\n       Siebels-Kilnes became a Norwegian citizen this year and \n     moved her residence from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. to Nassau. \n     ``I've spoken to a number of hedge fund managers who are \n     thinking of giving up their citizenship. It may be better to \n     be offshore running offshore money before American \n     authorities clamp down on the advantages,'' says Siebels-\n     Kilnes.\n       A hot spot: St. Kitts-Nevis. All it requires is owning \n     $150,000 worth of local real estate and paying $50,000 in \n     fees, and presto. St. Kitts-Nevis levies neither a personal \n     income tax nor an estate tax.\n       Top executives of midwestern industrial companies nearing \n     retirement are considering expatriation as a way to ensure a \n     high standard of living in a comfortable environment.\n       Is it greed alone that impels these citizenship changes? \n     Not necessarily.\n       ``These people love to challenge all the rules, even \n     recognizing they may isolate themselves,'' says Carol \n     Caruthers, a partner of Price Waterhouse in St. Louis. ``We \n     are doing preliminary planning for a few of them.''\n       Expatriation is a fairly easy choice for many wealthy \n     Americans who hold dual citizenship--as Mobius already did--\n     and whose wealth is heavily concentrated abroad anyhow.\n       ``Since they may inherit these assets, a planning \n     opportunity might be to give up U.S. citizenship in order to \n     avoid taxation on assets and income that have no connection \n     to the U.S.,'' says Robert C. Lawrence III, a Cadwalader \n     Wickersham & Taft partner in New York who is advising on \n     several such expatriations.\n       You'll need an ace attorney. If the Internal Revenue \n     Service suspects you are renouncing your citizenship to avoid \n     taxes, it will try to tax your holdings for another ten \n     years, no matter where you live. All the IRS need establish \n     is that it is reasonable to believe you gave up citizenship \n     to avoid taxes. Then, the burden of proving the move was not \n     for tax reasons falls on the former citizen.\n       But whatever the drawbacks, many nations put out the \n     welcome mat for tax-averse Americans.\n       Lawyer Mirabello, who is working on six expatriations, is \n     changing citizenship for a superwealthy Chinese-American \n     whose headquarters is in Hong Kong. He has never set foot in \n     the U.S. and wants to avoid estate taxes when he passes the \n     empire to his children.\n       Some of Mirabello's clients are considering becoming Irish \n     citizens. What does that require? Certainly no hardship, \n     given what a pleasant place Ireland is for those with money. \n     They need only buy a home there and reside there at least \n     part of the year.\n       Why Ireland? An Irish passport lets its holder travel \n     hassle-free in any member of the European Union. It also has \n     more panache than a passport from Belize or St. Kitts, two \n     small tropical outposts. And, Dublin is being developed as a \n     global money center with tax advantages for individual and \n     corporate investors.\n       How do you get an Irish passport? It should be fairly easy \n     for the rich. New regulations will probably require a $1.6 \n     million investment in a job-producing operation like the \n     reforestation of an area or modernization of a shipbuilding \n     concern. This is the so-called business migration scheme, \n     administered in Dublin by the Department of Justice. Its \n     guidelines are currently being reexamined for political \n     reasons.\n       Another attractive destination is Switzerland. ``You can \n     pretty well negotiate your \n     [[Page S5308]] own private agreement with a Swiss canton \n     about your annual income taxes,'' asserts Lawrence.\n       Can an affluent American keep the politicians at bay \n     without sacrificing citizenship? It's not easy. Wealthy \n     people hold over $2 trillion in offshore accounts from Zurich \n     to the Cayman Islands. No doubt some of these accounts are \n     held by Americans who--illegally--omit mention of them on \n     their tax returns.\n       Merrill Lynch, like all major investment firms, has a piece \n     of this business. Merrill will not accept offshore accounts \n     from U.S. citizens, but it is eager to service foreigners.\n       ``Offshore money is growing faster than any other part of \n     the financial services industry. It's multiplying at a \n     double-digit rate of growth,'' says Nassos Michas, head of \n     Merrill Lynch's private banking division. Merrill's trust \n     bank in the Caymans, with assets growing at over $100 million \n     a month, has almost $5 billion of wealthy individuals' \n     holdings.\n       Actually, the Caymans trust is just a file for legal \n     purposes. Merrill's banks in Geneva, New York and London hold \n     the securities. The accounting is done in Singapore, the \n     administration is done on the Isle of Man, famed for its \n     trust business.\n       Wealthy Europeans, Latin Americans, Asians and Middle \n     Easterners are Merrill's principal clients here. They want to \n     buffer their fortunes against expropriation, political \n     unrest, economic instability, angry first wives, kidnapping, \n     family members, creditors and potential litigants.\n       Wealthy Europeans have expatriated their money to safety \n     ever since the French Revolution, when they began hiding it \n     in Switzerland.\n       When the Germans occupied the Netherlands in 1940, this \n     activated a trust instrument transferring ownership from the \n     homeland to a trust at a U.S. bank. In Europe, where the \n     pounding of marching feet and air raid warnings are of recent \n     memory, use of such trusts was common, at least up until the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union.\n       Today many wealthy Kuwaitis have trusts offshore to protect \n     their fortunes from Saddam Hussein. The rich in Latin \n     America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East remember that it \n     was only yesterday that their countries were ruled by \n     thieving populists or arbitrary soldiers.\n       What is new is that Americans are beginning to feel the \n     same sort of residual uncertainty about their posessions. \n     They see courts eroding property rights. They read about \n     bureaucrats who talk about ``tax expenditures'' when \n     referring to that part of your earnings that they permit you \n     to keep. They are subjected to retroactive taxation under the \n     Clinton ``deficit reduction bill.'' They live in a society \n     that changes the tax rules so frequently that long-term \n     planning is almost impossible.\n       So they consult legal experts like Cadwalader's Lawrence, \n     who is an authority on generational and international \n     planning, including the use of trusts, and taxation. ``They \n     want to sequester, organize and protect the privacy and \n     maintenance of their wealth, plus the freedom to transfer it \n     as they wish,'' says Lawrence.\n       But how, short of leaving for some sand dune in the \n     Caribbean?\n       There are several clever strategies you can use to minimize \n     the future tax bite on your estate, but the fact is that \n     Congress has done a very thorough job of plugging chinks in \n     the tax code. Parking assets abroad or setting up holding \n     companies will not get you out of the U.S., steep income and \n     estate tax rates. You really have to give up citizenship to \n     get a big tax savings.\n       It's easier for foreigners who have property in the U.S. to \n     avoid the worst of American taxation, but even for them there \n     are pitfalls. They must pay U.S. estate taxes on assets held \n     in the U.S. unless they safeguard them by means of an \n     offshore legal structure. Only certain fixed-income \n     investments are immune from the IRS.\n       A foreigner can shelter his U.S. assets in the following \n     way: Set up a trust outside the U.S. in some tax-advantaged \n     locale, such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands or the British \n     Virgin Islands. ``The foreign trust must own an underlying \n     holding company, called a private investment company (pic),'' \n     Lawrence says.\n       ``The pic opens an investment account in the U.S. \n     Otherwise, a foreign individual who has a stocks-and-bonds \n     portfolio of U.S. companies would be subject to U.S. estate \n     tax. If the securities are owned by a true foreign \n     corporation, the individual is not subject to the estate tax. \n     The foreign corporation acts like a shield to the estate \n     tax.''\n       The IRS can't be happy about these paper shuffling \n     arrangements. Indeed, Lawrence is afraid it may crack down on \n     them. But before you cheer at the prospect of making them \n     furriners pay up, remember this: The U.S. needs foreign \n     capital because we don't save enough. We must compete for \n     that capital with lots of other places. Treat the capital \n     shabbily and it can go elsewhere.\n       ``I'm afraid that foreign capital may be scared away from \n     the U.S. because of taxes and the complexity of our \n     regulation,'' Lawrence warns.\n       It could happen, Lawrence insists. He points to the Foreign \n     Investment in Real Property Tax Act, passed in 1980, which \n     forces foreigners to pay a capital gains tax when the sell \n     real estate in the U.S. We shudder to think what would happen \n     to the U.S. stock and bond markets if foreign paper holdings \n     were similarly taxed.\n       It will come as a shock to many people to learn about the \n     growing band of expatriates. But it is not unpatriotic to \n     remind Americans that ours is no longer the only show in town \n     as a place to invest. At a time when we urge developing \n     countries to cut taxes and make capital more secure, a lot is \n     happening to make it less secure and more heavily taxed at \n     home. Those who give up their citizenship to escape \n     Clintonomics and wealth redistribution are only the extreme \n     part of a worrisome trend.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                         Avoiding Confiscation\n\n       Short of renouncing citizenship, how do you protect the \n     family fortune from confiscation by the tax code writers in \n     Congress and in the U.S. Treasury?\n       The first, and easiest, tax-saving maneuver is to give \n     money away while alive. If the heirs are young or \n     irresponsible, you can put the gift in a trust and get the \n     same tax advantages.\n       There are two advantages to gifts over bequests. One is \n     that the first $10,000--per year, per recipient, per donor--\n     is free from gift tax. If both you and your spouse give for a \n     long time and you have many heirs, that exclusion can make a \n     serious dent in your estate. With five heirs, two donors and \n     20 years to make the transfers, you can get $2 million out of \n     your estate scot-free.\n       The other advantage is that the gift tax is somewhat lower \n     than the estate tax. The two taxes use the same rate \n     schedule, but the gift tax is calculated in a way more \n     favorable to the tax-payer. Say you give $1 million to a \n     grandchild when you are in the 60% bracket for federal gift \n     tax. (That rate applies when your cumulative gifts, after the \n     exclusion, are between $10 million and $21 million.)\n       The total cost of the gift will be $1.6 million--$1 million \n     to the grandchild, $600,000 to the IRS. But at your death, \n     that $1.6 million would be divided $960,000 (60% of $1.6 \n     million) to the IRS, only $640,000 to the grandchild.\n       Caution. If you die within three years of making a gift, \n     your taxes will be recalculated to negate the advantage of \n     giving over bequeathing.\n       Another defensive maneuver is the grantor retained annuity \n     trust (Forbes, Jan. 31). You transfer your business to a \n     trust whose beneficiaries are your heirs. Out of the trust \n     you carve yourself an annuity. The trust pays your annuity \n     out of business earnings.\n       You figure the discounted present value of the annuity you \n     retained, and subtract this amount from the value of the \n     business in order to arrive at the value of the gift. The \n     annuity gives you income while keeping your tax able gift to \n     a minimum.\n       Business owners are also availing themselves of the \n     ``minority discount'' rule (Forbes. Mar. 1, 1993) For \n     example, your software firm is worth $10 million. Carve it up \n     into ten shares and give one share each to ten heirs. Each \n     share may be worth only $700,000 on a gift tax return, \n     because no outside investor would want to be a minority owner \n     in a family business.\n       If the family heirloom is a house, a variation on the GRAT \n     may work well. You give your residence to your heirs, \n     retaining the right to live in it for a specific period \n     (Forbes, June 24, 1991). Again, the carve-out reduces the \n     value of the gift.\n       Another innovation is the dynasty trust. Each grandparent \n     puts $1 million worth of property in a trust in South Dakota \n     for the benefit of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Why \n     South Dakota? Because it permits trusts to last in \n     perpetuity; most states allow them to last no more than 21 \n     years after the death of anyone now living. Why only $1 \n     million? Because if you transfer more than that you will get \n     hit with a punitive ``generation skipping tax.''\n       Note that a dynasty trust doesn't relieve you of the usual \n     gift tax. It might, however, let you keep an asset in the \n     family for a long, long time. The asset is hit with a \n     transfer tax only once, when you set up the trust, rather \n     than again and again as each generation passed on.\n       ``There's no one device to solve all the problems. It's a \n     combination of solutions,'' says Richard Covey, a partner at \n     Carter, Ledyard & Milburn in New York. ``I find most wealthy \n     people outside of New York don't know about these tricks.''\n       What about life insurance? The inside buildup of assets \n     gets passed on to your heirs tax-free, but the premiums you \n     pay must be reported as gifts. Life insurance is somewhat \n     overtouted as an estate tool but it does have its advantages, \n     especially if you die before your time.\n       You also can buy a tax-deferred annuity from a foreign life \n     insurance company, typically German or Swiss. If the annuity \n     is fixed rate and denominated in deutsche marks or Swiss \n     francs, it may protect your nest egg from a deteriorating \n     dollar (Forbes, June 20). You may also opt for a variable \n     policy that is invested in stocks or mutual funds.\n       But you won't save taxes unless your estate administrator \n     is willing to commit a felony by omitting it. So the main \n     legal benefit of these overseas insurance policies appears to \n     be that they may--repeat, may--be beyond the reach of \n     creditors.\n       For a while the very wealthy were able to defer tax on \n     portfolio profits by investing in overseas funds that had a \n     majority of shares held by foreigners. But the 1986 tax put a \n     stop to this game.\n       [[Page S5309]] After the 1986 crackdown, the main thing \n     that offshore funds can do for you is give your fund manager \n     more flexibility in trading. Domestic funds must be \n     diversified, must avoid getting too much of their profits \n     from short term trading, and have limits on leverage. Foreign \n     funds escape these rules, says Joel Adler, a partner in \n     Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan in New York.\n       The bottom line is that there isn't much that wealthy \n     Americans can do to protect their assets from a covetous \n     state. Which explains, if it doesn't excuse, the drastic step \n     taken by more and more people of giving up their U.S. \n     citizenship. R.L. and P.M.\n                        taxation of expatriates\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the matter raised by \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. We should not countenance \nthe evasion of taxes by those who renounce their citizenship. The \nSenate should act to address this problem expeditiously.\n  A genuine abuse exists. Although the current Tax Code contains \nprovisions, dating back to 1966, designed to address tax-motivated \nrelinquishment of citizenship, these provisions have proven difficult \nto enforce and are easily evaded. One international tax expert \ndescribed avoiding them as ``child's play.'' Individuals with \nsubstantial wealth can, by renouncing U.S. citizenship, avoid paying \ntaxes on gains that accrued during the period that they acquired their \nwealth and were afforded the myriad advantages of U.S. citizenship. \nMoreover, even after renunciation, these individuals can maintain \nsubstantial connections with the United States, such as keeping a \nresidence and residing in the United States for up to 120 days a year \nwithout incurring U.S. tax obligations. Indeed, reports indicate that \ncertain wealthy individuals have renounced their U.S. citizenship and \navoided their tax obligations while still maintaining their families \nand homes in the United States, being careful merely to avoid being \npresent in this country for more than 120 days each year.\n  Meanwhile, the rest of Americans who remain citizens pay taxes on \ntheir gains when assets are sold or when an estate tax becomes due at \ndeath.\n  It was this Senator who made the first proposal in the Senate to deal \nwith the expatriation tax abuse. On February 6, the President announced \na proposal to address the problem in his fiscal year 1996 budget \nsubmission. Three weeks ago, on March 15, during Finance Committee \nconsideration of the bill to restore the health insurance deduction for \nthe self-employed, I offered a modified version of the administration's \nexpatriation tax provision as an amendment to the bill. My amendment \nwould have substituted the expatriation proposal for the repeal of \nminority broadcast tax preferences as a funding source for the bill. \nThe amendment failed when every Republican member of the Committee \nvoted against it. Subsequently, Senator Bradley offered the \nexpatriation provision as a freestanding amendment, with the $3.6 \nbillion in revenue that it raised to be dedicated to deficit reduction. \nSenator Bradley's amendment passed by voice vote. That is how the \nexpatriation tax provision was added to the bill that came before the \nSenate.\n  After the Finance Committee reported the bill, but before full Senate \naction and conference with the House, the Finance Committee held a \nhearing to further review the issues raised by the expatriation \nprovision. Tax legislation routinely gets polished in its technical \naspects as it moves through floor action and conference. At the Finance \nhearing, we heard criticisms of some technical aspects in the operation \nof the\n provision, as well as testimony raising the issue of whether the \nprovision comported with article 12 of the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, which the United States ratified in 1992. \nSection 2 of article 12 states: ``Everyone shall be free to leave any \ncountry, including his own.'' Robert F. Turner, a professor of \ninternational law at the U.S. Naval War College, argued that the \nexpatriation provision was problematic under the covenant. The State \nDepartment's legal experts disagreed, as did two other outside experts \nwhose letters were before the committee. I refer to Prof. Paul B. \nStephan III, a specialist in both international law and tax law at the \nUniversity of Virginia School of Law; and Mr. Stephen E. Shay, who \nserved as International Tax Counsel at Treasury under the Reagan \nadministration.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the written testimony of \nProfessor Turner, the written testimony of the Department of State, and \nthe letters of Professor Stephan and Mr. Shay be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, although there was considerable support \nfor the legality of the provision, I thought it best to proceed with \ncaution in these circumstances. These are matters of human rights under \ninternational law, on which we have rightly lectured others, and \ninvolve our solemn obligations under treaties. I sought the views of \nother experts. Letters concluding that the expatriation provision did \nnot raise any problems under international law were received from Prof. \nDetlev Vagts of Harvard Law School and\n Prof. Andreas F. Lowenfeld of New York University School of Law. The \nState Department issued a lengthier analysis upholding the legality of \nthe provision, and the American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service reached a like conclusion. However, there were \ndissenting views, most notably Prof. Hurst Hannum of the Fletcher \nSchool of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, who first wrote to me \non March 24.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters of Professors \nVaghts, Lowenfeld, and Hannum, and the memoranda from the American Law \nDivision of CRS and the Department of State, be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is where things stood when the \nHouse-Senate conference met on March 28. The weight of authority \nappeared to be on the side of legality under international law, but \nthere was some question, and the bill had to move at great speed. As my \ncolleagues well know, the legislation restoring the self-employeds' \nhealth insurance deduction, for calendar year 1994, needed to be passed \nand signed into law well in advance of this year's April 17 tax filing \ndeadline, so that the self-employed would have time to prepare and file \ntheir 1994 tax returns. The decision regarding the expatriation \nprovision had to be made without further opportunity of deliberation. I \nopted not to risk making the wrong decision with respect to \ninternational law and human rights.\n  The decision to drop the expatriation tax provision from the final \nconference version of the bill has been the subject of much debate over \nthe last week. I certainly don't presume to speak\n for the other conferees. But for myself I repeat as I have said on two \noccasions on this floor over the past week: We should proceed with care \nwhen we are dealing with human rights issues, particularly when the \ngroup involved is a despised group--that is, millionaires who renounce \ntheir citizenship for money.\n\n  As the Senator who first proposed the expatriation tax provision, I \nwill see this matter through to a conclusion. We are getting more \nclarity on the human rights issue, and it appears that a consensus is \ndeveloping to the effect that the provision does not conflict with our \nobligations under international law. In particular, it is worth noting \nthat Professor Hannum, who first wrote me on March 24 expressing his \nconcern that the expatriation provision was a problem under \ninternational law, has, after receiving additional and more specific \ninformation about the expatriation tax, now written a second letter of \nMarch 31 stating that he is ``convinced that neither its intention nor \nits effect would violate present U.S. obligations under international \nlaw.'' This is the growing consensus, although it is not unanimous.\n  Mr. President, I would further ask unanimous consent that Professor \nHannum's March 31 letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as for criticism of the technical \ndifficulties of the original proposal, I believe \n[[Page S5310]] they can be satisfied. Indeed, I would venture that if \nsome of those criticizing the provision's technical aspects had put \neven half as much effort into devising solutions as in highlighting \nshortcomings, we would already be\n much further along toward a satisfactory statute.\n\n  One final point, of utmost importance. As we take the time to write \nthis law carefully, billionaires are not slipping through some loophole \nand escaping tax by renouncing their citizenship. The President \nannounced the original proposal on February 6, and made it effective \nfor taxpayers who initiate a renunciation of citizenship on or after \nthat date. This was an entirely appropriate way to put an end to an \nabusive practice under current law. Both the proposal that I initiated, \nand the one that was ultimately adopted by the Finance Committee, also \nused February 6, 1995, as the effective date of the new provision \npreventing tax evasion through expatriation. The House conferees had \nproposed slipping the effective date to March 15, 1995--the date of \nSenate Finance Committee action on the provision. The two chairman of \nthe tax-writing committees ultimately--and wisely--resisted that \noverture, and have issued a joint statement giving notice that February \n6 ``may'' be the effective date of any legislation affecting the tax \ntreatment of those who relinquish citizenship. Given the potential for \nabuse under current law, I believe that February 6 must be the \neffective date for a new rule. In any event, given the President's \nannouncement in the budget, the Finance Committee action, and the joint \nstatement of the two chairman of the tax-writing committees, \nindividuals who are contemplating renunciation of their U.S. \ncitizenship are on fair notice of the February 6, 1995, effective date.\n  To repeat, as the Senator who first offered the proposal to end the \nexpatriation tax abuse, I will do everything I can to see that this \nmatter gets resolved. We will do it this session. Fundamental justice \nto all taxpaying Americans requires no less.\n  In an effort to advance that goal, I will shortly introduce \nlegislation embodying a revised expatriation tax proposal. I do so in \nthe interest of ensuring that the issues that have been raised are \naddressed satisfactorily, and in a timely manner. This revised proposal \nrepresents a serious effort to address the criticisms that have been \nraised, and I believe it will be a major step forward.\n  Mr. President, we will end this abuse, and promptly, but in a careful \nand orderly way, as we should do in matters of this importance.\nExhibit 1.--International Law and the ``Exit Tax'': Does Section 203 of \n   the Tax Compliance Act of 1995 Violate the ``Right to Emigrate'' \nRecognized in the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Other \n               U.S. and International Legal Instruments?\n\n                         (By Robert F. Turner)\n\n       Mr. Chairman, it is an honor and a pleasure to appear \n     before the subcommittee this morning to explore the human \n     rights ramifications of the so-called ``exit tax'' contained \n     in Title II of H.R. 981, the ``Tax Compliance Act of \n     1995.''\\1\\\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Before turning to the merits of the issue, I would like to \n     make three caveats in connection with my appearance here \n     today.\n       First of all, I am testifying in my personal capacity as a \n     scholar interested in the subject of International Law; and, \n     although I currently occupy the Charles H. Stockton Chair of \n     International Law at the Naval War College while on leave of \n     absence from the University of Virginia's Center for National \n     Security Law, my appearance is unconnected with either of \n     those relationships. Any similarities between the views I \n     express and those of the War College, the Navy, the \n     University of Virginia, or any other institution or \n     organization, is purely coincidental.\n       Secondly, I want to stress the start that I have absolutely \n     no expertise on the substantive issue of tax law. I will \n     therefore have to pass on any questions you might wish to \n     raise predicated upon such a knowledge.\n       Finally, since my invitation to testify was not extended \n     until late Friday afternoon (four days ago)--and because of \n     prior commitments and travel requirements, I had less than \n     one day to work seriously on my testimony--my prepared \n     statement is not as detailed as I might otherwise have \n     preferred. The basic human rights issue is, of course, not \n     new to me--ironically, I believe I first looked at the \n     ``right of emigration'' professionally more than two decades \n     ago when the Jackson-Vanik Amendment came before the Senate \n     while I was on the staff of Senator Robert P. Griffin of \n     Michigan--and I don't believe the pressures of time have \n     prevented me from accurately setting forth the basic legal \n     rules by which this statutory provision should be judged. I \n     have not had a great deal of time for serious analysis, \n     however; and while I venture some very tentative conclusions, \n     I suspect that each of you will be able to apply the legal \n     rules to the proposed new statute at least as well as I have \n     been able to do in the limited time available. Candidly, I \n     have gone back and forth on the issue--I don't find it to be \n     a clear cut case.\n       Thus, I do not appear before you this morning for the \n     purpose of either supporting or opposing the so-called ``exit \n     tax'' provision of the tax bill. I do believe that upholding \n     the rule of law is important, and I do believe that this \n     provision may raise a sufficiently serious question under \n     International Law that it warrants additional consideration \n     before making a final decision on Section 201. To that end, I \n     commend you for scheduling this hearing.\n       Even if in the end you conclude that the provision does \n     not, in reality, violate the Nation's solemn human rights \n     treaty commitments, if there is even a colorable claim to the \n     contrary that might be raised to undermine future US efforts \n     to enforce human rights laws, it might be wise to avoid even \n     the appearance of violating these laws. In the end it may \n     come down to balancing the importance of the tax code \n     provision against the potential harm\n      that might result if we are perceived as having violated \n     these important rules of international human rights law.\n       As an aside, I also have a professional interest in issues \n     of US Constitutional Law--indeed, I have testified before at \n     least half-a-dozen congressional committees on issues of \n     Constitutional Law in the past few years--and I have the \n     impression that this provision may also raise issues in that \n     area.\\2\\ However, considerations of time, and my \n     understanding of the scope of my invitation this morning, led \n     me to refrain from examining those issues in sufficient depth \n     to make a meaningful contribution today on that issue.\n\n\n                the growth of a legal right to emigrate\n\n       Today the right of citizens to renounce their citizenship \n     and leave their own country is almost universally recognized \n     as a fundamental civil right, but its widespread recognition \n     as creating international obligations is of relatively recent \n     origin. The origin of the right can arguably be traced back \n     nearly 2500 years, to the famous Dialogues of Plato, in which \n     Socrates says to Crito: [H]aving brought you into the world, \n     and nurtured and educated you, and given you and every other \n     citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we \n     further proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we \n     allow him, that if he does not like us when he has become of \n     age and has been the ways of the city, and made our \n     acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his goods \n     with him. None of . . . [our] laws will forbid him or \n     interfere with him. Any one who does not like us and the \n     city, and who wants to emigrate to a colony or to any other \n     city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\\3\\\n       The 42nd paragraph of the original 1215 version of the \n     Magna Carta issued by King John at Runnymede guaranteed the \n     right of ``any one to go out from our kingdom, and to return, \n     safely and securely, by land and by water, saving their \n     fidelity to us''; but this ``right to travel'' was omitted \n     from the forty-six subsequent versions--including the one \n     issued by Henry III in 1225 usually associated with the term \n     ``Magna Carta''--on the grounds that such a right seemed \n     ``weighty and doubtful.''\\4\\ Nor, for that matter, is it \n     clear that the right to ``travel'' included a right to \n     emigrate--a right far more easily sustained now that people \n     have changed from ``subjects'' of the King to ``citizens'' of \n     the State.\n       In 1791, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man \n     affirmed the right ``to come and to go'' from the State as a \n     ``natural'' right.\\5\\ By 1868 the U.S. Congress was on record \n     by statute that: [T]he right of expatriation is a natural and \n     inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment \n     of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \n     . . . Therefore, . . . any declaration, instruction, opinion, \n     order, or decision of any officers of this government which \n     denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of \n     expatriation, is declared inconsistent with the fundamental \n     principles of this government.\\6\\\n       More recently, Section 349(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act recognizes a right of every citizen to \n     relinquish US citizenship.\\7\\ Just a decade ago, the US Court \n     of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed that ``expatriation \n     has long been recognized as a right of United States \n     citizens,'' and noted that ``the Supreme Court [has] placed \n     the right of voluntary expatriation solidly on a \n     constitutional footing.''\\8\\\n       The proposed ``exit tax,'' of course, does not expressly \n     challenge this well-established right to emigrate--it merely \n     provides that a few very wealthy citizens will be forced to \n     pay a 35% tax on appreciated assets should they wish to \n     exercise this constitutional \n     [[Page S5311]] right. The issue you have invited me to \n     address is whether such a tax would bring the United States \n     into noncompliance with any binding rules of International \n     Law. I\n      am not sufficiently versed on issues of tax law to answer \n     that question with any real confidence, but perhaps I can \n     be of assistance by at least summarizing the existing \n     international law binding upon the United States \n     concerning the human right to emigrate.\n\n\n       international law and constraints on the right to emigrate\n\n       Mr. Chairman, perhaps it would be most helpful if I began \n     by briefly setting forth the status of the right to emigrate \n     under International Law. I will first consider the relevant \n     conventional (treaty) law binding upon the United States, \n     followed by a look at some ``nonbinding'' international \n     documents which may shed light on these issues, and finally I \n     will discuss the very important area of customary \n     international law (which, under the Statute of the \n     International Court of Justice, is considered as equal in \n     authority to conventional law\\9\\).\n\n\n                     conventional international law\n\n       The effort to codify international human rights law is of \n     quite recent origin, essentially coming in the wake of World \n     War II and the establishment of the United Nations. Article \n     55 of the UN Charter establishes as a goal the promotion of \n     ``universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, \n     sex, language, or religion.'' In Article 56, ``All Members \n     pledge[d] themselves to take joint and separate action in co-\n     operation with the Organization for the achievement of the \n     purposes set forth in Article 55.''\n       An important first step was the unanimous adoption (with \n     eight abstentions, including the Soviet Union and several \n     other Communist States) on 10 November 1948 of the \n     ``Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' as a UN General \n     Assembly Resolution. Such resolutions do not have legal \n     effect,\\10\\ and the Declaration was clearly viewed as \n     aspirational at the time--indeed, the United States delegate \n     expressly stated that the resolution ``is not and does not \n     purport to be a statement of law or of legal \n     obligation.''\\11\\ However, there is a very strong consensus \n     today that the Declaration is legally binding by virtue of \n     reflecting customary international law. It will be discussed \n     below under customary law.\n\n\n        the international covenant on civil and political rights\n\n       In an effort to follow up the Declaration with a series of \n     binding treaties, in 1966 the United Nations General Assembly \n     unanimously approved the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, which entered into force on 23 March 1976. \n     The following year, it was signed by the Carter \n     Administration and on 23 February 1978, it was submitted to \n     the Senate for its advice and consent.\n       In 1991, President Bush asked the Senate to consider the \n     treaty, and hearings were held late that year in the Foreign \n     Relations Committee, which recommended approval of the treaty \n     by a unanimous vote (19-0). On 2 April 1992, the Senate \n     consented to the ratification of the treaty with a variety of \n     proposed reservations, understandings, and declarations\\12\\; \n     and the instrument of ratification was deposited with the \n     United Nations on 8 June of that year with the recommended \n     additions--none of which apply directly to the\n      issue at hand.\\13\\ The United States thus joined more than \n     100 other States in assuming a solemn international legal \n     obligation to abide by the terms of the Covenant.\n       It is perhaps worth noting that the unanimous report of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee on this treaty categorized the \n     ``rights enumerated in the Covenant'' as being ``the \n     cornerstone of a democratic society.''\\14\\\n       The Covenant was designed to be a legally-binding \n     international treaty setting forth ``inalienable rights'' \n     which were ``derive[d] from the inherent dignity of the human \n     person.''\\15\\ Article 12 of the Covenant provides:\n\n                               Article 12\n\n       1. Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, \n     within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement \n     and freedom to choose his residence.\n       2. Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including \n     his own.\n       3. The above mentioned rights shall not be subject to any \n     restrictions except those which are provided by law, are \n     necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre \n     public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms \n     of others, and are consistent with the other rights \n     recognized in the present Covenant.\n       4. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to \n     enter his own country. [Italic emphasis added.]\\16\\\n       The American Society of International Law commissioned an \n     excellent study of The Movement of Persons Across Borders, \n     edited by two of the nation's foremost scholars in this area \n     (Professors Louis B. Sohn and Thomas Buergenthal), which \n     provides important background on the interpretation of the \n     Article 12 of the Covenant. Among other things, the authors \n     note that one of the reasons Article 12 was written was that, \n     ``[n]otwithstanding Article 13(2) of the . . . [Declaration], \n     some countries prevent their nationals from leaving, \n     prescribe unreasonable conditions such as exacting taxes or \n     confiscating property . . . [emphasis added]''\\17\\\n       While Article 12 embodies a ``fundamental right,'' it is \n     not an ``absolute right'' in the sense that a State may not \n     legitimately place some reasonable restrictions by law on the \n     right of emigration. In addition to preventing individuals \n     accused of serious crimes from leaving,\\18\\ for example, it \n     is clear that a State may require a citizen to pay any normal \n     tax obligations or other public debts.\\19\\ However, people \n     who wish to emigrate may not lawfully be required to \n     surrender their ``personal property,'' and ``Property or the \n     proceeds thereof which cannot be taken out of the country \n     shall remain vested in the departing owner, who shall be free \n     to dispose of such property or proceeds within the \n     country.''\\20\\\n       It seems to me that a key issue with respect to the \n     proposed US ``exit tax'' is whether or not it represents a \n     normal tax obligation applicable to all citizens irrespective \n     of their wish to emigrate. To the extent that it constitutes \n     a special requirement on individuals because of their desire \n     to emigrate, then the Government would presumably have the \n     burden under the Covenant of establishing that the law is \n     ``necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre \n     public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms \n     of others. . . .''\\21\\\n       It may be relevant that efforts were made during the \n     drafting of Article 12 to broaden this list of permissible \n     exceptions to include such concepts as promoting a State's \n     ``general welfare'' and ``economic and social well-being,'' \n     and these were rejected as being\n      ``too far-reaching.''\\22\\ Restrictions on freedom of \n     movement were only to be permitted in ``exceptional'' \n     circumstances.\\23\\ Professor Louis Henkin, of Columbia Law \n     School, has noted that: The Covenant . . . is not to be \n     read like a technical commercial instrument, but ``as an \n     instrument of constitutional dimension which elevates the \n     protection of the individual to a fundamental principle of \n     international public policy.'' Rights are to be read \n     broadly, and limitations on rights should be read \n     narrowly, to accord with that design.\\24\\\n       This view is widely shared by other experts in the \n     field.\\25\\ Discussing Article 12 in a lengthy 1987 article in \n     the Hofsta Law Review, a group of four attorneys from the New \n     York firm of White & Case concluded: Although it is accepted \n     that there may be restrictions imposed on the right to \n     emigrate, these restrictions are of an exceptional character \n     and must be strictly and narrowly construed. The right to \n     emigrate is primary; the restrictions on that right are \n     subordinate and may not be so construed as to destroy the \n     right itself.\\26\\\n       For the record, the United States is now also to the \n     International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Racial Discrimination, which prohibits barring freedom of \n     movement (and many other enumerated rights) on the basis of \n     ``race, colour, or national or ethnic origin''\\27\\--however, \n     this treaty does not appear to be relevant to the issue at \n     hand. There are several other international conventions which \n     guarantee the right to emigrate, including regional \n     agreements underlying the European, African, and Inter-\n     American human rights systems. However, the United States is \n     not a Party to these, so in the interest of time I have not \n     addressed their specifics. (While they do serve as evidence \n     of customary legal obligations, in this area the statutory \n     language of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment [discussed infra] \n     assures that the United States is bound by customary law in \n     this area.)\n\n\n              other international instruments of relevance\n\n       As already noted, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n     was intended to be aspirational and not legally binding upon \n     the 48 States that voted to approve it. Because it reflects \n     customary law, it will be discussed under that heading--but \n     it also stands as an important non-treaty human rights \n     document.\n       Another very important international document clearly not \n     intended to create binding legal rights was the Final Act of \n     the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     (Helsinki Accords), which expressly incorporated the \n     Declaration.\\28\\ Time has precluded me from addressing these \n     types of instruments further, but they are probably not \n     critical to a resolution of the issue.\n\n\n                      customary international law\n\n       Perhaps the most important written source of customary \n     international law\\29\\ is the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights, approved as a UN General Assembly Resolution on 10 \n     November 1948 and already noted above. The Declaration \n     provides:\n\n                               Article 13\n\n       1. Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and \n     residence within the borders of each State.\n       2. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including \n     his own, and to return to his country.\\30\\\n       During the debate on the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in 1974 \n     (discussed infra), this document was occasionally portrayed \n     as an international treaty designed to create legal \n     rights.\\31\\ In reality, its only ``legal'' value is as \n     evidence of binding customary law. This may be important \n     background for the discussion which follows, because the \n     Soviet Union voted against Article 13 during the drafting \n     process and did not vote in favor of the Declaration itself \n     in the General Assembly. With a few exceptions, which are not \n     relevant to the issue at hand,\\32\\ rules of International Law \n     are established by the consent of States. This can be done \n     explicitly by ratifying a treaty or other international \n     agreement, or \n     [[Page S5312]] it may be done implicitly by taking part in \n     the development of a consistent and general practice accepted \n     as law. But--again, with some exceptions\\33\\--a State is not \n     considered bound by customary legal rules against which it \n     clearly protested during formation. Thus, it is at least \n     arguable\\34\\ that the Soviet Union was not bound by the \n     Declaration as customary law in 1974.\n\n\n                    The 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment\n\n       Mr. Chairman, it may be worth noting this Committee, and \n     the United States Congress, have played a prominent role in \n     the affirmation of customary international law governing the \n     right of citizens to emigrate without having to pay \n     burdensome special taxes. I believe that Chairman Packwood, \n     Majority Leader Dole, and Senator Roth are the only current \n     members of the Finance Committee who served in the Senate \n     during the Ninety-Third Congress, so it may be useful to \n     review the history of the ``Jackson-Vanik'' Amendment--also \n     known as the ``Freedom of Emigration'' Amendment\\35\\--briefly \n     at this time. I remember it reasonably clearly, for, as I \n     mentioned, I was serving at the time on the staff of Senator \n     Bob Griffin and I followed the Amendment closely.\n       As reported out of this committee, Section 402 of the Trade \n     Act of 1974 (H.R. 10710) included the House-passed ``Vanik \n     Amendment''\\36\\ which prohibited the President from granting \n     ``nondiscriminatory tariff treatment'' to any ``non-market \n     economy country'' which ``imposes more than a nominal tax, \n     levy, fine, fee or other charge on any citizen as a \n     consequence of the desire of such citizen to emigrate to the \n     country of his choice.''\\37\\ In its accompanying report, this \n     Committee referred to the ``right to emigrate'' as a ``basic \n     human right. . . .''\\38\\\n       When the trade bill reached the Senate floor in mid-\n     December 1974, this provision was strengthened by the \n     enactment of the famous ``Jackson Amendment'' (with the final \n     language affirming the right of emigration thus widely \n     referred to as the ``Jackson-Vanik Amendment''). Although \n     strongly opposed by the Ford Administration as an impediment \n     to detente with the Soviet Union, and Jackson Amendment was \n     introduced in the Senate with 78 co-sponsors.\\39\\ \n     Significantly, it received a unanimous vote after a lengthy \n     (if entirely one-sided) floor debate.\\40\\ The three current \n     members of this Committee who served in the Senate at the \n     time were co-sponsors of the Jackson Amendment\\41\\ and voted \n     for its passage.\\42\\\n       In testimony before this committee, the legendary Hans J. \n     Morgenthau, at the time Leonard Davis Distinguished Professor \n     of Political Science at the City University of New York, \n     characterized the right of emigration as ``one of the tests \n     of civilized government.''\\43\\ Senator Dole termed it a \n     ``fundamental freedom,'' and described the Soviet requirement \n     that citizens seeking to emigrate first pay a ``diploma tax'' \n     to reimburse the State for its investment in their education \n     as being in conflict with ``America's traditional concern for \n     the rights of individuals.''\\44\\ Addressing the Senate \n     following passage of his amendment, Senator Jackson noted \n     that the ``fundamental human right to emigrate'' was \n     guaranteed ``in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n     which was adopted unanimously 26 years ago this week.''\\45\\ \n     As enacted into law (19 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2432), the provision \n     provides in part: Sec. 2432. Freedom of emigration in East-\n     West trade. . . . (a) To assure the continued dedication of \n     the United States to fundamental human rights, and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or after . . . \n     January 3, 1995, products from any nonmarket economy country \n     shall not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment \n     (most-favored-nation treatment), such country shall not \n     participate in any program of the Government of the United \n     States which extends credits or credit guarantees or \n     investment guarantees, directly, or indirectly, and the \n     President of the United States shall not conclude any \n     commercial agreement with any such country, during the period \n     beginning with the date on which the President determines \n     that such country--\n       (1) denies its citizens the right or opportunity to \n     emigrate;\n       (2) imposes more than a nominal tax on emigration or on the \n     visas or other documents required for emigration, for any \n     purpose or cause whatsoever, or\n       (3) imposes more than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee, or \n     other charge on any citizen as a consequence of the desire of \n     such citizen to emigrate to the country of his choice,\n\n     and ending on the date on which the President determines that \n     such country is no longer in violation of paragraph (1), (2), \n     or (3).\\46\\\n       Even if you conclude that the proposed exit tax is not in \n     conflict with the terms of the Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, it strikes me that--given in particular \n     this Committee's and the Senate's unanimous support for the \n     Jackson-Vanik Amendment--careful consideration ought to be \n     given to whether this proposal complies with that standard as \n     well.\n\n\n      reconciling the proposed us ``exit tax'' with jackson-vanik\n\n       Subjectively, of course, all of us can presumably agree \n     that there is a substantial difference in the motivation \n     behind the proposed US ``exit tax'' and the impediments \n     placed in the path of Soviet Jews (and others) in the early \n     1970s designed clearly to discourage emigration (especially \n     by dissident Jews to Israel). The United States \n     understandably does not wish to lose the substantial sums in \n     tax revenues which the Treasury Department projects could be \n     lost if especially wealthy US citizens elect to renounce \n     their citizenship and emigrate to foreign points.\n       While one might normally view this as a ``political'' \n     problem for Congress to factor in to the drafting of the tax \n     laws--how to extract maximum tax revenues from the wealthy \n     without exceeding the point that the ``geese that lay the \n     golden eggs'' will fly off to find a more hospitable \n     environment in which to do business\\47\\--there are obvious \n     political attractions to the exit tax approach. Presumably \n     few constituents will be directly affected by this \n     legislation (and ``soaking the rich'' is not all that \n     unpopular with many Americans of more ordinary means in these \n     troubled times), and in order to be subject to the special \n     ``tax'' an individual will have to renounce his or her \n     American citizenship--in the process surrendering their right \n     to vote in any case. One can see how this might have appeared \n     to be a virtually cost-free (from a political standpoint) way \n     to raise a couple of billion additional dollars over the next \n     five or six years.\\48\\\n       From the standpoint of International Law, however, it may \n     be more difficult to make the distinction between the old \n     Soviet practice of charging a special ``diploma tax'' to \n     compel citizens who wish to emigrate to compensate the State \n     for its investment in their education, and the proposed US \n     ``exit tax'' designed to compel citizens who wish to emigrate \n     to compensate the State for income taxes they would likely \n     eventually owe if they remained citizens. (It would not be \n     illegal under these rules of International Law for the United \n     States to tax unrealized capital gains annually, or for the \n     Soviets to charge a fee for providing an education--the legal \n     issue arises when people who seek to emigrate are treated \n     less favorably than others because of their decision to \n     exercise their legal right to emigrate.)\n       To be sure, we can probably agree that the old Soviet \n     regime was made up of ``bad guys,'' and our own government is \n     much ``nicer.'' Even as many of us search around for \n     professional assistance in reducing our own tax liabilities, \n     it is probably true that most Americans have a visceral \n     antipathy for ``tax dodgers.'' Nor do many of us identify \n     very closely with individuals who would voluntarily renounce \n     their American citizenship as a means of reducing tax \n     liability. While it may be in part that our relatively more \n     limited liability makes their decision difficult to \n     comprehend, I like to think that most of us view our status \n     as American citizens as among our most cherished rights. Many \n     of us still recall Sir Walter Scott's moving words, as we \n     read them in high school in Hale's ``A Man Without a \n     Country'':\n\n     Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,\n     Who never to himself hath said,\n     This is my own, my native land!\n     Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd\n     As home his footsteps he hath turn'd\n     from wandering on a foreign strand!\n     If such there breathe, go, mark him well;\n     For him no Minstrel raptures swell;\n     High though his titles, proud his name,\n     Boundless his wealth as a wish can claim;\n     Despite those titles, power, and pelf,\n     the wretch, concentered all in self,\n     Living, shall forfeit fair renown,\n     And, doubly dying, shall go down\n     to the vile dust, from whence he sprung,\n     Unwept, unhonor'd, and unsung.\\49\\\n\n       I suspect that the outcry from your constituents over the \n     proposed exit tax--even if it is perceived as nothing more \n     than an effort to ``stick it to rich expatriates''--is not \n     likely to be very considerable.\n\n\n           congress may by statute violate international law\n\n       Perhaps I should make one additional point. The United \n     States belongs to the dualist school and views municipal and \n     international law as being separate, if often \n     interrelated,\\50\\ legal systems. United States courts will \n     thus first attempt to reconcile the language of apparently \n     inconsistent statutes and treaties, but if that proves \n     unreasonable, they will apply the ``later in time'' doctrine \n     (lex posterior derogat priori) and give legal effect to the \n     instrument of most recent date.\\51\\ The theory underlying \n     this policy is that treaties and statutes have a co-equal \n     standing as ``supreme law of the land,''\\52\\ and the \n     lawmaking authority--be it the two chambers of the \n     Legislative Branch acting with the approval (or over the \n     veto) of the Executive,\\53\\ or the Executive acting with the \n     consent of\n      two-thirds of those Senators present and voting\\54\\--is \n     presumed to know the existing law when it acts and to \n     intend the logical consequences of its actions. Thus, if \n     the Congress enacts the provision in question and it is \n     subsequently challenged as contrary to the nation's solemn \n     treaty commitments, American courts will not strike down \n     the statute because of the treaty. Similarly, while some \n     scholars quarrel with the rationale,\\55\\ the oft-cited \n     1900 Supreme Court case of The Paquete Habana held that \n     customary international law (``the customs and usages of \n     civilized nations'') is part of US law ``where there is no \n     treaty and no controlling executive or legislative act or \n     judicial decision. . . .''\\56\\ Furthermore, while the \n     recently ratified Covenant clearly creates a solemn legal \n     obligation upon the United States under International Law, \n     it is not self-executing\\57\\ and thus will not be \n     implemented by US courts in the absence of independent \n     legislative authority.\\58\\\n       [[Page S5313]] However, this is not to say that Congress \n     has the legal power to relieve the United States from its \n     solemn treaty obligations under International Law. On the \n     contrary, no such right exists (unless the relevant treaty \n     provides for termination by act of a national legislature), \n     and if the Congress elects to approve a statute that is \n     contrary to the Covenant it will make the United States a \n     lawbreaker.\n       To be sure, Congress in the past has on occasion enacted \n     legislation which placed the Nation in such a status.\\59\\ \n     Such a decision has consequences, however. Not only might \n     other treaty Parties have available meaningful remedies under \n     International Law,\\60\\ but violations of International Law by \n     the United States contributes to a lack of respect for the \n     rule of law in general and greatly undermines the ability of \n     the United States to pressure other States to comply with \n     such rules. Thus, in particular when the issue involves \n     solemn undertakings in the area of international human \n     rights, one would hope that legislators would be careful to \n     avoid even the appearance of breaching provisions of a \n     treaty.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Mr. Chairman, as I indicated when I began, I did not come \n     here this morning with the intention of taking a definitive \n     position on this legislation on the merit. Because the \n     invitation to take part in the hearing came with such short \n     notice, I have not been able to analyze the issue to the \n     extent I might have wished. The comments which follow are \n     offered with more than a little hesitation and uncertainty.\n       I have primarily tried to set forth the basic international \n     legal rules in my testimony, and I suspect that honorable men \n     and women might reach different conclusions when applying \n     those rules to this bill. I came into the hearing with some \n     reservations, but it may be that after I have heard other \n     perspectives I will be less concerned about the compatibility \n     of the ``exit tax'' with Article 12 of the Universal Covenant \n     on Civil and Political Rights.\n       Even if that occurs, however, it still leaves us with the \n     perhaps more difficult problem of reconciling this tax with \n     the spirit and language of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment. \n     I'm not going to pre-judge that issue for you, either, other \n     than to say that I personally find it somewhat more \n     troubling. If this were merely a statute providing that \n     citizens must ``pay their lawful taxes'' before they may \n     renounce their citizenship and move to a foreign State they \n     find more attractive, I think it could pass legal muster with \n     little difficult.\\61\\ But I'm not sure that's the situation. \n     You understand the tax system for better than I do, and I \n     will defer to your expertise in the final analysis.\n       As I stressed at the beginning, I am not even arguably an \n     authority on the tax code; but it is my initial impression \n     that the proposed ``exit tax'' is designed to impose an \n     immediate and substantial financial burden upon citizens--on \n     the specific and expressed grounds that they have elected to \n     renounce their citizenship and emigrate--and that this is a \n     burden that would not be imposed upon otherwise identically \n     situated citizens who elected to remain American citizens \n     (and did not elect to sell or dispose of their property or \n     take other action that would realize capital gains \n     liability).\n       If that is true, in all candor, I think I would want my \n     money ``upon front'' if I were asked to argue before an \n     international tribunal that the proposed US exit tax complies \n     with the spirit of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment--which no less \n     an authority that the United States Congress argued reflected \n     the minimal requirements of International Law two decades \n     ago. (I think I would base my Jackson-Vanik case upon the \n     technicality that the United States is not covered because it \n     does not have a ``non-market economy''--but the underlying \n     rule of customary international law is not so qualified and \n     could not be evaded by that consideration. Trying to argue \n     that international human rights standards have declined since \n     1974 would clearly not pass the ``straight face'' test.)\n       I have not had time to research the issue, but my \n     recollection is that in the recent past, Congress--or at \n     least many members of Congress--have pressured the Executive \n     to apply the Jackson-Vanik principle to trade with the \n     People's Republic of China. Certainly many members continue \n     to feel passionately about human rights issues, and to urge \n     the President to identify and put pressure on other States \n     who fail to comply with fundamental treaty norms in this \n     important area. Unless someone can do a better job that I \n     have in distinguishing an exit tax targeted at ``rich \n     Americans'' from one aimed at ``educated Jews,'' however, you \n     may find as a practical matter that you will need to make a \n     choice between enacting this provision and attempting in the \n     years ahead to uphold the Jackson-Vanik Amendment and similar \n     human rights norms. If this provision is enacted into law, I \n     believe the odds are good that future US protests calling \n     upon China, Iraq (which last month imposed an exit tax of its \n     own to curtain the flow of capital), Iran, and other flagrant \n     human rights violators to comply with the provisions of the \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will receive in reply \n     a reference to American ``violations'' of Article 12.\n       Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared statement. I will \n     be happy to attempt to answer any questions you or your \n     colleagues might have.\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Inter alia, this provision would amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code by adding this language: If any United States \n     citizen relinquishes his citizenship during a taxable year, \n     all property held by such citizen at the time immediately \n     before such relinquishment shall be treated as sold at such \n     time for its fair market value and any gain or loss shall be \n     taken into account for such taxable year.\n     That the ``exit'' is designed to affect a relatively small \n     portion of the population is clear from the fact that the \n     first $600,000 of gross income is excluded from this \n     provision. According to the State Department 697 US citizens \n     expatriated in 1993 and 858 the following year. ``It is not \n     yet known how many of these former citizens, if any, will be \n     subjected to tax under section 877.'' Joint Committee on \n     Taxation, Description of Revenue Provisions Contained in the \n     President's Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Proposal 17 n.6 (Feb. 17, \n     1995). The fact that the Treasury Department anticipates more \n     than $2 billion in additional revenues from this provision by \n     FY 2000 suggests either that many expatriates will be covered \n     or that the few covered will be hit with rather substantial \n     additional tax bills under this provision.

A \n     thorough discussion of this issue is precluded by the short \n     time available to prepare this testimony. Some human rights \n     principles have this status--it is doubtful that this is one \n     of them. The issue is of only academic interest given the \n     strong statement of the right to emigrate as constituting \n     binding International Law contained in the Jackson-Vanik \n     Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act (discussed below). Thus, the \n     United States could hardly protest that it is not bound by \n     this rule and claim to have protested against its creation.\n     \\33\\Jus congens rules (discussed supra) bind all States, and \n     newly-formed States are bound by all rules of customary law \n     in existence when they are created.\n     \\34\\In reality, a strong case can be made that the Soviet \n     Union was bound by this provision of the Declaration in 1974. \n     Among other things, abstention in the General Assembly does \n     not constitute an adequate ``protest'' to protect against \n     being bound (although it does not constitute ``consent'' \n     either). The following year the issue was arguably resolved \n     when Moscow signed the Helsinki Accords (which, as discussed \n     supra, incorporated the text of the Declaration.) While the \n     Helsinki Accords were not designed to be legally binding in \n     themselves, Moscow's acceptance of the principles of the \n     Declaration would undercut any Soviet claim that it objected \n     to these principles as customary law.\n     \\35\\See, e.g., Senate Report No. 93-1298 (Committee on \n     Finance), reprinted in 4 U.S. Code Congressional & Admin. \n     News 7338 (93d Cong., 2d Sess., 1974) (hereinafter cited as \n     Finance Committee Report).\n     \\36\\This amendment, introduced by Representative Charles \n     Vanik, was approved on the House floor on 11 December 1974 by \n     a vote of 319-80.

J. INT'L L. 602 \n     (1993).\n                 Prepared Statement of Jamison S. Borek\n\n       Thank you Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I am \n     here today to address the question whether section 5 of H.R. \n     831 as reported by the Senate Committee on Finance raises \n     legal questions concerning international human rights.\n       The proposal in section 5 would effectively require payment \n     of taxes by U.S. citizens on gains, if they have such gains, \n     if they elect to renounce U.S. citizenship, by treating this \n     as equivalent to a realization of gains (or losses) by sale. \n     The proposal would only apply to gains in excess of $600,000; \n     it would not apply to U.S. real property owned directly, nor \n     to certain pension plans.\n       It has been suggested by some that this proposal would \n     violate the right to leave the territory of a state \n     (including one's country of nationality) or the right to \n     change one's citizenship as recognized in international human \n     rights law. In our view, however, this tax proposal does not \n     conflict with these or any other international human rights.\n       Section 5 is not an ``exit tax''. It does not apply to the \n     act of emigration and is wholly unrelated to travel. Rather, \n     it applies at the time an individual renounces U.S. \n     citizenship. Based on past experience, the proposal is most \n     likely to affect U.S. citizens who have already departed from \n     the United States. It is well established, nonetheless, that \n     a state could impose economic controls in connection with \n     departure as long as such controls do not result in a de \n     facto denial of an individual's right to emigrate.\n       Similarly, a claim of violation of the right to renounce \n     citizenship could only be made where that right is \n     effectively denied. There is no international law right to \n     avoid taxes by changing citizenship. Section 5 would impose \n     taxes comparable to those which U.S. citizens would have to \n     pay were they in the United States. It is a bona fide means \n     of collecting taxes on gains which have already accrued. It \n     is not a pretext to keep people from leaving, and it is not \n     so burdensome as effectively to preclude change of \n     nationality or emigration. It applies only to gains, and only \n     when these gains are in excess of $600,000.\n       In short, it is the view of the Department of State that \n     this proposal does not raise any significant question of \n     interference with international human rights.\n       I hope that this information is helpful to the Committee.\n                                       University of Virginia,\n\n                              Charlottesville, VA; March 20, 1995.\n     Leslie B. Samuels,\n     Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, U.S. \n         Department of the Treasury.\n       Dear Mr. Samuels: I have been asked to offer an opinion as \n     to whether the Administration's proposal to treat the \n     renunciation of U.S. citizenship as a realization event with \n     respect to wealthy taxpayers presents any problems under \n     international law, particularly in light of the position the \n     United States has taken in the past with respect to the \n     freedom to emigrate. As I find myself in the unusual position \n     of being a specialist in international law, U.S.-Soviet \n     relations, and federal taxation, I am happy to do so.\n       The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 and \n     the 1975 Helsinki Accords both express a strong U.S. stand in \n     favor of the freedom of people of emigrate free of more than \n     ``a nominal tax,'' 19 U.S.C. Sec. 2432(a)(2), and there is \n     substantial authority for the proposition that the \n     international law of human rights incorporates the obligation \n     to refrain from erecting such impediments to emigration. But \n     it is critical to recognize the distinction between the right \n     to travel, on the one hand, and the right to change one's \n     citizenship status, on the other. Emigration necessarily \n     involves the former, but not necessarily the latter. The \n     human rights concerns that dominated our encounters with the \n     Soviet Union and other totalitarian regimes during the 1970s \n     and 1980s were based on violations of the right to travel. \n     Those governments treated their borders as the perimeter of a \n     prison and their citizens as prisoners. The so-called \n     education tax that the Soviet Union threatened to impose on \n     emigrants, which inspired the above cited language in the \n     Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was triggered by a request to travel \n     abroad, not by an attempt to renounce Soviet citizenship. \n     Whether the communist regimes also made it difficult to \n     surrender citizenship was a matter of indifference to us. \n     Indeed, many authorities believed that the Soviet Union and \n     other governments violated international law by making it too \n     easy to lose one's citizenship, as they did when they imposed \n     involuntary loss of citizenship as a form of punishment for \n     political dissent (e.g., the case of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn).\n       The Administration's proposal, as I understand it, has \n     absolutely no effect on the right of a citizen to travel \n     abroad. It is triggered only by a change of citizenship \n     status, not by the crossing of the country's borders. The \n     reason for this distinction is clear when one considers how \n     U.S. tax rules operate. Whether a citizen resides within or \n     without the United States, the obligation to pay tax on \n     appreciation of assets remains the same. Any gain realized \n     and recognized during life will result in an income tax. Any \n     unrealized appreciation that remains at death will not be \n     subject to an income tax, but instead will subject the \n     decedent to the estate tax. To be sure, the federal estate \n     tax is not an exact substitute for an income tax at death on \n     unrealized appreciation, both because only wealthy persons \n     (those with assets in excess of $600,000, assuming no taxable \n     gifts during life) are subject to the estate tax, and\n      because the taxable estate includes both realized and \n     unrealized appreciation. But I am not alone in having \n     pointed out that the estate and gift tax, in practice, \n     serve as a reasonable approximation for the income tax \n     that could be levied on unrealized appreciation at death.\n       All of the above turns on citizenship, not on residence. A \n     U.S. citizen who resides abroad will have to include in his \n     tax base any gain realized from the disposition of an asset, \n     see Cook v. Tait, 265 U.S. 47 (1924), will pay a federal gift \n     tax on any taxable gift during his life, no matter where the \n     asset is located, and will include all of his worldwide \n     assets in his taxable estate at death. By contrast, a citizen \n     who severs the bond of citizenship and does not continue to \n     reside in the United States will pay neither income, gift, \n     nor estate tax (except as U.S.-sourced income and, for the \n     estate and gift tax, transfers of certain property sourced to \n     the United States). The change of citizenship status, not of \n     residence, is what matters for U.S. tax law. Current law \n     recognizes the significance of change sin citizenship by \n     subjecting nonresident aliens who lose U.S. citizenship for \n     tax avoidance reasons to a special alternative income tax, \n     see Internal Revenue Code Section 877. Section 2107 imposes a \n     similar result with respect to the estate tax, and 2501(a)(3) \n     with respect to the gift tax. What the Administration \n     proposal would do, as I understand it, is replace the \n     unworkable tax avoidance standard of Sections 877, 2107 and \n     2501(a)(3) with a per se rule that applies to any person with \n     sufficient assets to make future estate taxation a \n     probability. An analogous provision is Section 367 of the \n     Code, which denies nonrecognition treatment in certain \n     corporate reorganizations if the recipient of appreciated \n     property is a foreign corporation. I never have heard the \n     argument that the latter provision imposes an impermissible \n     burden on the right of a domestic corporation to export its \n     capital.\n       In summary, the international law of human rights is \n     concerned with restrictions on the right to leave one's \n     country, not those on the right to renounce one's \n     citizenship. To the extent human rights law deals with \n     citizenship status, it addresses involuntary denials of \n     citizenship, not burdens triggered by the renunciation of \n     citizenship. Furthermore, the proposed measure is not a tax \n     on the export of capital as such, but rather a logical part \n     of a comprehensive scheme to ensure that all appreciation of \n     capital owned by a U.S. citizen eventually will be subject to \n     a U.S. tax, whether income, gift, or estate. For these \n     reasons, it is inconceivable to me that the Administration's \n     proposal could be seen as violating international human \n     rights law.\n       To be sure, there are few positions with respect to \n     customary international law that \n     [[Page S5315]] cannot obtain the support of at least some \n     jurists. Last Saturday, while passing through Pittsburgh's \n     airport, I ran into my former student, Bob Turner, who \n     informed me of his intention to testify before the Senate \n     Finance Committee to the effect that the proposal did raise \n     problems under international law. As I told him at the time, \n     I found his arguments unconvincing. However, I am responsible \n     only for Bob's education in Soviet law, not in international \n     or tax law.\n       I hope this letter is useful. Please feel free to make \n     whatever use of it you wish.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Paul B. Stephan III.\n                                      One International Place,\n\n                                       Boston, MA, March 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Packwood,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Daniel P. Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Packwood and Senator Moynihan: I would like \n     to comment on the provisions of Section 5 of H.R. 831 as \n     reported by the Committee on Finance (the ``Committee \n     Bill'').\n       I am a partner in the law firm Ropes & Gray in Boston, \n     where I practice international tax law on behalf of U.S. and \n     non-U.S. corporate and individual clients. Prior to joining \n     Ropes & Gray, I served as International Tax Counsel to the \n     U.S. Treasury Department. Altogether, I served in the \n     Treasury Department for five years during the Reagan \n     Administration.\n       Although I am Vice Chairman of the American Bar Association \n     Section of Taxation's Committee on Foreign Activities of U.S. \n     Taxpayers and an active member of several other bar and \n     professional associations, my comments are not made as a \n     representative of Ropes & Gray or any of its clients, the \n     American Bar Association Tax Section or any of the other bar \n     or professional associations of which I am a member. My \n     comments are directed exclusively to tax policy aspects of \n     the proposal in the Committee Bill to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by adding proposed Section \n     877A.\\1\\ Subject to certain technical comments referred to \n     below, I strongly support enactment of proposed Section 877A.\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                       Description of Current Law\n\n       The United States exercises personal jurisdiction to tax \n     individuals by taxing the worldwide income of U.S. citizens \n     (whether or not resident or domiciled in the United States) \n     and residents.\\2\\ A U.S. taxpayer may elect to credit foreign \n     income taxes against his U.S. tax, subject to a limitation \n     that applies with respect to categories of foreign source \n     income to restrict the credit to the amount of U.S. tax paid \n     with respect to income in that category.\n       The United States asserts a source-based tax on nonresident \n     aliens.\\3\\ Nonresident aliens are taxed on the gross amount \n     of U.S.-source interest, dividends, rents, and other fixed or \n     determinable income at a flat rate of 30 percent (or a lower \n     treaty rate). This tax generally is collected by withholding. \n     A nonresident alien is taxed at regular graduated rates on \n     income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or \n     business, less deductions that are properly allocable to the \n     effectively connected income. A nonresident alien individual \n     is allowed a foreign tax credit under Section 906 only for \n     foreign taxes paid with respect to income effectively \n     connected with a U.S. trade or business.\n       Under current law, the only income tax provision governing \n     a change from citizenship to non-citizenship status is \n     Section 877, first enacted in 1966. Under Section 877, a U.S. \n     citizen who relinquishes his U.S. citizenship with a \n     principal purpose to avoid Federal income tax is taxed either \n     as a nonresident alien or under an alternative taxing method, \n     whichever yields the greater tax, for 10 years after \n     expatriation. For purposes of determining the tax under the \n     alternative method, gains on the sale of property located in \n     the United States and stocks and securities issued by U.S. \n     persons are treated as U.S.-source income, taxable at rates \n     applicable to U.S. citizens.\\4\\\n       Whether tax avoidance is a principal purpose for the \n     expatriation is determined by all of the relevant facts and \n     circumstances. If the I.R.S. establishes that it is \n     reasonable to believe that the loss of U.S. citizenship would \n     result in a substantial reduction in the taxpayer's income \n     taxes for the year (taking account of U.S. and foreign \n     taxes), the burden of proving that the loss of citizenship \n     did not have tax avoidance as one of its principal purposes \n     is on the taxpayer. This presumption is rebuttable.\\5\\\n       A foreign tax credit is not allowed for foreign taxes on \n     income that is deemed to be U.S.-source income under the \n     alternative method. The effect of the source rules generally \n     is to transform foreign income that would not be effectively \n     connected income into U.S. gross income. Because Section \n     877(c) does not cause the income to be effectively connected \n     income, the Section 906 foreign tax credit will not apply. \n     Any foreign taxes imposed on the income re-sourced under \n     Section 877(c) therefore would give rise to double taxation.\n       The so-called savings clause found in most modern income \n     tax treaties generally provides that the United States may \n     tax its citizens and residents as though the treaty had not \n     come into effect.\\6\\ Although the I.R.S. has published a \n     revenue ruling taking the position that the savings clause \n     preserved U.S. taxation of former citizens taxable under \n     Section 877,\\7\\ the Tax Court held in Crow v. Commissioner, \n     85 T.C. 376 (1985), that the savings clause of the 1942 \n     United States-Canada Income Tax Convention did not apply to a \n     former citizen who, it was assumed for purposes of deciding \n     petitioner's motion for summary judgment, expatriated to \n     Canada for a principal purpose of avoiding United States tax. \n     The Court found that, properly interpreted, the Convention \n     prohibited the United States from taxing the taxpayer's \n     capital gain from the sale of stock under Section 877. Based \n     on the Crow decision, it is doubtful whether the United \n     States may tax a treaty resident under Section 877 on income \n     that a treaty reserves for taxation by the country of \n     residence unless the treaty specifically preserves the U.S. \n     right to tax a Section 877 expatriate.\n       Current U.S. treaty policy is to cover Section 877 \n     expatriates under the savings clause to permit the United \n     States to tax income or gains of a Section 877 expatriate who \n     is resident in the treaty partner country notwithstanding \n     other articles of the treaty.\\8\\ Even where the savings \n     clause covers taxation of an expatriate under Section 877, \n     the coverage may be less than complete.\\9\\\n       It does not appear that treaties remedy the failure of the \n     domestic law foreign tax credit mechanism to avoid double \n     taxation under Section 877. For example, the 1980 Convention \n     between the United States and Canada allows the United States \n     to impose tax on gains from the sale of stock in a U.S. \n     company realized by a Section 877 expatriate who is resident \n     in Canada.\\10\\ Canada also would be allowed to tax the \n     gains.\\11\\ For purposes of\n      applying the foreign tax credit provisions of the \n     Convention, the gains from the sale of stock would be \n     treated as Canadian-source income,\\12\\ however, the United \n     States does not commit to allow a credit for the Canadian \n     tax.\\13\\\n\n\n                      Deficiencies of Current Law\n\n       The reason for enactment of Section 877 in 1966 was that \n     the elimination of graduated rates with respect to non-\n     effectively connected income of a nonresident alien could \n     encourage some individuals to surrender their U.S. \n     citizenship and move abroad. The 89th Congress did not have \n     any experience as to whether the other changes in taxation of \n     nonresident aliens made by the Foreign Investors Tax Act of \n     1966 would induce expatriations and chose to employ a tax \n     avoidance purpose condition to the application of Section \n     877.\n       The facts of the Furstenberg case, in which the Tax Court \n     found that the taxpayer's expatriation did not have tax \n     avoidance as a principal purpose, illustrate why a tax \n     avoidance purpose standard is ill-advised. To satisfy a \n     commitment made before her marriage to her new husband, Mrs. \n     Furstenberg renounced her U.S. citizenship immediately after \n     her honeymoon on December 23, 1975. As a result of the Tax \n     Court's decision that Section 877 did not apply, it appears \n     that Mrs. Furstenberg paid no U.S. tax on as much as $9.8 \n     million of capital gains from selling securities owned at the \n     time of her expatriation in the two years following her \n     expatriation.\n       There is ample precedent for a U.S. claim to tax \n     appreciated assets at a time when the asset will no longer be \n     subject to U.S. personal taxing jurisdiction. Under sections \n     367 and 1491, the United States overrides otherwise \n     applicable nonrecognition rules in order to tax transfers of \n     appreciated assets to foreign entities. It is accepted that \n     this principle should apply in circumstances where there is \n     no actual transfer of an asset, for example, upon the \n     termination of an election by a foreign corporation to be \n     treated as a domestic corporation under section 1504(d) or \n     when a foreign trust ceases to be a grantor trust with a U.S. \n     grantor. Amendments in 1984 to sections 367 and 1492 deleted \n     exceptions to taxation of such outbound transfers where the \n     taxpayer could establish that the transfer did not have as \n     one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income \n     taxes. The principal purpose test similarly should be deleted \n     from Section 877.\\14\\\n       A second difficulty with current Section 877 relates to the \n     assertion of U.S. taxing jurisdiction after the taxpayer has \n     renounced U.S. citizenship. At that point, the taxpayer may \n     be resident in another taxing jurisdiction that may \n     rightfully feel that it has the primary right to tax gains of \n     a resident from the sale of tangible property (other than \n     real estate in another country) and intangible property. It \n     is not surprising that there may be disagreement as to which \n     country should be considered to have the primary right to \n     tax. A tax imposed at the time of expatriation, however, \n     would accurately delineate gains properly subject to U.S. \n     taxing jurisdiction. This would improve the position of the \n     United States if it asks treaty partners to increase a \n     taxpayer's basis in property taxed by the United States on \n     expatriation for purposes of taxation by the treaty partner. \n     If taxation at the time of expatiation is adopted, I would \n     urge the Treasury to take such a position in treaty \n     negotiations.\n       A third problem with current Section 877 is that it is \n     easily avoided. I quote from a 1993 article published in Tax \n     Notes International:\n       ``Even for those nonresident former U.S. citizens with \n     substantial U.S. assets and income, there are techniques that \n     can greatly reduce the impact of the anti-abuse rules by \n     [[Page S5316]] converting U.S. income and assets into foreign \n     income and assets or by deferring income and taxable \n     transfers until after the 10-year period under the anti-abuse \n     rules has expired.\n       For example, consider the plight of a tax-motivated former \n     U.S. citizen living abroad and owning a portfolio of U.S. \n     stocks and bonds. Without taking any measures, such a person \n     would be subject to U.S. income tax on interest, dividends \n     and capital gain from the portfolio and would be subject to a \n     U.S. estate and gift tax on taxable transfer of assets in the \n     portfolio. Such an individual could, however, transfer the \n     portfolio to a foreign corporation that is not engaged in a \n     U.S. trade or business with drastically more favorable \n     results.\n       For income tax purposes, the foreign corporation would \n     itself be taxed in the same manner as an NRA who had never \n     been a U.S. citizen (i.e., gross U.S.-source dividends would \n     be subject to a flat 30-percent-or-lower withholding tax, \n     certain types of U.S.-source interest would be subject to a \n     similar flat withholding tax while other types of U.S.-source \n     interest would be exempt under the portfolio interest or \n     other exemptions and capital gains would be exempt from tax \n     unless real estate related).\n       While a sale of stock in the foreign corporation by the \n     former U.S. citizen would be treated as taxable U.S.-source \n     income under the anti-abuse rule, as sale of the U.S. stocks \n     and securities in the portfolio by the foreign corporation \n     would not. Moreover, dividends by the foreign corporation to \n     its shareholders would be foreign-source, and therefore free \n     from U.S. tax, even if the foreign corporation's earnings out \n     of which it pays the dividends are U.S.-source interest, \n     dividends, and capital gains.'' (Footnotes omitted.)\\15\\\n       In light of the increasing sophistication of taxpayers, it \n     is not surprising that the easy pickings of tax-motivated \n     expatriation are too tempting for some to resist. Based on \n     informal discussions with the State Department, and Staff of \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation has reported that 697 \n     citizens expatriated in 1993 and 858 in 1994.\\16\\ There is \n     evidence that some of these expatriations will result in \n     substantial revenue loss as a result of the infirmities of \n     current Section 877. It is time to amend the law to address \n     current realities.\n\n\n                  description of proposed section 877a\n\n       Under the Committee Bill, a U.S. citizen who relinquishes \n     U.S. citizenship generally would be treated as having sold \n     all of his or her property at fair market value immediately \n     prior to relinquishing citizenship and gain or loss from the \n     deemed sale would be subject to U.S. income tax. In addition, \n     the deferral of tax or income recognition (e.g., due to the \n     installment method) would terminate on the date of the deemed \n     sale and the deferred tax would be due and payable on that \n     date.\n       Generally property interests that would be included in the \n     individual's gross estate under the Federal estate tax if \n     such individual were to die on the day of the deemed sale, \n     plus certain trust interests that are not otherwise included \n     in the gross estate, would be taxed on the expatriation date. \n     The first $600,000 of net gain recognized on the deemed sale \n     would be exempt from tax. If a taxpayer were determined to \n     hold an interest in a trust for purposes of Section 877A, the \n     trust would be treated as though it sold the taxpayer's share \n     of assets of the trust and the proceeds were distributed to \n     the taxpayer and recontributed to the trust.\n       U.S. real property interests, which remain subject to U.S. \n     taxing jurisdiction in the hands of nonresident aliens, \n     generally would be excepted from the proposal.\\17\\ Certain \n     interests in qualified retirement plans and, subject to a \n     limit of $500,000, interests in foreign pension plans (as \n     provided in regulations) also would be excepted from the \n     deemed sale rule.\n       A U.S. citizen would be treated as having relinquished his \n     citizenship on the earlier of (i) the date he renounces \n     citizenship before a diplomatic or consular officer, (ii) the \n     date he provides to the State department a signed statement \n     of voluntary relinquishment of citizenship confirming an act \n     of expatriation under the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n     (iii) the date that the U.S. Department of State issues a \n     certificate of loss of nationality, or (iv) the date a court \n     cancels a naturalized citizen's certificate of \n     naturalization. The tax would be due on the 90th day after \n     the expatriation date. The Internal Revenue Service would be \n     authorized to allow a taxpayer to defer payment of the tax \n     for up to 10 years under section 6161 as through the tax were \n     an estate tax imposed by chapter 11.\n       The Committee Bill's Section 877A would be effective for \n     U.S. citizens who relinquish their U.S. citizenship on or \n     after February 6, 1995. No tax would be due before 90 days \n     after enactment.\n\n\n                   analysis of proposed section 877a\n\n       The Committee Bill meets the three objections to current \n     law Section 877 described above. It deletes the tax avoidance \n     purpose test. It imposes tax on gain determined as of the \n     date a taxpayer relinquishes citizenship and thereby properly \n     measures the gain subject to U.S. personal taxing \n     jurisdiction. As a consequence of these changes it will be \n     more administrable and not subject to easy avoidance.\n       The Committee Bill also reflects several significant \n     improvements over the text released in the original version \n     of H.R. 981. The definition of when a taxpayer relinquishes \n     citizenship has been modified to relate to the earliest of \n     several substantive acts that manifest an intent to \n     voluntarily relinquish citizenship. This should adequately \n     protect taxpayers who have relied on current law. The I.R.S. \n     authority to extend the time to make payment of the tax is \n     expanded to permit deferral of up to 10 years under rules \n     that are commonly used in the estate tax context. These \n     changes are welcome.\n       I suggest another modification to the Committee Bill. I \n     recommend that an alien that becomes a naturalized citizen \n     take a ``fresh start'' fair market basis in his or her assets \n     for purposes of Section 877A. The measuring date for this \n     purpose should be the earliest of (i) the date the alien \n     becomes a naturalized citizen, (ii) the date the alien \n     becomes a resident alien, and (iii) the date the asset is \n     ``effectively connected'' with a U.S. trade or business of \n     the alien. This measure is important to support the position \n     that the U.S. claim to tax is truly related to its personal \n     or source taxing jurisdiction.\n       I reserve comment on certain technical aspects of the \n     proposal and would be pleased to work with the Committee \n     staff on the details of final legislation. In particular, I \n     do not comment, without further study, on the approach taken \n     by the Committee Bill to interests in trusts or to the \n     interaction of Section 877A with estate and gift tax rules.\n       Finally, I respectfully disagree with certain initial \n     criticisms of H.R. 981 in comments prepared by other \n     individual members of the American Bar Association.\n       The weight of scholarship rejects the view that realization \n     is or should be constitutionally required to tax gains. \n     Since, in my experience, Congress, and this Committee, \n     exercises an appropriate skepticism regarding professorial \n     musings, perhaps the more relevant precedent is that Congress \n     has enacted at least two provisions that tax gains before \n     they are realized. Section 1256 was added to the Code in 1981 \n     and provides that certain regulated futures and foreign \n     currency contracts are marked-to-market on the last day of a \n     taxpayer's taxable year and gain or loss recognized.\\18\\ \n     Section 475, enacted in 1993, requires securities dealers to \n     mark-to-market securities held in inventory on the last day \n     of the taxable year and recognize gain or loss. Moreover, \n     fairness to taxpayers as well as the Government's revenue \n     interests may require that such mark-to-market treatment be \n     expanded to a broader range of circumstances. It would be \n     extremely unwise for this Committee to adopt the holding of \n     Eisner v. Macomber\\19\\ in a way that could be viewed as \n     imposing a constitutionally-based realization requirement.\n       I also would not in any way equate the imposition by the \n     United States, in 1995, of a tax on its fair share of the \n     appreciation in assets owned by U.S. persons during their \n     period of U.S. citizenship to an exit tax imposed on Jewish \n     and politically motivated emigrants from the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics during the State-sponsored repression of \n     the Brezhnev era. A tax that excludes the first $600,000 of \n     gain can hardly be viewed as a barrier to emigration.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The Committee's proposed Section 877A is an improvement \n     over current law, is sound international tax policy and \n     deserves the strong support of your Committee.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may be of \n     assistance to the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen E.

Leslie B. Samuels,\n     Assistant Secretary (Tax Policy), Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Samuels: Your office has requested my views \n     as to international law implications of the proposed tax on \n     expatriates that would be imposed by section 5 of H.R. 831. \n     You will understand that this is my personal opinion and in \n     no way purports to represent the views of the institution to \n     which I belong. It is also compact in form due to the \n     constraints of time imposed by your legislative schedule and \n     my own impending travel.\n       The right of expatriation has always been highly valued by \n     the United States, which has defended it against the claims \n     of other nations that refused to let their citizens go. The \n     right to make this choice is the counterpart of the right not \n     to lose one's citizenship except by one's own voluntary \n     choice, a right underlined by opinions of the Supreme Court. \n     However, in my view, the proposed tax does not amount to such \n     a burden upon the right of expatriation as to constitute a \n     violation of either international law or American \n     constitutional law. It merely equalizes over the long run \n     certain tax burdens as between those who remain subject to \n     U.S. tax when they realize upon certain gains and those who \n     abandon their citizen while the property remains unsold.\n       Furthermore, the proposed tax does not except, in the most \n     indirect way, burden the right to emigrate. It is the right \n     to emigrate rather than the right to expatriate oneself which \n     is the subject of various conventions and of customary \n     international law. As stated in the preceding paragraph, it \n     basically equalizes certain tax burdens. It is not comparable \n     to the measures imposed by such countries as the former \n     Soviet Union and German Democratic Republic which were \n     obviously and intentionally burdens on the right to emigrate.\n       In arriving at these conclusions I have reviewed various \n     materials such as your statement before the Subcommittee on \n     Taxation and Internal Revenue Oversight, two opinions of the \n     Office of the Legal Adviser, U.S. State Department, the views \n     of Professors Paul Stephan III and Robert Turner and others.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Detlev F.

Leslie B. Samuels,\n     Assistant Secretary (Tax Policy), Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: You have asked for my views on section \n     5 of H.R. 831 presently pending before the U.S. Senate, which \n     as I understand it would impose a capital gains tax on United \n     States citizens who renounce their U.S. citizenship, based on \n     a hypothetical sale of all their property (subject to a \n     deduction) immediately prior to renunciation. In particular, \n     you have asked my view on whether such a tax would be \n     inconsistent with applicable treaties or principles of \n     international law.\n\n\n                      statement of qualifications\n\n       I have been a professor of law at New York University since \n     1967, specializing in international law and international \n     economic transactions. Prior to joining the faculty of New \n     York University, I served for more than five years in the \n     United States Department of State, as Special Assistant to \n     the Legal Adviser for Economic Affairs, and Deputy Legal \n     Adviser (1961-66). I was an Associate Reporter for the \n     American Law Institute's Restatement (Third) of the Foreign \n     Relations Law of the United States (1979-87), and I served as \n     consultant to the ALI Project on Income Tax Treaties (1988-\n     92).\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Without taking any position on the desirability of the \n     proposed legislation, I am confident that neither adoption \n     nor enforcement of the provision in question would violate \n     any obligation of the United States or any applicable \n     principles or international law.\n                                Analysis\n\n       There is no doubt that international law today recognizes \n     the right to emigrate, and the right to change one's \n     nationality. Article 13(2) of the universal Declaration of \n     Human Rights (1948) states.\n       Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his \n     own. . .\n       Article 15(2) states: No one shall be arbitrarily deprived \n     of his nationality nor denied the right to change his \n     nationality.\n       Without here debating the binding character of the \n     Universal Declaration (see ``Restatement (Third) of Foreign \n     Relations Law,'' introduction to Part VII, Sec. 701, and \n     notes thereto), it is clear to me that the Congress should \n     not be asked to adopt legislation that runs contrary to \n     principles to which the United States has given and continues \n     to give its support. I do not believe, however, that H.R. 831 \n     is contrary either to the right to emigrate (i.e., change of \n     one's residence) or to expatriate (i.e., change of one's \n     nationality). No prohibition against performing either or \n     both of these acts is contained in the proposed legislation, \n     nor is the tax so burdensome as to be fairly regarded as \n     penal or confiscatory.\n       Persons who wished to abandon their American Citizenship \n     for reasons of political or religious belief would not be \n     prevented from doing so by H.R. 831. Persons who were \n     considering renunciation of their U.S. citizenship for \n     purposes of reducing their tax liability--whether on income \n     or upon succession at death--might be dissuaded by H.R. 831 \n     from doing so, but I do not believe the effect of the \n     proposed tax could be classified as an arbitrary denial of \n     the right to change one's nationality within the meaning of \n     the Universal Declaration.\n       I understand that the question has been raised whether H.R. \n     831 is inconsistent with Sec. 402 of the Trade Act of 1974, \n     the so-called Jackson-Vanik Amendment. I am very familiar \n     with the amendment, having written about it in my book \n     ``Trade Controls for Political Ends'' at pp. 166-190 (2d.ed \n     1983). I am clear that the amendment was addressed to a quite \n     different purpose, i.e., inducement to Soviet authorities to \n     abandon their restrictions on Jews and some other groups who \n     desired to leave the Soviet Union to escape discrimination \n     and persecution. It is true that one of the restrictions \n     against which the Jackson-Vanik Amendment was directed was \n     taxation; however (i) the Soviet tax was a relatively high \n     tax based not on wealth or income but on the level of \n     education; and (ii) the tax was imposed on emigration, not on \n     change of citizenship or nationality. I have read the \n     prepared statement of Professor Robert F. Turner of March 21, \n     1995; I find his suggestion that H.R. 831 is somehow \n     inconsistent with the ideals expressed in the Jackson-Vanik \n     Amendment quite unpersuasive, as a matter of history, of \n     purpose, and of law.\n       On sum, imposition of unreasonable conditions on emigration \n     or change of nationality could be contrary to international \n     law. H.R. 831 imposes no restrictions on emigration; it does \n     impose some conditions on renunciation of United States \n     citizenship, but these conditions are not unreasonable, and \n     therefore not unlawful.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                         Andreas F.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Re: Tax Compliance Act of 1995, H.R. 981\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I am writing to express my serious \n     concern over the proposed ``exit tax'' included in Sec. 201 \n     of H.R. 981. This concern is based not on an evaluation of \n     its tax consequences, an area in which I am not an expert, \n     but rather on the possible inconsistency of the tax with \n     fundamental international human rights norms and U.S. \n     international legal obligations.\n       As you know, the U.S. is now a party to the Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, article 12 of which guarantees \n     the right of everyone ``to leave any country, including his \n     own.'' By coincidence, the United States will present its \n     first report on compliance with the Covenant to the Human \n     Rights Committee in New York next week.\n       Although I understand that the ``exit tax'' is based on \n     renunciation of citizenship rather than on leaving the \n     country, it is difficult to see how one can ``punish'' the \n     former without seriously compromising the latter. Indeed, the \n     imposition of confiscatory taxes has been a policy pursued by \n     many countries to discourage emigration, whether on purported \n     national security grounds, specious economic arguments, or to \n     prevent ``brain drain;'' I address these and other issues in \n     my 1987 book, ``The Right to Leave and Return in \n     International Law and Practice'' (Martinus Nijhoff).\n       In 1986, a meeting of eminent American and European legal \n     experts adopted the ``Strasbourg Declaration on the Right to \n     Leave and Return,'' a copy of which I attach for your \n     information. I would particularly \n     [[Page S5318]] draw your attention to article 5, which \n     states, inter alia, that ``[a]ny person leaving a country \n     shall be entitled to take out of that country . . . his or \n     her personal property . . . [and] all other property or the \n     proceeds thereof, subject only to the satisfaction of legal \n     monetary obligations, such as maintenance obligations to \n     family members, and to general controls imposed by law to \n     safeguard the national economy, provided that such controls \n     do not have the effect of denying the exercise of the \n     right.'' The tax in question would not appear to meet these \n     standards.\n       Without having examined the provisions of Sec. 201 in \n     greater detail, I cannot state definitively that it would \n     violate international law. However, the human rights \n     implications of such a provision appear to be extremely \n     serious, and adoption of the law would seem, at best, to be \n     hypocritical, given the legitimate and consistent U.S. \n     insistence on free emigration from other countries over the \n     years.\n       I hope that the Senate will examine these issues with great \n     deliberation before it decides to balance the budget on the \n     back of individual rights.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                                 Hurst Hannum,\n\n                                               Associate Professor\n     of International Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               APPENDIX F\n\n        Strasbourg Declaration on the Right to Leave and Return\n\n                      Adopted on 26 November 1986\n\n\n                                preamble\n\n       The Meeting of Experts on the Right to Leave and Return,\n       Recognising that respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms is essential for peace, justice and well-being and \n     is necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations \n     and co-operation among all states;\n       Recalling that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and \n     the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \n     of Racial Discrimination, as well as regional conventions, \n     recognize the fundamental principle, based on general \n     international law, that everyone has the right to leave any \n     country, including one's own, and to return to one's own \n     country;\n       Emphasizing that the right of everyone to leave any country \n     and to enter one's own country is indispensable for the full \n     enjoyment of all civil, political, economic, social and \n     cultural rights;\n       Concerned that the denial of this right is the cause of \n     widespread human suffering, a source of international \n     tensions, and an object of international concern;\n       Adopts the following Declaration:\n\n                               Article 1\n\n       Everyone has the right to leave any country, including \n     one's own, temporarily or permanently, and to enter one's own \n     country, without distinction as to race, colour, sex, \n     language, religion, political or other opinion, national or \n     social origin, property, birth, marriage, age (except for \n     unemancipated minors independently of their parents), or \n     other status.\n\n                               Article 2\n\n       Every state shall adopt such legislative or other measures \n     as may be necessary to ensure the full and effective \n     enjoyment of the rights set forth in this Declaration.\n       All laws, administrative regulations or other provisions \n     affecting the enjoyment of these rights shall be published \n     and made easily accessible.\n\n\n                           the right to leave\n\n                               Article 3\n\n       (a) No person shall be subjected to any sanction, penalty, \n     reprisal or harassment for seeking to exercise or for \n     exercising the right to leave a country, such as acts which \n     adversely affect, inter alia, employment, housing, residence \n     status or social, economic or educational benefits.\n       (b) No person shall be required to renounce his or her \n     nationality in order to leave a country, nor shall a person \n     be deprived of nationality for seeking to exercise or for \n     exercising the right to leave a country.\n       (c) No person shall be denied the right to leave a country \n     on the grounds that that person wishes to renounce or has \n     renounced his or her nationality.\n\n                               Article 4\n\n       (a) No restriction may be imposed on the right to leave \n     except those which are\n       (1) provided by law;\n       (2) necessary to protect national security, public order \n     (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and \n     freedoms of others; and\n       (3) consistent with internationally recognized human rights \n     and other international legal obligations.\n       Any such restriction shall be narrowly construed.\n       (b) Any restriction on the right to leave shall be clear, \n     specific and not subject to arbitrary application.\n       (c) A restriction shall be considered ``necessary'' only if \n     it responds to a pressing public and social need, pursues a \n     legitimate aim and is proportionate to that aim.\n       (d) A restriction based on ``national security'' may be \n     invoked only in situations where the exercise of the right \n     poses a clear, imminent and serious danger to the State. When \n     this restriction is invoked on the ground that an individual \n     acquired military secrets, the restriction shall be \n     applicable only for a limited time, appropriate to the \n     specific circumstances, which should not be more than five \n     years after the individual acquired such secrets.\n       (e) A restriction based on ``public order (ordre public)'' \n     shall be directly related to the specific interest which is \n     sought to be protected. ``Public order (ordre public)'' means \n     the universally accepted fundamental principles, consistent \n     with respect for human rights, on which a democratic society \n     is based.\n       (f) A restriction based on ``the rights and freedoms of \n     others'' shall not imply that relatives (except for parents \n     with respect to unemancipated minors), employers or other \n     persons may prevent, by withholding their consent, the \n     departure of any person seeking to leave a country.\n       (g) No fees, taxes or other exactions shall be imposed for \n     seeking to exercise or exercising the right to leave a \n     country, with the exception of nominal fees related to travel \n     documents.\n       (h) Permissibility of restrictions on the right to leave is \n     subject to international scrutiny.

Grimmet and Larry M. Eig, Legislative \n         Attorneys\n       This memorandum addresses whether legislation that would \n     tax the property of American citizens who renounce their \n     citizenship at the time of renunciation violates an \n     international obligation of the United States under a treaty \n     or other international agreement or customary international \n     law. Because of the brevity of our deadline, this memorandum \n     does not provide a detailed analysis of this question, but \n     rather briefly examines some of the more salient \n     international legal issues that might be implicated by such \n     legislation.\n       Based on this preliminary analysis, there does not appear \n     to be a clear international legal impediment to the enactment \n     of the proposed legislation. First, the legislation applies \n     upon the act of renunciation of citizenship and would thus \n     only indirectly affect emigration. While a right to emigrate \n     is recognized in national legal systems and in both binding \n     and non-binding international legal instruments, there does \n     not appear to be an obvious consensus on the content of this \n     right and, moreover, international legal instruments \n     recognize the right of emigration may be restricted for \n     certain purposes. Additionally, the proposed tax would not \n     appear to violate a norm of customary international law. It \n     would seem to be relatively common in international practice \n     for an individual to incur tax consequences as a result of \n     his or her emigration or expatriation.\n       Proposed legislation. Section 5 of H.R. 831, 104th Cong., \n     1st Sess. (1995), as reported by the Senate Finance \n     Committee, would amend federal income tax law to require that \n     property held by a United States citizen who relinquishes his \n     or her citizenship be treated as sold for its fair market \n     value at the time of relinquishment and any gain or loss be \n     taken into account for the taxable year (new 26 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 877A). Certain exceptions and conditions would apply to \n     the general rule. Items currently excluded from gross income \n     under 26 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 102 et seq. would continue to be \n     excluded, as would real property and interests in retirement \n     plans. The amount of realized gain would be reduced (but not \n     below zero) by $600,000.\n       A tentative tax would be due 90 days after the taxpayer \n     relinquishes citizenship, but for good cause payment of tax \n     may be extended by the Secretary of the Treasury for up to 10 \n     years. An individual will be deemed to have relinquished his \n     or her citizenship (1) on the date the individual renounces \n     his or her United States nationality before a diplomatic or \n     consular officer, furnishes the State Department a signed \n     statement of voluntary relinquishment, or is issued a \n     certificate of loss of nationality by the State Department or \n     (2) for naturalized citizens, on the date a court cancels the \n     citizen's certificate of naturalization.\n       Currently, nonresident aliens are subject to income tax on \n     certain property for ten years after losing United States \n     citizenship, unless the loss of citizenship did not have as \n     one of its purposes the avoidance of federal or income or \n     estate and gift taxes (26 U.S.C. Sec. 877). This law would \n     cease to apply to any individual who relinquishes his or her \n     citizenship on and after February 6, 1995 (new 26 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 877(f)).\n       International agreements. With respect to the right of \n     emigration, we can identify only one clearly binding \n     international agreement to which the United States is a party \n     that addresses the right to emigrate as possibly implicated \n     here--namely, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights.\n       Article 12 of the Covenant, which entered into force for \n     the United States on September 8, 1992, provides, in \n     pertinent part, as follows:\n       2. Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including \n     his own.\n       3. The above-mentioned rights shall not be subject to any \n     restrictions except those which are provided by law, are \n     necessary to protect national security, public order (``order \n     public''), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms \n     of others, and are consistent with the other rights \n     recognized in the present Covenant.\n       In submitting the Covenant to the Senate, the Executive \n     Branch specifically stated that Article 12 ``guarantees . . . \n     the right of emigration to all those lawfully within the \n     territory of a State party.''\\1\\\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Convention does not make the right to emigrate an \n     absolute one. The right may be restricted for, among other \n     things, reasons of ``public order,'' a phrase roughly \n     analogous to the concept of public policy and likely \n     including such notions as ``economic order.''\\2\\ Some \n     commentary apparently indicates that States may certainly \n     require that citizens pay normal tax obligations and public \n     debts upon emigration,\\3\\ but suggests that economic controls \n     should not result in a de facto denial of the right to \n     leave.\\4\\\n       The proposed legislation does not directly restrict the \n     right of an individual to leave the United States and indeed \n     covers individuals who may have already chosen to reside \n     elsewhere. The tax would not be triggered by the mere act of \n     leaving or residing abroad. It would be based on activities \n     that occurred while the taxpayer was a citizen and appears to \n     generally reflect amounts that for the most part would \n     otherwise be payable upon death. The proposed tax obligation \n     contains elements found in existing tax laws--for example, \n     exclusions for items currently excludable from income tax \n     under 26 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101 et seq. (certain interest on \n     state and local bonds, gifts and inheritances, etc.) and an \n     exclusion of the first $600,000 of gain. Currently 26 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 6018 requires an executor to file an estate tax return \n     in all cases where the gross estate at the death of a citizen \n     or resident exceeds $600,000. While current deferrals would \n     apparently be eliminated, the possibility of deferred payment \n     is not entirely foreclosed. Further, the tax burden would \n     seem to be immediately lessened by the fact that certain real \n     property and pension plans would be excluded.\n       Though curbs on expatriation may indirectly affect one's \n     ability to emigrate, one may question, however, whether a \n     restriction on expatriation would in fact restrict this \n     right. The proposed tax does not, for example, amend current \n     constitutional and statutory protection of a U.S. citizen's \n     right to leave the country whether or not the tax is paid; in \n     other words, the act of emigration would not appear to be \n     conditioned on such payment. Moreover, it seems difficult to \n     argue that a condition on U.S. expatriation would so affect \n     foreign countries' willingness to accept U.S. citizens as \n     residents that the right to leave the U.S. would be \n     substantially impaired. More likely, there may be a number of \n     foreign laws and regulations that could burden an individual \n     who seeks to live elsewhere--e.g., restrictions on \n     immigration, acquiring citizenship, eligibility for benefits.\n       Customary international law. Customary international law is \n     defined as resulting ``from a general and consistant practice \n     of states followed by them from a sense of legal \n     obligation.\\5\\ Further, a principle of customary \n     international law would not bind a State that dissents from \n     the norm while it is being developed nor if and when the \n     practice evolves into a rule.\\6\\ As stated in the Foreign \n     Relations Restatement, whether a principle has achieved the \n     status of an international legal norm would generally be \n     determined by ``evidence appropriate to the particular source \n     from which that rule is alleged to derive,''\\7\\ and thus the \n     most reliable evidence for customary law would be ``proof of \n     state practice, ordinarily by reference to official documents \n     and other indications of governmental action'' and similar \n     proof regarding a nation's dissent from the principle.\\8\\\n       The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (a United Nations \n     General Assembly Resolution) and the Final Act of the \n     Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe (Helsinki \n     Final Act) state or incorporate the notion of freedom of \n     emigration\\9\\ and to this extent they may be said to \n     articulate a generally recognized international human right. \n     It appears to remain uncertain, however, whether the \n     Universal Declaration is binding.\\10\\ Further, the Helsinki \n     Final Act is not intended to legally bind parties. Even \n     assuming that the right to emigrate may be considered to be a \n     norm of customary international law, it is unclear whether \n     the proposed tax would violate that right, given the apparent \n     lack of international consensus on the issue of taxes keyed \n     to expatriation and state practice to the contrary.\n       As for the right of expatriation in general, the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights provides that ``no one shall be \n     denied the right to change his nationality'' (Art. 15(2)). \n     Nevertheless, while the United States over 10 years ago \n     recognized a right of expatriation in statute,\\11\\ other \n     countries appear to have expressed different views on the \n     matter.\\12\\\n       More specifically, identifying customary international law \n     that may restrict a State's ability to limit emigration and \n     expatriation necessarily requires examination of State \n     taxation practices that affect those acts. A recent Joint \n     Committee on Taxation staff document indicates that policies \n     that attach \n     [[Page S5320]] tax consequences to emigration are common.\\13\\ \n     Many countries, including the United States, continue to \n     impose income and capital gains tax liability on former \n     residents (including citizens) after they emigrate. Commonly, \n     this income and gains are also fully taxable in the new \n     country of residence, and a recent emigre may face \n     significantly higher taxation than would have been incurred \n     had he or she not emigrated. Additionally Australia and \n     Canada already tax an emigre's property upon emigration. \n     Denmark and Germany also deem some types of property to have \n     been sold upon emigration for tax purposes. In addition, \n     United States bilateral income tax treaties generally contain \n     a provision reserving a right on the part of the United \n     States to tax for a period of ten years the property of a \n     former citizen who is resident in the territory of the treaty \n     partner.\\14\\ Entry into the treaty obligation would appear to \n     indicate at least some foreign acquiescence in this practice. \n     In sum, the ``expatriation tax'' under consideration would \n     not appear to inhibit international movement in ways that \n     current international tax practice already does not.\n       Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which \n     makes nonmarket economy (NME) countries that do not meet \n     statutory freedom-of-emigration standards ineligible for \n     United States trade and financial benefits,\\15\\ would not \n     appear to provide sufficient evidence of the kind of state \n     practice that is needed to create a customary rule of \n     international law regarding the type of tax that is being \n     proposed here. Three types of conduct are addressed by the \n     Amendment: (1) denying citizens the right or opportunity to \n     emigrate; (2) imposing more than a nominal tax on emigration \n     or on the visas or other documents required for emigration, \n     for any purpose or cause whatsoever; and (3) imposing more \n     than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any \n     citizen as a consequence of the desire of such citizen to \n     emigrate to the country of his choice.\\16\\ While the statute \n     specifically incorporates language regarding the right to \n     emigrate and defines unacceptable restrictions on that right, \n     placing Jackson-Vanik-type requirements on trading partners \n     would appear to be unique to the United States. Further, the \n     targeted taxes are specifically related to emigration, rather \n     than to expatriation and, moreover, clearly apply in an \n     overly restrictive manner. They include fees for passport \n     applications and exit visas that are ordinarily prohibitive \n     when measured against average income.\\17\\ These are far \n     removed from the kind of tax proposed in H.R. 831, which, \n     among other things, applies to individuals who have incurred \n     a tax burden because of actions that would generally \n     implicate tax laws absent renunciation of citizenship, \n     affects taxpayers with untaxed capital gains in excess of \n     $600,000, and, if the Internal Revenue Service agrees, might \n     be payable on a deferred basis.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Senate Exec.

As described below, closing a \n     loophole that allows extremely wealthy people to evade U.S. \n     taxes through renunciation of their American citizenship does \n     not violate any internationally recognized right to leave \n     one's country. It is inaccurate on legal and policy grounds \n     to suggest that the Administration's proposal is analogous to \n     efforts by totalitarian regimes to erect financial and other \n     barriers to prevent their citizens from leaving. The former \n     Soviet Union, for example, sought to impose such barriers \n     only on people who wanted to leave, and not on those who \n     stayed. In contrast. Section 201 seeks to equalize the tax \n     burden born by all U.S. citizens by ensuring that all pay \n     taxes on gains above $600,000 that accrue during the period \n     of their citizenship. Unlike the Soviet effort to \n     discriminate against people who sought to leave, the purpose \n     of Section 201 is to treat those who renounce their U.S. \n     citizenship on the same basis as those who remain U.S. \n     citizens.\n       Section 201 would require payments of taxes by U.S. \n     citizens and long-term residents on gains above $600,000 that \n     accrue immediately prior to renunciation of their U.S. \n     citizenship or long-term residency status. These tax \n     requirements are similar to those that they would face if \n     they remained U.S. citizens or long-term residents at the \n     time they realized their gains or at death. While U.S. tax \n     policy generally allows taxpayers to defer gains until they \n     are realized or included in an estate, we understand from the \n     Department of the Treasury that Section 201 treats \n     renunciation as a taxable event because such act effectively \n     removes the underlying assets from U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n       International law recognizes the right of all persons to \n     leave any country, including their own, subject to certain \n     limited restrictions. Article 12(2) of the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that: \n     ``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his \n     own.'' Article 12(3) states that the right ``shall not be \n     subject to any restrictions except those which are provided \n     by law, are necessary to protect national security, public \n     order (order public), public health or morals or the rights \n     and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other \n     rights recognized in the present Covenant.''\n       Section 201 does not affect a person's right to leave the \n     United States. Any tax obligations incurred under Section 201 \n     would be triggered by the act of renunciation of U.S. \n     citizenship, and not by the act of leaving the United States. \n     In addition, since during peacetime U.S. citizens must be \n     outside the United States to renounce their citizenship (see \n     8 U.S.C. Secs. 1481(a)(5), 1483(a)) the persons affected by \n     Section 201 would have already left the United States. \n     Renunciation does not preclude them from returning to the \n     United States as aliens and subsequently leaving U.S. \n     territory. Accordingly, Section 201 does not affect a \n     person's right or ability to leave the United States.\n       Inherent in the right to leave a country is the ability to \n     leave permanently, i.e., to emigrate to another country \n     willing to accept the person. The proposed tax is as \n     unconnected to emigration as it is to the right to leave the \n     United States on a temporary basis. It is not the act of \n     emigration that triggers tax liability under Section 201, but \n     the act of renunciation of citizenship. These two acts are \n     not synonymous and should not be confused with one another. \n     Because the United States allows its citizens to maintain \n     dual nationality, U.S. citizens may emigrate to another \n     country and retain their U.S. citizenship. Hence, the act of \n     emigration itself does not generate tax liability under \n     Section 201. Indeed, we understand from the Department of the \n     Treasury that some of the people potentially affected by \n     Section 201 already maintain several residences abroad and \n     hold foreign citizenship. Moreover, in stark contrast to most \n     emigrants, particularly those fleeing totaliatarian regimes, \n     some continue to spend up to 120 days each year in the United \n     States after they have renounced their U.S. citizenship.\n       While emigration from the United States should not be \n     confused with renunciation of U.S. citizenship, it should \n     nonetheless be noted that it is well established that a State \n     can impose economic controls in connection with departure so \n     long as such controls do not result in a de facto denial of \n     emigration. As Professor Hurst Hannum notes in commenting on \n     the restrictions on the right to leave set forth in Article \n     12 of the Covenant:\n       ``Economic controls (currency restrictions, taxes, and \n     deposits to guarantee repatriation) should not result in the \n     de facto denial of an individual's right to leave . . . If \n     such taxes are to be permissible, they must be applied in a \n     non-discriminatory manner and must not serve merely as a \n     pretext for denying the right to leave to all or a segment of \n     the population (for example, by requiring that a very high \n     `education tax' be paid in hard currency in a country in \n     which possession of hard currency is illegal).''\\1\\\n       A wealthy individual who is free to travel and live \n     anywhere in the world, irrespective of nationality, is in no \n     way comparable to that of a persecuted individual seeking \n     freedom who is not even allowed to leave his or her country \n     for a day. In U.S. law, the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the \n     Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. Sec. 2432) is aimed at this \n     latter case and applies to physical departure, not change of \n     nationality. Examples of States' practices that have been \n     considered to interfere with the ability of communist \n     [[Page S5321]] country citizens to emigrate include imposing \n     prohibitively high taxes specifically applied to the act of \n     emigration with no relation to an individual's ability to \n     pay, or disguised as ``education taxes'' to recoup the \n     State's expenses in educating those seeking to depart \n     permanently. Such practices also include punitive actions, \n     intimidation or reprisals against those seeking to emigrate \n     (e.g., firing the person from his or her job merely for \n     applying for an exit visa). It is these offensive practices \n     that the Jackson-Vanick amendment is designed to eliminate \n     and thereby ensure that the citizens of all countries can \n     exercise their right to leave. (See Tab A for further \n     analysis of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.)\n       The only international human rights issue that is relevant \n     to analysis of Section 201 is whether an internationally \n     recognized right to change citizenship exists and, if so, \n     whether Section 201 is consistent with it. The Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, which is in many respects \n     considered reflective of customary international law, \n     provides in Article 15(2) that: ``No one shall be arbitrarily \n     deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change \n     his nationality'' (emphasis added).\\2\\ Although many \n     provisions of the Universal Declaration have been \n     incorporated into international law, for example in the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article \n     15(2) is not. Accordingly, the question arises whether this \n     provision could be considered to be customary international \n     law.\n       States' views on this question and practices do vary. Many \n     countries have laws governing the renunciation of \n     citizenship, but renunciation is not guaranteed because they \n     have also established preconditions and restrictions, or \n     otherwise subject the request to scrutiny.\\3\\ Professor Ian \n     Brownlie has commented on Article 15(2) in the context of \n     expatriation that: ``In the light of existing practice, \n     however, the individual does not have this right, although \n     the provision in the Universal Declaration may influence the \n     interpretation of internal laws and treaty rules.''\\4\\ Others \n     agree with this position. (See Restatement of the Foreign \n     Relations Law of the United States, Sec. 211, Reporters' Note \n     4). Nonetheless, the United States believes that individuals \n     do have a right to change their nationality. The U.S. \n     Congress took the view in 1868 that the ``right of \n     expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people'' \n     in order to rebut claims from European powers that ``such \n     American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of \n     foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments thereof. \n     . ..'' (Rev. Stat. Sec. 1999).\n       It is evident, however, that States do not recognize an \n     unqualified right to change nationality. It is generally \n     accepted, for example, that a State can require that a person \n     seeking to change nationality fulfill obligations owed to the \n     State, such as pay taxes due or perform required military \n     service.\\5\\ This is especially true where--as here--the \n     requirement is by its nature proportional to the means to \n     pay, and thus does not present a financial barrier.\n       The consistency between Section 201 and international human \n     rights law is further demonstrated by the practice of \n     countries that are strong supporters of international human \n     rights and that have adopted similar tax policies. According \n     to the Report prepared by the Staff of the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation, Germany imposes an ``extended tax liability'' on \n     German citizens who emigrate to a tax-haven country or do not \n     assume residence in any country and who maintain substantial \n     economic ties to Germany. Australia imposes a tax when an \n     Australian resident leaves the country; such person is \n     treated as having sold all of his or her non-Australian \n     assets at fair market value at the time of departure. To \n     provide another example, Canada considers a taxpayer to have \n     disposed of all capital gain property at its fair market \n     value upon the occurrence of certain events, including \n     relinquishment of residency.\n       Accordingly, Section 201 would not raise concerns with \n     respect to change of citizenship for two reasons. First, U.S. \n     citizens would remain free to choose to change their \n     citizenship. This proposal does not in any way preclude such \n     choice, even indirectly. Any tax owed, by its nature, applies \n     only to gains and thus should not exceed an individual's \n     ability to pay. Second, international law would not proscribe \n     reasonable consequences of relinquishment, such as liability \n     for U.S. taxes that accrue during the period of citizenship. \n     We understand from the Department of the Treasury that the \n     imposition of taxes under Section 201 would be equitable, \n     reasonable and consistent with overall U.S. tax policy. We \n     are aware of no evidence that would suggest otherwise. The \n     tax, as we understand it, applies only to gains that accrued \n     during the period of citizenship in excess of $600,000; the \n     tax rate is consistent with other tax rates; and affected \n     persons have the financial means to pay the tax. Indeed, were \n     these persons to choose to retain their U.S. citizenship, \n     they would have to pay similar taxes upon realization of \n     their gains or upon death. Obviously, there is no \n     international right to avoid paying taxes by changing one's \n     citizenship.\n       In conclusion, it is the view of the Department of State \n     that Section 201 does not violate international human rights \n     law. Accordingly, the debate on the merits of Section 201 \n     should focus solely on domestic tax policies and priorities.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\H.

In Coumas, supra note 3, the Supreme Court \n     of California observed that Greece qualified the right of \n     expatriation on fulfillment of military duties and \n     procurement of consent of the Government.\n                                 tab a\n\n       Section 201 of the proposed Tax Compliance Act of 1995 does \n     not conflict with the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade \n     Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. Sec. 2432). That amendment restricts \n     granting most-favored-nation treatment and certain trade \n     related credits and guarantees to a limited number of \n     nonmarket economies that unduly restrict the emigration of \n     their nationals. Specifically, it applies to any nonmarket \n     economy which:\n       ``(1) Denies its citizens the right or opportunity to \n     emigrate;\n       ``(2) Imposes more than a nominal tax on emigration or on \n     the visas or other documents required for emigration, for any \n     purposes or cause whatsoever; or\n       ``(3) Imposes more than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee or \n     other charge on any citizen as a consequence of the desire of \n     such citizen to emigrate to the country of his choice * * \n     *.''\n       This provision, according to the Senate Finance Committee, \n     was ``intended to encourage free emigration of all peoples \n     from all communist countries (and not be restricted to any \n     particular ethnic, racial, or religious group from any one \n     country). (1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7338.) These countries were \n     expected to ``provide reasonable assurances that freedom of \n     emigration will be a realizable goal'' if they were to enter \n     into bilateral trade agreements with the United States. (Id.)\n       The amendment does not apply to emigration from the United \n     States or to the renunciation of U.S. citizenship. It has \n     been suggested, however, that Section 201 would somehow \n     conflict with the ``spirit'' or the ``principles'' of the \n     Jackson-Vanik amendment. The Department of State does not \n     agree with such proposition.\n       Generally, in implementing this statute, the President \n     makes determinations concerning a nonmarket economy's \n     compliance with freedom of emigration principles contained in \n     the amendment. Such determinations take into account the \n     country's statutes and regulations, and how they are \n     implemented day to day, as well as their net effect on the \n     ability of that country's citizens to emigrate freely. The \n     President may, by Executive Order, waive the prohibitions of \n     the Jackson-Vanik amendment if he reports to Congress that a \n     waiver will ``substantially promote'' the amendment's freedom \n     of emigration objectives, and that he has received assurances \n     from the country concerned that its emigration practices \n     ``will henceforth lead substantively to the achievement'' of \n     those objectives. (19 U.S.C. sec. 2431(c).)\n       Several types of State practices have been considered by \n     the United States to interfere with the ability of communist \n     country citizens to emigrate, such as:\n       Prohibitively high taxes specifically applied to the act of \n     emigration with no relation on an individual's ability to pay \n     or disguised as ``education taxes'' seeking to recoup the \n     state's expenses in educating those who are seeking to \n     permanently depart;\n       Punitive actions, intimidation or reprisals by the State \n     against those seeking to emigrate (e.g., firing a person from \n     his or her job merely for applying for an exit visa);\n       Unreasonable impediments, such as requiring adult \n     applicants for emigration visas to obtain permission from \n     their parents or adult relatives;\n       Unreasonable prohibitions of emigration based on claims \n     that the individual possesses knowledge about state secrets \n     or national security; and\n       Unreasonable delays in processing applications for \n     emigration permits or visas, interference with travel or \n     communications necessary to complete applications, \n     withholding of necessary documentation, or processing \n     applications in a discriminatory manner such as to target \n     identifiable individuals or groups for persecution (e.g., \n     political dissidents, members of religious or racial groups, \n     etc.).\n       Examples of these practices in the context of the former \n     Soviet Union are described in an exchange of letters between \n     Secretary of \n     [[Page S5322]] State Kissinger and Senator Jackson of October \n     18, 1974, discussing freedom of emigration from the Soviet \n     Union and Senator Jackson's proposed amendment to the Trade \n     Act, now known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. (Reprinted in \n     1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7335-38.)\n       As explained in the accompanying memorandum, Section 201 \n     does not deny anyone the right or ability to emigrate, and \n     does not impose a tax on any decision to emigrate. Neither \n     does the proposed tax raise questions of disparate standards \n     applicable to the United States as against the nonmarket \n     economies subject to Jackson-Vanik restrictions.\n       The emigration practices of those countries which have been \n     the target of Jackson-Vanik restrictions have typically \n     involved individuals or groups that have been persecuted by \n     the State (e.g., dissidents), precluded family reunification, \n     applied across the board to all citizens by a totalitarian \n     State in order to preclude massive exodus, or have otherwise \n     been so restrictive as to effectively prevent the exercise of \n     the international right to leave any country including one's \n     own (as recognized in Article 12(2) of the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and further described \n     in the accompanying memorandum). Furthermore, the primary \n     objectives of those seeking to emigrate from those countries \n     have been to avoid further persecution or to be reunified \n     with their relatives, and to leave permanently. It was the \n     act of leaving for any period of time that the State sought \n     to block. None of these conditions are comparable to the \n     exercise of taxing authority by the United States under \n     Section 201 or to the status of individuals who would be \n     subject to that tax.\n       As stated in the accompanying memorandum, Section 201 would \n     not interfere with the right of an individual to physically \n     depart from the United States, whether temporarily or \n     permanently.\n       Tufts University, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy,\n                                                   March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Attention: Patricia McClanahan,\n     Re Tax Compliance Act of 1995, H.R. 981.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I wrote you on 24 March expressing \n     my concern over the possible human rights implications of the \n     so-called ``exit tax'' called for in the above-referenced \n     bill. As I noted then, what appeared to be the imposition of \n     a tax solely on the ground that a person was renouncing his \n     or her citizenship could interfere with the right of every \n     person ``to leave any country, including his own,'' which is \n     guaranteed under article 12 of the Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights.\n       I am gratified that the human rights issues related to this \n     bill have become a subject of serious debate, and I \n     appreciate your contribution to that debate. Having now \n     received additional and more specific information about the \n     tax, however, I have become convinced that neither its \n     intention nor its effect would violate present U.S. \n     obligations under international law.\n       Although imposition of a special tax on those who wished to \n     renounce U.S. citizenship might be questionable, it is my \n     understanding that the tax in question is based on accrued \n     income and, in effect, treats renunciation of citizenship as \n     the financial equivalent of death for the purpose of \n     attaching tax liability. There are undoubtedly negative \n     consequences to the individual concerned in having to pay \n     taxes on gains while he or she is alive rather than after \n     death, but there is no internationally protected right to \n     escape taxation by changing citizenship. However, in order to \n     clarify that the purpose and effect of the proposed tax are \n     non-discriminatory, the language might be rewritten to offer \n     the individual the option of complying with the new tax or \n     electing to have realized gains taxed only as part of the \n     individual's estate--subject to an appropriate escrow account \n     being established for money which would be otherwise be \n     expected to be beyond U.S. jurisdiction at the time of death.\n       In sum, imposition of a non-discriminatory tax on accrued \n     income at the time citizenship is renounced, in a manner \n     consistent with the way in which that same income would be \n     treated at the time of death, does not appear to me to \n     violate either the internationally protected right to \n     emigrate or the (somewhat less well protected) right to a \n     nationality.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to clarify my views on this \n     important matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                     Hurst Hannum,\n                         Associate Professor of International Law.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Kassebaum).

I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I come before the Senate today to underscore the \ncommitment that we must make to end domestic violence in America.\n  Beginning today, every time a person in my State of Minnesota dies at \nthe hands of an abuser, I will make sure that their story becomes part \nof the Congressional Record. I do this so that we all remember how \ndeeply this violence scars our society and, most importantly, as a \nreaffirmation of our commitment to ending domestic violence.\n  Indeed, if we are ever going to stop the violence in our communities \nand in our workplaces and on the street, we must begin in the home.\n  I am here today with evidence that the brutal violence continues, and \nwhile it continues to be the single most important or the single most \nsignificant cause of injury to women, this violence knows no boundaries \nof age or gender or race or geography or income or education. The \nviolence goes on year after year, generation after generation.\n  In Minnesota in 1994, at least 19 women and 7 children were killed \nbrutally by a spouse or former partner. With pain, but also with great \ndetermination, I ask that we honor the memory of the following \nindividuals, and from my heart, I ask that we work to end the kind of \nviolence that has cost these individuals, their families and their \ncommunities so much:\n  Pamela Bennett, 34 years of age, January 5, Bemidji, MN. Pamela and \nher boyfriend of Bemidji were traveling together in Oregon when they \nstopped at a rest stop. Hoagland reported to authorities that a hit-\nand-run driver struck Pamela at the rest stop as she exited the \nrestroom. She was dead upon arrival at the hospital. When police found \nno evidence of an accident, Hoagland told authorities that he had lied \nabout the accident and that she fell beneath their travel trailer as he \npulled away from the rest stop without her. Hoagland was charged with \nfiling a false police report, assault and harassment. In late March, \nHoagland pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in her death. He was \nsentenced to 5 months in jail.\n  Pamela Kay Currie, 45, January 14, St. Francis, MN. Pamela was found \nstabbed to death in her home by police who were called by her husband, \nGary Currie. He reported awaking in the morning and finding his wife \ndead on the bed and a knife sticking out of his own chest. He told \nauthorities he remained in bed for almost a whole day before calling \n911 because he hoped he would die. Curry was charged with second-degree \nmurder.\n  Mary Sue Oberender, 46, February 16, Watertown, MN. Mary Sue was \nfound shot to death in her home by her husband, Lawrence. Authorities \ndiscovered the car in Minneapolis and, within a half an hour, arrested \ntwo youths. The youths, Mary Sue's teenage son, Christian, 14, and a \nfriend, also 14, were arrested. They indicated the shooting stemmed \nfrom a minor difference one of them had had with the mother. Police \nsaid the shooting appeared somewhat planned, as if by ambush. There \nwere no signs of struggle. Mary Sue was a volunteer for Scouts at a \nlocal elementary school. Her husband is a Watertown-Mayer school board \nmember.\n  Gertrude Bestor, 86, February 19, Granger, MN.\n  And finally, some murders of children:\n  Lydia Healy, 4 years of age. Police officers found Lydia lying on her \nliving room floor after her mother, Judey Healy, reported to police \nthat Lydia wasn't breathing. Lydia was hospitalized for 8 days before \nshe died. Her injuries included massive swelling of the brain caused by \nshaking or hitting; large black-and-blue marks on the tops of her feet; \nmarks on her legs; bruises on her stomach and chest; a burned hand; \nbruises on her face; two large welts above an eye and on her cheek; and \na burn or cut on her chin. Lydia's 11-year-old brother told police that \nhis mother beat Lydia with a spatula and was left sitting in a bathtub \nof cold water. The next morning, neither he nor his mother were able to \nwake Lydia. Judey Healy was charged with second-degree murder.\n  Geneva Broaden, 15, March 10, 1995, St. Paul. Alfred Robinson, 51, \nthe live-in companion of Geneva's mother, summoned authorities to their \nhome and reportedly confessed to beating Geneva. Robinson told police \nhe punched Geneva and kicked and stomped on her after she fell down \nbecause of a dispute over use of the telephone. When found, Geneva was \nnot breathing and was transported to a medical center where she was \npronounced dead. Police described the assault as ``a very vicious \nattack.''\n  Adriana Whiteside, age 4, March 11, 1995, St. Paul. Adriana was found \nstabbed inside her father's apartment. She was stabbed near her heart \nwith a pocketknife and was rushed to the hospital where she died a \nshort time later. A 14-year-old boy, Randy Burgess, who was babysitting \nAdriana and her infant stepsister, was seen by neighbors running \nthrough the building, carrying Adriana screaming, ``Call 911. I stabbed \na baby.'' He was arrested at the scene. He allegedly told police he was \nplanning to kill someone when he found himself alone with Adriana. \nRandy Burgess was charged with intentional second-degree murder.\n  And finally, Jessica Turner, age 8, March 31, 1995, St. Paul. Jessica \ndied after being stabbed in the chest and tumbling down a flight of \nstairs in her parent's apartment. Her stepfather, who had been released \nfrom a chemical dependency center on March 24, was drinking when he \nallegedly stabbed Jessica and her mother. He was found 5 hours after \nthe stabbings, arrested and was charged with second-degree murder and \nattempted second-degree murder.\n  Madam President, as I went over the names of these Minnesotans who \ndied at the hands of an abuser--and as I say, I want their story to \nbecome a part of the Congressional Record because I want us to honor \nthem, I want us to make a commitment to stopping this violence--I \nrealize that I did not read the circumstances of Gertrude Bestor, 86.\n  Gertrude's daughter went to her mother's house after a signal had \nbeen sounded by Gertrude's medical alert alarm. As she approached the \nhouse, she saw a pickup truck speeding away and found Gertrude lying on \nher bedroom floor beaten to death.\n  The daughter recognized the truck as belonging to Gertrude's step-\ngreat-grandson. He was arrested about an hour later after police \nstopped him in his pickup truck and noticed bloodstains on his clothes \nand hands. He was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and a \ncount of first-degree murder.\n  Madam President, I would like to end this presentation with a quote \nfrom my wife, Sheila:\n\n       We will not tolerate the violence, we will not ignore the \n     violence, we will no longer say it is someone else's \n     responsibility.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, and I have two great colleagues out here \non the floor with me right now, the Senator from Oregon and the Chair, \nthe Senator from Kansas, to work with the survivors, the advocates, the \nmedical professionals, the justice system in our own States, and to \nsupport full community involvement in ending the violence.\n  I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to work with \npassion and conviction to make this a priority for our work of the \nSenate. We must do everything we can to make homes the safest places \nthat they can be. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there has been a lot of talk on the House \nside this week about the bills they have passed as a part of their so-\ncalled Contract With America. I have my own views about many of those \nbills.\n  But today, I would like to talk about what was not included in the \nso-called contract. The contract does not include campaign finance \nreform legislation, it does not include lobbying disclosure \nlegislation, and it does not include gift reform legislation. So, on \nthe three biggest political reform issues facing the Congress today, \nthe Contract With America is silent. The House of Representatives has \nbeen silent. We in the Senate have also been silent. We have done \nnothing to address these fundamental problems with the way business is \ndone in Washington today.\n  We tried to bring these issues up in January, but we were told that \nthat the new Republican leadership wanted some time, wanted a chance to \ngovern. Action would come in a few months, we were told.\n  Well, we have waited more than 3 months, and there is no sign of any \nserious effort to enact lobbying and gift reform. No hearings have been \nscheduled, there have been no mark-ups, and no effort has been made to \nbring a bill to the Senate floor.\n  If anything, it appears that we have been moving in the wrong \ndirection on political reform. Special interest seems to be more \ninfluential than ever. Every week, we read new stories about how \nspecial interest lobbyists have written bills, and have been invited \ninto committee rooms to brief congressional staff about what those \nbills would do.\n  Reform of the Federal lobbying laws and of the congressional gift \nrules is too important to wait any longer. This should not be hard. My \nlobbying reform and gift reform bills each received 95 votes in the \nSenate in the last Congress.\n  It was only when the conference report got caught up in a last-minute \nfilibuster that we were unable to finally pass lobbying registration \nreform and gift reform.\n  Our existing lobbying registration laws have been characterized by \nthe Department of Justice as ineffective, inadequate, and \nunenforceable; they breed disrespect for the law because they are so \nwidely ignored; they have been a sham and a shambles since they were \nfirst enacted almost 50 years ago. At a time when the American public \nis increasingly skeptical that their government really belongs to them, \nour lobbying registration laws have become a joke, leaving more \nprofessional lobbyists unregistered than registered.\n  My lobbying reform bill would ensure that we finally know who is \npaying how much to whom, to lobby what Federal agencies and \ncongressional committees on what issues. This bill would close the \nloopholes in existing lobbying registration laws. It would cover all \nprofessional lobbyists, whether they are lawyers or non-lawyers, in-\nhouse or independent, whether they lobby Congress or the executive \nbranch, and whether their clients are for-profit or non-profit. It \nwould streamline reporting requirements and eliminate unnecessary \npaperwork. And it would provide, for the first time, effective \nadministration and enforcement of disclosure requirements by an \nindependent office.\n  The congressional gift rules are also fundamentally flawed. These \nrules currently permit Members and staff to accept unlimited meals from \nlobbyists or anybody else. They permit the acceptance of football \ntickets, baseball tickets, opera tickets, and theater tickets. They \npermit Members and staff to travel to predominantly recreational \nevents, such as charitable golf and tennis tournaments, which are paid \nfor by special interest groups. To the public, these rules reinforce an \nimage of a Congress more closely tied to the special interests than to \nthe public interest. That is not good for the Congress and it is not \ngood for the country.\n  Our bill would address this problem as well. Under our bill, \nlobbyists would be prohibited from providing meals, entertainment, \ntravel, or virtually anything else of value to Members of Congress and \ncongressional staff. Acceptance of gifts from others would also be \nrestricted significantly. To give just one example, my bill would \nprohibit private interests from paying for recreational expenses, such \nas greens fees, for Members of Congress, whether in Washington or in \nthe course of travel outside Washington. In fact, private interests \nwould be prohibited from paying for congressional travel to any event, \nthe activities of which are substantially recreational in nature. If my \nbill passes, recreational activities paid for by interest groups will \nbe a thing of the past.\n  The enactment of our bill would fundamentally change the way business \nis conducted on Capitol Hill. It would get rid of the gifts, and it \nwould bring lobbying out in the open. If we are serious about changing \nthe way government works, we will enact this legislation, and do it \nsoon.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON.

That is correct. Although it does take \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending \n[[Page S5326]] amendments before additional business can be ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the \namendments necessary be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have a bit of a dilemma. I have been in \nForeign Relations Committee meetings and other things most of the day. \nI am not aware of precisely what has happened on one issue which is of \ngreat interest to me and which I consider to be an outrageous invasion \nof the taxpayers money. It involves the 1995 appropriations bill \ncontaining $30 million that would be spent to build housing for Russian \nmilitary officers.\n  My understanding is that there may have been some action to delete \npart of that $30 million. I will speak my opinion about this and then I \nwill consult with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who is \nnow on the floor, about whether my understanding is correct.\n  This program was begun, as I recall, in 1993 by President Clinton. In \nmy judgment, it is a perfect example of how the United States conceives \na bad foreign aid giveaway program, shrouds it in doubletalk to protect \nit, and then scrambles to spend the money when elected officials in \nCongress raise questions about it.\n  In April 1993, President Clinton met at a summit with Russian \nPresident Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver. At that time, Mr. Clinton \nproposed that the United States would pay--meaning the taxpayers of the \nUnited States would pay--to construct housing in Russia so that Russian \ntroops occupying the Baltic States could be withdrawn to Russia.\n  Now, let me drag that by one more time--going to spend American \ntaxpayers' money to build housing for Russian soldiers so Russian \nsoldiers can go home.\n  The Clinton administration suggested this, as I understand it, on the \ngrounds that no housing existed in Russia for these soldiers.\n  There is at least one problem with that logic. Instead of building \nhousing in Russia, the United States is now giving Russian soldiers \n$25,000 apiece to go out and purchase an existing unoccupied house. Now \nI am in favor of home ownership and I wish the Clinton administration \nwould support more home ownership right here in America. But this \nprogram, Mr. President, is absolutely outrageous.\n  In fact, what the administration is saying is that it is not a \nhousing shortage that the Russian military has; it is a cash shortage. \nI think that question is going to be of great interest to a lot of \nAmerica's taxpayers.\n  Well, the U.S. Government, as a matter of fact, come to think of it, \nhas a cash shortage. The Federal debt, as of yesterday afternoon \nclosing time, was over 4.8 trillion bucks. Everybody knows about the \nbudget deficit. We have talked and talked and talked about it for \nyears. Finally, when something is being done about it, you hear all the \nweeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth--``But you can't do that to \nthis one or you are doing this to that one,'' and so forth.\n  So I want to see these political figures go home and try to explain \ntheir votes against cutting the Federal deficit.\n  The administration itself is struggling to fund a request for 77,000 \nnew and improved housing units for American soldiers and their \nfamilies. They do not have the money for it, but they are struggling to \nfind it. But they have already found it for the Russian soldiers. The \nconditions in which many of the men and women who serve in the U.S. \nservices--the Army, Navy, Marines, and all the rest--are required to \nlive are circumstances that are an embarrassment. And yet we have money \nfor $25,000 apiece for Russian soldiers for housing.\n  Finally, the question absolutely must be asked: why does the Russian \nmilitary have a shortage of money? The answer is no further away than \nthe evening news in various places where the Russians are still \nparticipating in mayhem.\n  This program to build housing for Russian soldiers is not essential \nand it did not get the Russian military out of the Baltic States. This \nprogram is nothing but a golden parachute for the Russian military--not \nthe United States military.\n  Mr. President, while the United States plays real estate agent to the \nRussian military, they have time and resources to fight in other places \nthey ought not to be fighting.\n  Let me ask the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nif any action on this outrageous allocation of money has been taken \nsince I last heard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina in terms of the ``provision in this bill,'' the \nconference report on H.R. 889, that is, the bill on military defense \nappropriations that we conferenced yesterday, and we are now about to \nface that conference report, it having passed the House.\n  A number of years ago when, I believe, President Bush was still \nPresident and made a trip to the Baltics, he found that even though the \nSoviet Union had ceased to exist in reality, that the Baltic \nGovernments that had emerged out of that former Iron Curtain power base \nof the Soviet Union, that those occupation troops, particularly the \nofficers within the occupation of the Baltics, were not going back to \nRussia, were not returning home. They were remaining in the Baltics. \nThey were wearing their uniforms, and that gave the new Baltic \nGovernments great concern as to the intentions, and what have you.\n  Upon a careful analysis, they found that the Russians were not \nreturning home because they had no housing to return to. The housing \nmarket had just been totally demolished over the years, and they found \nbetter housing in the Baltics.\n  So in the first initial step, we had what was called a demonstration \nproject, I suppose, a figure of about $6 million--I am recalling now, \nnot precisely--but a single-digit figure was appropriated as a \ndemonstration project to help the Russians produce housing, not just \nfor those officers still in the Baltics but also to start a housing \nindustry in that country that had had no housing policy to speak of.\n  Then following that, there was a commitment made, and that now \ncarries over into the Clinton administration, within the Baltic reaches \nthat after there is that skill that comes out of that demonstration \nproject we had to find an incentive to get these Russian officers out.\n  So a voucher system was provided, $25,000 voucher value for housing \nin Russia. That has then proceeded to, as we know now, there being no \nofficers left in uniform. Some have decided to make the Baltics their \nhome, have taken off the uniform and are rooting in as citizens, not as \nofficers.\n  There were a lot of questions raised about this whole policy to begin \nwith but, nevertheless, it was felt to be a sound policy to pursue to \nassist our new government friends in the Baltics.\n  We had, in effect, a drawdown from a $100 million appropriation to \nwhat we thought was about $75 million unobligated funds in the \npipeline. These figures are difficult, and we are not certain of these \nfigures. We cannot precisely identify the total number, but we think it \nis around $75 million.\n  The House had rescinded all $75 million in their bill. We, on the \nSenate side, rescinded none. We kept whatever that figure--75--in the \nbill.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is what got my attention.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. Now when we went to conference, we engaged in a \nlot of discussion, a lot of debate, and then the questions were raised \nas to what is the precise figure in that budget. We have the State \nDepartment, we have other sources, that have yet to give what we \nconsider satisfactory figures so that we can say exactly how much.\n  So the House made a proposal to the Senate that we reallocate $15 \nmillion out of the $75 million; leave, in a sense, a total of $60 \nmillion to be revisited at \n[[Page S5327]] a time when we can get that exact figure, which would \nprobably be in the 1996 cycle, assuming this report passes now as a \nrescission package. Other discussions might be engendered out of the \nForeign Relations Committee. We are not wedded on the basis of that \nprogram to say that is in place to last into the indefinite future.\n  Mr. HELMS. I hope it has no future.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Because of the question of not only appropriations \nunder the circumstance of today, but the policy issue itself.\n  All I can say, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we \nare doing the minimal of what we can legitimately do and maintain \ncommitments that are in process or already made, until we can get a \nmore exact total figure of unobligated funds.\n  Mr. HELMS. But the Senator will not presume to permit any further \ncommitments. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. We have no basis upon which at this time to make a \nstatement to the future of this program, because every program today is \nunder such careful review and scrutiny in terms of our budget deficit, \nin terms of our priorities. Obviously, these rescissions are only to \nreflect upon the current fiscal year anyway.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am not being critical of the Senator. I would hate to \nhave his job as chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  It seems to me we have $60 million somewhere in limbo--it might be in \nthe pipeline, it may have been committed without our knowing. There are \nso many ambiguities about it. How can we tie it up so there will be no \ncommitment beyond what has already been made?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Well, I think that the situation is such that when the \nHouse rescinded the total figure of unobligated funds, it sent a very, \nvery strong message to the agencies themselves. I suppose it should \nsend a message to the authorizing committee as well, which the Senator \nfrom North Carolina chairs.\n  We have a whole foreign aid bill under constant review. Nothing is a \ncommitment very far down the road.\n  We are dealing with the problem right now in this appropriation bill \nreport that is pending as to how to delineate between the Department of \nDefense pursuing and executing a humanitarian program as a police \naction program and as it relates to the defense of this Nation. In \nother words, there are those who say we should not be charging, in \noffsets, any of these incursions into Haiti, et cetera, et cetera, back \nto the DOD appropriations budget.\n  So we are engaged in a lot of issues here that are pretty cloudy at \nthis moment. I do not think any part of this can be a statement of \nfuture commitment at all.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me ask, if I may, will we have somebody on the \nAppropriations Committee staff try to explain to me specifically where \nthe $60 million is, because I do not want to leave this unvisited \nbefore we pass this bill. Can somebody answer that?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. We can certainly do that. We have very excellent staff \nthat can be supportive of your questions and responsive to your \nquestions.\n  Let me just say in summary, we have no precise figures at this \nmoment. We are dependent upon a couple of agencies from the executive \nbranch of government to provide such figures. We do not keep the books \nin that sense. We are now at a level of commitment in this report that \nwe feel will be sufficient to cover any current commitments, \nobligations, or pipeline. Until we can get that precise figure we \ncannot answer that part of your question.\n  I can answer your question in the sense, does this have any kind of a \nbase of commitment for 1996, or 1997, and I could say on that, ``No, it \nmakes no basic commitment for 1996.'' We will review 1996 in a totally \ndifferent context.\n  Mr. HELMS. So, the Foreign Relations Committee, I assure the Senate--\n--\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I want to make sure, as the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, that the Senator understands we are not \ntrying to make policy in our committee when the policy committee that \nhe chairs is in that position.\n  Mr. HELMS. The strongest policy part of any legislation are the \ndollars. That is what really counts.\n  I am not saying anything that the Senator does not know or believe \nhimself.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Murkowski-D'Amato \namendment to the D'Amato amendment No. 427.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 574 to Amendment No. 420\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Glenn, \n     Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lieberman, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Pell, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered \n     574 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9 of the substitute amendment, strike line 1 \n     through line 23 and insert the following:\n\n\n                     industrial technology services\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $3,100,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                  construction of research facilities\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading, \n     $30,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n national oceanic and atmospheric administration operations, research \n                             and facilities\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $25,100,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                              construction\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $13,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                    goes satellite contingency fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading, \n     $2,5000,000 are rescinded.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this goes to the heart of our work in \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee of State, Justice, and Commerce whereby \nwe want to support the overall amount of the rescission but to redirect \nit to less important financial requirements at this particular time. In \nother words, my amendment would restore current programs that have been \nfound very effective for the NOAA coastal oceans program, $7 million to \nthe NOAA climate and global change research, $1.5 million to the Under \nSecretary for Technology, and $24 million to the NIST manufacturing \nextension program for a total of $37.5 million in total restoration.\n  Those restorations are offset by $30 million from the unobligated \nbalances in the NIST construction, $5 million in the unobligated \nbalances in the NOAA construction, and $2.5 million in the unobligated \nbalances of the NOAA contingency fund.\n  All of those construction funds and everything else are to be set \naside not to be expended this year. Of course, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, \n[[Page S5328]] chairman of our subcommittee, and I are just now \ncompleting our series of hearings for next year's appropriations. So we \nare not turning away in any context our dedication to the various \nrequested construction commitments. But, in a word, what we are saying \nis let us not go for office buildings but rather for building jobs.\n  Let me go right to the heart of the connection between this amendment \nand the so-called Contract With America, which I welcome because this \nis a good tonic to come to town and stir everybody up and get us \nmoving. Many elements of the contract are things that I have worked \nupon--the unfunded mandates, the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, which I voted for already three times. I did not vote for \nit this time because I did not want to repeal my own law that puts \nSocial Security off budget.\n  On that matter, I do not believe that we should just move deficits. \nRather, let us eliminate deficits. I did not want to move the \nGovernment's deficit from the general Government over to Social \nSecurity. So when we were debating the balanced budget amendment, all \nthey had to do is exempt the Social Security funds instead of repealing \nmy section 13301 which says ``Thou shall not use Social Security \nfunds'' in the estimates of the deficit and the debt. That was put in \nby Senator Heinz and myself back in 1990 and signed into law by \nPresident Bush.\n  With respect to the other parts of the contract, the line-item veto, \nis actually my bill, which was a compromise between the two rescissions \ninitiatives by Senator McCain and Senator Domenici.\n  So there is much with which we can agree. But I thought in coming to \ntown here at this particular session in January that our purpose was to \npay the bill, and create jobs--not to adopt a contract which does not \nin itself create a single job or pay a single bill. It has more to do \nwith symbols than substance, more with procedures than actual \nproduction. Now we have an amendment before the body which actually \nproduces jobs.\n  I am convinced, after the hearing we had this morning, that we will \nget a most sympathetic hearing from our distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Gramm of Texas, because the two big elements of \nmisgiving that I have heard expressed about the NIST programs of the \nAdvanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Centers is on the one \nhand, that this was industrial policy, Government picking winners and \nlosers, and on the other hand, that this was pork, political pork. Let \nme address the first particular problem.\n  Of course, we make all kinds of industrial policies. This morning, \nwith respect to product liability, we told industry just exactly what \nit can expect--less care in the manufacturing. Currently, we have the \nhighest degree of care in the United States of America in its \nmanufacturing. But what we did was put in all kinds of gimmicks and \nhurdles that hamstring the individuals right to a trial by jury and \nthereby significantly affects industry. But we will not go any further \ninto that.\n  But we get industrial policy when we recommend a minimum wage, when \nwe come forward and say we are going to have parental leave, when we \nsay we are going to have to have plant closing notice, safe machinery, \nsafer working place, Social Security, unemployment compensation, \nMedicare, Medicaid. You can go right on down the list. When we in a \nbipartisan fashion, which is the record, adopt those measures, we get \ninto industrial policy. There has been a fetish around town amongst the \npollsters putting out their pap about industrial policy, saying ``let \nthe market choose the winners and losers rather than the bureaucrats \nand politicians in Washington.'' I agree with that.\n  But, while we make industrial policy all the time, my amendment \nsupports an industrial policy chosen by industry. We ensure sound \nindustrial choice by requiring the industry to come with 50 percent of \nthe money at least in their pocket and also to go through a peer review \nsystem of the National Academy of Engineering and the overall \nGovernment peer review choice. That was brought out in specific by Mary \nLou Good, Dr. Good, the undersecretary in charge of technology, a real \nexpert; had been in charge of their research and development over the \nyears and just had a perfect speaking knowledge about the various \nthings to guard against and make sure it was the industry and not the \npolitician choosing the winner and loser, so to speak.\n  And otherwise, we carefully designed the peer review to make sure \nthat the Senator could not call and get a manufacturing center, the \nSecretary of Commerce could not call and get one, nor could the \nPresident, nor the White House minions call over and say, ``We want \nit.'' In fact, our absolute track record with this program under every \nadministration has been one of just exactly that, of unbiased peer \nreview.\n  I can tell you categorically we did have a little hesitation in the \nmarkup of our bill over the past few years because the distinguished \nchairman on the House side wanted one of these but we never would write \nit in. We said we are not breaking ranks and starting with these \nmarkups on bills and inserting anything like Lawrence Welk's home as \none of these manufacturing centers.\n  Otherwise, consider the matter of pork. I must refer to the \ndistinguished former Senator from Wyoming, Senator Wallop. He pointed \nout in reading an article year before last, or April 2 years ago, how \nthe chairman of the Democratic Party had gone to the West Coast under \nthe Clinton administration. He said, ``Look here.'' I read the article. \nThe chairman of the party is saying categorically the end all and be \nall of Presidential--and I know the Senator from Mississippi is \ninterested in Presidential elections.\n The end all and be all of Presidential elections is California. And, \naccording to this article, this administration was going to send out \nRon Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, and he was going to pour the \nprojects to the State of California and we were really going to get on \nthe move over here for our party.\n\n  Well, that there just tackled me from behind because it was not true \nat all. The Secretary of Commerce could not do it. But it was a \ntremendous misgiving on the part of Senator Wallop and others on the \nother side of the aisle, even though 14 Republican Senators and a task \nforce for reconversion had gone on and endorsed this particular \nprogram. It took us several days, what we had previously passed almost \nby unanimous consent took us several days to pass, and then with an \noverwhelming majority we passed the authorization.\n  So I had to answer up to that matter of pork and make sure that \neveryone knew that this was as well administered a governmental program \non the basis of merit that we have ever had.\n  Another question arose then. The Senator from Texas says, now, ``what \nis the cutoff date?'' Well, that is a good question because you would \nthink in the global competition, the answer could be given ``when is \nthe cutoff date for Germany, for Japan, for Taiwan?'' And all our \ncompetition that has been investing way more than this. They just pour \nin the research and development, and we are trying to catch up, since \nwe do not have long-term investments here in the United States--it is \neverything short term with the Wall Street market. It is tough, tough \nto get these little, small, fledgling industries going because they go \nto the market seeking credit, but if it takes more than two-, three-, \nfour-quarters, over a year to get a good return, they can put the money \nelsewhere. This is a quick turnaround society in which we live. And the \nothers go for the long range and can lose some in the short term. \nSpecifically, the Japanese this past year, 1994, took over an \nadditional 1.2 percent of the automobile market, losing, if you please, \nlosing $2.5 billion. Of course, they made it back in the Tokyo market \nselling cars in Japan.\n  We do not have that kind of policy, and we do not want that kind of \npolicy. And we are not going to have that kind of approach to our \nproblems here. But to try to stay alive in the competition, we very \nwisely, with the support of the competitiveness council, and President \nBush in his address to the joint session of the Congress, agreed to \ncome forward and resolve the National Institute of Standards into the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, and on a peer review \nmerit basis to start meeting this kind of competition.\n  We had a very, very thorough hearing about it this morning, and these \noffsets are not really going to hurt anybody \n[[Page S5329]] and certainly they will not diminish further our effort \nwith respect to jobs.\n  In the other rescission bill, we have already knocked $90 million off \nthe advanced technology program. We cannot afford, on these research \ncenters, manufacturing centers, to knock another $24 million off of \nthis.\n  Specifically, in agriculture, when the question was asked, when is \nthe cutoff date? Well, Roosevelt started it in 1933 with price supports \nand protective quotas, and we still have it. In fact, we have \nembellished it with advertising and export promotion. They got over $1 \nbillion selling California raisins and almonds and California wines and \nall these other agricultural products. Here, for the poor fellow, \nworking in industry, trying to hold his job, nothing but this babble of \nfree-trade nonsense, whereby we are blaming America's labor for a \nflawed trade policy.\n  There is no question in my mind; we have the most competitive \nindustry worker, the most productive industrial worker in the entire \nworld, but we have a silly, really nonpolicy of running around and \nacting like we are still on foreign policy and we have to sacrifice on \nthe kind of relation in the Pacific rim, we have to defend them and we \nhave to continue to give them all our jobs.\n  I can talk at length, but I see others waiting. I do not want to go \ntoo long, but I wish my colleagues to understand its fullest \nimportance. That is why I did not want to agree to a time limit right \nhere at the initial part of this particular amendment. If we had, \nSenator, the same number of manufacturing jobs as we had 25 years ago, \nwe would add 10 million manufacturing jobs.\n  What am I saying? I am saying that in 1970, 25 years ago, 10 percent \nof the consumption of manufactured products in the United States of \nAmerica was represented in imports. Now, over 50 percent of the \nconsumption of manufactured products is represented in imports. If we \nhad gone back to the 90 percent that we had of U.S. manufacture of this \ncountry's consumption of manufactured products, we would immediately \nadd 10 million jobs.\n  What does that mean? Some of my friends here have talked today about \nforeign policy. I would like to get to foreign policy. What does it \nmean? It means that if you cannot have a strong manufacturing sector, \nsaid Mr. Morita--former chairman of Sony--in a particular seminar we \nattended in Chicago years back, if you cannot have a strong \nmanufacturing sector, you cannot be a nation state. And the country \nthat loses its manufacturing power ceases to be a world power.\n  What we are learning already in the WTO, I say to the Senator from \nMississippi. We thought we had a consensus on who would be the \npresident of the WTO--like Mickey Kantor would come in and say we are \ngoing to have a consensus. Oh, we are in charge. Consensus. Consensus. \nWe got together on a consensus with the Italian as the choice. In fact, \nthe poor fellow now--I happen to like him. They say he is a \nprotectionist. OK, that is common sense to me. We have a high standard \nof living. We have to protect it. But the gentleman from Italy they \nsaid was totally unacceptable. We could not have him. We tried to get \nthe man, Salinas, down in Mexico, and he bombed out. And then we ended \nup with the Italian, who is now going to be the president of the WTO. \nThe second choice was Korea, and we are sitting around with our so-\ncalled consensus.\n  On our most important choice to be made we have already been rolled \nwith WTO. When you lose your economic power, you lose your influence in \nforeign policy. The foreign policy, Mr. President, of this land is like \na three-legged stool. You have as one leg the values of the country; \nyour second leg of military power; and your third leg of economic \npower.\n  That one leg of values as a nation is strong. We sacrifice to feed \nthe hungry in Somalia and bring democracy to Haiti. No one questions it \nor our military power, the military leg. We are the superpower. But \nwhen it comes around to the economic leg, Mr. President, I can tell \nyou, here and now, that leg over the last 40 years, 45 years, has been \nfractured due to the special relationship that we had to give. We had \nto rebuild the capitalist economy the world around in order to contain \ncommunism. And bless it, the Marshall plan has worked. We have no \nmisgivings about it. But now, with the fall of the wall, we have an \nopportunity here to repair that economic leg for America.\n  And this one little initiative here out of all the other initiatives \nhas been the bipartisan move toward production and manufacture and \nstrengthening that economic leg. That is what this particular amendment \ndoes. It could not be considered, incidentally, in the subcommittee. We \ntried, but we could not get a hearing, as the ranking member. Our \nsubcommittee report was read out without a single one Senator on this \nside of the aisle ever having heard of it.\n  I wanted to have a chance to repair that and say, ``Look, set aside \nconstruction funds, money just hanging around not to be used in this \nfiscal year. Why rescind ongoing programs that we have in the several \nStates on a merit basis that is one of the finest that we have ever got \nto try to help?\"\n  I will speak a little bit further. I see other Senators wanting to be \nrecognized.\n  I have the list of the industries here with respect to what we call \nthe Advanced Technology Coalition, representing 5 million U.S. workers, \n3,500 electronic firms, 329,000 engineers, and 13,500 companies in the \nmanufacturing sector. They have endorsed this particular program.\n  And it is really down to the minimal basis, not near what we give to \nNASA and all its research in space, not near what we have in \nagriculture, not near what we have in alternative energy and in nuclear \nendeavors. Here is a fledgling little $300 million program that we are \ntrying to keep alive, and some, I think, unknowingly, have cut it, \nbecause over on the other side there is a gentleman--incidentally, from \nPennsylvania--who says we ought to not only get rid of this but get rid \nof the entire Department of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly on the \npending legislation. There appears to be some reason for optimism that \nwe are in the final stages and will be completing action on this bill \nyet this evening.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, and \nEducation, our subcommittee faced a very major rescission package, as \nsent over by the House of Representatives, amounting to some $5.9 \nbillion. While the full appropriations package addressed the \nrescissions of the House--with somewhat different calculations because \nFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was deferred. The \ncommittee was able to shift priorities, so that the rescissions in our \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education was \nreduced to $3.05 billion.\n  We restored some $1 billion in cuts on education because it was our \nsense that the education funding should remain at as high a level as \npossible.\n  It is my own view, Mr. President, that education, as a national \npriority, is second to none. I come by that view from the experience \nwith my own parents, both of whom were immigrants, who had very little \neducation and therefore valued it very highly in our household. My \nfather, Harry Specter, had no formal education. My mother, Lillie \nSpecter, went only to the eighth grade when she quit school to help \nsupport her family on the tragic death of her father from a heart \nattack in his mid to late forties. But my brother, my two sisters and I \nhave been the beneficiaries of the opportunity to share in the American \ndream with good educations. And that has been a point for which I have \nalways worked hard to try to maintain the funding, supported by Senator \nHarkin the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Senator Harkin agreed with restoring these funds to education, and \nincluded in that was the restoration of funding of $371 million for \ndrug-free schools. Mr. President, the drug problem in the school system \nis the intersection of education and violence. Funding for the program \nis supported by our subcommittee, supported by the full committee and \nsupported, it appears, by the Senate. Perhaps even more money will be \nadded back on drug-free schools which is a very, very high priority.\n   [[Page S5330]] We also restored some $13 million for worker safety, \nfor OSHA, where the funds had been cut. It is very, very important to \nhave safety on the job.\n  Another key item was low-income home energy assistance for the \nelderly and poor. Principally, this vital program provides assistance \nfor many Americans who earned less than $8,000 a year. For these low \nincome or elderly without this important program it comes down to a \nchoice, as the expression goes, between heating or eating.\n  The program also is very, very important, as a matter of safety. In a \n3-month period in the city of Philadelphia, 11 people were killed, many \nof them children, in families which were using kerosene heaters because \nthey did not have enough money for the regular fuel allotment. The \ncommittee has reinstated the program from the House cuts.\n  I think it is very important, Mr. President, to meet the target of \nbalancing the budget by the year 2002, but I think it has to be done \nwith a scalpel and not a meat ax. Traditionally, as the Founding \nFathers articulated, the Senate is the saucer that cools the tea from \nthe House of Representatives. The strength in our system is a bicameral \nlegislature--that is a House of Representatives and a Senate--the \nmodels of most of the States in the United States, and it takes both of \nthe Houses to work it out.\n  So I think we will come up in the Senate with a very sound bill. \nThere have been negotiations, as has been announced on the floor, and \nit appears at this point that there will be add-backs on a number of \nthe programs, which could, apparently, lead to less of a cut from the \n$3.05 billion.\n  But it appears that we will have had an appropriate allocation of \nresources and assessment of priorities and that we will take a good \nbill into conference. Hopefully, we can eliminate unnecessary expenses \nbut, at the same time, retain the programs which are very important for \nAmerica's safety net.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of our leader, I would like to see \nif we could not get a time agreement now on the Hollings amendment. I \nunderstand Senator Hollings has already had some time to speak and has \nindicated a willingness to enter into this agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time on the pending Hollings \namendment be limited to the following: 20 minutes under the control of \nSenator Hollings, 10 minutes under the control of Senator Hatfield; I \nfurther ask that, following the conclusion or yielding back of the \ntime, Senator Dole or his designee be recognized to make a motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. With no amendments to our amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is fine. No amendment is mentioned here.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. If it is in order, I would like to propose an amendment, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend?\n  The Senate has just entered into a time agreement on the Hollings \namendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Can we temporarily set this aside so the Senator from \nHawaii and the Senator from Pennsylvania could be recognized?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii has an amendment he \nwould like to offer. Could I inquire of the Senator from Hawaii, is \nthis an amendment that has been worked out?\n  Mr. AKAKA. It is an a amendment that has been agreed to on both \nsides. I have spoken with Chairman Specter and he agrees with this \namendment.\n  By unanimous consent, I wanted to offer the amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time does the Senator expect to take?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I will take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if my distinguished colleague from Hawaii \nwould yield, I believe we will work that amendment through in the final \npackage, so it would not be in order to offer it at this time.\n  But I understand the distinguished Senator from Hawaii would like to \nspeak about it, which I think would be entirely appropriate to outline \nwhat we will accomplish. But structurally and procedurally, we will \ninclude that in the final managers' amendment, which will accommodate \nwhat the Senator from Hawaii wants to achieve.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I had asked the distinguished \nassistant leader if Senator Santorum and I--and I cleared this with the \nSenator from South Carolina--might have 10 minutes for a brief \npresentation on a memorial to Jimmy Stewart in Indiana, PA, which will \nbe coming up after the Senator from Hawaii finishes his remarks.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And without the time being allocated on our particular \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am sure that would be fine. But after that, I know the \nleader would like for us to really begin to finish the debate on this \namendment and other amendments that have been agreed to so we can begin \nto bring this to a conclusion.\n  But I believe we are going to have a couple minutes now for the \nSenator from Hawaii and then 10 minutes for the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Mississippi wish to \npropose a unanimous consent request for this?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I so make that request to have 2 minutes for \nthe distinguished Senator from Hawaii to discuss an amendment that will \nbe the managers' amendment, and 10 minutes for the two Senators from \nPennsylvania on a subject relating to Jimmy Stewart, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n                   Demonstration Partnership Program\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the leadership, and I thank my \nfriend, Chairman Specter, for including it in his manager's report.\n  I have an amendment, which will be in the chairman's report, and it \nwould restore partial funding for the $7.9 million rescinded from the \nDemonstration Partnership Program. My hope is this amendment is \nagreeable and that it will receive the support of my colleagues.\n  The DPP, administered by the Office of Community Services in the \nAdministration for Children and Families of the Department of Health \nand Human Services, has a highly successful record of employing \ninnovative approaches to increase self-sufficiency for the poor.\n  The program provides grants to community action agencies and other \neligible entities of the community services block grant. The objectives \nof the DPP are to develop tests and evaluate new approaches for \novercoming poverty, as well as to disseminate project results and \nevaluation findings so that successful programs can be replicated \nelsewhere.\n  I also want to inform my colleagues that there is agreement to \noffsets for this $3 million, and there is agreement by the staff on \nboth sides of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment and \nthank Chairman Specter for including it in his report. I yield back any \ntime remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, rather than taking time now from the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nSantorum and I would like to amend the unanimous-consent agreement to \ntake 10 minutes at the conclusion of the next vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself sufficient time. The \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, wanted to be heard. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator \n[[Page S5331]] from Virginia, Senator Robb, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think it is fundamental that we all \nunderstand that this movement with respect to the development of our \ntechnology came about at the same time that we were trying to get \nconversion programs in the Defense Department, including start-up \nfunding for many of the extension centers in this particular program. \nIn fact, we actually got as NIST Director Dr. Arati Prabhakar, one of \nthe top managers who had worked with Craig Fields over at DARPA, and \nNIST is now taking over the funding of 37 DOD-started extension centers \nthat help small firms that are no less attuned to civilian purposes \nrather than to military purposes.\n  If this little amendment is knocked out, and some $25.6 million, is \nrescinded, as originally proposed in the bill, then what you have left \nis only $65 million to support a total of 44 centers, plus any new \ncenters for other States. There is a cutoff period of 6 years also in \nthis program that I forgot to emphasize. These centers come up with at \nleast 50 percent of the cost to begin with and over the years we have \nan ever diminishing amount by the Feds and an ever increasing amount by \nthe sponsoring State along with the industry. They take over these \nextension centers.\n  By way of comparison, it should be shown that this past year, where \nwe had some $91 million in these centers and now, if we lose $25 \nmillion, we would end up with only $65 million. You can compare that to \nthe $439 million budget this year of extension program of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, a figure that does include research or the \ncooperative education programs; to NASA with an aeronautical research \nand assistance budget of $882 million; and the Department of Energy, \nwhere there is another $3.315 billion for civilian energy research. And \nwhat we have is a very restricted program, run on a peer-review basis, \nof $91 million. We are trying to restore the proposed cut by using \nunobligated balances within the same NIST budget.\n  I also emphasize at this particular time, Mr. President, before \nyielding as much time as is necessary to the Senator from Connecticut, \nthat I would like to read just one sentence from the 1992 Senate \nRepublican defense conversion task force. This was a very outstanding \ngroup of some 14 Republican Senators, including the Senator from \nKansas, now the majority leader, and many others here, without reading \nout their names. I read the language:\n\n       The task force endorses two programs of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology as important to the \n     effort to promote technology transfer to allow defense \n     industries to convert to civilian activities. These programs \n     are the Manufactured Technology Program and the Advanced \n     Technology Program.\n\n  That is exactly what we have been doing. This has been bipartisan \nfrom the very beginning. It has worked very well. There is no pork and \nthere is no industrial policy with the Government picking winners and \nlosers.\n  I yield as much time as he needs to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut. I do appreciate his support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the state of manufacturing in this \ncountry is mixed. On the one hand our manufacturing productivity is \nincreasing, but on the other hand we are losing manufacturing jobs by \nthe millions. Manufacturing which once was the life blood of our \neconomy is bleeding jobs overseas. We need to provide the \ninfrastructure that insures that manufacturing flourishes.\n  Some kinds of manufacturing have been experiencing a resurgence in \nthe last decade. This resurgence has been dominated by big business, \nnot by small and mid-sized businesses. I am worried about the 381,000 \nmanufacturing companies of less than 500 workers, representing nearly \n12 million employees. Taken as a group, these small and mid-sized \nmanufacturers are the source of the largest number of new manufacturing \njobs, and, they represent real growth for our economy. Perhaps most \nimportantly, small and mid-sized manufacturers have become the \nfoundation of our manufacturing industry.\n  Larger manufacturers are no longer self-sufficient. Outsourcing is \nmore and more often the most efficient and competitive way to \nmanufacture. Take the example of a Chrysler car. Typically 70 percent \nof the final product is manufactured by Chrysler itself, the rest is \nmanufactured by a myriad of smaller suppliers. This web of smaller \nmanufacturers have become the core of the manufacturing industry. When \nU.S. small manufacturers thrive, our manufacturing industry as a whole \nthrives, and our economy thrives. If our smaller suppliers are not \ncompetitive, they compromise the quality of the final product, or more \nrealistically, they lose out to more qualified suppliers abroad. We \nhave to decide how, as a nation, we are going to build our \nmanufacturing infrastructure so that we do not lose these jobs and this \npotential for economic growth.\n  As I look at our manufacturing competitors, I am struck by how little \nwe do to support this critical component of our economy. American big \nmanufacturers have had the resources to undergo something of a long and \npainful rebirth. They have learned from their competitors how to \nmodernize their manufacturing processes as well as their products. At \none time, it was sufficient to provide new products in a wide variety. \nThen as more companies had products, being the company with the best \nprice was the order winner. Then, all competitive companies had low \nprices, and the company with the highest quality products started \nwinning the orders. Now, a company must supply high quality, low cost \nproducts, in a wide variety and deliver it exactly when the customer \nneeds it. These demands are tremendous challenges for manufacturing, \nand unless you have state-of-the-art manufacturing practices, you \ncannot compete.\n  In the United States we are used to being the leaders in technologies \nof all kinds. Historically, English words have crept into foreign \nlanguages, because we were the inventors of new scientific concepts, \ntechnology, and products. Now when you describe the state-of-the-art \nmanufacturing practices you use words like ``kanban'' (pronounced kahn' \nbahn) and ``pokaoke\" (pronounced po kai oke'). These are Japanese words \nthat are known to production workers all over the United States. Kanban \nis a word which describes an efficient method of inventory management, \nand pokaoke is a method of making part of a production process immune \nfrom error or mistake proof thereby increasing the quality of the end \nproduct. We have learned these techniques from the Japanese, in order \nto compete with them.\n  In a global economy, there is no choice, a company must become state-\nof-the-art or it will go under. We must recognize that our policies \nmust change with the marketplace and adapt our manufacturing strategy \nto compete in this new global marketplace. The Manufacturing Extension \nProgram [MEP] is a big step forward in reforming the role of government \nin manufacturing. This forward looking program was begun under \nPresident Reagan, and has received growing support from Congress since \n1989.\n  The focus of the MEP is one that historically has been accepted as a \nproper role of government: education. The MEP strives to educate small \nand mid-sized manufacturers in the best practices that are available \nfor their manufacturing processes. With the MEP we have the opportunity \nto play a constructive role in keeping our companies competitive in a \nfiercely competitive, rapidly changing field. When manufacturing \npractices change so rapidly, it is the small and mid-sized companies \nthat suffer. They cannot afford to invest the necessary time and \ncapital to explore all new trends to determine which practices to adopt \nand then to train their workers, invest in new equipment, and \nrestructure their factories to accommodate the changes. The MEPs act as \na library of manufacturing practices, staying current on the latest \ninnovations, and educating companies on how to get the best results. At \nthe heart of the MEP is a team of teachers, engineers and experts with \nstrong private sector experience ready to reach small firms and their \nworkers about the latest manufacturing advances.\n  Another benefit of the MEP is that it brings its clients into contact \nwith other manufacturers, universities, national labs and any other \ninstitutions \n[[Page S5332]] where they might find solutions to their problems. \nFacilitating these contacts incorporates small manufacturers into a \nmanufacturing network, and this networking among manufacturers is a \npowerful competitive advantage. With close connections, suppliers begin \nworking with customers at early stages of design and engineering. When \nsuppliers and customers work together on product design, suppliers can \nprovide the input that makes manufacturing more efficient, customers \ncan communicate their specifications and timetables more effectively, \nand long term productive relationships are forged. These supplier/\ncustomer networks are common practice in other countries, and lead to \nmore efficient and therefore more competitive, design and production \npractices.\n  The MEP is our important tool in keeping our small manufacturers \ncompetitive. We are staying competitive in markets that have become \nhotbeds of global competition, and we are beginning to capture some new \nmarkets. More importantly, companies that have made use of MEP are \ngenerating new jobs rather than laying off workers or moving jobs \noverseas. These companies are growing and contributing to real growth \nin the U.S. economy. For each Federal dollar invested in a small or \nmidsized manufacturer through the MEP, there has been $8 of economic \ngrowth. This is a program that is paying for itself by growing our \neconomy.\n  Let me share with you some examples of success stories from the MEP. \nWhen the Boeing Co. told Manufacturing Development Inc. or, MDI, it \nneeded to meet Boeing's stringent D1-9000 quality standards, or risk \nlosing Boeing's business, MDI Vice President Michael Castor knew the \ncompany needed help. The 30-person sheet metal fabricator located in \nCheney, KS, depended on its work with Boeing, its largest customer. The \ncompany called the Mid-America Manufacturing Technology Center, an \nextension center in Kansas, which provided MDI employees on-site \ntraining in statistical process control and helped MDI secure a State \njob training grant that paid for half of the training costs. MDI not \nonly received certification by Boeing and retained its largest \ncustomer, but it also estimates that it will achieve a 50 percent \nreduction in scrap, reduce rework by 25 percent, and realize an annual \nsavings of $132,000.\n  Another example is HJE Co. Inc., a 4-person manufacturer of gas \natomization systems in Watervliet, NY. HJE produces ultrafine metal \npowders from molten metal. These powders are used, for example, in \nsolder and braze pastes and dental alloys. When Joe Strauss, founder of \nHJE, first came to the New York MEP he had lots of good ideas and some \nsketches and rough drawings. The New York MEP helped him turn those \nideas into blueprints of manufacturable parts, and helped him find \nmachine shops to make the parts. Strauss spent 6 months getting \nassistance and learning how to become a world class manufacturer. After \nlearning to use them with the help of the MEP, Strauss eventually \npurchased his own computer-aided design and manufacturing equipment and \nsoftware. Now HJE is one of only four companies of its kind in the \nworld and the only one in the United States. Joe is now used as a \nmaterials expert for others who seek help from the New York MEP. HJE, \nby the way, is expanding and moving into new areas in manufacturing.\n  These are just a couple of examples. There are many others.\n  Each MEP is funded after a competitive selection process, and \ncurrently there are 44 Manufacturing Technology Centers in 32 States. \nOne requirement for the centers is that the States supply matching \nfunds, ensuring that centers are going where there is a locally \nsupported need.\n  The appropriated funds for fiscal year 1995 would allow the Commerce \nDepartment to fund over 30 more centers, to further cover manufacturing \nareas in the country. The funds are required to grow the program and \nreach the States that still need them. Not only are the appropriated \nfunds needed to grow the program, but to maintain the centers that were \nonce covered by DOD funds. Historically, the DOD has covered the cost \nof some manufacturing extension centers because of its vested interest \nin maintaining a strong defense manufacturing base. DOD funding of the \nMEP has been a casualty of the defense cuts as defense dollars become \ntighter.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support the Manufacturing \nExtension Program. The MEP provides the arsenal of equipment, training, \nand expertise that our small and mid-sized manufacturers need to keep \nthem in the new global economic battlefield. The investment is in our \nfuture economic health, in high wage jobs for our workers, in the \nAmerican dream. Investment in the education of our small and mid-sized \nmanufacturers is investment in our future.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. First, I would like to remind everybody what is the base \nbill here. This started out being a bill that was going to pay for \ndisaster aid that is needed for California and perhaps in other areas.\n  It also has rescissions. These are reductions in spending from this \nyear's fiscal budgets throughout the Government to try to reduce the \ndeficit, try to pay for the disaster aid, and to try to begin to move \ntoward controlling our rate of growth. That is the basic premise that \nwe are starting from here.\n  When we have all these amendments--although some of them are very \njustifiable, good, small amounts of money, they just keep growing. For \na week now, I have seen lists floating around here with add-backs here, \nadd-backs there, many of which I like. When we check into it, usually \nit is an add-back on top of a very large program already.\n  Second, this amendment, I understand, has four components, at least \npart of which there is support for, and an agreement could probably \nhave been worked out to support it.\n  I understand that Senator Gramm from Texas, chairman of the State, \nJustice and Commerce Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, had \nindicated he could go along with some of these. But it adds back money \nin these areas: $26.5 million in the manufacturing extension \npartnership program; adds back $1.5 million from salaries and expenses \nof the Commerce Department's Technology Administration; it adds back \nfunding of $5 million in funding for NOAA coastal ocean program; and it \nadds back $14 million in the climate and global change research area.\n  Some of those sound pretty good, but in each case it is an add-back \non top of money that was already there.\n  The central issue here is the funding for the manufacturing and \nextension partnership program and the fact that it has been growing so \nrapidly. Funding for this unauthorized program increased dramatically \nover the past few years. For instance, this program did not exist until \nfiscal year 1991. In that year, the funding was $11.9 million; then it \nwent to $15.1 million; and then $16.9 million; then $30.3 million; in \nthis fiscal year it jumped to $90.6 million. Even with the rescission \nor the cuts proposed in this bill, we still would have had a doubling \nof the program. The Senator noted that there is still $67 million, I \nbelieve, that would be left. It is projected this program would go up \nto $146.6 and keep going up.\n  This is a new program that has grown like top seed. Maybe the plan is \nover the years to bring it down and maybe bring in private-sector \nfunding. That is all well and good. The fact of the matter is it has \nbeen doubling and tripling in recent years. That is why on this side, \non behalf of the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the \ncommittee, our urging to the Members is that they vote to table this \namendment, because if we do not do it here, there will be another one \nthat will add money, and another one will add money, and we think we \nhave to control the rate of growth and not start a long process that \nwill add back additional spending to this bill. I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point. We are not adding \nback $26 million of the $24 million, and we are not adding back $14 \nmillion, but $7 million on the climate and global change research. I \nwant to correct those figures.\n  I wanted also to include, Mr. President, the point made that it does \nrestore not only the manufacturing extension but the NOAA coastal ocean \nprogram, the NOAA climate and global \n[[Page S5333]] change program and the Undersecretary for Technology \nOffice, and it shows the United States-Israel Bilateral Science and \nTechnology Agreement continues.\n  Right to the point about growing: We transferred from the Department \nof Defense at the request of the Republican Coalition for Defense \nReconversion. These programs did not grow. It was just really \ntransferred as more applicable to the civilian side than the military \nside. That is why we have that amount in there.\n  It certainly has not grown just like export promotion in agriculture, \nwhich I am sure my distinguished colleague from Mississippi supports, \nwhich is over 1 billion bucks.\n  Talking about rescissions--now, just with the atmosphere or \nenvironment of frustration of amendments coming and going, I can say \ncategorically, Mr. President, we could not offer an amendment all last \nweek. I tried to. What we had was a fill-up-the-tree kind of approach \nand we had to take the amendments, and we had no votes. We sat around \nhere for 3 days with no votes on amendments. My amendment has never \nbeen considered in subcommittee. Rolled in the Appropriations Committee \nas if we had considered it. And it only takes from other programs \nunexpended balances, rather than eliminate viable programs endorsed on \nboth sides of the aisle that are not growing like topsy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \nletter from the president of the Advanced Technology Coalition, with \nthe encompassing endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Advanced Technology Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1994.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: On behalf of the Advanced Technology \n     Coalition, we want to express our strong support for the \n     Senate version of the National Competitiveness Act, S.4.\n       We believe that the bill deserves bipartisan support. We \n     ask that you vote for the bill when it reaches the floor in \n     the very near future. Its passage is essential to \n     strengthening the ability of our companies and members to \n     compete in the international marketplace; in short, S.4 means \n     jobs and will contribute to our nation's long-term economic \n     health.\n       Combined, the Advanced Technology Coalition represents 5 \n     million U.S. workers, 3,500 electronics firms, 329,00 \n     engineers, and 13,500 companies in the manufacturing sector. \n     The Coalition is a diverse group of high-tech companies, \n     traditional manufacturing industries, labor, professional \n     societies, universities and research consortia that have a \n     common goal of ensuring America's industrial and \n     technological leadership.\n       The members of the Advanced Technology Coalition have \n     invested an enormous amount of time working with both the \n     House and the Senate in developing and refining the National \n     Competitiveness Act. The Coalition believes that its views \n     have been heard by Congress and reflected in the bill.\n       In short, we believe that S.4 will promote American \n     competitiveness and enhance the ability of the private sector \n     to create jobs in this country. We hope that you will play a \n     leadership role in ensuring its passage. We would be happy to \n     sit down with you or your staff to discuss the bill in \n     greater detail.\n           Sincerely,\n       See attached list of associations, professional \n     organizations, academic institutions and companies:\n       American Electronics Association (AEA).\n       National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).\n       The Modernization Forum.\n       Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC).\n       Honeywell, Inc.\n       National Society of Professional Engineers.\n       Business Executives for National Security.\n       IEEE-USA.\n       Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI).\n       Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronics \n     Circuits (IPC).\n       Wilson and Wilson.\n       American Society for Training and Development.\n       Catapult Communications Corporation.\n       Dover Technologies.\n       Texas Instruments, Inc.\n       Columbia University.\n       Motorola.\n       Intel Corporation.\n       Cray Research.\n       Electron Transfer Technologies.\n       Electronic Data Systems (EDS).\n       American Society for Engineering Education.\n       U.S. West, Incorporated.\n       Electronic Industries Association.\n       Tera Computer Company.\n       Southeast Manufacturing Technology Center.\n       Convex Computer Corporation.\n       Association for Manufacturing Technology.\n       Semiconductor Research Corporation.\n       American Society of Engineering Societies.\n       AT\n       Hoya Micro Mask, Inc.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I also ask unanimous consent we print a letter from \nPresident Clinton, an endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Fritz: Thank you for your concern about the technology \n     investment programs we have built together over the past two \n     years. Your steadfast support of the Advanced Technology \n     Program (ATP), the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), and \n     related technology investment efforts has been indispensable \n     in educating the new Congress as to their economic and \n     national security value, and countering proposed legislative \n     actions that threaten their existence.\n       These programs are a high priority to me and I will \n     continue to fight for them. I have expressed strong \n     opposition to the cuts to TRP and ATP in H.R. 889, and I am \n     working to see that an acceptable bill comes out of \n     conference. And, as you know, I have indicated that I would \n     veto H.R. 1158 in the form passed by the House; the cuts to \n     key technology programs are among the serious problems that I \n     have with the bill.\n       Our technology investments in partnership with industry, \n     while a small part of our entire federal R portfolio, make \n     essential contributions to national security and economic \n     growth. Together with TRP and ATP, initiatives such as the \n     High Performance Computing and Communications program, the \n     Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle, the Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership, Challenge Grants for Technology in \n     Education, Information Infrastructure grants, and the \n     Environmental Technology Initiative provide the necessary \n     seed money for exciting, rewarding education for our \n     children, productive jobs for our working people, and a \n     better quality of life for all of us in the twenty-first \n     century.\n       I have asked Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chair of the National \n     Economic Council (NEC), to lead a team composed of senior \n     officials from throughout my Administration to continue to \n     build support for these vital investments in the nation's \n     future. We want to work closely with you to protect our \n     technology investments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding a technology/\nNOAA amendment for myself, and Senators Thurmond, Bingaman, Breaux, \nGlenn, Graham, Leahy, Levin, Kennedy, Kerry, Kohl, Lieberman, Kerrey, \nMurray, Pell, Rockefeller, and Sarbanes.\n  There are many rescissions in the Commerce, Justice and State chapter \nof this bill which I am not pleased with. There are four particular \nrescissions in the Commerce Department section of the committee \nreported bill which my amendment would restore--the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology Manufacturing Extension Program, the Office \nof the Under Secretary of Technology, the NOAA Climate and Global \nChange Research Program, and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program. These \nrescissions total $37.5 million and my amendment proposes $37.5 million \nin alternative rescissions in their place. My amendment is fully \noffset, dollar for dollar.\n\n\n                                offsets\n\n  The offsets in this amendment are quite simple, and they are all from \nother Commerce Department appropriations accounts. We propose \nrescinding $30 million from the unobligated balances in the NIST \nconstruction account. There are currently $195 million to such \nunobligated balances. Most of this amount is set to go on contract. But \nseveral projects have been held up due to environmental concerns and \ndelays, and this rescission should have little impact on the agency \nbeing able to move ahead with modernization of its priority \nlaboratories. This account has never been authorized, and there should \nbe no reason why this rescission is not acceptable to the managers of \nthe bill.\n  Second, we have recommended two rescissions of prior year unobligated \nbalances from NOAA. We have recommended rescinding $5 million of \nunobligated balances from NOAA's construction account. Since fiscal \nyear 1992 Congress has appropriated over $9 million for above standard \ncosts for a \n[[Page S5334]] new environmental research laboratory. The principle \nconstruction costs for this facility are the responsibility of GSA. The \nconstruction of this facility has been held up by a number of \nenvironmental and community concerns.\n  Finally, we have proposed rescinding $2.5 million of prior year \nrecoveries within the GOES Satellite contingency fund. This is a one-\ntime appropriation account that Warren Rudman and I established in 1991 \nto ensure the GOES Satellite Program continued. The program got back on \ntrack, and the first GOES-next satellite is now in orbit--these \nunobligated funds are no longer needed.\n  So each offset is based on good financial management. We have \nidentified prior year appropriations that are not required or not \nneeded at this time. Our proposed restorations, however, continue \npriority NOAA and technology programs that should not be cut.\n\n\n                              restorations\n\n  Our amendment provides restoration of appropriations for four \nprograms:\n  Technology programs: With respect to the Commerce technology and \ncompetitiveness programs. The committee bill rescinds $26.5 million \nfrom the NIST Manufacturing Extension Program--from Manufacturing \nTechnology Centers--and it rescinds $1.5 million from the Office of the \nUnder Secretary of Technology, Mary Good.\n  No. 1, Office of the Under Secretary for Technology: I find it hard \nto believe that this Senate would want to cut Under Secretary Mary \nGood's office. She is the finest Under Secretary for Technology we have \nhad. She is the kind of leader that we had in mind when the Congress \npassed the 1988 Trade Act. This cut would make her either lay off her \nstaff or terminate valuable projects, like the Commerce Department's \nshare of the United States/Israel Science and Technology Agreement. \nWhen I was chairman, we annually exceeded the Bush and Reagan budget \nrequests for this office. I was requested to do so by Republican \nmembers of this committee, and I was happy to do so. Further, I cannot \nunderstand why we would want to prevent the Under Secretary of \nTechnology from following through participating in a technology and \nscience agreement with our allies, the Israelis.\n  So, first, our amendment restores funding for her office and prevents \nany reduction to the U.S./Israeli science and technology agreement.\n  No. 2, Manufacturing extension: Second, the House bill and the \ncommittee-reported bill currently cuts the NIST Manufacturing \nTechnology Centers by $26.5 million. Our amendment would restore $24 \nmillion of this program, and leave a rescission of $3.1 million.\n  The Manufacturing Extension Program now supports 44 centers in 32 \nStates. Most were started with defense conversion [TRP] funds but have \nnow been transferred onto NIST's budget. These centers provide hands-on \ntechnical support to small to medium-sized manufacturers to help them \nupgrade equipment, improve production processes and save jobs. They are \ncost-shared with States and are competitively awarded. This is a merit-\nbased program--neither the President nor the Secretary of Commerce, nor \nmembers of Commerce--can earmark these centers. Each center is tailored \nto the industrial characteristics and needs of the area in which it is \nlocated. So the center in Philadelphia, is different from the center in \nAlbuquerque, NM, which is different again from the manufacturing \nextension center in Rolla, MO.\n  Now there are two specific impacts from the rescission proposed in \nthe committee reported bill. First, NIST will not be adding as many new \ncenters as we intended when I fought for these funds in conference last \nyear. And I should note that NIST informs me that they expect \napplications to come in from many States.\n  Second, some of the 37 centers that were started with Defense \nappropriations will have to begin phasing out operations--because NIST \nwill lack the funding to take over the Federal portion of their \noperational support.\n  This is an effective program that has always been bipartisan. I \nremember when former Vice President Dan Quayle traveled to the Great \nLakes Manufacturing Center in Cleveland, OH. He praised their work and \nwas particularly impressed with their role in keeping an automotive \npart manufacturer in business. General Motors told the small firm to \ncut costs or they would contract with a Mexican firm. The NIST \nmanufacturing center designed machinery to automate and modernize the \nfirm's operations--and the company prospered and added even more jobs \nin Cleveland. In fact, there is a picture of the Vice President in the \nentrance to that Great Lakes Manufacturing Center.\n\n\n                 NOAA OCEAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS\n\n  No. 3, NOAA, Coastal Ocean Program. Third, my amendment restores $5 \nmillion to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's [NOAA] \nCoastal Ocean Program. The Coastal Ocean Program was established as a \nagency-wide initiative to focus the capabilities of all NOAA line \norganizations to deal with coastal and oceanic issues of national \nconcern. Examples include fisheries research in the Bering Sea off \nAlaska and the Georges Bank off Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine; \nand estuary and ecosystem studies in Florida and the Chesapeake Bay. \nThe Coastal Ocean Program is merit-based and employs competitive peer \nreview. The program was recently praised by the National Research \nCouncil.\n  The House rescission, which the committee reported bill agrees to, \neliminates half the Coastal Ocean Program's funding! This would result \nin a loss of ongoing field and laboratory work and it would impair \nNOAA's ability to attract quality scientists and oceanographers. Many \ncoastal ocean projects would have to be terminated or severely \ncurtailed.\n  No. 4. NOAA Climate and Global Change Program. Finally, our amendment \nwould restore $7 million for the NOAA Climate and Global Change \nResearch Program. Specifically, we would seek to restore cuts that the \ncommittee reported bill, which cuts twice as much as the House bill \nfrom this program, would require in the research and understanding of \nthe role of the oceans in climate change.\n  NOAA's Climate and Global Change Program is a competitive and peer-\nreviewed program of scientific grants geared toward improving our \nunderstanding of long-term changes in the oceans and atmosphere.\n  This is a quality program that increasingly is paying off by allowing \nNOAA to have more accurate long-term weather forecasts. We used to \nthink of a wet side to NOAA and a dry side or atmospheric side of NOAA. \nThe Climate and Global Change Program is breaking down these artificial \nbarriers by proving that the oceans hold the key to global climate and \nweather.\n  A case in point is NOAA's program to monitor and forecast El Nino \nevents. El Nino is an interannual change in the air-sea conditions of \nthe tropical Pacific that can cause torrential rains, droughts and \nmajor shifts in ocean conditions. For example, during a 1983 El Nino, \n600 people died in South America, and Peruvian economic losses due to \nsevere weather and poor fishing were estimated at $2 billion. In the \nUnited States, the west coast and Gulf of Mexico were hit by major \nwinter storms that led to beach erosion, flooding and mudslides. \nIncreasingly, NOAA's climate and global change research is correlating \nsevere weather events and the temperature of the equatorial Pacific. \nThe Program plays a key role in efforts to develop El Nino predictions \nthat could improve planning and preparation for such events, thereby \nsaving hundreds of lives and preventing millions in economic losses.\n  Mr. President, again this amendment is fully offset. I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment, offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina, deserves strong support from this body. I \nam a cosponsor of the amendment for a very basic reason. Our amendment \nwill restore funding for what's called the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership [MEP] Program-- a vital network of facilities dedicated to \na strong manufacturing base in this country. With vision and a lot of \nhard work, the Senator from South Carolina has turned a very basic idea \ninto a very powerful, invaluable reality.\n  It seems incredibly stupid to cut funds from a program that has the \ntrack record of this one. The name says it all--manufacturing \nextension. That means that because of this program, the small- and \nmedium-sized businesses \n[[Page S5335]] of this country have place to contact, to call, to visit \nwhere they get the latest there is to know about how to make products \nand turn a profit. Cut the funds, eliminate these centers, and cut off \nthe businesses of our country from what they cannot get anywhere else.\n  Forty-four manufacturing extension centers now operate in 32 States. \nThe centers are sharing expertise, information, and advice to smaller- \nand mid-sized companies that want to manufacture products and want to \nstay in business. This extension network has been so successful that \nother States are waiting In the wings to get centers of their own, and \nto link hundreds and even thousands of the businesses in their State to \na central repository of people and expertise steeped in the state-of-\nart in manufacturing and technology. Anyone who knows what the \nAgricultural Extension Service did in this country to help farmers \nlearn about the latest techniques for irrigation, for farming, for \nkeeping their costs down, understand this model now applied to \nmanufacturing very well.\n  These manufacturing extension centers play a role that cannot and \nwill not be duplicated by any single part of the private sector. They \nplay a truly public role, because their only client is the public \ninterest. They share information and ideas among businesses. They learn \nwhat works on 1 factory floor, and help 20 more businesses avoid \nreinventing the wheel by learning from the first. They spread manuals, \ntraining guides, information across their States--with the latest \nfindings and ideas on how to run and fix equipment, make products \nefficiently, organize and train a work force, and make profits.\n  We all know how information and know-how spread in places like \nSilicon Valley and Cambridge, MA. Extension programs tie the rest of \nthe country's small manufacturers\n into these and other hubs of new technology, and allow even the \nsmallest firm to share in new ideas and equipment in a way that enables \nbusinesses across the country to prosper.\n\n  In West Virginia, this is the program responsible for drawing \ntogether two facilities, the West Virginia Industrial Extension Service \nat West Virginia University and the Robert C. Byrd Institute for \nAdvanced Manufacturing at Marshall University. The program is called \nthe West Virginia Partnership for Industrial Modernization [WVPIM].\n  Because of this effort, the hundreds of small businesses in my State \nhave a place to go for help and expertise that would not be there \notherwise. In Huntington, WV, there is the story of Wooten Machine Co. \nBecause of the help that this company got from the Institute for \nAdvanced Manufacturing, Wooten went from making parts manually to \ncomputerizing their operation. Now they are talking about hiring more \npeople.\n  They are not alone. Stinson Manufacturing in Alta, WV, went from a 4-\nperson operation to one that now employs 28 people and has annual gross \nsales of more than $1 million, again with the help of the Robert C. \nByrd Institute.\n  This is not just about tying together the resources in just one \nState. Mr. President, there is a tremendous advantage in being part of \na national network of centers planted in different States. With the \nhelp of this network, West Virginia firms are staying on top of the \ninnovations and techniques that are being collected from thousands of \nsmall- and mid-sized firms throughout the country. Larger firms will \nalways be able to keep up with modernization, they have the staff and \nresources to do that. But if this unique network of manufacturing \ncenters shrinks or dies off, the losers will be the small firms in our \nStates.\n  Nationally, there are almost 400,000 small- and mid-sized \nmanufacturers that employ less than 500 people apiece--these \nmanufacturers account for over half our national manufacturing output. \nNearly 12 million people, in all 50 States, work at these small- and \nmid-sized firms.\n  Mr. President, in the global marketplace, firms of any size must \nmaster modern technologies, management techniques, and methods of work \norganization. The exciting part of progress is that you don't have to \nrun a business in Chicago or Detroit or New Orleans to be the best \nmaker of an auto-part, a computer chip, a machine tool. You can be in \nremote parts of Montana or West Virginia or South Carolina. But you do \nhave to be linked to the information that is necessary to keep up with \nthe advances breaking out every day.\n  Our Nation's overall economy requires thousands of small- and mid-\nsized firms keeping up at breakneck pace with what works in design, \nproduction, marketing, training, and all kinds of other practices.\n  Mr. President, the American people know what it will mean to our \nNation's long-term economic survival if we do not keep making products \nand being the best at manufacturing. We have to build things to survive \nin this increasingly competitive global marketplace. The Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership is the best, most efficient way to advance this \ncause.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a Dear Colleague distributed by \nmyself and several colleagues on the importance of this effort be \nreprinted immediately after this statement.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: Tomorrow, Friday, March 24, 1995, the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee will mark-up the many \n     rescissions passed by the House of Representatives as part of \n     the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriation.\n       One item included in the House package is a $26.5 million \n     rescission from the Manufacturing Extension Partnership--that \n     amounts to 30 percent of this current year's appropriated \n     funds.\n       We believe Congress should continue its history of \n     bipartisan support for this unique network of assistance \n     dedicated to equipping small-and-medium-sized businesses and \n     their employees to maximize their potential in manufacturing \n     and for growth.\n       The MEP centers exist in most states, and play an essential \n     role in diffusing and sharing the state-of-the-art ideas, \n     lessons, and methods that businesses in all of our states--\n     especially when they're not in metropolitan centers--would \n     not otherwise obtain.\n       To help you think about the vital role of the Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership, we offer you the following:\n\n\n10 key facts about the manufacturing extension partnership--and what's \n        at stake for the businesses and economies of your state\n\n       1. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) is based \n     on the basic, proven idea that a strong manufacturing base is \n     essential to this nation's economic strength and future. \n     Manufacturing employs almost 19 million Americans, \n     representing more than 20 percent of the private sector \n     workforce and accounting for almost a fifth of the U.S. GNP \n     over the last 40 years.\n       2. Small manufacturing firms, with less than 500 \n     employees--the primary customers of the MEP--contribute more \n     than half of total U.S. value-added in manufacturing and \n     employ almost two-thirds of all manufacturing employees, \n     approximately 12 million Americans.\n       3. America's small manufacturers know their challenge lies \n     in being able to learn about and adopt modern manufacturing \n     equipment and ``best practices,'' and overcoming various \n     barriers to change, including\n      geographic location or even isolation, awareness, \n     information, finance, and regulations. These are the \n     smaller companies across the country being assisted by \n     manufacturing engineers at MEP extension centers run by \n     local, state, and non-profits.\n       Median size of MEP's client companies is 50 employees; \n     median sales of a MEP's client companies is $5.4 million; \n     median age of MEP's client companies is 26 years.\n       4. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership is industry-\n     driven, and market-defined. It builds on and magnifies \n     existing state and local industrial extension initiatives and \n     resources. Centers are managed and staffed by experts with \n     private sector manufacturing experience.\n       5. The MEP Centers are awarded funds using a rigorous, \n     merit-based competitive process.\n       6. MEP and its Centers focus services on activities where \n     economies of scale do not exist in the marketplace, and on \n     only those firms which demonstrate a commitment to their own \n     growth and development.\n       7. The small amount of federal dollars available for MEP \n     leverages substantial resources in state and local \n     governments, as well as the private sector.\n       8. MEP is committed to performance measurements which focus \n     on the bottom-line economic impact for client companies. This \n     program has shown a rate of return of 7-to-1 for the federal \n     government's investment, with concrete benefit in increased \n     sales, cost savings, and jobs for small manufacturers.\n       9. Companies using MEP centers are becoming more \n     competitive and are improving their long-term prospects for \n     growth. Their goal is to retain existing jobs, create new \n     high-skilled jobs, and contribute broader economic benefits.\n        [[Page S5336]] 10. Manufacturing Extension Centers are in \n     32 states, and one of them could be yours. But even if your \n     state is\n      still without a center, eliminating funds from the \n     Manufacturing Extension Program will mean giving up on the \n     goal of a modern, national network to provide \n     irreplaceable technical assistance to our businesses and \n     workforce.\n       In conclusion, our point is: ``fiscal year rescissions \n     undermines manufacturing strength''\n       The proposed $26.5 million rescission for the Manufacturing \n     extension Partnership would weaken the emerging, nationwide \n     network of extension centers--co-funded by state and local \n     governments--that provide small and medium-sized \n     manufacturers with technical assistance as they upgrade their \n     operations to boost competitiveness and retain or create new \n     jobs. The rescission would reduce funding available for \n     establishing new centers around the country. Approximately 10 \n     new centers could be funded in FY 1995, rather than the \n     planned 36 centers. Reducing the number of new centers would \n     slow the delivery of MEP services to large regions of the \n     United States--and many thousands of small companies.\n       We urge your support for his important endeavor. For \n     further information, please contact Laura Philips at 4-9184 \n     in Senator Lieberman's office or Ken Levinson at 4-7515 in \n     Senator Rockefeller's office.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joe Lieberman.\n     John Glenn.\n     Jay Rockefeller.\n     Jeff Bingaman.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the Hollings \namendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The \namendment would restore programs that are important to the people of \nMassachusetts and the entire country. I would also like to note that \noffsets for each of these programs is provided so the total amount of \nthe rescission package is not affected.\n  NIST's Manufacturing Extension Program [MEP] is vitally important to \nsmall businesses in my State. MEP supports our Bay State Skills and \nUniversity of Massachusetts technical assistance programs for small- \nand mid-sized Massachusetts companies. The House bill rescinds $26.5 \nmillion from this program and the Senate bill retains this rescission. \nThe Hollings amendment would restore the entire amount rescinded from \nthe MEP Program.\n  The second program addressed in the amendment is the NOAA Coastal \nOcean Program [COP], a nationwide science program that is conducting \nvery important interdisciplinary research on oceanographic problems. As \npart of the COP, a major field study is presently being conducted of \nGeorges Bank as part of the U.S. Global Ocean Ecosystems Research \nProgram [U.S. GLOBEC]. The main objective of the study is to understand \nthe physical and biological processes that control the abundance of \npopulations of commercially important marine animals. The House and \nSenate Bills rescind $5 million of COP's $11 million in fiscal year \n1995 funding--40 percent of the budget. The rescission is harmful not \nonly to U.S. marine science but also to resource management decision-\nmaking which depends on the results of this science. The Hollings \namendment would restore the $5 million rescission in the NOAA \noperations, research and facilities account for the Coastal Ocean \nProgram, resulting in retention of $11 million in funding for this \nyear. As an offset, the amendment would increase the rescission in NOAA \nconstruction account from $8 million to $13 million. This would \ndecrease the construction account from $97 million to $84 million. NOAA \nsupports this change.\n  The final program that the amendment addresses is the NOAA Global \nClimate Change Program. This program seeks to develop a clearer picture \nof the relative roles of various greenhouse gases in causing global \nwarming. The Senate bill rescinds $14 million of the $78 million in \nfiscal year 1995 funding. The amendment would restore $7 million of the \nrescission for this critical program. The offset would come from the \nNIST construction fund and the GOES construction fund.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from South Carolina for his \nleadership in these oceans and technology issues--which he has \nchampioned for years. It is my pleasure to serve with him on the \nCommerce Committee, where he was recently chairman and is now the \nranking Democrat.\n  I join with him to prevent short-sighted cuts in these beneficial \nprograms that exemplify the kind of nationally important work \ngovernment can do so well and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and \nyield time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly I just wanted to respond \nto my friend from Mississippi and say we are at a time when, obviously, \nwe have to make some tough choices, a lot of tough choices. There are a \nlot of rescissions in this bill to cut spending and I am going to \nsupport most of them. But it seems to me this is one that does not make \nsense because of the numbers I cited, which is $8 in economic growth \nfor every $1 we spend in this program.\n  I have to tell my colleague, I know we all hear different messages \nfrom our people back home. When I am in Connecticut there is one \nquestion that I think is most on people's minds, resonating throughout \nthe State, and I think, throughout the country. The question is: ``Can \nyou do something in Washington to protect my job, to keep my job \nsecure?'' se If people have lost a job, as too many people in my State \nhave, because of manufacturing downsizing, the question becomes: ``What \ncan you do to help me get a new job?''\n  I know some of the old industries in our State which have downsized, \nsome have even closed, are not going to expand in the near future. The \nonly answer here is to grow the economy. There are tax policies I will \nlook forward to supporting that will encourage capital formation and \nhelp make that possible.\n  But it seems to me one of the best things we can do is to create \nmanufacturing extension centers that will reach out to the small- and \nmid-size companies to help them grow and help them create jobs. This is \na program where I feel we make a mistake by cutting a single dollar \nbecause this is a program that gives a lot of people out there--people \nwho are worried about their futures--some hope that there is a new and \na good job, a high-paying job, around the corner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi should \nunderstand, this does not add back. It does not add back one red cent. \nIt is offset within the same budget for unexpended construction funds \nthat are sitting there.\n  I am here going along with the original premise and the continuing \npremise of rescissions. That is the basic premise. This amendment is in \nconformance. It does not add back. It readjusts allocations under the \nsame budget from construction--whether you are going to build office \nbuildings or you are going to start building jobs.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we have made our points. We will be \nprepared to yield our time and go to a vote if the Senator would like \nto. I think we only have a total of about 5 minutes or so left. How \nmuch do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 6 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from South Carolina has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will go along with the suggestion of \nthe distinguished Senator from Mississippi. What happened, two or three \nSenators wanted to be heard, but we only have 3 minutes if they got \nhere.\n  Is it the point to yield the remainder of our time, make the motion, \nget the yeas and nays? Is that it?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very good.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back on the \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to table the Hollings amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n   [[Page S5337]] The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Specter and I rise today to \nhonor a native son of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who is going to \nbe honored next month in Indiana, PA--the birthplace of Jimmy Stewart--\nwith a museum that is going to open right about half a block away from \nthe birthplace of Jimmy Stewart.\n  Many of us have been working long and hard on this museum, trying to \nget a suitable museum for a man like Jimmy Stewart.\n  Jimmy Stewart asked, when the people of Indiana, PA, went to him and \nasked to do a museum for him, that it not be anything fancy; that he \nwanted it to be very modest. He did not want the University of Indiana, \nPA, to have a big museum dedicated to him. He wanted something very \nsimple.\n  In fact, he refused to have anyone from Hollywood participate in any \nof the fundraising. He said he wanted it to be something from the \ncommunity and not anything that was generated with a lot of money and a \nlot of fanfare; that that would make him feel uncomfortable.\n  So the people of Indiana, PA, have set about the process of raising \nthe money locally and secured the third floor of an old house, just a \nvery small amount of space. Mr. Stewart donated the artifacts for the \nmuseum, some of his personal memorabilia. And, in fact, he still has \nseveral old friends who have been sort of shepherding this cause along.\n  I am rising today with Senator Specter to pay tribute to him and to \nthe people of Indiana, PA, a little town in western Pennsylvania; a \ntown that, frankly, has had some tough times of late. In fact, Indiana \nCounty has the highest unemployment rate of any county in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  But they pulled themselves together and are putting together this \nreally fine and lovely and modest tribute to Jimmy Stewart.\n  The man is an incredible man in America. He is an actor who has \nappeared in 71 films. Obviously, we all know the famous films that he \nhas been in. Who has gone through a Christmas holiday without seeing \nthe brilliant George Bailey part that he played and that we all can \nidentify with as someone who has gone through some tough times and been \nable to face those tough times, and the spiritual role that he played \nin that movie.\n  I can still relate to him as I watch ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' and the role he played as a U.S. Senator in fighting for \nwhat the people of his State called for.\n  He has been an inspiration not only on the movie screen, but he has \nbeen a tremendous inspiration as a war hero.\n He was assigned to the Army Air Corps, rising from private to bomber \npilot, to commander of the Eighth Air Force Bomber Squadron. He, \nhimself, flew 21 missions over enemy territory, including Berlin, \nBremen and Frankfurt. By the time it was over Over There, James M. \nStewart would be known as colonel, and he would be later decorated with \nan Air Medal, The Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Croix de Guerre. \nAll told he accumulated 27 years of service in Active and Reserve Duty, \neven attaining the rank of brigadier general.\n  On May 20 in Indiana, PA, we will be celebrating Jimmy Stewart's \nbirthday and the opening of the Jimmy Stewart Museum. And, in so doing, \nwe really do honor a great American, someone who takes life in stride \nand who is just a wonderful example of the goodness that is in America.\n  I just want to read a couple of quotes from Jimmy Stewart that I \nfound to be amusing and somewhat typical of the man. He said once:\n\n       Jean Harlow had to kiss me, and it was then I knew that I'd \n     never been kissed before. By the time we were ready to shoot \n     the scene, my psychology was all wrinkled.\n\n  On his experience in the military and in the war:\n\n       I always prayed, but I didn't really pray for my life or \n     for the lives of other men. I prayed that I wouldn't make a \n     mistake.\n\n  And finally, when he was flying a plane back for the Army, he ran \ninto engine trouble while flying a tour of duty in 1959, but managed to \nbring his plane to a safe landing. He was quoted after he got out of \nthe plane:\n\n       All I could think of was not my personal safety, but what \n     Senator Margaret Chase Smith (who was then chairman of the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee) would say if I crashed such \n     an expensive plane.\n\n  [[Page S5338]] That is the kind of down-to-earth goodness and \nhumbleness that Jimmy Stewart brought to the stage and to the screen \nand to the families of millions and millions of Americans and millions \naround the world.\n  He, frankly, deserves a greater tribute but, frankly, I cannot think \nof a more appropriate tribute to a modest man, to a good man, than a \nmodest museum in his own hometown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, in commemorating the opening \nof the museum in Indiana, PA, on May 20 of this year, which will \ncommemorate the 87th birthday of a great American.\n  James Stewart spoke in the Senate of the United States to a \nspellbound crowd in the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' unlike \nthose assembled here today, who are still conducting some substantial \nbusiness as we near the completion of this important appropriations \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend while we get order on \nthe floor.\n  Could we please have order in the Senate?\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I feel a particular affinity for James \nStewart for many reasons. In addition to playing a U.S. Senator for the \nmovies, he was also the lead actor in ``The Philadelphia Story,'' for \nwhich he won an Academy Award.\n  He is a Pennsylvanian from a small town, Indiana, PA, which has a \nvery striking statue in his honor.\n  In opening this museum on May 20--we talk about it on an \nappropriations bill--it is relevant to know that there is no Federal \nfunding, at least to my knowledge, for this museum, which the people \nare offering as a tribute to James Stewart.\n  He has really a remarkable career as an actor and as a great patriot, \none of the first movie stars to enter in World War II. He rose from the \nrank of private to the rank of colonel. He had 20 missions over Bremen, \nFrankfurt, and Berlin. He is an all-American hero. He reminds us of \nthat when he appears frequently on television and in the reruns of \n``It's a Wonderful Life.''\n  James Stewart is an American success story, and it is entirely \nappropriate that he be honored in his hometown on May 20 of this year.\n  Jimmy Stewart's achievements on and off the silver screen are well \nknown to us, and Indiana, PA, is indeed fortunate to claim him as one \nof its own. He was born in Indiana, PA, on May 20, 1908, and graduated \nfrom Princeton University in 1932 with a degree in Architecture. \nShortly after his graduation, Jimmy joined a summer theater group, \ndebuting that same year in a production of ``Goodbye Again.'' After \nseveral years of performing in Broadway productions, Jimmy made his \nfilm debut in ``The Murder Man'' in 1935. His legendary film career was \nlaunched, and over the next several years he would bring us such \nclassics as ``It's A Wonderful Life,'' ``Destry Rides Again,'' and \n``The Philadelphia Story.'' His 1939 ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' \nstands before us all--here in Washington and all throughout our \ncountry--as an abiding testimony to the importance of courage and \nintegrity.\n  Jimmy Stewart's excellence in film, however, is matched by his sense \nof duty and patriotism. When his country called him to serve in World \nWar II, he answered willingly; he served as a bomber pilot in the U.S. \nAir Force with dedication and distinction, earning several medals and \ncommendations--and yet all the while with a sense of modesty and \nhumility that belied the star-of-the-screen status he had left behind. \nBy the time he returned home to the States, Mr. Jimmy Stewart had \nbecome Col. Jimmy Stewart, and over the course of his continued service \nin the Air Force Reserve in the years after the war he rose to the rank \nof Brigadier General.\n  His post-war return to the world of film brought us some of his \ngreatest cinematic achievements, including such collaborative efforts \nwith Alfred Hitchcock as ``Rear Window,'' ``The Man Who Knew Too \nMuch,'' and ``Vertigo.'' In 1950, he brought us ``Harvey,'' in 1953, \n``The Glenn Miller Story,'' and in 1962, ``The Man Who Shot Liberty \nValance.'' And in the most gloriously atypical fashion, he and his wife \nGloria remained together through it all year after year until her \nrecent passing.\n  Jimmy Stewart's many contributions to the world of film, as well as \nthe steadfast humility of his character and the tremendous sacrifice \nthat he made as he served in behalf of his country, have endeared him \nto us all, and the occasion of the opening of this museum in his honor \nis a special one indeed. I am personally grateful for the joy that he \nhas brought to us in his films and for the tremendous model of \nintegrity and selflessness that he has exhibited for so many years, and \nI am hopeful that this modest museum erected in his honor will serve to \nenshrine his contributions and his character for many generations to \ncome.\n  These remarks, along with the remarks by my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Santorum, as we pay tribute to this very, very distinguished \nAmerican and Pennsylvanian.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5337-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5338-S5380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator, the question \nbefore the Senate is amendment No. 441 in the second degree to \namendment No. 427. The Senator needs to ask unanimous consent for that \nto be set aside.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, shortly I think we will have some agreement on an \namendment that I will offer. I thought what I might do is take \nadvantage of this time to briefly summarize this for colleagues. I \nappreciate the hard work of the majority leader and the bipartisan \nspirit of this.\n  Senior citizens face a confusing world of rules, conditions, \nexceptions, limitations, and even outright scams when choosing their \nsupplemental health insurance and grappling with the Medicare system. \nCongress recognized the difficulty seniors face when it established a \nprogram, which is really a wonderful program. It is sort of the best \nexample of grant money going a long way, and is called the Insurance \nInformation Counseling and Assistance Grant Program in OBRA 1990. This \nwas a recognition by the Congress that Medicare beneficiaries need \nhelp, not help through a Washington agency, but person-to-person help \nat a local level.\n  All 50 States have established insurance counseling and assistance \nprograms with the help of Federal grant dollars. As a result, these \nprograms provide local volunteer based assistance to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this grant program is a perfect example of a small \nprogram--it is basically seed money--that has produced big results. Let \nme repeat that--a small program that has produced big results.\n  Over 10,000 volunteers have been trained through the program, and \nover $14 million is saved each year for beneficiaries just by good \ncounseling for senior citizens who have a difficult time.\n  I remember that both my mom and dad had Parkinson's disease and, in \nthe latter years of their lives, among their struggles was the struggle \nof just wading through some of the paperwork that they had to do, and \nsome of the forms that they found bewildering.\n  In my own State of Minnesota, 300 volunteers have been trained, and \n3,300 \n[[Page S5339]] beneficiaries were assisted in 1994 alone--just in the \nState of Minnesota--and $867,000 was saved on their behalf.\n  Mr. President, I just simply want to make the case that what we are \ntrying to do here is restore $5.5 million that is part of the proposed \nrescissions. What we are working on now is what the offset will be.\n  This is $5.5 million to be added on to what I think is now being \nspent, which is also about $5.5 million, which wil go a long way. \nAgain, this is not a program centered in Washington, DC. This is a \nprogram that uses a small amount of Federal dollars that goes a long, \nlong way. We train volunteers in each of our States, and I say to my \ncolleagues that I know if you just talk to people in your State, \nespecially senior citizens, you will find that there is a tremendous \nappreciation for the Insurance Information Counseling and Assistance \nGrant Program.\n  So I am just trying to restore $5.5 million. We are now working on an \noffset. As soon as we have that offset--and I think it will be soon--it \nis my hope that my amendment will have unanimous support.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say to my colleagues, the reason that I \nhave been working on this amendment is, at least for me, one of the \nbetter reasons to be in the U.S. Senate--the need for this program \ncomes directly from a lot of senior citizens in the State of Minnesota. \nPeople are really committed to this program. They feel it is not very \nexpensive. I am just trying to get $5.5 million back in here to provide \ncounseling assistance to seniors all across the country, and people \ntell me it is a huge help to them.\n  I think this is a good example of public policy that is not overly \ncentralized, Mr. President, and not overly bureaucratized. It takes \nplace back in our States and local communities, and constitutes the \nbest example of using a small amount of money to get a lot of \nvolunteers to provide a lot of help to senior citizens working their \nway through these forms, and it is a wonderful consumer protection and \nprevention program against some of the scams that all too often, \nunfortunately, happen to seniors.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum. I hope soon we will have some \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside \nthe pending amendment if we have one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 576 to Amendment No. 420\n\n  (Purpose: To restore $614,000 proposed for rescission from the Weir \nFarm Historical Site, CT, and $700,000 proposed for rescission from the \n  Jefferson Expansion Memorial, IL, offset by rescissions of $700,000 \n from land acquisition for the Wayne National Forest, OH, and $690,000 \n from the Highway Trust Fund; and to prohibit the purchase of lands in \n               Washington County and Lawrence County, OH)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 576 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 2, strike ``$11,297,000'' and insert: \n     ``$9,983,000''.\n       On page 21, line 17, strike $3,020,000'' and insert: \n     ``$3,720,000''.\n       On page 21, line 17, after ``rescinded'' insert ``and the \n     Chief of the Forest Service shall not exercise any option of \n     purchase or initiate any new purchases of land, with \n     obligated or unobligated funds, in Washington County, Ohio, \n     and Lawrence County, Ohio, during fiscal year 1995''.\n       On page 44, line 77, insert the following:\n\n                     FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION\n\n                          FEDERAL AID HIGHWAYS\n\n\n                          (Highway Trust Fund)\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the available contract authority balances under this \n     heading in Public Law 100-17, $690,074 are rescinded.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment includes five items, all of \nwhich apply within the general direction of the Interior Committee \nportions of this bill. They are at the request of individual Senators \nand have offsets there for relatively small projects. They have \noffsets. They have been cleared with the majority and minority parties.\n  They include elements in Ohio, Illinois--that is one in which \nMissouri is interested--and Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Has the Senator from Washington sent the amendments to \nthe desk? Are they at the desk?\n  Mr. GORTON. They are.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, those amendments have been cleared on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 576) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from Nevada \nis prepared to offer an amendment. I wonder if we might agree to a 30-\nminute time agreement on the amendment?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I may respond, Senator Bumpers is the \nprimary sponsor of this. I am trying to reach him. He will be here \nmomentarily. I am certainly agreeable in principle to the time limit to \naccommodate the leader and move this along, but I am reluctant to agree \nto a specific time until I speak with him.\n  Let me assure the leader I will try to ferret out the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas and will be in communication with the leader as \nsoon as possible.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I just want to give my colleagues a status \nreport on where I think we are. I believe we are making progress, but I \nam not certain because I see some additional amendments that have been \nadded, additional cost items, add-backs--about $60 million. Then the \noffset has been reduced by about $60 million. It is about $120 million \nthat has sort of disappeared here without our knowledge on this side.\n  We are perfectly willing to discuss these items or look at offsets \nthat might be offered.\n  $46 million for Job Corps; I do not know where that came from. That \ncame out of the blue; never discussed it yesterday. TRIO, whatever TRIO \nis; immigration and education; substance abuse and mental health--all \nthese things. There is already a great deal of money in the bill for \nall of these programs.\n  Then the IRS offset disappeared. That was $50 million. Library is $10 \nmillion; maybe one or two others.\n  So we have sort of gone backwards on the deficit reduction and \nforwards on spending more money. Now, maybe in the overall mix of \nthings, because this is about a $16 billion rescission package, we \nshould not quarrel about $120 million. But I think there may be \nprinciple involved here, too.\n  If we are going to negotiate, then we ought to negotiate and finish \nthis bill, or finish it tomorrow. I am not going to stay here very much \nlonger tonight if we are not making any more progress than we are. So \nwe will come back tomorrow. But I hope before that decision is made we \ncan come to some conclusion on where these amendments came from. Why \nwere there not any offsets? Why did we lose some $60 million on the \noffset side, savings side? Then I think we would be prepared to reach \nsome agreement.\n   [[Page S5340]] I know the Senator from Nevada has an amendment. I \nknow the Senator from Minnesota has an amendment. And I know there is a \nmanagers' amendment. Then I think there was one additional amendment. \nThe Senator from Iowa has an amendment on CPB. I thought those were all \nof the amendments. Then we discovered there are four more amendments \nthat have been added back without a vote or anything else. Then there \nwere some taken out of the savings side without a vote or anything \nelse.\n  I just say to my colleagues on the other side. We want to be \ncooperative, but we cannot do business this way. I am prepared to see \nif we cannot work something out in the next 30 minutes. If not, we will \nrecess for the evening and come back sometime tomorrow.\n  Are we yet in a position to get a time agreement? We are never going \nto finish it unless some people are willing to give us some time \nagreements.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the majority leader yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  Mr. FORD. We are doing our best to try to put things together. I \nunderstand the push. I understand getting out in 30 minutes and coming \nback tomorrow. But then you have a cloture petition filed. That ripens \nSaturday. So we are trying to put it together, and people understand \nthat. The amendments that we have there, the new entrants, are the ones \nthat are the amendments that basically have been agreed to. We have \nbeen trying to put--\n  Mr. DOLE. On your side.\n  Mr. FORD. On our side. We are trying to put it together where we can \nget that agreement. It becomes very difficult. We understand that there \nis no budget out here. We are trying to get rescissions in this year's \nallowances. That cuts off a lot of money for people that already \nstarted work. It does make it a little bit difficult.\n  I wanted to assure the majority leader that we are working. We are \nsweating trying to agree to what he is offering here. I just wanted to \nassure him. There was not anyone else out here to take it up.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am not quarreling with the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I will give you one example. The Senator from Mississippi, Senator \nCochran, has been following the Women, Infants, and Children program, \nWIC, very carefully. He is very sensitive to that program. So we are \nadding back $35 million, which he says we cannot spend, just cannot \nspend it. But you know we added it back. So I assume it will not be \nspent. So it is not really an add-on. I am certain there are other \nprograms which are the same.\n  But all I am suggesting is I think we are very, very close to getting \nthis done, except for these new add-backs that I was not aware of, and \nthen some of the deductions that have gone on that I was not aware of. \nSo, hopefully, we can resolve those matters very quickly. And one way \nto do it quickly is to get Members to give us a time agreement.\n  I wonder if we not in a position to get a time agreement on the \nBryan-Bumpers amendment so we can move on to some other amendments and \nso we are not just wasting our time waiting for the Senator from \nArkansas to give us permission to proceed. Is there another amendment \nthat we can proceed to?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I have just been informed that Senator Bumpers should be \nhere momentarily. Once he gets here, I am can assure the leader that we \nare prepared to proceed and enter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. HUTCHISON). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 \nminutes equally divided on the Bryan-Bumpers amendment. In fact, we are \nprepared to give Senator Bryan 20 minutes as the proponent of the \namendment and we will take 10 on this side.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the majority leader. That is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 461 to Amendment No. 420\n\n    (Purpose: To eliminate funding for the market promotion program)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for Mr. Bumpers, for \n     himself and Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 461 to \n     amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike lines 3-7 on page 4 of the Committee substitute, and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``deleting \n     `$85,500,000' and by inserting `$0.'''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry, if I \nmight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield for the purposes of parliamentary inquiry. Will \nthat be on our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, the Senator can have 5 minutes; 10 in \nopposition, and take 5.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is quite satisfactory. So the agreement is that the \nSenator from California would have 5 minutes, and the Senator from----\n  Mr. DOLE. Wherever.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Wherever can have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Is that satisfactory to the Senator from California?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 7 minutes, Madam President.\n  Madam President, this year Ralston-Purina will spend $13 million to \nadvertise its Chex brand cereal, and Brown-Forman Corp. has budgeted \n$20 million to help sell California Cooler, and last year McDonald's \nspent $7.7 million in advertising in Singapore alone.\n  The question arises, what do all of these companies have in common \nbesides each having multimillion-dollar advertising budgets? The answer \nis that they are all recipients of taxpayer funds which is known as the \nMarket Promotion Program. This program was started in 1986 to promote \nAmerican agricultural produce.\n  Let me just say a word by way of background. The amendment which the \nSenator from Arkansas and I have presently before the floor will zero \nout funding for this program for this year. Last year, the \nappropriators came up with $85 million for this Market Promotion \nProgram, and in the legislation we are acting on this evening, they \nhave increased the appropriation level to $110 million.\n  In my view, this program, which I am going to describe very briefly \nin a moment, is corporate welfare. We have debated in this session of \nthe Congress where we can make cuts in the budget. We have talked about \nWomen, Infants, and Children and school nutrition programs. Everything \nseems to be on the table except the sacred cow of American agriculture, \nthe Market Promotion Program.\n  Very briefly, Madam President, the history of this program dates back \na number of years. Currently, we are spending in the neighborhood of \n$3.5 billion in America on export promotion--$3.5 billion. Of that sum, \n$2.2 billion is set aside specifically for agricultural promotion.\n  Now, to put this in context, 63 percent of all the money that we are \nspending for export promotion in America is devoted to agriculture. \nAgriculture represents about 10 percent of the foreign exports from \nAmerica. So it is my view that is a disproportionate, indefensible \namount. But let us put that aside for the moment. We can debate the \nmerits or demerits of spending $2.2 billion in agricultural promotion. \nI am talking about the Market Promotion Program. This is a program \nwhich, as I have said, is corporate welfare. It is the equivalent of \nfood stamps \n[[Page S5341]] for the largest corporations in America.\n  The way this program works is that advertising budgets of some of the \nlarge corporations in America are supplemented by taxpayer moneys. Now, \nConagra, a good company, makes the kind of products that are household \nnames in America: Country Pride, Chung King, Wesson, Butterball, Swift, \nPeter Pan, Armour, Banquet, Swiss Miss. Since 1986, this company has \nreceived in taxpayer dollars $826,000. This company has, by 1994 \nfinancial data, $462 million in net profits. The advertising budget is \n$200 million. The CEO receives compensation of $1.229 million annually. \nHow in God's world do we justify, Madam President, spending taxpayer \ndollars to supplement this program? This is a company that is large; it \nis successful; and they can effectively handle their own advertising \nand promotion budget.\n  Jack Daniels, a product that is familiar to many of us, $2.41 million \nis what they have received through the Market Promotion Program and its \nimmediate predecessor, TEA [Targeted Export Assistance]. The 1994 \nfinancial data: Net profits of $146 million, an advertising budget of \n$74 million, CEO compensation of $703,000.\n  Again, Madam President, I suggest that it is indefensible to call \nupon the American taxpayer to subsidize a company of this size.\n  McDonald's. Who among us does not enjoy a Big Mac? I know I do. But \nthis is a company that has received, since 1986, $1.6 million, taxpayer \ndollars, all taxpayer money, to supplement a company that makes a net \nprofit, according to the 1994 data, of $1.2 billion, that has an \nadvertising budget of nearly $700 million, and CEO compensation of \n$1.78 million.\n  In addition to this, it is not only American companies that receive \nit. Here is a list--not a complete list--of foreign companies that \nreceive money from the American taxpayer.\n  The point to be made is that at a time when we are making some very \ntough budget cuts--very tough budget cuts--we are talking about the \nmost vulnerable in our society who have been asked to step forward, \nwhether it is the WIC program, or whether it is school nutrition, or \naid to our schools in terms of drug assistance.\n  All of these programs have been hotly debated, but for some reason \nthese agriculture programs are sacrosanct. It is time to eliminate \nthese programs. First of all, they are indefensible in terms of \ntaxpayer dollars being used to subsidize them. And secondly, there is a \nquestion as to its effectiveness.\n  The General Accounting Office has done an evaluation, and they find a \nnumber of problems with this program. Number one, it is not clear \nwhether the taxpayer dollars that are going into the advertising budget \nsimply are being exchanged for advertising money that is already in the \ncorporate budget.\n  Secondly, there is no criteria as to who is eligible--big company, \nsmall company.\n  Third, there is no criteria as to how long you stay in. Do you get in \nand stay forever?\n  Now, there has been at least one reform that has been added that you \nhave to get out in 5 years. But that is 5 years from 1994, and that \nmeans some of these companies have been in this program since its \norigin.\n  There is no objective statistical data, absolutely none, to suggest \nor to prove that in fact these dollars have assisted our export \npromotion program. Madam President, I remind my colleagues that we are \nspending separate and apart for this one agricultural promotion $2.2 \nbillion. Now, you will recall agricultural exports represent 10 percent \nof the exports from America. We are spending 63 percent of a total of \n$3.5 billion that is being spent by the Federal Government on export \npromotion.\n  There are other brand names that are household products. I think the \nAmerican taxpayer is entitled to be absolutely outraged when you look \nat some of these companies, highly successful companies. I have no \nquarrel with the companies. My quarrel with them is the fact that \nAmerican taxpayer dollars are subsidizing the corporate giants in \nAmerica.\n  Let me just give you some more information here. Welch's, marvelous \nfruit juice, and others, they have received since 1986 $5.8 million; \nBlue Diamond, these are the folks who are involved in nuts, $37 \nmillion; Dole fresh fruit, $9 million. If the Pillsbury Doughboy looks \na little chubby to you all, it is because the American taxpayer has \nbeen subsidizing his diet pretty heavily. Pillsbury, it says, received \nduring this period of time $10 million.\n  So my point, Madam President, is that if we are serious about cutting \nthe deficit, if we are serious about making the hard choices, the tough \ncuts, we have to begin with programs like this. Corporate welfare ought \nto be on the line every bit as much as the other programs which have \nbeen targeted in this Congress either for elimination or reduction.\n  Let me say this is not a liberal amendment nor a conservative \namendment that my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nArkansas, and I offer. This is an amendment on which those who are to \nthe political right in America, the Cato Institute, and those who are \nthe moderates in America, the Political Aggressive Policy Institute, \nhave taken a look at this program and both have reached the same \nconclusion: This is a program that ought to be eliminated.\n  To conclude, Madam President, it is time to take these companies off \nthe taxpayer dole. They are capable of fending for themselves. They \nhave marvelous programs, sophisticated staffs. They pay their people \ntop dollar in terms of their promotion programs. The American taxpayers \nought not to be asked to spend their dollars to supplement these \nadvertising accounts. The time for action is now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to oppose the amendment by my friend and colleague from \nNevada. We agree on many things. This is one on which we do not agree. \nTo zero out a program like the Market Promotion Program, which we know \nis working--and, when my colleague says there is no statistical proof \nit is working, I have other reports than he does on that matter. But to \ncut a program that is working to increase our exports, when we are \napproaching the 21st century mark and exports are crucial to our \neconomy--and promoting those exports is certainly crucial to that--I \nthink it would be a very radical move.\n  We have a budget that is coming up for review. We are going to look \nat this program in that budget review. After we do that--and I am on \nthe Budget Committee--as my friend knows, we are going to take a real \nhard look at all of these things in the various authorizing committees \nand, of course, in the Appropriations Committee.\n But to take this move today to eliminate this program, I hope that we \nwill not go along with it.\n\n  The Marketing Promotion Program is an important tool in expanding \nmarkets for U.S. agricultural products from California to many other \ncountries in the world.\n  We talk today about redirecting farm spending away from price \nsupports. I support that. I think we should move away from price \nsupports. But we also should work toward expanding markets. I think it \nmakes a lot of sense to do that.\n  My friend from Nevada says there is no statistical data to show that \nthe Marketing Promotion Program is working. I would like to call to his \nattention a U.S. Department of Agriculture study. They estimate that \neach marketing promotion dollar results in an increase in agricultural \nproduct exports of between $2 and $7.\n  Madam President, that is a very good return on our money. Indeed, any \nbusiness person would say if you put $1 in and it results in $2 of \nincreased sales and even up to $7 in increased sales, that is a very \nsound program.\n  And my colleague talks about large beneficiaries. Well, I think he is \noverlooking the number of small beneficiaries. We have seen much-needed \nassistance to commodity groups comprised of small farmers who are \nunable to break into those markets on their own. And I think that is a \nvery important point.\n  I have been to the fertile valleys of California. I have met with \nthose small farmers. I have seen those family farms. And alone they do \nnot have \n[[Page S5342]] much power. But they come together as cooperatives, and \nthey work together as marketing groups, and with the Market Promotion \nProgram they have been successful in breaking into the export markets.\n  So I think it is fair to say to my friend that the small growers and \nthe small farmers have benefited greatly. And that is one of the \nintentions of the program.\n  I also want to point out to my friend that last year a task force of \nthe U.S. Agricultural Export Development Council met for 2 days in \nLeesburg, Virginia. Their function was to review the role of the \nMarketing Promotion Program and other agricultural programs as part of \nour overall trade policy. The task force concluded that the purpose of \nthe Marketing Promotion Program is to ``increase U.S. agricultural \nproduct exports.'' It also concluded that the increase in such exports \nhelps to ``create and protect U.S. jobs, combat unfair trade practices, \nimprove the U.S. trade balance, and improve farm income.''\n  And I am directly quoting from that meeting.\n  So I would say to my friend, although he has not found any \ndocumentation that this program works and it helps us and, in fact, is \na wise investment, there are certainly other groups that have found \nthat it is a wise investment. And it should be supported.\n  I would like to say to my friend, in closing, that we should look at \nwhat other countries do. Sometimes we do not look at the fact that \nother countries push for their exports, push for their agricultural \nproducts, promote their products, and fight for their products. And \nwhat do we do sometimes? We walk away from a program like this and let \nour people twist in the wind.\n  Madam President, I see my time is up.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I will conclude here. I think that we would be making a big mistake, \nas we move toward this global marketplace, to walk away from the \nMarketing Promotion Program. Our competitors have programs that do far \nmore for their agricultural products than we do. And there is a reason. \nThey understand that exports are key to any country's success as an \neconomic power.\n  We do not have a level playing field out there. That is clear. So I \nhope that my friend would agree with me that there is no level playing \nfield, and other countries are out there pushing hard for their \nproducts, helping their farmers to push exports. This is our only \nprogram that does that.\n  I hope we will defeat his amendment.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 10 minutes 39 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield to the Senator from Arkansas whatever time he \nwishes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time remains for the proponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 31 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I will yield myself such time as I may \nuse, which I hope will be less than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. First of all, I want to thank my colleague and very good \nfriend, Senator Bryan, of Nevada, for his unstinting efforts in this.\n  In 1993, Congress directed GAO to prepare a report on the \neffectiveness of the Market Promotion Program. The report that came \nback was less than satisfactory. Subsequently, for Fiscal Year 1994, we \ncut MPP from $147.7 million to $100 million. In Fiscal Years 1991 and \n1992, the funding level had been at $200 million.\n  Last year, as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture and Rural Development, I made every effort to eliminate \nthis program. However, the distinguished Senator from Washington, Mr. \nGorton, was successful in reinstating the program, both in the \ncommittee and on the floor.\n  Madam President, I do not see how we can go through the agony we have \nbeen going through in here in trying to cut spending, particularly in \nlight of the fact that we are cutting spending for school lunches and \nfor the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and for a host of other \nthings which, in my opinion, have great merit and go right to the heart \nand soul of America. How we can cut spending for them and actually add \nnearly $25 million to the Market Promotion Program? It was at $85.5 \nmillion for Fiscal Year 1995 and it now stands, by virtue of the bill \nnow before the Senate, at $110 million.\n  Senator Bryan and I now propose to eliminate the Market Promotion \nProgram and apply the savings toward deficit reduction. We are not \nsetting it aside for something else. I would love to take this and put \nit in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but we chose to offer \nthis amendment and apply the $110 million for pure deficit reduction.\n  I do not believe any member of this body should be able to keep a \nstraight face and support some of the measures we are voting for when \nwe cannot kill a program, like MPP, that is a pure subsidy for some of \nthe biggest corporations in America and abroad. If we were solely \npromoting an industry, an industry-wide product or an agricultural \nproduct, as we do in the Export Enhancement Program, it might make a \nlittle sense. But we are promoting brand loyalty. With MPP, we are \nusing federal funds to promote a large number of popular retail items \nthat most of us know as household words. MPP funds have been used to \npromote McDonalds' products, Gallo Wines, and several popular items \nproduced in my State which we can all easily identify in grocery stores \nacross the Nation.\n  Look down the list of the people who benefit from this--143 foreign \nfirms. You inquire, what on Earth are we doing spending American \ntaxpayers' money subsidizing foreign companies and promoting their \nbrand loyalty? The answer: They use some American products. So if \nforeign companies that use our products want to advertise their brand \nand create a brand loyalty, we give them money, too.\n  And, in addition to 143 foreign corporations, Madam President, over \n700 American corporations participate in this program just last year \nalone.\n  I am not blaming them. When Uncle Sam throws a big trough full of \nmoney out and says, come and get it, if I were one of these \ncorporations and I had a foreign presence, as most of them do, I would \nget up there and apply for it, too.\n  Now, Madam President, I started off saying that the 1993 GAO report \ngave us reasons to question the validity of this program. More \nrecently, another GAO report was prepared which I received in March of \nthis year, just a couple of weeks ago.\n  No Senator should vote on this amendment until they look at the March \n1995 GAO report.\n  Here is what they say, and this is the meat of the whole argument:\n\n       The Foreign Agricultural Service has no assurance that \n     marketing promotion funds are supporting additional \n     promotional activities rather than simply replacing company \n     industry funds.\n\n  The GAO did not just reach that decision without substantial program \nreview. They studied it, and they said there is no evidence that this \nmoney is going for additional promotional activities that the companies \nthemselves would not spend if we torpedoed this program. You cannot \nfind a more compelling reason to vote for anything around here than a \nGAO report offers findings such as this.\n  If we were going to champion a program such as this--and I am not \nprepared to do that yet--it ought to be for small business, or \ncompanies new to market U.S. agricultural products abroad. Not big \nbusinesses that have been in the export business for years.\n  So, Madam President, I hate to use the term corporate welfare because \nbig corporations make a contribution to this country, although members \nof the national press have not hesitated to attach that label to some \nresults of the Market Promotion Program. I am not blaming them for \nstanding at the trough and getting this money. There are 716 domestic \nand 143 foreign firms that received MPP funds in Fiscal Year 1994, and \nsome of these are among the largest commercial enterprises in the \nWorld. Look down the list. It is shocking.\n   [[Page S5343]] Here is an opportunity to save $110 million, of which \nit can be argued that the farmers of this nation are only the indirect \nbeneficiaries, if even that; $110 million in genuine deficit reduction, \nmuch of which will otherwise go to some of the most affluent companies \nwe know.\n  I listened to some Senators on the other side of the aisle 2 evenings \nago talking about pork, talking about the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting being an outrageous waste of the taxpayers' money. Here is \nan opportunity for everybody to quit talking and making partisan \npoints. We need to make better use of our limited federal resources. We \nshould join hands and eliminate this funding and allow these large \ncompanies to float free and easy on their own and spend their own \nmoney.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time \nthat the distinguished Senator from Nevada has.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. What is the situation with the time? How much time \nremains on each side, allocated to individual Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators in opposition have 5 minutes; the \nproponents have 3 minutes 28 seconds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. How much time on our side is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 28 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, let me, in the interest of moving this \ndebate forward, just express my appreciation to the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas for his efforts and make just a couple of brief \npoints, if I may.\n  He made the observation, which is absolutely correct, that there are \n140 foreign companies. Here is a partial list of them right here. Some \nof the names you may know and some, frankly, I have never heard of, but \n140.\n  To make the point that the distinguished Senator from Arkansas was \nmaking, from 1986 to 1993, 20 percent--20 percent--of the budget for \nthis program for branded advertising--that is the McDonald's and the \nrest of it--goes to foreign companies. Twenty percent, American \ntaxpayer dollars. I do not know how you justify and how you support \nthat.\n  The other point that I would like to make is the GAO report that the \ndistinguished Senator makes reference to has a very interesting piece \nof testimony, and that is, one of the recipients of the program was \nasked by the auditors, ``How did you all become involved in the \nprogram?''\n  ``Well,'' she said, ``we got a phone call. They said, `Would you like \nto get some money?'''\n  As the Senator from Arkansas said, I do not fault the company.\n  She said, ``Tell me how.''\n  ``Look, we are passing out money on this program called the Market \nPromotion Program,'' and, indeed, the company did. The company, \nNewman's Own, Paul Newman's food company. They just got a call which \nsaid, ``Look, would you like help for your advertising bills? We will \nreimburse you.''\n  This was the testimony of A.E. Hotchner, from Newman's Own.\n  ``We would be delighted to take it.'' As the Senator from Arkansas \nmade the point, number one, it has not been established that it has \naccomplished its desired purpose. It is not effective. Is that not a \nprime reason to zero it out? And secondly, philosophically, I must say, \nMadam President, it sticks in my craw. Companies like this, and good \ncompanies--I am not maligning these companies--would get into the \npublic trough and get this kind of taxpayer dollar when everybody in \nthis Congress has talked a pretty good talk about reducing the deficit.\n  This ought to be a no brainer. This is not a difficult decision. This \nis one in which we should say these companies ought to have the ability \nto fly on their own.\n  I yield the floor and reserve any time I may have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 31 seconds left.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, first of all, let me say putting the \nsign of McDonald's on the floor of the Senate and suggesting this \nprogram is designed to subsidize McDonald's, or any other particular \nfirm, is an outrageous distortion of this program.\n  Let me read to you a memo written by the Poultry and Export Council \nabout the McDonald's issue. It says in part:\n\n       Yes, our Council has used MPP to help McDonalds sell more \n     American chicken--but not to promote McDonalds. The facts are \n     that McDonalds franchises in other countries are foreign \n     owned and operated. They are under no obligation to buy U.S. \n     poultry or eggs and can readily find lower priced (and lower \n     quality) product in Thailand, Malaysia or elsewhere.\n       But by allowing McDonalds to apply for and receive matching \n     funds under MPP, requires their franchisees to be entirely \n     supplied with U.S. products. The point is, we are NOT \n     promoting McDonalds, we are getting McDonalds to advertise \n     U.S. chicken and eggs. And it has been quite effective. In \n     fact, the state of Arkansas has likely benefited more from \n     this activity than any other state.\n\n  The point is this: The market promotion funds are made available \nalmost 97 percent to non-profit and related U.S. trade associations, \nincluding state departments of agriculture. The National Cattlemen's \nAssociation says these funds have helped them break into the market in \nJapan, in Korea, and build market share.\n  We have seen the funds used in other countries for the same purpose, \nto try to overcome barriers to U.S. trade. The program has helped \nfarmers, it has created jobs in America, and it has benefited every \ncommunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to print a copy of a letter \nfrom the Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports in the Record, \nwhich shows a listing of all of the agriculture and farm commodity \ngroups in America that benefit from this program because they can sell \nwhat they produce more effectively with this program's promotion money \nin overseas markets when they have to combat the unfair and competitive \nsubsidies from other countries.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                              Coalition to Promote\n\n\n                                    U.S. Agricultural Exports,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: We are writing to urge your continued \n     strong support for maintaining and strengthening funding for \n     USDA's export programs, including the Market Promotion \n     Program, when the Senate takes up the FY 1995 supplemental \n     appropriation and rescissions package.\n       As approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \n     package includes $24.5 million to restore funding for USDA's \n     Market Promotion Program to its authorized level of $110 \n     million. Such an increase, we believe, sends a strong and \n     positive message that U.S. Policies and programs will remain \n     equally competitive with those of other countries as allowed \n     under the Uruguay Round GATT Agreement.\n       For this reason, we are very concerned over possible \n     amendments to reduce or even eliminate funding for the entire \n     program when the package comes to the Senate floor. Such \n     action would be devastating to U.S. interests--especially in \n     the face of continued subsidized foreign competition.\n       The GATT agreement, it should be emphasized, did not \n     eliminate export subsidies, it only reduced them. The \n     European Union (EU), which outspent the U.S. by 6 to 1 over \n     the last 5 years, will be able to more than maintain its \n     historical advantage. As export subsidies are reduced, they \n     and other competitors can be expected to redirect much of \n     those resources into other GATT allowable programs, including \n     market development and promotion, to maintain and expand \n     their share of the world market.\n       In fact, the EU and other competitors, including Australia, \n     Canada and New Zealand, are moving aggressively with their \n     farmers and ranchers, and other exporters, in support of \n     market development and promotion efforts. According to USDA, \n     total expenditures for such activities are estimated at \n     nearly $500 million--well above similar expenditures by the \n     U.S. and are expected to increase.\n       American agriculture is the most competitive in the world. \n     But, it is not enough to be economically competitive. U.S. \n     policies and programs also must be competitive. Many of us \n     supported the Uruguay Round agreement because of assurances \n     that U.S. policies and programs would continue to be \n     maintained and aggressively implemented to the full extent as \n     allowed under GATT and U.S. law. Without this commitment, \n     America's farmers and ranchers will be at a substantial \n     disadvantage in the new global trade environment.\n       [[Page S5344]] U.S. agriculture exports, which are \n     projected to reach as high as $48.5 billion this year, \n     account for as much as one-third of total production. In \n     addition to helping strengthen farm income, exports are vital \n     to our nation's economic well-being as highlighted below:\n       Jobs--Nearly one million Americans have jobs which are \n     dependent on agriculture exports. A 10 percent increase in \n     exports would help create as many as 100,000 jobs.\n       Economic Growth--U.S. agriculture exports help generate \n     approximately $100 billion in economic activity and account \n     for $8 billion or more in federal tax revenues.\n       Balance of Payments--U.S. agriculture exports result in a \n     positive trade balance of nearly $20 billion. Without \n     agriculture, the U.S. trade deficit would be even higher.\n       Again, such economic benefits can only be maintained to the \n     extent that U.S. policies and programs remain competitive \n     with those of our foreign competitors. America's farmers and \n     ranchers, and others engaged in international trade, can not \n     and should not be required to compete alone against the \n     treasuries of foreign governments.\n       USDA's Market Promotion Program has been and continues to \n     be an important element in our nation's trade strategy and in \n     helping U.S. agriculture build, maintain and expand export \n     markets in the face of continued subsidized foreign \n     competition. As a cost-share program, it has been extremely \n     cost effective with farmers and ranchers, along with other \n     participants, required to contribute as much as 50 percent of \n     their own resources in order to be eligible. It has also been \n     highly successful by any measure.\n       For these reasons, we urge your continued strong support \n     and that you oppose any amendment which would reduce or \n     eliminate funding for this important program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ag Processing, Inc.\n     Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.\n     American Farm Bureau Federation.\n     American Forest & Paper Assn.\n     Amerian Hardwood Export Council.\n     American Meat Institute.\n     American Plywood Association.\n     American Seed Trade Association.\n     American Sheep Industry Assn.\n     American Soybean Association.\n     Blue Diamond Growers.\n     California Avocado Commission.\n     California Canning Peach Assn.\n     California Kiwifruit Commission.\n     California Pistachio Commission.\n     California Prune Board.\n     California Table Grape Commission.\n     California Tomato Board.\n     California Walnut Commission.\n     Cherry Marketing Inst., Inc.\n     Chocolate Manufacturers Association.\n     Diamond Walnut Growers.\n     Dole Fresh Fruit Company.\n     Eastern Agricultural and Food Export Council Corp.\n     Farmland Industries.\n     Florida Citrus Mutual.\n     Florida Citrus Packers.\n     Florida Department of Citrus.\n     Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n     Hop Growers of America.\n     International American Supermarkets Corp.\n     International Apple Institute.\n     International Dairy Foods Association.\n     Kentucky Distillers Association.\n     Mid-America International Agri-Trade Council.\n     National Dry Bean Council.\n     National Grape Cooperative Association, Inc.\n     National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n     National Cattlemen's Assn.\n     National Confectioners Assn.\n     National Corn Growers Assn.\n     National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n     National Cotton Council.\n     National Milk Producers Federation.\n     National Peanut Council of America.\n     National Pork Producers Council.\n     National Potato Council.\n     National Renderers Association.\n     National Sunflower Association.\n     National Wine Coalition.\n     NORPAC Foods, Inc.\n     North American Export Grain Association.\n     Northwest Horticultural Council.\n     Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.\n     Produce Marketing Association.\n     Protein Grain Products International.\n     Sioux Honey Association.\n     Southern Forest Products Assn.\n     Southern U.S. Trade Association.\n     Sun-Diamond Growers of California.\n     Sunkist Growers, Inc.\n     Sun Maid Raisin Growers of California.\n     Sunsweet Prune Growers.\n     The Catfish Institute.\n     The Popcorn Institute.\n     Tree Fruit Reserve.\n     Tree Top, Inc.\n     Tri Valley Growers.\n     United Egg Association.\n     United Egg Producers.\n     United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n     USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council.\n     USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.\n     USA Rice Federation.\n     U.S. Feed Grains Council.\n     U.S. Livestock Genetics Export, Inc.\n     U.S. Meat Export Federation.\n     U.S. Wheat Associates.\n     Vodka Producers of America.\n     Washington Apple Commission.\n     Western Pistachio Association.\n     Western U.S. Agricultural Trade Association.\n     Wine Institute.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, let me give one example. The European \nCommunity this year is going to spend $89 million just promoting wine \nexports and subsidizing wine exports, a lot of that into the U.S. This \nentire program is $85.5 million, and the sponsors of this amendment are \ntrying to knock out every dollar of it. We are not going to have any \nfunds left to help combat the unfair and heavily subsidized trading \npractices of foreign countries if you take away this tool.\n  I am hoping that we can increase the funding. It used to be $200 \nmillion a year, and because of cuts in this and other programs, we had \nto downsize the program. It is now only $85.5 million, and they are \ntrying to take away that.\n  The President and the administration requested additional funds to \nhelp companies, to help farm groups and State departments of \nagriculture deal with these competitors, to increase their market \nshare. The administration asked for an increase from $85.5 million to \n$110 million, and this committee recommended it, the Appropriations \nCommittee agreed to it, and we ought to approve it.\n  I am hoping the Senate will reject this amendment. I yield whatever \ntime remains to the Senator from the State of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 1 minute 7 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a \nprogram that I have not often praised in the past. The Market Promotion \nProgram (MPP) is designed to help U.S. agricultural producers develop \nexport markets overseas.\n  Most people do not associate Vermont with agricultural exports, but \nin fact the state exported almost 122 million agricultural products in \n1994. The food products industry is the fastest growing sector of the \nstate's economy. And profitable value added products make up a good \npart of that total.\n  In my state, the Market Promotion Program has fulfilled its potential \nto help small companies develop a niche in foreign markets. Thanks to \nthe program Mexicans have discovered the joys of Vermont maple syrup, \nCanada is importing Vermont cheesecakes, Bermudans are drinking our \ncider and finding that they like it, and our friends in the United \nKingdom are eating MacIntosh apples they never even knew Vermont \nproduced.\n   [[Page S5345]] Through MPP, the Vermont Department of Agriculture is \nintroducing Vermont companies to new opportunities in Europe, Canada, \nAsia and Latin America. During the next year, Vermont companies will be \nparticipating in trade missions and export seminars in Hong Kong, \nGuangzhou, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. These opportunities would not be \navailable to Vermont agriculture without the MPP.\n  Unfortunately MPP dollars are not always as well spent. As Chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, I held oversight hearings on MPP \nthat uncovered a number of problems with USDA's management of the \nprogram. And, in 1993 I worked for real reform of the program to \ncorrect the abuses that were reducing MPP to a massive corporate \nwelfare program.\n  The Market Promotion Program has come a long way from where it was 3 \nyears ago. The Clinton Administration has reformed the program to curb \nabuses and focus the program where it should always have been \ntargeted--toward small businesses. MPP is far from perfect. We must \ncontinue to look for ways to put scarce dollars where they are needed \nthe most. But eliminating the program is not the way to do it.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I find it simply incredible that almost \nthe only suggestion for the reduction in funds that we get from Members \nwho, by and large, have been voting to increase funds for all sorts of \nincome transfer purposes is to take away funds that help the United \nStates sell its agricultural products abroad.\n  This program does more to benefit hard-working American farmers and \nfood processors than almost any other program we have.\n  It helps to deal with a terrible deficit in our trade balance, the \nlargest this country has ever had. It is a more positive impact on what \nwe do to produce money for our farmers, for the people who work for \nthem, for those who process food, than practically any other program.\n  By all means, we should not turn down the opportunity to help our \neconomy become more and more competitive. We should reject this \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, is there time left in opposition to the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from Nevada \nhas 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Let me just say in response to my friends on the other side of this \nproposition, I am not arguing with the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas that no agricultural promotion is defensible or justified.\n  We are spending $2.2 billion--$2.2 billion--on agriculture promotion \nfor exports aside from this program. What I am saying is this \nparticular program that subsidizes the wealthiest corporations in \nAmerica cannot be defended, particularly when we are spending $12.2 \nbillion, 63 percent of all the money spent for promotion around----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I move to table the amendment offered \nby Senators Bryan and Bumpers and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I further ask that the following amendments be the only \nremaining amendments in order and limited to the following time \nrestraints where noted, all in the usual form. And I have been advised \nby Senator Levin he will not offer the one amendment--he does have an \namendment that has been worked out; an amendment by Senator Wellstone \nrelating to seniors; a managers' amendment, a Hatfield/Byrd amendment; \nand a Harkin handback for CPB, and on that there be an up-or-down vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n   [[Page S5346]] Mr. DOLE. Excuse me. I did not give times on those \namendments: On Harkin, there will be 20 minutes equally divided; on the \nWellstone amendment, 20 minutes equally divided; and the Hatfield/Byrd \nmanagers' amendment, 15 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have an \namendment for which I do not need more than 10 minutes which I intend \nto offer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \ndistinguished majority leader, on my amendment, I had initially asked \nfor 20 minutes on our side. I do not know how much time the other side \nwill take. I need 20 minutes because I have at least two other people \nwho want to speak on it. If I can just have 20 minutes, that is fine.\n  Mr. DOLE. Twenty minutes and we will take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Whatever. The amendment is not only CPB. It is also an \nadd-back for the senior community appointment program.\n  Mr. DOLE. What is the total of the amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The total of the amendment is $40 million.\n  Mr. DOLE. And it is offset?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is offset by the cut in Radio Free Europe. Some of the \nmoney goes to get CPB back up to the inflation increase, and then some \nof it goes for the senior community appointment program. The Senator \ndid not mention it, and I wanted to make sure that it was in there.\n  Mr. DOLE. So that will be 20 and 10, 20 minutes for Senator Harkin \nand 10 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine. My concern, when the unanimous consent was \nread, was that when I sent my amendment to the desk and it was also for \nsomebody in the senior community appointment program, it would not be \npulled out of order on this type of agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, I am not sure where I \nstand, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that, \nfollowing the disposition of the above listed amendments, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the Hatfield substitute, to be followed by third \nreading and final passage of H.R. 1158, as amended, all without any \nintervention action or debate.\n  But before the Chair rules on that, I think it is best to have a \ncolloquy at this time with the distinguished Senator from New York with \nreference to the amendment on Mexico, which would be critical to \nwinding up this package this evening, as I understand from the \nDemocratic leader and others.\n  So I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.\n  I recognize the situation and the dilemma that the Senate finds \nitself in in confronting the necessity of moving forward with this \nbill. I recognize that we are moving up against a time deadline.\n  Mr. President, I am going to say now that I am not going to pursue \nthis amendment for two reasons. Number one, I do not want to be accused \nof scuttling a very difficult agreement that has been worked out, where \nother of my colleagues have stepped back, and insist that I be the only \none that goes forward.\n  Having said that, I want to indicate very clearly that this Senator \nis deeply troubled by the manner in which we are discharging our \nconstitutional responsibility as it relates to Mexico and the attempt \nof this administration to help them.\n  And I want to help. But this Senator wants to see to it that the \ndollars that we are committing are used appropriately. I think at the \nvery least we are entitled to the kind of accountability that we would \nbe if it were a foreign aid program and even more since it is a clear \ncircumvention of the manner in which foreign loans should be made.\n  To that extent, I suggest that the second-degree amendment which was \noffered by Senator Murkowski is absolutely, totally appropriate; that \nthe legislative initiatives undertaken by Congressman Cox should be, \nwithout question, something that is carried out in terms of making \ninformation available to us as it relates to what preceded the crisis \nin Mexico before it became public and the collapse of the Mexican \neconomy. What was our role and what has been our role since then? And \nwhat do we anticipate as we move along?\n  Again, I will press this matter. I do not claim that the legislative \ninitiative that I have undertaken should be adopted in its present \nform, but I do believe that when we are talking about sending billions \nof dollars, taxpayers' dollars, to a program that may or may not work--\nand the administration has testified before the Banking Committee that \nit may not work--that we have an absolute obligation to know what is \ntaking place and how it is administered, at the very least.\n  I do not think that those who say this is without doubt within the \nadministration's prerogative would deny us that. I believe that is \ngiving tremendous latitude.\n  When we come back from our recess, undoubtedly billions of dollars \nmore of American moneys will have been placed into this program. The \nquestion as to whether or not we will ever have repayment is a very \nlegitimate question. But how far do we go, in a very important but a \nvery risky undertaking; how far do we go before we say, ``Wait, this \nmay not be working''? Do we leave this just in the prerogative of the \nSecretary of the Treasury to determine if it is working, or should we \nnot at the very least have that information?\n  Mr. President, I tell the majority leader that I will move forward by \nway of legislation, if necessary, to at least obtain that information, \nobtain the facts. And, in addition thereto, if we find, and if I am not \nconvinced, that the program is working or that there is a chance of us \nrecovering moneys, I will then move by legislative action again to \naccomplish the things that I have said before on this floor and to cut \noff further dollars.\n  By the time we come back, there is no doubt in my mind that we will \nhave committed directly from the United States probably in the area of \n$10 billion or more. That is a lot of money. We are working on a \nrescission package to try to save money. We certainly, at the very \nleast, are entitled to know that those dollars are being used wisely, \nappropriately, and that there is some chance of success, a bona fide \nchance of success. That is what troubles this Senator.\n  So with that statement, I will say that I do want to accommodate my \ncolleagues, but I also want them to know that there may be more \nlegislation moving through this Senate, and I reserve the right, as all \nof us have that right, to move forward with this initiative. It will be \nat a time when there is legislation that may be critical, that the \nadministration needs or that people are interested in. I will not move \non a piece of legislation that is not critical and therefore be denied \nbringing this matter to a vote.\n  At some point in time, it is my belief that this Congress and this \nSenate should be required to vote as to whether or not we should \ncontinue this program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the pending \namendment, amendment No. 427.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 427) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have the agreement.\n  I think I did ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of \nthe above-listed amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on the Hatfield \nsubstitute, to be followed by third reading and final passage of H.R. \n1158, as amended, without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n   [[Page S5347]] Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator \nfrom New York, I think he has raised a very important issue, and it is \nnot going to go away. Sooner or later, Congress is going to have to \nbecome involved, because we are spending taxpayers' money. I think it \nis safe to say that Speaker Gingrich and I indicated early on that we \nwanted to support the administration, the President. That is what we \nsaid at that time, and that is what I would say at this time, but with \none caveat: We should know precisely what is happening. And I think \nthat is the thrust of the Senator's amendment. It is an important \namendment.\n  We have a responsibility. We are talking about $5 million here in one \namendment we cannot agree on--$5 million. And you are talking about $5 \nbillion. So I just suggest it is important, and I hope that we do not \nlose sight of that.\n  I thank the Senator for withdrawing the amendment. That will permit \nus to complete action on this bill, hopefully, tonight or tomorrow at \nsome hour. I would like to do it tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all the votes that we order be stacked, \nin effect, so we could have all the votes and then final passage, and \nthen see if we cannot get some agreement to do the rest of our business \nby voice vote, if there is no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I also ask unanimous consent that, if there is more than \none vote, any succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would also ask my colleagues, even though \nthey have 20 minutes or 15 minutes, different time allotments, that I \nthink we could save some time.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his \ncooperation throughout the day and throughout yesterday, and throughout \npart of the night last night.\n  I believe we are within striking distance of concluding a bill that \nnow totals about $16 billion in rescissions--$16 billion. This bill \nwill go to conference and some of the issues that some people have \nconcerns about will be raised again in the conference. Regardless of \nwhat your concern may be, if you think it is too much or too little, it \ncan be raised in the conference.\n  So I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation. I think we \nhave made progress. I can tell you that the end is in sight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me also thank all of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle for their cooperation in the effort that has \nbeen made to bring us to this point. It has been a long day. There have \nbeen a lot of people who have been responsible for bringing us to this \npoint, and I want to publicly commend them and thank them for that \neffort.\n  We still have some very big decisions to make on amendments that are \ngoing to be offered. I appreciate everyone's willingness to accommodate \na debate on each one of these issues, but I do think that we are \ngetting close, and I think that it is an agreement we can all support. \nObviously, people are going to come down on either side of the issue \nwhen we come to final passage, but I think this accommodates Senators \nin a way that allows us to get to that point.\n  So I think it is a good agreement, and I hope that we can work \nthrough the amendments and get to final passage sometime tonight. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 578 to Amendment No. 420\n\n   (Purpose: To restore funds to the National Sea Grant's program on \n research to control and prevent the spread of aquatic non-indigenous \n                                species)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and send an amendment to the desk which has been \ncleared by both sides, reference to which was made by the majority \nleader in the UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n     Simon, and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment numbered \n     578 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 9, line 16, strike ``$13,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$15,000,000''.\n       On page 9, line 12, strike ``$37,600,000'' and insert \n     ``$35,600,000''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sending this to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Abraham, Senator Specter, Senator Glenn, Senator Kohl, \nSenator Santorum, Senator Simon, and Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  This amendment will restore $2 million to the research program on the \nzebra mussel, which is a pest which has infested the Great Lakes and is \nnow spreading through the tributaries from and to the Great Lakes.\n  It is a very important program for the fresh water supply of this \ncountry. The reduction of $2 million will hurt the research program. \nMany, many States benefit by it, and the offset for the $2 million \nrestoration comes from the NOAA construction money.\n  I understand that this has been accepted on both sides.\n  The $2 million rescission in the National Sea Grant Research Program \nwill limit Federal, State, and university research to help stop the \nspread of the zerbra mussel, and other non-indigenous species.\n  Fifteen States' programs would likely continue efforts to educate \nnatural resource managers as to the devastating impacts of zebra \nmussels if this $2 million is restored. They will study these pests' \nlife cycles to determine when and where they are most vulnerable to \npesticides or nonchemical control. The States that received funds in \nfiscal year 1994 besides the Great Lakes States include California, \nLouisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, Texas, \nConnecticut, and Florida.\n  This is not just a zebra mussels amendment. Sea Grant's Program is \ncrucial. We need to keep cataloging the ways nuisance species \nreproduce. There are over 130 nonindigenous species in this country, \ntwo-thirds of which entered the country since 1959, when the St. \nLawrence Seaway was opened.\n  Some of my colleagues may be familiar with some of the most \neconomically damaging exotic species that industries, municipal \nsewerage and drinking water facilities, boaters, farmers, et cetera \nhave been forced to confront besides the zebra mussel, such as the \nwater milfoil, the water flea, purple loosestrife, the round Gobi, and \nthe ruffe.\n  But, the zebra mussel invasion provides the most compelling reason to \nsupport research that will enable us to develop control methods and \nprevent infestation. The mussel has now spread to 20 States and \ncontinues to spread. Between July and September 1994, mussel densities \non the southern Mississippi River increased from 10/sq meter to 40,000/\nsq meter.\n  A relatively new pest, the ruffe, is spreading throughout the far \nreaches of Lake Superior threatening commercial and recreational \nfisheries, and is heading toward Lake Erie's $800 plus million perch \nand walleye fishery.\n  The sea grant performs high-quality, peer-reviewed science. It does \nnot duplicate other nonindigenous programs conducted by other agencies.\n  My bipartisan amendment would take an additional $2 million out of \nNOAA's construction account and restore it to NOAA's National Sea Grant \nProgram for research on nonindigenous species.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues from the \nGreat Lakes region, on their efforts to restore needed funding for Sea \nGrant's critical research on aquatic nuisance species.\n  As the cochair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, I have worked \nhard to protect and restore the economic and environmental health of \nthe Great Lakes. This aquatic ecosystem is home to nearly 30 million \nAmericans who depend on these waters as avenues of commerce, as sources \nof drinking \n[[Page S5348]] water, and as recreational playgrounds attracting \nmillions of visitors. Under the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \nPrevention and Control Act (P.L. 101-646) I sponsored in 1990, Sea \nGrant is authorized to conduct critical exotic species research which \nallows the Great Lakes to provide such a wide range of benefits.\n  Exotic species cause severe economic and ecological damage along our \nNation's marine coasts and freshwater systems. In a surprisingly short \ntime, the zebra mussel has spread to 20 States taking a heavy toll on \nbiodiversity of hosting systems and forcing private and municipal \nwaterworks and powerplants to withstand increased and costly \nmaintenance efforts. However, Sea Grant aquatic nuisance species \nresearch is not exclusively dedicated to the zebra mussel. The \nrestoration of $2.0 million for Sea Grant's nonindigeous species \nfunding continues research on the serious Eurasian ruffe problem in \nLake Superior which threatens the region's $4 billion fishing industry.\n  The increasing number of harmful nonindigenous species and their \ncumulative impacts continue to create growing economic and \nenvironmental burdens for the United States. Sea Grants research and \noutreach efforts complement other Federal programs and enable us to \nadopt a national approach toward stewardship of our natural resources. \nReducing funding for the critical aquatic nuisance species research \nconducted by Sea Grant will curtail ongoing research which benefits the \nGreat Lakes and the entire Nation.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan is correct. This \namendment has been accepted on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 578) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 579 to Amendment No. 420\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Leahy, \n     Mr. Reid, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 579 \n     to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Insert after page 7, line 18:\n\n                 International Broadcasting Operations\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading to the board \n     for international broadcasting in Public Law 103-317, \n     $40,500,000 are rescinded.\n       On page 27, delete lines 4 through 12.\n       On page 36, line 10, strike ``$26,360,000'' and insert \n     ``$17,791,000''.\n       On page 36, line 12, strike ``$29,360,000'' and insert \n     ``$11,965,000''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 20 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, offered on behalf of myself, Senator \nHollings, Senator Leahy, Senator Reid, and Senator Kennedy, would \nrescind $40.5 million from the funding for the organization known as \nRadio Free Europe. Of that money, we would take $26 million and put it \ninto the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in America, and the other \n$14 million would go for the Senior Community Service Employment \nProgram.\n  Again, Mr. President, I point out that adding this money, this $26 \nmillion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, still leaves the \nCPB at $29 million less than what was appropriated last year. This does \nnot even bring it up to the fully appropriated level. It would allow \nfor only an inflationary increase for CPB.\n  But I want to point out very emphatically that this amendment does \nnot even bring the Corporation for Public Broadcasting up to what was \nfunded last year.\n  It does take $40 million out of Radio Free Europe, and I think it \nreflects an important historical reality; namely, the cold war is over, \nand it is time we take some of these old relics of the cold war and we \nstart defunding them.\n  Mr. President, right now we have a lot of people who are opposing \nFederal funding for public radio and television in the United States. \nThe same opponents who rail against U.S. contributions to public radio \nfor Americans are willing to write, without question, a check of almost \nequal amount to fund public radio for Europeans to fight a war against \nan enemy that no longer exists. In short, sending U.S. taxpayer dollars \nabroad to fund public radio in Europe is OK, but using U.S. tax dollars \nto finance public radio and TV for Americans at home is not.\n  Our amendment attempts to correct that injustice by restoring \nfederally financed public radio for Americans and cutting a little from \nU.S. financed public radio for Europeans.\n  I will also point out that this amendment, plus the $14 million that \nis in the agreement, provides for a $54 million total cut in Radio Free \nEurope. The Dole substitute, offered by the majority leader, had a $98 \nmillion cut in Radio Free Europe. So I am not even advocating cutting \nas much from Radio Free Europe as the Senator from Kansas did in his \nfirst proposal. He proposed to cut $98 million out of it. We are only \nproposing to cut $54 million.\n  Even with this cut in Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Europe's funding \nlevel will be $175 million. That is $100 million more than the $75 \nmillion the administration requested for this program in fiscal year \n1996.\n  I point out further that President Clinton, in February of 1993, \nproposed eliminating Radio Free Europe. He said the cold war is over; \nthere is no use to keep funding RFE.\n  Opponents of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are working to \nphase out public broadcasting at home and are willing to sustain that \nsame service in Europe. Make no mistake about it, this is public \nbroadcasting in Eastern Europe; it is paid for by U.S. taxpayers. But \nthere are existing alternatives available to Eastern Europeans and \nRussians--CNN, FM radio, AM radio, in addition to the Voice of America.\n  Mr. President, let me recite briefly the history of Radio Free \nEurope. It started 40 years ago as a covert operation of the CIA \nbroadcasting shortwave signals behind the Iron Curtain. All three of \nthese--Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and Voice of America--played a \ntremendous role in bringing news and information to people in Communist \ncountries. They all played a critical role in fighting and winning the \ncold war.\n  I would never have suggested this kind of amendment if the cold war \nwere still on, but the cold war is over. And yet our overburdened \nAmerican taxpayers are still paying more than $200 million for Radio \nFree Europe--I have dubbed it ``Radio Expensive Europe''; it is not \nRadio Free Europe, it is ``Radio Expensive Europe''--plus another $100 \nmillion for the Voice of America and another $2 million for the \nadministrative costs for the Board of International Broadcasting.\n  Mr. President, you will hear arguments against my amendment. They \nwill claim that RFE provides independent broadcasting, and therefore \nperforms a different role from the Voice of America. Who is kidding \nwhom? Radio Free Europe, created by the Central Intelligence Agency--\nthe board that runs it is appointed by the President of the United \nStates.\n  Second, Radio Free Europe continues to be funded to this day solely \nby U.S. taxpayers. Why? Why not the Germans? Their mark, as we know \nlately, is a lot better than the U.S. dollar. Why do the Germans not \ncome in and \n[[Page S5349]] pay a little bit? Why do they not pick up the tab? Or \nhow about the French or the Norwegians or the Swedes or the Poles or \nthe Italians? Why do they not come in and contribute?\n  No, it is our U.S. taxpayers footing the whole bill for Radio Free \nEurope. Quite frankly, Mr. President, I want to make my feelings known. \nI think Radio Free Europe ought to be zeroed out. But I am not \nproposing to do that in this amendment. I am still leaving $175 million \nfor RFE for Fiscal 1995. I think we ought to come back and zero it out, \nmaybe next year, but we ought to use some of this money to at least \nprovide an inflationary increase for public broadcasting here at home, \nand restore funding for the senior citizen community employment \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, let me just talk a little bit more about the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program. As I said, the amendment I have \noffered takes $26 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nIt still leaves it $29 million less than what we appropriated last \nyear. And it takes $14 million and puts it into senior community \nservice employment, the only work force program designed to help \nseniors, elderly, get jobs in community service.\n  I suspect all Members have gone to a senior citizens center providing \nmeal programs, and we know how much good this program does.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Washington Post of January 27, 1995, titled ``A Federal Program \nThat Does It Right,'' and I also ask unanimous consent to insert a \nletter from the National Council of Senior Citizens in support of this \nprogram.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 27, 1995]\n\n                  A Federal Program That Does It Right\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Let's say you run a small company and you need a filing \n     clerk. A 67-year-old Latino woman applies for the job and so \n     does a newly minted high school graduate. Which one would you \n     hire?\n       Precisely. And that's one of the reasons behind the Senior \n     Company Service Program, an organization that trains low-\n     income people 55 and older and helps them find jobs. \n     Participants usually receive minimum wage for 20 hours of \n     training, and then they go to work, often in community \n     service jobs that help the elderly. Those subsidized jobs \n     often serve as bridges into permanent positions.\n       By last June, the program had placed 27.3 percent of its \n     people in unsubsidized jobs such as bookkeeping in banks, \n     driving delivery vehicles, tutoring in schools and working as \n     health aides. That is a higher rate than the 25 percent job \n     placement rate in California's program for its welfare \n     parents.\n       The Senior Community Service Program is the backbone for \n     most meals-on-wheels programs and for many day-care centers \n     in rural areas. an essential feature of the program is that \n     it matches seniors with the service needs of each community. \n     The program also works closely with businesses to ensure that \n     enrollees are getting indispensable job skills.\n       The program is administered by the Department of Labor, \n     which contracts with national nonprofit organizations, such \n     as the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) and the \n     American Association of Retired Persons, to run them. About \n     70 percent of the enrollees are women, 56 percent are 65 or \n     older, a third have less than a high school education and \n     about 40 percent are members of a minority group--one of the \n     highest rates of minority participation for any domestic \n     program.\n       Chris Oladipo, who runs the NCSC program in Prince George's \n     County, says it is particularly helpful as a bridge for older \n     immigrants who have trouble earning a living because of \n     language barriers.\n       While most employment programs operate on the premise that \n     they get more for their money by concentrating on young \n     people, ``we look for the oldest and poorest people we can \n     find,'' says Andrea Wooten, president of Green Thumb Inc., \n     which trains 18,000 people a year.\n       The programs have also played an important role in \n     retraining displaced workers, says Donald Davis, who directs \n     the programs run by the National Council on Aging. He tells \n     the story of a professional man in San Francisco who had \n     looked for a job for eight months after being laid off.\n       ``We worked with him for three months. He is now heading up \n     a multilingual program and making $30,000 a year,'' Davis \n     says. ``Every study that's been done of this program says it \n     is one of the most effective ever developed by the federal \n     government.''\n       In the three decades since the senior community service and \n     job training program has evolved, it has enjoyed strong \n     bipartisan support. But it is in danger of getting caught up \n     in the current rush to decentralize welfare programs and to \n     fund them through block grants to states, where various \n     programs are having to compete with each other for fewer \n     resources.\n       David Affeldt, the former chief counsel with the U.S. \n     Senate Committee on Aging who developed legislation creating \n     the program, says it came about because block grant programs \n     historically have not served older workers well. He predicts \n     that, at a minimum, 15,000 to 20,000 older workers served \n     each year ``will get their pink slips'' if the program is \n     funded through block grants.\n       ``One of the main problems that older workers have is that \n     they are not as visible or outspoken about their needs. . . \n     .The program has given these people hope and an opportunity \n     to help themselves while helping others, rather than be \n     dependent upon public assistance.''\n       The Senior Community Service Program, also known as Title V \n     of the Older Americans Act, costs $410 million a year and is \n     supposed to serve about 67,000 people. ``We actually serve \n     over 100,000 people because we've used this program to get \n     people up and out,'' ``says Sheila Manheimer, of the NCSC.\n       Half the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have \n     been elected since 1992, and many are riding a streamroller \n     called ``mandate for change'' without having a very good idea \n     of the territory they are rolling over. The Senior Community \n     Service Program serves the poorest of the elderly while \n     providing a wide variety of services that make our \n     communities livable. Far from a candidate for dismantling, \n     this is one federal program that everyone should look to as a \n     model of what works.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  National Council\n\n\n                                           of Senior Citizens,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The National Council of Senior Citizens \n     (NCSC), in behalf of our five million affiliated members, \n     asks you to vote in support of Senator Harkin's amendment of \n     H.R. 1158, the 1995 Rescission bill. This amendment is \n     expected to come before the full Senate today and your \n     support would be appreciated by seniors and families \n     throughout the nation.\n       This amendment would restore funding to many programs \n     important to the elderly, children and our communities, \n     including the Senior Community Service Employment Program \n     (SCSEP), the Child Care Block Grant, the Safe and Drug Free \n     Schools Program, Drug Courts and the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting.\n       The Council is particularly concerned about the $14.4 \n     million rescinded under H.R. 1158 from the Senior Community \n     Service Employment Program. The SCSEP designs needed \n     community service programs and provides subsidized training \n     and part-time employment which maximizes the productive \n     contributions of older persons in these community services. \n     Senator, please note that the $14.4 million rescinded under \n     H.R. 1158 would result in the loss of jobs for almost 3,000 \n     low-income senior citizens now staffing community service \n     programs nationwide under Title V of the Older Americans Act.\n       In a January 27 article in The Washington Post, which I \n     have attached, Judy Mann said it best when she said, ``Far \n     from a candidate for dismantling, this is one Federal program \n     that everyone should look to as a model of what works.'' \n     Every study has shown the SCSEP to be one of the most \n     effective programs ever developed by the Federal government.\n       Again, please do right by the elderly, young and our \n     communities by supporting Senator Harkin's amendment \n     restoring funding to these critical programs. Short of the \n     changes included in Senator Harkin's amendment, the \n     Rescission bill does not merit support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lawrence T. Smedley,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of the 10 minutes allotted \nyourself and another 10.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 2 minutes or whatever more he needs to the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Harkin and I are \noffering would partially restore cuts to public radio and television by \nreducing the appropriation for Radio Free Europe.\n  Radio Free Europe [RFE] is a World War II program, designed to \nbroadcast news to people living behind the Iron Curtain.\n  News flash--The Iron Curtain has fallen.\n  The Cold War is over. While the rest of the world is moving ahead \nwith satellite communication and other technological advances, we are \nstill using U.S. tax dollars to support broadcasts by shortwave radio.\n  I find when I go on the internet, I can reach people in Eastern \nEurope. I think I can reach them quicker on internet than by shortwave \nradio on Radio Free Europe.\n  I really cannot see, when we are cutting out our own public \nbroadcasting, why we are paying for this in Germany.\n  [[Page S5350]] We are shortchanging an American audience in deference \nto overseas listeners.\n  Our amendment cuts $40.5 million from what U.S. taxpayer is currently \npaying to support Radio Free Europe. This will still leave $175 million \nfor RFE.\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting would receive $26 million of \nthis savings.\n  This is not a total restoration of the cuts in this bill for public \ntelevision and radio--we understand that tough choices have to be made. \nThis restoration will support CPB at the 1995 level with a small \nincrease to compensate for inflation.\n  Continuing public television and radio programs are especially \nimportant in rural areas where residents might not be able to afford or \nhave access to cable programs.\n  I hear from hundreds of Vermonters each week on how important Vermont \nETV and Vermont Public Radio are to their lives. For some, it is the \nonly news and educational programming they can get.\n  We should not be diminishing this valuable national resource.\n  The remaining savings from the RFE budget would restore cuts to the \nCommunity Service for Older Americans Program.\n  The war against communism is over. We must focus our efforts on \nanother battle that is still being waged here at home:\n  Adoption of this amendment will send a clear signal that our priority \nis to support programs that will help educate and enrich the lives of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nto be included as an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, it is difficult to \ncover the ground in less than 2 minutes.\n  Let me just make three points. First of all, I want to associate \nmyself with the remarks of the Senator from Vermont. Second of all, I \nwould like to focus on the import of this amendment, which is to \nrestore as much funding as possible for public television.\n  I go back to just one gathering in Appleton, MN, in southwest \nMinnesota, where it is just crystal clear for anyone who wants to look \nat public TV that it is far from a ``sandbox for the rich.'' Public \ntelevision is so important to the enrichment of lives of citizens in \nour country, both urban and rural, but I think especially in the rural \ncommunities it is vitally important.\n  Second of all, the community service for older Americans program is a \nhuge success. The way I define ``success'' is we are talking about low- \nand moderate-income elderly people who, number one--it is kind of a \nmarriage--are able to have the dignity of being able to work; and \nnumber two, their work is this service of community, whether it be \ndelivery of meals to homebound, whether it be taking care of children, \nwhether it be recreational services.\n  I remember in talking with citizens in Willmar, MN, we can get a \nwonderful feel for how important this program is on the basis of \ninvestment of really very few dollars.\n  I want to make it clear that I am in full support of this amendment \nand proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if the leader would yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this amendment represents the \ncomplicated dilemmas that can be presented. Of course, I am in favor of \nsenior citizens, and I also support public broadcasting. In fact, I \ncontribute and have contributed to public broadcasting through the \nyears.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee this year I have discovered \nthat public broadcasting could well become self-funding. I agree with \nAl Gore that we need to reinvent and privatize wherever possible.\n  In talking to a lot of telecommunications people, I discovered that \nthey plan to get into video dial TV and so forth, and I asked them \nwhere they are going to buy their programming? They would say from Arts \nand Entertainment, the History channel, or Learning channel. I said, \n``Why not buy it from public television or radio? They have all kinds \nof public programming.'' And they said, ``Well, they do not try to sell \nit.''\n  I came up with a plan, along with some House leaders, and an \nagreement has been reached, or an informal agreement, with some of the \nleading people in public broadcasting to move towards self-funding.\n  Where would the money come from? First of all, public broadcasting \ncan digitize and sell a lot of their programming. There is a good \nmarket for that type of programming. They can sell it to the channels I \nmentioned as the History channel, the Learning channel, Arts and \nEntertainment. Nickelodeon is marketing a lot of children's programming \nin France where it is dubbed--educational children's programming. There \nis money to be made in this. Public television has taught that.\n  Second of all, the spectrums that public broadcasting has throughout \nthe country. Now we are finding that, with modern technology, we have \nextra spectrum. They can sell it or rent parts of their spectrum and \nmake a great deal of money.\n  Third of all, they have a lot of overlapping spectrum that can be \nsold or represented. For example, in the Washington, DC, area, many \nhomes get two or three public television signals with the same \nprogramming or virtually the same programming. The taxpayers of the \ncountry need some relief.\n  Fourth, the great bureaucracy that has grown inside the beltway here \nand the excessively high salaries that are paid to foundations that get \ngrants directly from the corporation can be cut. There is great room \nfor efficiency there.\n  By the way, our States are not getting their fair share of the money. \nIn fact, our State legislatures support most of the public broadcasting \nin this country as well as private contributors such as myself.\n  Finally, public stations could make money by getting a bigger \npercentage of what is played on the free public platform. I have spoken \nout about this, and indeed I commend the board of directors of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting because they passed a resolution to \nstart getting a bigger percentage of Barney and other programming that \nappear on the free public platform provided by the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the States are not getting their fair share. My little \nState of South Dakota, which is vast in geography but small in \npopulation, gets $1.7 million, but they have to send $1 million back \nimmediately for programming, which they might be able to buy elsewhere \nat a better rate.\n  The ``shields'' used by public broadcasting are children in rural \nareas. Let me say the State legislature in my State voted against a \nresolution to seek more funding for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting because it is such a charade they must go through.\n  So, I believe strongly in lowering the deficit. I believe in less \nGovernment involvement. This is an opportunity, a plan has been \ndeveloped, and they are working with a big investment bank in New York \nto privatize, to become self-funding.\n  There is not a need for taxpayers money here. If we are going to \ntransfer this money, we do not need to transfer it to the corporation. \nThe House leaders reached an agreement to privatize, to work toward \nself-funding. I have outlined various sources of revenue the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting can get. I have not mentioned \nadditional advertisement. They already have a great deal of \nadvertising. They call it ``enhancements'' or something. That is fine.\n  Even without further advertising they sit on a treasure trove of \nresources here. I recently wrote an article in the Washington Post \noutlining the five ways public broadcasting can get more revenue \nwithout any more advertising. They are sitting on a treasure trove of \nspectrum, of overlapping spectrum. Inside the beltway here their \nheadquarters are bloated bureaucracies.\n  The States are really not getting the money that they are supposed to \nbe getting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post \narticle I mentioned printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 8, 1995]\n\n                       Reality-Based Broadcasting\n\n                          (By Larry Pressler)\n\n       ``Public broadcasting is under attack!'' ``Congress wants \n     to kill Big Bird!'' These and other alarmist cries have been \n     common in recent weeks. The problem is they are lies. That's \n     right, lies. I tried to conceive of a more polite way to say \n     it. I could not. With rare exceptions the press largely has \n     ignored the specifics of the position taken by members of \n     Congress seeking to reinvent public broadcasting.\n       I have struggled to make my position clear. Yet the \n     misrepresentations continue. I am convinced many simply do \n     not care to report the facts--facts they do not find as \n     interesting as the scenarios they create. That is too bad. \n     The average American taxpayer would find the facts extremely \n     interesting.\n       As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, I am not seeking to destroy public \n     television and radio. I am a strong supporter of public \n     broadcasting, both in my home state of South Dakota and \n     nationally. Pull the plug? Absolutely not. Rather, my plan \n     would expand opportunities and save taxpayer dollars.\n       Why do I seek change? Because times have changed. Today's \n     electronic media are vastly different from those of the \n     1960s, when the current system of federal subsidies for \n     public broadcasting was established. The old theory of \n     ``market failure'' for educational programming is completely \n     untenable in today's environment. Educational and cultural \n     programs can and do make profits when their quality is good \n     and marketing astute. The only money losers in today's \n     arrangement are the taxpayers.\n       A Feb. 24 Post editorial stated it is time for the public \n     broadcasting industry to face reality. The issue no longer \n     should be whether federal subsidies for public broadcasting \n     will be cut. I could not agree more. Congress now is debating \n     when and how much. The House Appropriations subcommittee on \n     labor, health and human services already has cut the public \n     broadcasting budget. The House leadership promises more to \n     come. I fully expect the Senate to follow suit.\n       Instead of crying over public cash, it would be more \n     prudent for public broadcasting executives to use their \n     talents and resources developing the numerous potential \n     sources of revenue available to replace the federal subsidy \n     rather than continuing to fan the flames of fear and \n     exaggeration. As captains of a major corporation, their \n     responsibilities should be clear. The Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting (CPB), National Public Radio (NPR) and the \n     Public Broadcasting System (PBS) need to learn to stand on \n     their own feet.\n       To help in that effort, I recently provided the chairman of \n     the board of CPB with a plan to end its dependency on federal \n     welfare in three years. Ideas to end CPB's addition to \n     taxpayer dollars include:\n\n\n                           profits from sales\n\n       CPB should renegotiate sales agreements and improve future \n     agreements to get a larger share of the sales of toys, books, \n     clothing and other products based on its programming. In \n     1990, Barney-related products retailed at $1 billion! Steps \n     have been taken by the CPB board to improve its share of such \n     sales. More should be done.\n\n\n                    make the most of new technology\n\n       Use of new compressed digitization technology would permit \n     existing noncommercial licensees to expand to four or five \n     channels where once they had only one. Public broadcasting \n     stations could rent, sell or make use of the additional \n     channels for other telecommunications and information \n     services.\n\n\n                             end redundancy\n\n       At least one-quarter of public television stations overlap \n     other public television stations' signal areas. Public radio \n     also suffers from the inefficiencies of redundancy. Ending \n     this overlap and selling the excess broadcast spectrum would \n     provide substantial revenues to public broadcasting.\n\n\n                            switch channels\n\n       Moving public television stations from costly VHF channels \n     to less costly UHF channels in certain markets would provide \n     a substantial source of new revenue.\n\n\n                  team with other information services\n\n       CPB could increase commercial arrangements in the computer \n     software market and with on-line services.\n       These are only a few of the ways in which the CPB could \n     reinvent itself into a self-sufficient corporation for the \n     '90s and, indeed, for the next century. Ending federal \n     dependency does not end public broadcasting. Today's subsidy \n     amounts to only 14 percent of the industry's spending! \n     Indeed, my current plan asks the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting to end its dependency on federal welfare in \n     three years--that's one year more than what current proposals \n     would give welfare recipients to get off federal assistance.\n       It would be tragic if the public broadcasting industry \n     ignores its responsibilities when the federal budget is in \n     crisis. It also would be tragic if the industry spurns \n     exciting opportunities in new markets and technologies. \n     Perhaps most tragic of all, however, would be continued \n     retrenchment from public broadcasting executives crying, ``It \n     can't be done.'' It can be done. It should be done.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. So, let me conclude by saying that it may well be that \nmoneys could be transferred from here to there, but they do not need to \nbe transferred anymore for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The \ncommittee level and the House level gives them more than they need.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes; 5 minutes and 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains for the opponents of the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time was there originally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have 5 minutes left. Will the Senator from Delaware \ntake 2\\1/2\\?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make it real quick. First of all, I \nthink the characterization of my friend from Iowa is bizarre. It makes \nit sound like this is a CIA plot that is still underway. It is one of \nthe most noble undertakings that the Western World has ever engaged in. \nIf you ask any people in Eastern Europe, from Lech Walesa to Vaclav \nHavel to Boris Yeltsin, and others, who in fact were there before the \nWall came down, they credit Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty more \nthan any single thing.\n  Number two, is it still needed? It is needed now. There is an enemy. \nThe enemy is called censorship, and if you wonder whether or not it is \ntrue, some of us met this week with Mr. Gusinsky, the fellow who has \nthe media empire in Russia now who is criticizing the present \nPresident. They are threatening to take down the television stations. \nThey are taking down the radio and television access to the news for \nthe people everywhere from Slovakia through Russia.\n  The third thing is this notion it is no longer needed. Mr. President, \n25 million people still listen to it on a regular basis in Eastern \nEurope and Russia. Anyone who thinks democracy has taken root and the \nfree market system is in place in those areas, I respectfully suggest \nthey take another close look. And the notion that they can watch CNN--I \nwould say to my friends, CNN is in English; it can be censored. It, in \nfact, can be impacted upon. And CNN communicates international news, \nnot what is happening within those countries--as RFE/RL does. What we \nare doing is fully emasculating the ability of Radio Free Europe or \nRadio Liberty to continue to function.\n  I am a supporter, an unabashed supporter of public television. I \nbelieve it should be more than it is now. But this is like having the \nhearing impaired steal from the physically impaired, from those who are \nunable to walk. They are pitting two very important functions of \ngovernment against one another. But we should not undermine Radio Free \nEurope and Radio Liberty.\n  Again, those who think democracy is secure in those areas, please \nstand and raise your hands and tell me that censorship is still not the \nsingle biggest enemy of the prospect for freedom to flourish and \ndemocracy to flourish in Eastern and Central Europe.\n  Let me give a few more examples. In Russia, we have heard about the \nmedia courageously reporting on the war in Chechnya.\n  But that does not mean that Russia is now blessed with completely \nfree media.\n  Last year, the State Duma in Russia adopted a new media law which \nrequires that State-owned media must inform the public of activities of \nthe President, Government, and Parliament within 24 hours after any \nnoteworthy event.\n  And although the State Department reports that ``print media [in \nRussia] functioned largely unhindered,'' this optimistic picture is \nclouded by the situation in many provinces:\n\n       Regional political authorities [in Russia] resorted to \n     various devices to close down critical newspapers.\n\n  Last winter and spring, during the parliamentary campaign in \nKazakhstan, a television station went off the air for several days when \nlocal authorities, upset by broadcasts critical of the mayor of the \ncapital, shut off electricity to the station.\n  [[Page S5352]] In Slovakia, as the Washington Post reported last \nTuesday, the newly elected Government has increasingly pressured--and \nat times forced--television, radio, and newspapers to accept wholesale \nchanges or drop programs.\n  In my view, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are as important \ntoday as they were during the past 40 years.\n  Because the establishment of free and independent media in the region \nhas been a slow process, RFE/RL today have a dual role: To provide a \nmodel of how independent media should function in a free society, and \nto keep honest those who seek to reestablish repression and to silence \nthe press.\n  This function is not one conceived in the abstract; the practical \nreality lies in the public response: The people of the region continue \nto tune in to RFE/RL.\n  In nearly every country in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion, the listenership of RFE/RL today equals or exceeds that of the \nVoice of America.\n  It also exceeds the audience of the British Broadcasting \nCorporation's World Service.\n  All told, some 25 million people in the region listen to RFE/RL on a \nregular basis.\n  Surveys conducted last fall of leading citizens in the region found \nthat an average of nearly 75 percent supported the continuation of \nwestern radio broadcasts.\n  Equally important, every leader of the new democracies in the region \ncontinues to urge that these radios remain open.\n  Let me quote from a letter from Czech President Vaclav Havel to \nPresident Clinton:\n\n       [RFE broadcasts] remain important to the development of \n     independent journalism and democracy in our country.\n\n  The Presidents of the three Baltic States expressed a similar view:\n\n       These broadcasts [are] an integral part of the continuing \n     development of [our] democratic institutions.\n\n  These are not leaders whose budgets benefit from RFE/RL--these are \nleaders who recognize that RFE/RL still make a contribution to the \nestablishment of democracy.\n  This year, the administration proposes to spend $100 million on the \nso-called ``Warsaw Initiative,'' a program to assist the new \ndemocracies of Eastern Europe to modernize their militaries.\n  I would argue that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are as \nimportant as this military assistance in helping to secure the \ndemocratic foundation in the former East bloc.\n  Yet I predict that hardly anyone around here will blink an eye when \nthe Congress votes on the $100 million ``Warsaw Initiative.''\n\n\n                      rfe/rl is cutting its budget\n\n  I agree with the Senator's belief that we need to reduce our \ninternational broadcasting budget.\n  We are doing just that.\n  The State Department authorization bill, enacted last year, provides \nfor the consolidation of all U.S. international broadcasting.\n  The plan will reduce operations at both RFE/RL and the Voice of \nAmerica. By next October, VOA and REF/RL will have reduced their \ncombined broadcast hours to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union \nby 32 percent.\n  RFE/RL will reduce its budget by 67 percent--from $220 million to $75 \nmillion annually by fiscal 1996.\n  In terms of employees, RFE/RL will be cut by a similar amount--from \n1,600 in September, 1993 to about 420 in fiscal 1996.\n  The research arm of RFE/RL has already been privatized: Its \noperations have been taken over by the open media society--a project \nfunded by the philanthropist George Soros.\n  The new institute will undertake the restoration and preservation of \nthe invaluable archives owned by RFE/RL--40 years of material that \ntrace the dark era of totalitarianism in Eastern Europe and Eurasia.\n  This is a project for which no Federal funds were available. But \nbecause of this public-private partnership, that important objective \nwill be realized.\n  The changes that I have enumerated will produce $400 million in \nsavings over the period from 1994 to 1997. All this is not a one-time \nphenomenon--it is a permanent structural change.\n  In addition, Congress has directed RFE/RL to begin an effort to \nprivatize the radios--that is, that the funding should be assumed by \nthe private sector by the end of the decade.\n  The radios are taking that directive seriously. Their ongoing move to \nPrague is a critical part of the effort to prepare for privatization.\n  Let everyone understand what this amendment will do--it will \nemasculate Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.\n  The fiscal year 1995 budget for the radios is $229 million. That \nincludes $103.5 million for one-time downsizing costs.\n  Nearly $67 million of those costs are mandated by German labor laws.\n  Restrictive German labor laws require RFE/RL to pay severance and \nother benefits to the hundreds of employees who will be laid off--laws \nthat RFE/RL, as a private corporation operating in Germany, must comply \nwith. It is undisputed that RFE/RL, Inc. is subject to German labor \nlaws.\n  A recent case, decided in February in the D.C. Circuit (Mahoney v. \nRFE/RL, Inc.), made clear that as a corporation with its principal \nplace of business in Munich, RFE/RL would violate the laws of Germany \nif the corporation breached its collective bargaining agreements.\n               this will stop an important move to prague\n\n  In short, the effect of this amendment would be to place a dagger in \nthe heart of the radios--at a moment when they are in the midst of a \nmove from Munich to Prague, where they are preparing for the eventual \nprivatization of RFE/RL.\n  This would break faith with a decision that the President and \nCongress jointly made last year.\n  Last January, the Senate voted to consolidate RFE/RL and the Voice of \nAmerica.\n  Last summer, the President sent a reprogramming to Congress which \nprovided for the move of the headquarters of RFE/RL from Munich to \nPrague.\n  I do not recall any of my colleagues objecting at that time to the \ncontinuation of RFE/RL.\n  But now the move to Prague is in motion. Four language services are \nnow being produced in Prague: Russian, Ukrainian, Latvian, and the \nSouth Slav service.\n  RFE/RL plans to be out of Munich by June 10.\n  Because Munich is one of the most expensive cities in Europe, the \nmove will achieve important savings. Per capita personnel costs will be \nreduced by one-third.\n  The President of the Czech Republic, President Havel, made an \nextremely generous offer to allow the radios to use the former \nCzechoslovak Federal Parliament Building for a nominal fee of one Czech \ncrown per day--or 12 dollars per year.\n  The President of the United States accepted that offer last summer. \nThis amendment would obviously undercut that commitment.\n  That is why the Clinton administration is strongly opposed to the \nHarkin amendment, as stated in the letter I read earlier from Joe \nDuffey, director of the U.S. Information Agency.\n\n\n                   rfe/rl and voa are not duplicative\n\n  It is not true that RFE/RL duplicates the Voice of America.\n  The two radios have different missions. The Voice of America's is \nmandated to tell America's story.\n  By contrast, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, radios provide news \nand information about local events within the recipient countries.\n  In this manner, RFE/RL act as home service or surrogate radios in the \nabsence of fully free and independent media in the emerging democracies \nof the Eastern Europe and Eurasia.\n  As a result of the broadcast consolidation, the amount of overlapping \nbroadcasts--that is, broadcasts by both RFE/RL and the VOA in the same \nlanguage at the same time--was reduced from 24 hours to zero.\n  It is ludicrous to suggest that the cable news network now suffices \nfor the countries of the former Soviet Empire.\n  In most countries, there are only two ways to obtain CNN--by staying \nin an expensive hotel or to buy a satellite dish.\n  I do not have any data on how many such dishes are available, but I \ncannot believe they are widespread.\n  More important, the news of CNN is in English, and it is \ninternational news. The news on Radio Free Europe \n[[Page S5353]] and Radio Liberty is in the vernacular--the local \nlanguage; and it focuses mainly on local news.\n  Do not take my word for it that these broadcasts are still needed. \nListen to the results of a survey conducted last fall in the region.\n  A poll of decisionmakers in each country--government, military, \nmedia, and economic leaders--clearly demonstrates this point.\n  When the proposition was put to them that Western radio is needed \ndespite the new media freedom, some 75 percent of those polled \ndisagreed or strongly disagreed.\n  I sympathize with my friend from Iowa about the choice we face in \nthis bill.\n  I am in favor of restoring the cuts to the corporation for public \nbroadcasting--but not at the expense of one of the most valuable \ninstruments in American foreign policy.\n  The last point I will make is the administration is opposed to the \namendment of my friend from Iowa. And I hope I have done this within \n2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. Much as I would \nlike to see additional funding for public broadcasting, the \nsubcommittee of which I am the chairman, the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth, Human Resources and Education, has made a very careful \nallocation and has in fact reduced considerably the rescission by the \nHouse of Representatives for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. The House \nwanted to cut public broadcasting by $47 million. We limited the \nrescission to $26,360,000 for fiscal year 1996. For fiscal year 1997, \nthe House of Representatives wanted to cut public broadcasting by $94 \nmillion, and our subcommittee limited that rescission to $29,360,000, \nleaving public broadcasting at its current rate of $285,640,000.\n  That is fairly complicated arithmetic, but what it boils down to is \non the current mark, there has been substantial consideration given to \npublic broadcasting. The responses which the committee has heard from \nthose who are interested in public broadcasting is a sigh of relief \nthat their funding has been maintained at its present level.\n  I would like to see more funding for public broadcasting. But in \nsetting this mark we feel there has been a realistic and appropriate \nbalancing of priorities.\n  When the Senator from Iowa talks about employment for older Americans \nand would like to add funding there, of course it would be fine to add \n$14 million additionally to the $396 million recommended by the \ncommittee. But here again, the Appropriations Committee has made a very \ncareful balancing of priorities. It is possible to pick apart the \nappropriations bill in a thousand ways and to take accounts which sound \nwonderful, like older Americans or public broadcasting, and take them \nfrom accounts like Radio Free Europe which makes a great sound bite or \nlooks complicated when the Sunday papers reprint the vote. But this has \nbeen very, very carefully worked out.\n  Senator Biden has made as good an argument as you can make in 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. I am sorry he is not on the floor to compliment him, because \nit is seldom that Senator Biden makes that good an argument in 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. Usually it is longer and proportionately it may not justify \nthe additional time. I wish he were here to reply to that.\n  It is with some reluctance that I oppose my colleague, Senator \nHarkin, who serves as ranking member on the subcommittee. We have \nworked together for a very, very long period of time. But as the \nallocations now stand, there is an appropriate allocation and balancing \nof priorities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend this \ndebate for 10 minutes, to be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the time is extended for an additional 10 minutes--\n  Mr. HATFIELD. And I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would want to reserve time until I hear from Senator \nHarkin and reply, if I may.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the 10 minutes has been agreed to, 5 on \na side?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor and will reply to whatever additional \narguments remain.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Senator Specter's argument on the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting is we are not hurting the \ncorporation nor public broadcasting as much as the House is. That is \nnot a very good argument.\n  Let me point out one thing. This body, I am pleased to say, \nunanimously supported me in an effort to have an exemption to the \nantitrust laws so that the television industry could get together on \nthe question of violence. The evidence is overwhelming.\n  The Presiding Officer is a physician. The American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Medical Association, the National Institute of \nMental Health, the Surgeon General of the United States, all have \nissued studies saying that television violence that glorifies violence \nadds to violence in our society.\n  I am pleased to report to this body, thanks to your efforts and to \nvoluntary efforts in the industry, broadcast television has reduced \nviolence appreciably. Cable has moved very, very modestly. But one \nnetwork and one network alone provides violence-free television for the \nchildren of America, and that is public broadcasting.\n  I think we have to put our vote where our mouth is on this. I think \nwe have to encourage the only network in this Nation that provides \nviolence-free television for our children. There is one children's \nprogram, for example, that is broadcast in this country which is \nproduced in two versions. One is the violent version for the United \nStates of America, and the other is the nonviolent version for all the \nother countries in the world. When the Christian Science Monitor asked \nthe producer why, she said, ``Well, the United States people demand \nviolence, and we get no complaints. We cannot sell it in other \ncountries with the violence in it.''\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is doing a superb job of \ngiving us violence-free television for our children, and we ought to be \nsupporting it and supporting them strongly.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Harkin amendment. If I am not \nalready, I want to be added.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes and 39 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from Iowa \nfor yielding to me. I congratulate him on trying to maintain a \nsemblance of culture, decency, and civility in this Nation.\n  The Senator from Illinois spoke just before I did. He spoke about the \nfact that our children, by the time they graduate from high school, \nwill have seen 18,000 murders, to say nothing of the other unspeakable \nviolence they are going to see on network television. We have grappled \nin the Senate with how to control children's exposure to violence in \nlight of the free speech provisions of the first amendment, and nobody \nhas been able to come up with a workable solution.\n  I was speaking with a Senator's wife about a week ago and she said, \n``You know, Dale, we don't subscribe to cable at our house. We have a \n12-year-old son. We do not want him exposed to MTV.'' I tell you, there \nare an amazing number of people in this country who deplore what their \nchildren are watching on television, and some of them are opting, as \nshe does, not to purchase cable television.\n  Mr. President, you can be assured that this is not the final \ndefinitive debate on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. There is \nan assault in the U.S. Congress on public broadcasting. With Newt \nGingrich leading the charge, the Republicans in Congress \n[[Page S5354]] have decided to take dead aim at Big Bird, rather than \ndeal with the problems that really cause harm to our society.\n  Mr. President, we have heard the argument: ``CPB can be privatized; \nlet them do as everybody else does.'' Let me ask you about the \nmagnificent, unprecedented series on the Civil War which was so \npoignant. 14 percent of Americans tuned in to see it. I promise you, \nmost Americans were in tears watching, but above all, learning about \nthe most defining moment in American history--13 hours on public \nbroadcasting. Can you imagine watching that series on one of the \ncommercial networks and being interrupted every 5 minutes with a car \nbeing dropped on top of a mountain top, or a Budweiser beer commercial?\n  I cannot believe that the Harkin amendment is even being challenged. \nIf the Senator from Iowa prevails on his amendment, there will be $175 \nmillion left in the Radio Free Europe account. That is $100 million \nmore than the President requested. In addition, even if the Senator \nfrom Iowa prevails, we will still be $29 million short of what public \nbroadcasting was supposed to get.\n  Mr. President, how many times during the balanced budget amendment \ndebate did you hear the argument, ``Senator, how can you vote against \nthe balanced budget amendment? Eighty percent of the people of this \ncountry favor it. You are going against the wishes of the people.''\n  So, for the Senators here who are prepared to vote against the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa, let me remind you that between 65 \npercent and 70 percent of the people of this country do not want the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting to be cut. Is it for dilettantes? \nThe statistics show that the average salary of the people of this \ncountry who watch opera is $40,000 a year. Where else could they see \nPavarotti, Kiri Te Kanawa, all of the magnificent voices; are they to \nbe silenced? Are we going to say to the American people that other \ncountries of the world are willing to spend up to $38 per household for \nthe very same thing the American people are paying $1.09 for?\n  It is troubling to hear the assaults on things like the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting and National Public Radio--I never move my \nradio off NPR. When I get in the car in the morning, that is what is \non; and when I go home at night, that is what is on, because I want to \nknow what is going on in the world and I do not want all those \ncommercials interrupting it. I want a definitive, honest-to-goodness, \nanalysis of what is happening all over the world. I wonder what the \nopponents of the Harkin amendment listen to in order to get their news.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is remaining on both sides, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes on this side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank my \ncolleagues who have spoken so eloquently on this amendment. I thank \nthem for their support.\n  Second, I want to again thank and congratulate my colleague, Senator \nSpecter, for doing a truly outstanding job in getting the provisions \nthrough our Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations subcommittee that he has \ndone in this bill. Having been in his position, I know it is a tough \njob, a thankless job. I want to commend him for all the work he has \ndone. He has done a good job. I support him in that effort.\n  I point out, however, that in this case, Radio Free Europe is not in \nour subcommittee. So I am not hanging that on his head. It is funded in \nanother subcommittee. Senator Specter and our subcommittee does not \nfund Radio Free Europe.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say--and I do not have the time to do \nthis. The compensation package that was agreed upon for the employees \nof Radio Free Europe because they are now moving to Prague, \nCzechoslovakia, you ought to read it. Let me read a couple of its \nprovisions.\n  Employees having children shall receive a one-time payment in the \nfollowing amount: One month of gross salary, but in no event more than \ndeutsche mark 10,000--that is $7,500 in U.S. dollars--for every \ndependent child aged no more than 27. How about that?\n  Employees terminated effective as of July 30, 1994, shall receive in \nrespective school fees for the children to go to school 10,000 deutsche \nmarks per child. So they can go to school. That is $7,500 a year.\n  What is going on here? This is criminal. Talk about a golden \nparachute. And at the same time, we are saying we are going to cut \nbroadcasting for Big Bird and for our kids in this country. What \nnonsense.\n  My friend from Delaware talks about censorship. If that is going to \nbe our guiding light, let us start Radio Free Asia, Radio Free South \nAfrica, Radio Free South America.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We have.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Censorship can rear its ugly head anywhere, anywhere--in \nUruguay and Paraguay, in Chile and Argentina, in any country in Africa. \nBut what we have is the Voice of America. Now, he talked about Lech \nWalesa. I have some statements from other people I will put in the \nRecord telling about the Voice of America, the present Prime Minister \nof Albania saying it was the Voice of America that brought them \nthrough, not Radio Free Europe.\n  Second, Mr. President, here is a list--I ask unanimous consent to put \nthese in the Record--of every country in Eastern Europe and all of the \nradio and TV stations they already have that are operating. I ask \nunanimous consent to put that in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Ukraine: Russian TV programming is widely viewed.\n       Belarus: European music stations and BBC TV programs have \n     been on air since last year.\n       Latvia: 6 commercial stations broadcasting most of day.\n       Lithuania: Recent formation of an association of \n     independent TV and radio stations. TV programs broadcast; \n     also several TV and radio stations broadcasting in Polish.\n       Hungary: VOA and BBC rebroadcast on Kossuth, FM, a state \n     radio network.\n       Poland: RWE, Inc. broadcasts on Polish Program 4, a \n     nationwide mediumwave network; BBC and VOA rebroadcast \n     locally on both MW and FM. A National Broadcasting Council \n     has issued 3 private national licenses in addition to 115 \n     local licenses. The first national private TV license was \n     recently awarded to Polsat over competing bids involving \n     well-established foreign firms such as Time Warner Inc., \n     Bertelsmann AG, and Reuters.\n       Czech Republic: VOA and BBC broadcast on FM networks in \n     locations throughout the country; 2 public radio networks. \n     Many of the independent stations with music and news often \n     broadcast 24 hours a day.\n       Slovakia: Slovak Radio broadcasts despite financial \n     problems BBC broadcasts on FM networks throughout the \n     country.\n       Bulgaria: Numerous local independent radio stations operate \n     in Sofia and other major cities. VOA, BBC, Deutsche Welle and \n     Radio France International broadcast on FM in Sofia; VOA and \n     BBC in cities outside.\n       Romania: Romania Radio, with 3 national networks all due to \n     go on FM in the near future, is a less controversial \n     institution than state TV. Numerous local independent radio \n     stations operate in Bucharest and other major cities. VOA, \n     BBC, Radio France International and DW are currently being \n     rebroadcast on FM in Bucharest; BBC and DW also broadcast on \n     FM in other cities.\n       Azerbaijan: Iran and Turkey supply television and radio \n     programs to Azerbaijan; radio and TV cooperation between Iran \n     and Azerbaijan is expanding.\n       Georgia: ``Free Georgia'' radio reportedly has been set up \n     in Mingrelia by Gamsakhurdia supporters. Western and Turkish \n     TV is available in Tbilisi.\n       Kazakhstan: TV broadcasts from Russia. Almaty is home to \n     several independent radio stations. Print media are diverse. \n     BBC and VOA broadcast, but only in Russia.\n       Tajikistan: An opposition radio, ``Free Tajikistan,'' has \n     begun broadcasting 90 minutes a day. BBC and VOA broadcast in \n     Russian.\n       Uzbekistan: Voice of Iran and radio Saudi Arabia transmit \n     to Uzbekistan in Uzbek; other regional broadcasters can be \n     heard in Persian or Turkish. VOA broadcasts; BBC plans to \n     begin broadcasting in Uzbeck in later 1994.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Delaware says the administration is \nopposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n   [[Page S5355]] Mr. HARKIN. I will take 30 more seconds. Here is the \nOMB pass-back budget 1994:\n\n       Presidential decisions. The pass-back includes some \n     specific policy issues that were personally reviewed and \n     decided by the President and cannot be changed. BIB, RFE, RL \n     will be terminated in 1995, capital assets will be \n     transferred to and merged with USIA.\n\n  So if this is something new, then the President obviously has changed \nhis mind. But the President made a decision to personally zero it out.\n  I would also point out that even in this fiscal year the President \nasked for $75 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And this is $100 million more than the President asked \nfor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield me \n2 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not say this with any rancor, but it is clear the \nSenator from Iowa is correct; he is uninformed on this issue. The \nreason he is uninformed on the issue, Radio Free Europe or Radio \nLiberty, the administration is not opposed.\n  I will submit the letter for the Record. I ask unanimous consent it \nbe put in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      U.S. Information Agency,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Joseph Biden,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Joe: It is my understanding that the Senate may take \n     up an amendment that would rescind major funding for the \n     operations of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. We appreciate \n     your past and continuing support for RFE/RL and hope you will \n     join the Administration and me in opposing this amendment.\n       As you know, we are currently in the process of shutting \n     down RFE/RL in Munich and moving the newly configured \n     operation to Prague. We have managed to get major components \n     of the operation off the government budget and all of those \n     involved in this effort have proceeded in good faith on the \n     basis of reductions agreed to last year. The budget is being \n     drastically reduced.\n       The operation will be overhauled under the leadership of \n     Kevin Klose, President of RFE/RL, and a new Board of \n     Directors, chaired by David Burke, former Vice President of \n     ABC News. We have, however, let go more than a thousand long-\n     time employees in Germany and must meet major obligations \n     (legal obligations) there for German Government mandated \n     separation costs, pension and health costs, etc. A cut in \n     this year's budget of the one-time expense set aside for this \n     purpose will break faith with those who have moved ahead with \n     creativity and no little courage to help reinvent this old \n     institution and make it serve a new purpose in a new time. It \n     will also create a monumental management disaster in Munich \n     and Prague, which will cause operations to come to an abrupt \n     halt and create obligations and penalties for the U.S. \n     Government beyond the savings sought by the amendment's \n     sponsors.\n       I stand ready to met you in the Senate Lounge at any time \n     to talk with you about this, as does Mort Halperin, who can \n     express President Clinton's and the National Security \n     Council's strong opposition to the proposed amendment.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joseph Duffey,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me clarify this for the Senator. At the beginning of \nthis administration, the President proposed terminating RFE/RL. That \ndecision was reversed in the spring of 1993. And that summer, the \nPresident proposed consolidating all U.S. sponsored international \nbroadcasts. Congress accepted it. And we ordered budget cuts. We cut \nthe costs. The reason it is $175 million, $100 million more that the \nrequest for Fiscal 1996, is that it costs more--in the current fiscal \nyear--to reduce the size of the radios. That is what it cost under \nGerman law to reduce the operation. We are bound under German law. When \nwe lay off people and fire people under German law, we are required to \npay this severance pay. That is the reason why it is more money this \nyear and drops to $75 million next year.\n  Thirdly, I point out to my friend from Iowa, he did vote for and we \ndid vote for Radio Free Asia. We authorized the establishment of a new \nservice last year, and began appropriating money last year. We did it \nbecause there is censorship in China and the other communist countries \nin Asia; because there is a gerontocracy in Beijing that does not let \npeople express their points of view. We did do that. So he is ahead of \nhimself without even realizing it. We did in fact vote and have voted \nto guarantee that where there is censorship in the world, we will be \ninvolved to the extent that we can.\n  So, Mr. President, if we do not send troops, and we are not going to \nsend money, and we are not going to send information, and we are not \ngoing to send access to the truth, what the heck are we going to do? I \nresent the fact that this is being pitted against public television. \nThe reason public television is cut is not because of Radio Free \nEurope. When we reach the point----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired..\n  Mr. BIDEN. When you reach the point your time has expired, you sit \ndown.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 9 seconds remain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much for the opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute thirty-two seconds. But the Senator \nfrom Iowa yielded back his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, the Senator did not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thought the Senator did.\n  In that event, 1 minute 32 seconds remain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  When the argument is made by the Senator from Arkansas that there is \nan assault on public broadcasting, I would remind him that the major \nassault is on the deficit, and as chairman of the subcommittee we \nlooked at $5.9 billion of rescissions by the House, and we reduced that \nto $3.05 billion, and asked public broadcasting to take a fair share, \nleaving them with the same amount they had last year. And that has \nreceived the comments of gratitude that they are able to function \nwithout the larger cuts recommended by the House.\n  The amendment is an attractive one, obviously, when they move into \ncommunity service with older Americans, but that account already has \n$410 million. So the $14 additional million, while making this \namendment look attractive, really is not very significant in the \noverall picture.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware has spoken about Radio Free \nEurope, but I think the point has not been made that the $229 million \nis being reduced next year to $75 million, and $7 million has been \nadded this year for consolidation and wind-down purposes.\n  My colleague from Iowa, who was chairman and is now ranking member, \nworked with me over these sheets, and I can understand his interest in \nwanting more money for public broadcasting. And I understand the \nSenator from Illinois, who has done outstanding work to try to combat \nviolence on television. But this is a fair allocation, and if we are \ngoing to reach a balanced budget----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  If we are to reach the balanced budget by the year 2002, there is \ngoing to have to be a fair share reduction on many items which we would \nlike to have. And I think it is a fair submission that the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting is able to tighten its belt and do the job \nwithin the parameter of the existing budget, so additional funds should \nnot be added at the expense of another worthwhile account.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator give me 5 seconds?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to point out that in the Dole-Daschle \ncompromise we are cutting the international broadcasting account by $35 \nmillion. The Senator from Iowa proposes to cut $40 million from RFE/RL \nin addition to what we are about to cut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n   [[Page S5356]] Mr. HARKIN. First of all, let us face it. The Voice \nof America is broadcasting all over the world, in China, in Europe. The \nPrime Minister of Albania said it was the Voice of America, not Radio \nFree Europe that they listened to, plus we have BBC, German. These \ncountries all have other broadcasts. So it is just a question of \nchoices.\n  This is deficit neutral. This does not increase the deficit. But the \nchoice is just this. Are we going to privatize the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting or are we going to privatize Radio Free Europe? \nWill we have a compensation package for the Germans that I just \nmentioned or will we have jobs for our senior citizens here in America?\n  I would also point out, Mr. President, that the Dole substitute had a \n$98 million cut in Radio Free Europe, much more than what we are asking \nfor here in ours.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I would point out again, this amendment \nprovides $26 million more for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nIt also provides $14 million for the senior community service \nemployment program.\n  I ask unanimous consent to put at the end of my remarks some \nsupporting documents regarding the senior community service employment \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, again, Mr. President, the choice is clear. Are we \ngoing to spend our taxpayers' dollars for Radio Free Europe when the \nVoice of America is already broadcasting? Or are we going to bring that \nmoney here and make sure we have public broadcasting and jobs for our \nseniors?\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                      Examples of VOA Programming\n\n\n                                general\n\n       They do news broadcasts (in English and native languages), \n     descriptions of US foreign policy, pieces on popular US \n     culture, information about studying in America, English \n     lessons including Special English broadcasts in slow English, \n     and editorials (which are criticized for being one-sided and \n     potentially damaging the credibility of VOA.)\n       You can think of VOA as the public relations arm of the US \n     Government for foreign publics.\n\n\n                               specifics\n\n       During China's 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations and \n     massacre, VOA correspondents broadcast in real time back to \n     China eye-witness accounts of the massacre, and gave public \n     exposure in China to the demonstrators demands for democracy \n     and openness--information that Chinese authorities were \n     censoring.\n       During the Gulf War, VOA stepped up broadcasts in Iraq and \n     throughout the Middle East in English and Arabic to counter \n     misinformation by Sadaam Hussein, and explain US goals and \n     achievements in the world.\n       VOA reports on the Middle East peace process from the US \n     perspective so that Arab populations, who live in countries \n     where press is often censored, will hear additional views.\n       President Clinton broadcast an appeal for calm and non-\n     violence to Burundi in February 1995 just as ethnic violence \n     a la Rwanda is heating up between Tutsi and Hutu extremists: \n     in this case the President is using VOA to circumvent \n     hostilities without resorting to force or sanctions.\n       The Prime Minister of Albania, Dr. Alexander Meksi, praised \n     VOA for its role during 5 decades of totalitarianism and \n     during the 1990-1991 revolutions:\n       ``On Voice of America we heard about the revolution in \n     Eastern Europe as well as about internal developments in our \n     own country. The role of the radio station was vital in the \n     democratization of Albania. Through interviews that VOA \n     conducted with prominent personalities in Albania we heard \n     the first public criticism of the communist regime from \n     within Albania.''\n       VOA correspondents were in Mogadishu to report on the US \n     feeding mission, getting out information about where the US \n     Marines were, what they are doing, and where feeding centers \n     were.\n       When the Congress voted to lift the trade embargo against \n     Vietnam, Vietnamese heard it on VOA along with appeals for \n     continued cooperation on POW-MIAs--which well reflected US \n     policy.\n       VOA broadcasts to Tibet news about international efforts \n     for their struggles that China authorities would not allow. \n     The Dalai Lama can address his people on Tibet on VOA.\n       English classes in the English Corner throughout the world. \n     It's a language lesson everyday on radio.\n       VOA also feeds its broadcasts to local FM stations to \n     expand distribution\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    10 Good Reasons to Support SCSEP\n\n       The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) \n     authorized under Title V of the Older Americans Act should be \n     preserved and expanded for the following reasons:\n       1. The SCSEP is our country's only workforce development \n     program designed to maximize the productive contributions of \n     a rapidly growing older population through training, \n     retraining, and community service. History has taught us that \n     mainstream employment and training programs like JTPA and \n     CETA are not successful in serving older workers. A targeted \n     approach is needed.\n       2. The SCSEP is primarily operated by private, non-profit \n     national aging organizations that are customer-focused, \n     mission driven, and experienced in serving older, low-income \n     people. These nonprofits work in close partnership with the \n     Governors, Department of Labor, aging network, and employment \n     and training system, actively participating in One Stop \n     Service initiatives designed to streamline and integrate \n     services.\n       3. The SCSEP is a critical part of the Older Americans Act, \n     balancing the dual goals of community service and employment \n     and training for low-income seniors. Many nutrition programs \n     and other services for seniors are dependent on labor \n     provided by the SCSEP.\n       4. The SCSEP has consistently exceeded all goals \n     established by Congress and the Department of Labor, \n     surpassing the 20% placement goal for the past six years and \n     achieving a record 135% of goal in FY 1993-94. Virtually all \n     appropriated funds are spent each grant year, in stark \n     contrast to similar programs.\n       5. The SCSEP provides a positive return on taxpayer \n     investment. One study found that the program returns at least \n     $1.47 for every dollar invested by empowering individuals to \n     become self-sufficient and productive members of their \n     communities.\n       6. The SCSEP is a means tested program, serving Americans \n     age 55+ with income at or below 125% of the poverty level, or \n     $9,200 for a family of one. The program serves less than 1% \n     of those who are eligible; long waiting lists are common in \n     most areas of the country.\n       7. The SCSEP serves the oldest and poorest in our society \n     and those most in need: 39% of enrollees are minorities--the \n     highest minority participation rate of any Older Americans \n     Act program; 72% are female; 32% are age 70 and older; 81% \n     are age 60 and older; 41% do not have a high school \n     education; and 9% have disabilities.\n       8. The SCSEP ensures national responsiveness to local needs \n     by directly involving participants in meeting critical human \n     needs in their communities, from child and elder care to \n     public safety and environmental preservation. The SCSEP has \n     been a major contributor to national disaster relief efforts, \n     most recently resulting from floods in the midwest, \n     hurricanes in the southeast, and the California earthquakes \n     and riots.\n       9. The SCSEP has demonstrated high standards of performance \n     and fiscal accountability unique to government programs. Less \n     than 15% of funding is spent on administrative costs--one of \n     the lowest rates among federal programs and despite a unit \n     cost that has not been adjusted for increased administrative \n     expenses since 1981.\n       10. The SCSEP historically has enjoyed strong public \n     support because it is based on the principles of personal \n     responsibility, lifelong learning, and service to community. \n     In addition, the program is extremely popular among \n     participants, host agencies, employers, communities, and the \n     membership of our nation's largest aging organizations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                        [From Green Thumb, Inc.]\n\n                       Iowa SCSEP Case Histories\n\n       Donald Huntley of Boone county came to a Green Thumb pre-\n     app day last spring out of desperation. He had worked for \n     many years at a large turkey manufacturing plant that had \n     gone out of business. HIs annual income for a family of two \n     at the time was $1,380. Don had very good skills and life \n     experiences and a wonderful personality. He began his \n     assignment in June with the Iowa 4-H Education Center. Prior \n     to his orientation his Area Supervisor, Denise Juhl, told him \n     that this was a chance to prove to the agency that they \n     couldn't live without him. Don told her, ``consider it \n     done''. On January 1, 1992, Don became a permanent full-time \n     employee of the Iowa 4-H Education Center. His beginning \n     salary will be $18,400 with full benefits--an increase of \n     more than 13 times his salary when he enrolled in June! Way \n     to go, Don--we knew you could do it!\n       Jerry Burgett, a once very successful business owner and \n     entrepreneur, found himself physically disabled and as a \n     result lost his business. He had been a concrete sawer, which \n     took an extreme amount of physical activity. At age 55 he \n     experienced major back surgery and was unable to lift more \n     than five pounds. He became homeless, living with different \n     relatives. His life learned working skills were no longer of \n     value to him. At the intake and assessment, he indicated that \n     he wanted to learn computers and word processing. He was dual \n     enrolled in Green Thumb and JTPA to begin an eight week \n     course in computers and word processing. At the completion of \n     his course, he finished with a perfect attendance and top \n     scores in his class. Jerry began working for a local \n     greenhouse firm the day he finished classes. He is in charge \n     of a city wide satellite greenhouse system. He insures each \n     satellite is staffed and ready for business each day. Jerry \n     credits his new job to his recently acquired training. He now \n     has a small apartment and rediscovered self esteem and self \n     worth.\n   [[Page S5357]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this has been a lively debate. I think \nall of the issues have been aired. I think the accounts as they \ncurrently stand express appropriate priorities as best we can determine \nthem, and I move to table the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not in order under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand there was an agreement on an \nup-down vote. I was not present at that time. I withdraw the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all yea and nay \nvotes will be stacked. We are ready for other amendments.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair the list of \nthe amendments that were incorporated in the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Wellstone seniors' amendment, the \nHatfield-Byrd managers' amendment, the Harkin add-back for Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, so as far as the process of those \nneeding to be disposed of, we have the Wellstone amendment and the \nmanagers' wrap-up amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we have resolved the Wellstone \namendment. We are now putting that together with the managers' wrap-up. \nTherefore, I believe that would complete the business at this point as \nfar as amendments are concerned; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would the Senator from Oregon yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I withdraw the request for a quorum call.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just want to thank Senator Hatfield \nfor his graciousness in our negotiations. I wanted to say to the \nSenator and to my colleagues that this program, the insurance \ninformation counseling and assistance grant program, again, is a \nprogram that we have in every single State, with seniors receiving \nassistance from trained volunteers in dealing with all the Medicare \nforms and the Medigap policies to provide really good protection for \npeople. It is a program, with very little by way of money, that has \ngone a long ways. I thank my colleague from Oregon for all of his help.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. The only amendment left now will be the managers' \namendment. When will that amendment be prepared to be offered and how \nmuch time will it take for that amendment, could I ask the good \nSenator?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. My estimate at this point is that we are in the process \nof putting that together and of alerting our colleagues who are \ninvolved.\n  I notice Senator McCain is here. He will have an amendment in that \nwrap-up. Senator Wellstone will have one. Senator Jeffords will have \none.\n  In each case, Mr. President, I say to the Democratic whip, each of \nthese amendments that are in the wrap-up are totally offset amendments. \nSo they do not add to the deficit. And they have been cleared on both \nsides. We should have that within the next few minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, I was not objecting \nto that amendment. I understand it is basically agreed to and it has \ncomplete offsets, so most people are satisfied with it.\n  The only thing I was trying to do is figure out how much longer it \nwould be and when you think the votes will be occurring.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to make about a 4-minute statement.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, at this point, I \nwould say it should all be wrapped up, as far as the managers' \namendment, in about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the chairman very much.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 578, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I will now make a unanimous consent \nrequest to make a technical correction. We had cleared the Levin \namendment No. 578, but I ask unanimous consent to correct a drafting \nerror by modifying it with the language that I now send to the desk.\n  What we are doing is we are, on page 9, line 12, striking one figure, \n$37 million, and putting in $25 million; and one figure $35 million and \nputting in $23 million. This does not change the basic content of the \namendment. It was inaccurately drafted.\n  I ask that it be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 578), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 9, line 16, strike ``$13,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$15,000,000''.\n       On page 9, line 12, strike ``$25,100,000'' and insert \n     ``$23,100,000''.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, that will appear in our wrap-up package \nnow that it is corrected. It is easier to correct it now than correct \nit down the line. That is why I took the time to do that at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know the hour is late, and I will be \nbrief. But I would like to make some comments on the compromise \namendment that has been so long in its gestation period today and \nyesterday.\n  I want to start out by thanking the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and all those Members of the Senate who have worked to \nproduce a good substitute rescission bill. I give them credit. I am \nonly sorry we had not been able to do more.\n  Over the last week, freshman Senators have led a noble fight, in my \nview, to add new cuts to these bills. The amendment originally proposed \nby my freshman colleagues would have called for cuts in the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting, AmeriCorps $206 million, IRS, Foreign \nOperations, Youth Build, and many other cuts that would have totaled \n$1.3 billion. Obviously, they sought to have that amendment passed. \nThey were unable to do so for a variety of reasons which are not worth \ngoing into now.\n  But I really want to comment, Mr. President, about the difference \nthat those freshmen bring to this body, which is the message of \nNovember 8, which is that we have to make tough decisions. We have to \nmake difficult cuts in the budget and we have to do so because we have \nan obligation to the American people to balance the budget. Mr. \nPresident, we are not going to do that with this compromise amendment.\n  I especially thank Senator Santorum. I thank Senator Ashcroft, who is \nin the chair. I thank my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and many \nothers who played such an important role in their efforts and came here \nto succeed and maybe will succeed next time. Those cuts that they \nproposed were difficult decisions. They alienated substantial \nconstituencies in all of their States. But the fact is, we needed to \nenact those cuts and many more.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, I am a little bit disspirited because, \nif we cannot enact these cuts, I wonder what is going to happen when we \ntake up budget reconciliation and we have to consider some really \nimportant and difficult reductions in the Federal budget. I am not \npositive we will have the courage to do so, particularly in light of \nthe rejection of the so-called freshmen amendment.\n  I point out, in the compromise amendment, there are some good \nprograms. I think they are very nice to have these programs. These add-\nbacks \n[[Page S5358]] all have nice-sounding names to them, like TRIO and \nsubstance abuse and mental health and Goals 2000 and school-to-work, et \ncetera, et cetera. But Mr. President, the question is where the role of \nGovernment ends and our obligation to the American people to balance \nthe budget begins.\n  I am particularly pained by the so-called offsets that are in this \namendment, because the majority of the offsets, about $1.2 billion of \nthe $1.6 billion, are contained in two so-called offsets. One is for \nthe HUD section 8 project reserves and the other is for airport \nimprovement. Both of those funds will have to be replenished within the \nnext 6 months.\n  So the fact is what we have done is add back $834 million and really \nonly subtract from that around a couple hundred million. So the offsets \nare illusory. The offsets are not meaningful.\n  And it was interesting that Radio Free Europe and foreign operations \nwere two of the major so-called savings in offsets, neither of which \nhave any domestic constituencies. The other one that I see here was \nFederal administration and travel, which is always a convenient one. If \nanyone believes that there will be a $337 million reduction in Federal \nadministration and travel that is unspecified, I would say they have \nmore optimism about the Federal bureaucracy's reactions to the mandates \nof Congress than I have seen in the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I did not ask for unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are under controlled time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry for taking so much time.\n  I believe it is important for us to recognize the effort that was \nmade by the freshman Senators. I think it is disappointing that they \ndid not succeed. I urge them to continue in their efforts, because I \nthink they best reflect the views, aspirations, and hopes of the \nAmerican people, as expressed on November 8.\n  I am disappointed in this so-called compromise. I hope that in the \nfuture we will not agree to such compromises again.\n  Mr. President, I had yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 579\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted for the Harkin amendment to \ntransfer $40.5 million from the Board for International Broadcasting \nand Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc. to the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and the seniors community service program because I \nbelieve they are higher national priorities than overseas broadcasting \nis.\n  Last year I led the fight to reduce RFE/RL's budget from $220 to $75 \nmillion--by two-thirds--and to slash their outrageous management perks \nbecause I believe that RFE/RL is a cold war relic, which also suffered \nfrom terribly sloppy fiscal management in the past. I do have some \nconcerns about this formula, however,\n  During the debate on consolidation last year, we discovered that \nbecause of contractual obligations that the BIB never should have \nentered into on behalf of the U.S. Government, we have to spend some \nmoney this year in order to cap RFE/RL at $75 million next year. It \nseems to make little sense, but I have done the math many times, and \nunfortunately, concluded that these sums are necessary if we are to \ndownsize. It actually demonstrates how this organization ran amok for \nyears under the guise of national security interests. In any case, I am \nconcerned that if BIB funds are rescinded this year, we may not be able \nto reduce fully to $75 million next year.\n  At the same time, I think CPB is a far better investment that so-\ncalled surrogate broadcasting--particularly when we already have radio \nservices to the transitioning democracies through the Voice of America. \nI am carefully monitoring RFE/RL's budgeting and expenditures. If their \nrequest exceeds $75 million next year, I will be the first to propose \ntheir termination.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I support the amendment to reduce \nfunding for Radio Free Europe and to restore $40.5 million for programs \ncut in this bill before us. Specifically, this amendment would restore: \n$26 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; $14.4 million \nfor the Community Services Program for Older Americans.\n  Mr. President, for many years, I have been a supporter of the \ncontinued operation of Radio Free Europe. Every year as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I supported the Board for International \nBroadcasting's appropriations. But, now I look at this rescission bill \nand I look at the reductions that are proposed for programs like the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, programs to prevent the use of illegal \nnarcotics, and programs that serve the elderly and children--all \nprograms that serve Americans here at home--and I can no longer support \nthe appropriations for the radios. Programs for Americans here at home \nshould and must have a higher priority.\n  I have listened to the attacks on the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, on support for National Public Radio and Public \nTelevision. The other side has argued that taxpayer funds should not be \nused to support public radio and television. I disagree. Public radio \nand television are among the finest investments made by this \nGovernment. They are an investment in the education of our people. But, \nif the other side is arguing against taxpayer support for public radio \nfor Americans, how can they justify taxpayer support for Radio Free \nEurope. And, in this bill that the Appropriations Committee reported \nthey have even proposed supplemental funding for Radio Free Europe \nwhile they are proposing rescissions in the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. That simply doesn't make sense.\n  One of President Clinton's first reinventing government proposals was \nto phase out Radio Free Europe and to consolidate it with the Voice of \nAmerica. This country spends over $320 million per year for the Voice \nof America's operations and facilities, and almost $230 million per \nyear for Radio Free Europe.\n  We did not phase-out Radio Free Europe. They conducted an impressive \nlobbying campaign to continue their existence, and the administration \nbacked down. It agreed to reduce the Radios, but not to end their \noperation.\n  But, times are changing. The world has changed. The cold war has \nended. Many of the nations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion had developed their own media and radio stations, and without \njamming, they now had access to the BBC, CNN, Sky Television, and other \nWestern media. Just last week the Washington Post carried an article \ndiscussing Russia since the fall of communism. While the article \nbemoaned the outbreak of organized crime, it also noted that Russia has \ndeveloped a vigorous, and free mass media.\n  And, as everyone can see from this rescission bill, times have \nchanged here at home too. We have before us a $13 billion rescission \nbill. We are cutting programs that Americans rely on.\n  Mr. President, in the budget game, in the appropriations business, we \nare continually involved in a process of setting priorities--of \ndetermining what is more important than something else. And, when I \nlook at the programs that Senator Harkin, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nReid have suggested in this amendment, for this Senator, there is no \ncontest. They clearly are higher priority than continuing radio \nstations for Europe.\n  There is no one in this room that does not think the Older Americans \nAct Community Service Employment Program has been a success. The \naverage participant is a 68-year-old woman who has just lost her \nhusband and has little or no work history outside the home. There are \nboth elderly men and elderly women in the program, but this is the \ntypical situation. All of the participants are low income by \ndefinition.\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n  This program provides a grant to nonprofit organizations to train \nparticipants and to place them in jobs. Initially, the program supports \nthem at the minimum wage. For those who have good work skills, it moves \nthem into full-time, unsubsidized employment. For the others, it \nprovides either formal or on-the-job training to prepare for \nemployment.\n  n any case, the work done by these seniors in libraries, home health \nagencies, child care centers, and other public, nonprofit, and private \njobs is an absolute boon to the community and to the taxpayer. It would \nbe pennywise and pound foolish to send these low-income senior citizens \nto the welfare line instead of letting them do work that is needed for \nthe minimum wage.\n  Furthermore, we are talking in committee about getting people off of \nwelfare and into work, and here on the Senate floor we are cutting a \nprogram that does just that.\n  Mr. President, 16,000 elderly people are being supported at the \nminimum wage nationwide through the Community Service Employment for \nOlder Americans Program. There are 900 in South Carolina alone, and we \nwill cut 106 if this amendment fails. The dignity of these elderly \npeople is certainly more important than overextending our past \ncommitment to taxpayer-funded European radio.\n  Mr. President, Senator Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and Senator Snowe have proposed a major reorganization of \nour international affairs agencies. They are, at this time, considering \nmajor reductions in international affairs agencies. Their proposed \norganization chart for the reinvented Department of State includes an \n``America Desk.'' Well, it is clear to me that time has run out for \nRadio Free Europe, and we could well help their reorganization effort \nat this time. Clearly, Radio Free Europe no longer can pass the \n``America Desk'' review.\n  I commend Senators Harkin, Leahy, and Reid for bringing this \namendment to the Senate. Phasing out Radio Free Europe is a tough \ndecision to make. But, it is far preferable to the other reductions \nthat have been proposed in this rescission bill.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \npending amendment proposed by the Senator from Iowa.\n  Let me first state that I fully understand the valid impulses that \ngive rise to an amendment such as this. It takes money from Radio Free \nEurope, and puts it into a small number of other domestic spending \ncategories, some of them bringing benefits to children and to the \nelderly.\n  The point being made is clear. It is one that we always hear whenever \nwe go to our town meetings. If a Senator such as myself stands up to \ndescribe the vast increases in direct transfer payments to American \ncitizens--from the young worker to the older retiree--increases which \nindeed have driven our deficit to near extremity, one always hears the \nsame old refrain in response: ``What are you going to do about foreign \naid? What about Congressional perks?''\n  Of course, spending on those two items amounts to less than 1 percent \nof the budget. But as long as some of it is still there, one can always \ngain a few more political points by taking a little bit more out of \ninternational spending, and spending a little bit more on the domestic \nside.\n  Now, I come to this issue from an unusual stance, which I would hope \nthe Senator from Iowa appreciates. Unlike some of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side, I fully support public broadcasting. I think it is \nespecially valuable in a rural State such as my own, where we simply do \nnot have the market power to make available to our citizens all of the \nbest that commercial programming has to offer in a cost-effective way.\n  But despite my general support for public broadcasting, I oppose this \namendment. It would take $40.5 million out of Radio Free Europe in \norder to make it available for other domestic programs.\n  The first point I would make is that there has been a series of \namendments here from the other side of the aisle, each of them designed \nto score big political brownie points by giving more money to children, \nto the poor, to the elderly. They're trying to make the crude charge \nstick, that somehow Republicans are wreaking havoc upon all these \nprograms.\n  It is a war of symbolism, and it is being waged by various feints, \njabs and deceptions. I would say to my colleagues over there on that \nside that I believe this tactic is getting quite worn and tired. The \npress, believe it or not, is beginning to figure this one out. They did \nfall a bit for the school lunch sophistry, buying the notion that we \nwere snatching the food out of children's mouths, simply by giving the \nStates more control over that program. But increasingly they are \nstarting to understand what is a cut and what is a slower rate of \nincrease. That's what we are proposing with all domestic and welfare \nspending generally--and if the American public can't figure that one \nsimple gem of logic out, then they are, all of them, going straight to \nthe poorhouse themselves.\n  So that's what gives rise to these partisan amendments. And of \ncourse, if you want to get some money for the ragged and downtrodden, \nthere is no more politically popular place to get it than something \nthat smacks of the evil term ``foreign aid''--as in Radio Free Europe.\n  I would say that the U.S. is still getting a very fine return on its \ninvestment in Radio Free Europe. One thing\n that the collapse of the Berlin Wall has shown to us is the power that \nRadio Free Europe had in beaming a message of hope and freedom to those \nstriving for democracy. It is said by some that, now that the wall has \ncome down, RFE has outlived its usefulness. But we have seen eloquent \ntestimony that this is not the case.\n\n  Indeed, Radio Free Europe has moved its base of operations precisely \nbecause President Havel of the Czech Republic offered them various \nforms of subsidy assistance if only they would relocate in Prague. \nThat's what he personally feels about Radio Free Europe's usefulness in \nthe post-Cold War World. If the charge was to be made that Radio Free \nEurope was too expensive, then the people of Central Europe were \nwilling to chip in their own bucks and give some help in order to \nenable it to stay.\n  Radio Free Europe has kept its operation up-to-date and relevant. It \nremains a tremendous source of reliable information on many subjects of \ninternational import, often giving more timely and profound coverage of \nevents that the commercial news services. They have managed to stay \nahead of the game in a number of areas of particular movement and \nimportance in recent years--reports on the evolution of ethnic tensions \nas well as burgeoning controversies in economic and military matters. \nThey provide translations of articles in major international \nnewspapers, and academic analysis of events that cannot always be found \nin commercial papers and broadcasts.\n  In a budget in which we devote less than 1 percent of our resources \nto trying to affect the course of events beyond our borders in a way \nthat is beneficial to us, it seems to me to be very pennywise and pound \nfoolish, to take yet another whack at something which is so inexpensive \nto the taxpayer--indeed becoming less expensive as a result of the \nrecent decision to move--simply to make the sudden, cynical political \npoint that the loyal advocates of the amendment stand for more spending \nfor the downtrodden.\n  So I regret to say to the Senator from Iowa that I cannot support his \namendment. I would say to him and to the rest of this chamber that if \nwe are squeezing funding for the programs that he has attempted to \nprovide for here, it is not spending on Radio Free Europe that has \ncaused the difficulty. Come the year 2013, unless we do something about \nentitlement spending, we not only will not have money for Radio Free \nEurope, but for national defense, highways, prisons--turn them all \nloose--upkeep of the national parks--nothing. So we should turn the \nspotlight onto the spending that got us here and we'll be looking for \nthe Senator's vote, otherwise we won't be able to fund any of the \nprograms that the Senator from Iowa or anyone else cares about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take one or two moments at \nthis time, prior to the time that we are going to have a final vote on \nthis issue \n[[Page S5360]] on the rescissions, to, first of all, express my own \ndeep personal appreciation for the leadership of Senator Daschle, on \nour side, over the course of this debate and his perseverance in \npursuing the restoration of extremely important funding that had been \ncut in the areas which were targeted on children and on education. \nThere is close to a billion dollars which has been returned to this \nmeasure as a direct result of his strong commitment and work over these \npast days.\n  Many of us were prepared to have extended debate on priorities, which \nI think the rescission issue basically brings forward, to try and \nreflect in this body what we think are the real priorities of the \nAmerican people with regard to children and with regard to education.\n  We know that over this year and in the future, we are going to have \nto be much sharper in prioritizing this country's expenditures. Funding \nin and of itself is not necessarily the answer to all of our problems, \nbut it is a pretty clear reflection of a nation's priorities.\n This is particularly true when we are talking about a number of the \ndifferent items that were included in the measure which was supported \nby Senator Daschle and others, including some Members from the other \nside of the aisle.\n\n  I am speaking about the restoration of the funds at Head Start, \nChapter 1, and the day care programs, which are so important for \nworking families, particularly working mothers, and are an \nindispensable part of our planning if we are trying to be serious about \nwelfare reform. I should also note the return of the funding on the \nGoals 2000, which will help some 1,300 schools to move ahead in terms \nof enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  Those were extremely important programs. Other important measures \nthat were restored include the School-to-Work Program, which will \nprovide additional opportunities for the 70 percent of the young people \nthat do not go on to college and are facing dead-end jobs when they get \nout of high school.\n  Because of the School-to-Work Program that was passed last year and \nstrongly supported with the leadership of President Clinton, we were \nable to work through a partnership with public and private sectors to \ntry to offer a greater opportunity for young people. That, I think, is \nimportant.\n  I know that Senator Kassebaum is working through the restructuring \nand reorganizing of our youth training programs, and the role of the \nSchool-to-Work Program may very well be--I believe will be--the center \nfocus of reform of youth training. It will also help in redesigning the \noutreach to the some 400,000 young people who drop out of school every \nyear. With this program and some of the other efforts, these dropouts \nmay be brought back into the educational system.\n  Finally, I want to mention the restoration of funding for the \nnational service program. While we have had some debate and discussion \non that measure, I wish we had had the chance to go into greater detail \non the extraordinary contributions that so many of the young people in \nthis country are involved in through community service.\n  If there was really a failing during the period of the 1980's, and we \nall have our list of shortcomings in national policy, I think one of \nthe important areas was the failure to offer a vehicle and an avenue \nfor young people, particularly, to give something back to their \ncommunity in the form of voluntary service. We didn't give them an \nopportunity to repay what the community has done for them.\n  Under the leadership of President Clinton, we have seen service \nprograms growing, not only in the AmeriCorps programs, but the other \nprograms which are creating an opportunity for service while students \nare in school, from kindergarten through high schools. In my State of \nMassachusetts, enormously impressive programs are taking place.\n  I was talking recently to the service learning director of the \ncommunity service programs, and she mentioned that Massachusetts is one \nof the top States in taking advantage of the service learning programs.\n  We could go on about other programs restored--the TRIO program--and \nabout some that were not, such as the technology programs, which are so \nimportant in making sure young people are going to be able to get the \nbest in terms of new technology, and not only technology but training \nprograms in the use of these technologies. All of these are enormously \nimportant.\n  We are going to have debates on these measures as to funding levels \nin the future. But we want to make very clear in this body and to the \ncountry that there are going to be a number of Members that will stand \nfor the children, stand for education, stand for investing in the \nfuture of this country by doing all that we can to strengthen the \nsupport for the youngest and the most vulnerable. We will support \nchildren in the Head Start programs and support strengthening our \neducation system. Another issue we will watch closely will be aid to \ncollege students. We must ensure that young people that are taking \nadvantage of the student loan programs, work study programs, and other \nhigher education programs which have been targeted by Republicans over \nin the House of Representatives are not hurt by Republican cuts. We \nmust make sure the Republicans bent on eliminating these programs are \nnot going to be successful.\n  I believe that there is a bipartisan coalition for education. \nPerhaps, had we had more votes on education it would have been \nreflected in the course of this debate, but I believe it is there. It \nwill be tested over the period of these future months.\n  I do think in this early skirmish that it is very clear that even \nthough the funding levels are not what I would certainly like to see in \nthese areas, the areas nonetheless where there has been the greatest \nrestorations have been in children and in education. I think that that \nis what the American people would want. I know that these are what we \nwill want as we go through the process of prioritizing this Nation's \nneeds. We will keep them on the front burner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, by my calculation, we should be voting by \nnow. Could I be advised why we are still talking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We still have another amendment to be offered, \nthe managers' amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is anybody entitled to time on the managers' amendment, or \nare the managers entitled to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a total of 15 minutes remaining on \nthe managers' amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just say to my colleagues, if they want to stay here all \nnight, that is fine. But we are going to come back in the morning if we \ncannot close this down in about 5 minutes.\n  It is about 10 o'clock. Most everybody is here tomorrow, and we will \ncome back if we cannot conclude this, come back tomorrow morning. If \neverybody needs to talk, let them talk and we will come back and vote \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, why can we not proceed to vote on the Harkin \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent provided that the votes \nwould be stacked.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 579\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to vote on the \nHarkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Harkin amendment No. 579. On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been requested, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD: I announce that the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 131 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     [[Page S5361]] Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Mikulski\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 579) was rejected.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Now, Mr. President, I would like to have the attention \nof the body.\n  Mr. President, this is the last act for this bill except final \npassage, and this is referred to as a managers' wrap-up. What we have \ndone is incorporate into this one action amendments that have been \nagreed to on both sides. If there is any additional money, it is fully \noffset. So it is totally deficit neutral. And instead of having them \noffered one at a time, we are offering them en bloc. Let me enumerate \nthem because those of you who have such amendments make certain that we \nhave incorporated them. The following list: Hatfield has three, \nLautenberg, Burns, McCain, Jeffords, Pell, Kennedy, Akaka, Kempthorne, \nInouye, and Wellstone.\n  Now, that is our listing of all of the amendments that have been \nagreed to, cleared.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be \nconsidered and agreed to en bloc and that motions to reconsider votes \nby which these amendments were agreed to be laid upon the table en bloc \nand any statements with regard to the amendments be placed in the \nRecord at the appropriate place. And I yield to the ranking member of \nthe committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject, these amendments have been cleared on this side and they are \nfully offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments \nto describe the intent of the amendment I have offered today to S. 619. \nIt addresses my concerns about the rehiring of former Federal employees \nwho received a voluntary separation incentive payment to leave the \nFederal service, but now will be rehired under the provisions of this \nbill.\n  Under the terms of the ``Federal Workforce Restructuring Act''--\npopularly known as the buyout bill--Federal employees could receive an \nincentive payment as high as $25,000 if they voluntarily agreed to \nleave their agency. These buyouts will help achieve a reduction in the \nFederal work force of approximately 275,000 employees, which will \nsignificantly reduce the size of our Federal bureaucracy and save \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  After receiving such a buyout, the Federal employee would be barred \nfrom rejoining the Federal work force for 5 years. A special waiver \nprovision afforded former employees with unique capabilities to be \nrehired by a Federal agency if no other qualified individual was \navailable.\n  I supported this legislation, and am pleased that it has already \nhelped reduce the Federal work force by some 30,000 employees. I am \nconcerned, however, by one provision of the recissions bill before us \ntoday that would allow individuals who received a buyout payment to be \nrehired without having to either repay their buyout, or meet the terms \nof the existing waiver provision.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the need for highly qualified individuals \nto be brought back to Federal service with \n[[Page S5362]] the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to \nassist with new timber harvests. They must be brought back quickly, and \nare likely to be reemployed for a fairly short period of time.\n  I do believe, however, that the agencies rehiring these individuals \nshould advise the Congress on the extent of former Federal employees \nwho received a buyout and have been rehired. We have a responsibility \nto ensure that the spirit of the buyout legislation is not abrogated by \nthis new rehiring authority. Furthermore, it would be wise for the \nCongress to monitor that the taxpayers investment in this buyout \nprogram is not improperly utilized.\n  My amendment is intended to allow the Congress to fulfill these \nobligations. It would require OPM and the relevant Federal Department \nto advise the Governmental Affairs Committees of the House and Senate \ntheir use of the rehiring authority established in S. 619. More \nimportantly, it will require these agencies to explain how rehiring \nbuyout recipients without a repayment of their separation incentive \naward is consistent with the original waiver provision of Public Law \n103-226.\n  This requirement will provide the Congress with some idea of not only \nhow many former Federal employees who received a taxpayer funded buyout \nhave been rehired, but also whether their reemployment truly meets the \ncongressional requirement of highly skilled individuals, and a shortage \nof similarly talented candidates. I do not want to see the expedited \nrehiring authority established in this bill to be used in such a manner \nthat undermines the merits and purpose of the cash awards given to \nindividuals.\n  I think it is important that we treat rehired Federal employees \nfairly in this regard, but we also need to ensure that taxpayers are \nprotected due to the fact that they have paid for the cash buyouts that \nhave been awarded. After all, these voluntary separation payments are \nintended to downsize the bureaucracy, and save taxpayers money. \nIndividuals should not be able to take advantage of large buyout \nbonuses and then reenter the Federal service except under very special \ncircumstances.\n  This amendment will help the Congress evaluate this rehiring program \nas it proceeds, without hindering the Forest Service or the BLM in \ntheir legitimate efforts to bring skilled individuals back into their \nwork force on a short-term basis.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Gorton, Senator Hatfield, and \nSenator Byrd for their assistance and acceptance of this amendment.\n                           amendment no. 586\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield for Mr. Jeffords.)\n       On page 14, line 12 strike $81,500,000 and insert \n     ``$71,500,000''.\n       On page 13, strike the figure on line 24 and insert \n     ``$60,000,000''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 587\n\n  (Purpose: To provide continued funding for the national center for \n                   research in vocational education)\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield for Mr. Pell.)\n       On page 33, line 9, strike ``$236,417,000'' and insert \n     ``$242,417,000''.\n       On page 33, line 14, strike ``$8,900,000'' and insert \n     ``$14,900,000''.\n       On page 34, line 4, strike ``$60,566,000'' and insert \n     ``$54,566,000''.\n       On page 34, line 7, strike ``$8,891,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,891,000''.\n                           Amendment No. 588\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield, for Mr. Kennedy.)\n       On page 36 after line 5, insert:\n\n                       ``PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.\n\n\n                              (RESCISSION)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-333, $4,424,000 are rescinded.''\n       On page 34, line 18, Strike $57,783,000 and insert in lieu \n     ``$53,359,000''.\n       On Page 35, line 2, strike $6,424,000, and insert in lieu \n     of ``$2,000,000''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 589\n\n(Purpose: To restore certain funding for the demonstration partnership \n   program which is administered by the Office of Community Services \n          within the Administration for Children and Families)\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield, for Mr. Akaka.)\n       On page 31, strike line 9 and insert the following: \n     ``Public Law 103-333, $10,988,000 are rescinded.''.\n       On page 31, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       ``Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-333 and reserved by the Secretary pursuant to section \n     674(a)(1) of the Community Services Block Grant Act, \n     $1,900,000 are rescinded.''\n       On page 32, line 5, strike $2,918,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,018,000''.\n                           amendment no. 590\n\n   (Purpose: To make an appropriation for the Advisory Commission on \n Intergovernmental Relations and to increase the rescission amount for \n                   diplomatic and consular programs)\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield, for Mr. Kempthorne.)\n       On page 11, line 19, strike ``$2,000,000 are rescinded.'' \n     and insert the following: $2,500,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n           advisory commission on intergovernmental relations\n\n       For the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations \n     for purposes of section 306 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4), $500,000.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 591\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provision that prohibits the application of the \n  Davis-Bacon Act to any contract associated with the construction of \n       facilities for the National Museum of the American Indian)\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield, for Mr. Inouye.)\n       In chapter V of title I, under the heading ``construction'' \n     under the heading ``Smithsonian Institution'' under the \n     heading ``OTHER RELATED AGENCIES'' strike ``: Provided \n     further, That notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act shall not apply to any \n     contract associated with the consideration of facilities for \n     the National Museum of the American Indian.''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 592\n\n       (Offered by Mr. Hatfield, for Mr. Wellstone)\n       On page 29, line 16, strike ``$2,185,935,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof $2,191,435,000''.\n\n  At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     administrative expenses & travel shall further be reduced by \n     $5,500,000.\n  So the amendments (No. 580 through 592) were agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage at the \nprovision in this rescission bill that would increase funding for the \nMarket Promotion Program by $25 million in fiscal year 1995. A \nprovision that would increase subsidies for major corporations, at the \nsame time that we are cutting billions from programs that are vital to \nour Nation's children.\n  My opposition to the Market Promotion Program is long-standing. I do \nnot believe that the U.S. Government should be spending $100 million a \nyear to subsidize overseas advertising by large corporations.\n  In recent years, the Market Promotion Program has used taxpayer money \nto subsidizes such corporations as McDonalds, Miller Beer, Sun Maid \nRaisins, and General Mills: hardly struggling corporations in need of \nGovernment largesse.\n  It would be a travesty for the Senate to increase spending on this \nwasteful program while we are considering billions of dollars in cuts \nfrom far more important programs in the fiscal year 1995 budget.\n  How can we cut housing assistance for low-income families and seniors \nwhile we increase subsidies for large corporations?\n  How can the U.S. Senate cut the Head Start Program, the Youth \nTraining program, the National Service Program, the Safe and Drug Free \nSchool Zones program, Child Care, Education, and so many other programs \nthat benefit our Nation's children and families, help hard-working \nAmericans, and prevent drug abuse and crime? How can we cut all those \nprograms and then turn around and increase funding for multinational \ncorporations?\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. Dead wrong. The market promotion \nprogram should not be increased. It should be eliminated. If we can cut \nfunding for child nutrition programs and elderly housing, we certainly \ncan ask billion-dollar multinational corporations to do their fair \nshare as well.\n  I recently introduced legislation that would eliminate the Market \nPromotion Program and several other wasteful subsidy programs operated \nby the Department of Agriculture. I am pleased that the Senate has an \nopportunity today to cut some real waste out of the Federal budget.\n   [[Page S5363]] I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will join \nwith me in supporting the Bumpers-Bryan amendment.\n         funding for the united nations population fund [unfpa]\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my full support \nfor U.S. funding for the U.N. Population Fund [UNFPA]. President \nClinton resumed funding for the Population Fund last year after a 7 \nyear suspension during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Last year, \nCongress appropriated $40 million for the fund, and $50 million was \nappropriated for 1995. Unfortunately--and I think unwisely--the House \nrescinded $25 million of the funding in its emergency supplemental and \nrescissions bill.\n  With Senator Hatfield's couragous support, the Senate did not rescind \nany money for the fund in its bill. I am most appreciative of my fine \ncolleagues, Senator Hatfield and his efforts and longstanding support \nfor international population stabilization activities including the \nUNFPA.\n  I do understand that funding for all programs across the board needs \nto be reduced if we are to properly fund this supplemental bill. \nHowever, I do not want to see population programs unfairly targeted for \nlarger reductions than other foreign assistance programs. Reducing the \nPopulation Fund's money by one-half is surely an unreasonable reduction \nin funding.\n  This huge reduction in funding will surely send exactly the wrong \nmessage to the rest of the developed nations across the world. Last \nyear, the United States was seen as the world's leader on population \nand development assistance at the International Conference on \nPopulation and Development in Cairo. I was a congressional delegate at \nthe Conference aid I came away very much impressed with the leadership \nand direction displayed by Vice President Gore and the assistance given \nhim by our former colleague, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth in \nguiding the Conference and its delegates in developing a consensus \ndocument on a broad-range of short- and long-term recommendations \nconcerning maternal and child health care, strengthening family \nplanning programs, the promotion of educational opportunities for girls \nand women, and improving the status and rights of women across the \nworld.\n  We surely do not want to lose our moral leadership role and \nrelinquish any momentum by abandoning or severely weakening our \nfinancial commitment to population and development assistance. The \nUnited States needs to continue its global efforts to achieve \nresponsible and sustainable population levels, and to back up that \nleadership with specific commitments to population planning activities.\n  That is why it is so very important that we show our support by \nfunding the U.N. Population Fund. The fund is supported entirely by \nvoluntary contributions, not by the U.N. regular budget. There were 101 \ndonors to the fund in 1993, most of which were developing nations. \nJapan and the United States are the leading contributors to the fund \nwith the Nordic countries not lagging far behind. UNFPA assistance goes \nto over 140 countries and territories across the world. It would \ncertainly be a real shame if the United States were to back away from \nits commitment to the world's largest source of material assistance for \npopulation programs.\n  Mr. CHAFEE, Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Wyoming \nin expressing my strong support for the United Nations Population Fund \n(UNFPA). There are many challenges to be faced in the next century with \nregard to global population growth, and international programs such as \nUNFPA are critical to the world's population and development assistance \nefforts.\n  UNFPA, which receives funds from some 101 donor nations, has had a \nsomewhat tumultuous history in the US over the past decade. Indeed, \nUNFPA funding was suspended altogether during both the Reagan and the \nBush Administrations.\n  Under the Clinton Administration, modest funding for UNFPA has \nresumed. However, of the $50 million appropriated for UNFPA in Fiscal \nYear 1995, $25 million--or one-half--was rescinded by the House of \nRepresentatives in its Emergency Supplemental and Rescissions Bill.\n  Let me emphasize that in these difficult budgetary times, U.S. \nfederal spending, including U.S. contributions to international foreign \nassistance programs such as UNFPA, need to be adjusted accordingly. \nHowever, in this process we must ensure that programs are not unfairly \ntargeted for disproportionate funding reductions. Moreover, I believe \nit is important in this instance to continue the U.S. leadership role \nthat was demonstrated at the 1994 International Conference on \nPopulation and Development in Cairo.\n  For these reasons, I believe that a 50 percent cut in funding for \nUNFPA is excessive, and thus unwise. I was pleased, therefore, to find \nthat the Senate rescissions package does not cut the U.S. allocation \nfor UNFPA. I particularly want to commend and thank the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, for recognizing the \nimportance of this international effort.\n  UNFPA will continue only if member nations continue to provide it \nwith support. I believe that the United States has a clear interest in \nthe success of UNFPA and similar population and development assistance \nefforts, and I join with Senator Simpson and my other colleagues in \nurging the Senate to maintain U.S. support.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to take final \naction on H.R. 1158, I rise to draw the attention of my colleagues to \nthe provisions of the bill and the Dole-Daschle amendment making \nrescissions in U.S. foreign policy programs. Along with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Simpson, Chafee, Simon, and others, \nI believe a direct and substantial benefit flows to the United States \nfrom our modest investment in sustainable development and population \nefforts. I am pleased the Senate bill rejects specific cuts to these \nvital programs and instead attempts to minimize harm to on-going, cost-\neffective foreign assistance programs.\n  Mr. President, I disagree with certain provisions of the bill before \nus. Nonetheless, I want to commend the distinguished Chairman and \nRanking Democrat of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senators \nHatfield and Byrd, and the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Democrat \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Senators \nMcConnell and Leahy, for their very commendable effort to make \nequitable rescissions in U.S. foreign policy programs.\n  It is significant that the cuts recommended by the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee are not based on a fundamental dislike for particular \nprograms. Nor are they driven by a belief that one or two foreign aid \nprograms are unnecessary. Rather, the Subcommittee's recommendation of \n$100 million in general reductions to programs within its jurisdiction \nreflects the laudable belief that deficit reduction can be achieved in \na manner which minimizes harm to all programs.\n  Over the next few weeks, as my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee take this bill to conference with the House, I urge them to \nremain firmly committed to the Subcommittee's goal of making equitable \nrescissions in foreign policy programs. More specifically, I urge them \nto resist House efforts to target and cut vital population and \ndevelopment programs.\n  Under the House-passed bill, population and development programs \nwould disproportionately bear the burden of foreign\n policy rescissions. Development assistance would be cut by $45.5 \nmillion and population assistance would be targeted for $9 million in \ncuts. In my view, these cuts are extremely shortsighted. In the long-\nterm, they could end up costing the U.S. far more than we would save in \nfiscal year 1995. The Senate should remain firm in its commitment to \nmaking foreign policy rescissions that are rationale and fair, and the \nHouse rescissions should be rejected in Conference.\n  From my perspective, attention to global population issues and \nsupport for world-wide development is critical to our future successes \nhere in the United States. Because I so strongly believe this, I joined \nwith Senator Simpson--and Congressman Beilenson and Congresswoman \nMorella--to introduce legislation called the ``International Population \nStabilization and Reproductive Health Care Act,'' S. 1096, in the 103rd \nCongress. Our bill, which we are revising for re-introduction in this \nCongress, would have focused U.S. \n[[Page S5364]] foreign policy on a coordinated strategy to help achieve \nworld population stabilization; encourage global economic development \nand self-determination; and improve the health and well-being of women \nand their children.\n  I believe these three objectives are inextricably tied to one \nanother. The way I see it, all U.S. efforts to help develop economies \nand promote democracy around the world will be futile if we do not \nfirst address the staggering rate of global population growth. How can \nwe expect under-developed countries to pull themselves up when the \nworld's population is growing at a rate of more than 10,000 people per \nhour? When the women and men who make up a nation's workforce pool do \nnot even have the right to plan their families? And when millions of \nwomen around the world do not have access to basic--and lifesaving--\nreproductive health care or educational opportunities?\n  Fortunately, national and international awareness of two fundamental \nconcepts is growing: (1) population, poverty, patterns of production \nand consumption, and the environment are so closely interconnected that \nnone can be considered in isolation; and (2) sustained economic growth, \nsustainable development and population are fundamentally dependent on \nadvances in the education, economic status and empowerment of women.\n  Tonight, we in the Senate are re-affirming these principles, and we \nare rejecting the House's attempt to drag U.S. foreign policy \nbackwards. I sincerely hope the Senate conferees carry this message \ninto Conference. I urge them not to waiver from the Senate's position \non this issue.\n                           amendment no. 445\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nthe amendment proposed by the minority leader that would restore \nfunding for several important programs that address the needs of our \nNation's children.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are debating here today, H.R. 1158, would \nrescind $13.4 billion in previously appropriated funds--including $600 \nmillion appropriated last year for Federal education programs.\n  Needless to say, I am vehemently opposed to taking this kind of giant \nleap backward. In my view, it would be unconscionable for Congress to \nreduce the Federal Government's share of public education funding which \nhas already fallen from 9.1 percent during the 1980-1981 school year to \n5.6 percent during the 1993-1994 school year.\n  It is vital to the interest of our Nation that we maintain quality \npublic education for everyone. Education is not just a private benefit \nbut a public good. It is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy and, as \na society, we all benefit from a well educated citizenry.\n  We are currently experiencing a new era in economic competition. All \nover the world, barriers to trade between nations are falling. We are \nwitnessing the development of a truly global marketplace. I believe \nthat America can lead the way in this marketplace. But if we are to \nsucceed, if we are to retain our competitiveness into the 21st century, \nthere must be a renewed commitment to education in this country.\n  Several international institutions recognized the increasing \nimportance of education just a few weeks ago at the United Nations \nsummit on social development when they urged developing nations to \ninvest in education rather than on defense.\n  In fact, for the first time in history, over 130 world leaders also \nagreed to a non-binding goal known as the 20-20 proposal which \nrecognizes that economic and social problems have global consequences \nby creating immigration problems, epidemics, markets too poor to buy \nexports, and economies too risky for investors.\n  This proposal encourages all donor nations and international \ninstitutions to earmark 20 percent of their foreign aid for basic \nsocial needs including education and health care. It also encourages \ndeveloping nations to allocate 20 percent of their expenditures to the \nsame underfinanced sectors.\n  Nonetheless, while leaders from around the world were recognizing the \nincreasing importance of education, Members of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives were busy passing H.R. 1158. If enacted, H.R. 1158 \nwould rescind $17 billion--including $1.7 billion in education funding \nfor our Nation's children and $2.3 billion in job training funding for \nour Nation's unemployed youth.\n  In fact, this legislation would also withdraw funding for all new \neducation initiatives--including the education infrastructure act which \nI introduced last April to help local school boards ensure the health \nand safety of their students.\n  Mr. President, I simply do not understand why some of my colleagues \nare so determined to slash funding for programs that increase economic, \nsocial, and educational opportunities for our Nation's children. \nAccording to the Children's Defense Fund, every day in America: 3 \nchildren die from child abuse; 15 children die from guns; 27 children \ndie from poverty; 95 children before their first birthday; 564 babies \nare born to women who had little or no prenatal care; 2,217 teenagers \ndrop out of school; 2,350 children are in adult jails; 100,000 children \nare homeless; and 135,000 children bring guns to school.\n  Although S. 617 would reduce our investment in our Nation's children \nby less than H.R. 1158, it still asks them to bear too much of the pain \ncreated by this effort to pay for emergency spending.\n  The Daschle amendment would improve the bill by restoring $1.3 \nbillion for some of the most important and successful education and job \ntraining programs in this country. More specifically, the Daschle \namendment would provide: $42 million for the Head Start Program which \nhas successfully given hundreds of thousands of pre-schoolers the \nchance to start school ready to learn; $100 million for the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools Program which is helping local school districts keep \ndrugs and guns out of our Nation's $72 million for the Chapter 1 \nProgram which has helped States and local school districts meet the \neducational needs of economically disadvantaged children for 30 years; \n$69.6 million for the goals 2000 program which is helping States create \ncoherent frameworks for education reform founded on the national \neducation goals; $30 million for the school-to-work program which helps \nStates and local school districts improve the educational and \nemployment opportunities of our Nation's high school students who do \nnot plan to attend college; $8.8 million for the immigrant education \nprogram which helps local school districts meet the educational needs \nof recently arrived immigrant children; $16.3 million for the impact \naid program which compensates local school districts for revenue losses \nincurred due to removal of Federal property from local tax rolls; $35 \nmillion for the WIC Program which provides important nutrition \nsupplements to 6.5 million women, infants, and children everyday--\nincluding more than 3 million children under 5; $100 million for the \nYouth Training Program which helps States prepare youth and young \nadults for high skill, high wage careers; and $210 million for the \nAmericorps Program which provides a $4,725 scholarship to individuals \nwho serve the educational, environmental, public safety, and human \nneeds of our communities.\n  By providing this needed and long overdue support, the Daschle \namendment will begin to address our failure to adequately engage \nresources in behalf of preparing our children for competition in the \nemerging global economy. It will help our children to succeed--to make \na living, to participate in the community, to enjoy the arts, and to \nunderstand the technology that has reshaped our workplace. This is in \nour children's interest; this is in our national interest.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks by urging my \ncolleagues to support these investments in our Nation's children by \nvoting for the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, while there are a number of features of the \nDaschle amendment which significantly improve this legislation, I would \nlike to draw particular attention to two provisions that reinstate \nfunding the original bill intended to rescind--$14.7 million for the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] and \n$100 million for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program--because it was \nmy intention prior to their inclusion in the Daschle \n[[Page S5365]] amendment to offer amendments to restore these funds and \nto offset the consequent additional costs by rescinding funds from \nprograms less vital to our Nation and its people.\n  SAMHSA funds both Substance Abuse Block Grants and the Children's \nMental Health Program. Substance Abuse Treatment Block Grants are the \nmost important vehicle of support for substance abuse treatment efforts \nin this country. Funding for these grants cannot be compromised if we \nare to succeed in our efforts to reform welfare, reduce crime, and \ncontain health care costs. The grants account for over one-third of the \nfunding for public substance abuse treatment nationwide.\n  The California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment, July 1994 \n[CALDATA], found that each day of substance abuse treatment pays for \nitself on the day it is received, primarily through reductions in \ncrime. The Rand Corporation reports that drug treatment is the most \ncost-effective form of drug intervention, compared with other potential \ndrug strategy program options, such as interdiction or imprisonment.\n  Mr. President, every $1 invested in drug treatment saves taxpayers $7 \ndollars. There are several sources for this figure, including CALDATA \nand the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n  The heavy toll drug use exacts on the United States is most easily \nmeasured by the criminal and medical costs imposed on and paid for by \nthe Nation's taxpaying citizens. One major study, conducted by Dorothy \nRice at the Institute for Health and Aging at the University of \nCalifornia at San Francisco, concluded that drug abuse costs taxpayers \n$67 billion, alcohol abuse costs $99 billion, for a total cost to the \nFederal Government of $166 billion per year. ``The impact of substance \nabuse and addiction on Federal entitlements is equivalent to more than \n40 percent of the Federal deficit for 1995,'' states Joe Califano, \nformer HEW Secretary and President of the Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University. Ninety-two percent of \nthe funds spent by health care entitlement programs as a result of \nsubstance abuse are used to pay for treatment of the consequences of \nsuch abuse; only 8 percent is spent to reduce dependency.\n  The costs to the Federal Government do not begin to account for the \nhigher costs substance abuse wreak on the private economy. Every man, \nwoman, and child in America pays nearly $1,000 annually to cover the \ncosts of unnecessary health care, extra law enforcement, auto \naccidents, crime, and lost productivity resulting from substance abuse, \naccording to a Brandeis University study.\n  The impact of substance abuse on crime is staggering. Substance abuse \nis linked to between one-quarter and one-third of all suicides, \naccording to the Public Health Service, and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, \nand Mental Health Administration. Substance abuse is linked to half of \nall homicides, rapes, spousal abuse, and traffic fatalities. Substance \nabuse is linked to two-thirds of all cases of manslaughter, drownings, \nburglaries, robberies, thefts, and assaults.\n  According to a study by the National Association of State Alcohol and \nDrug Abuse Directors [NASADAD], approximately 1 million people--40 \npercent of those in need--want and pursue substance abuse treatment at \nthis moment but do not get it: instead of helping them to help \nthemselves, the Government leaves them sitting on waiting lists across \nthe country.\n  These individuals--the vast majority of which are mothers, workers, \nor professionals--are willing and eager to improve their lives and the \nlives of those around them, but the government fails to extend a \nhelping hand. Not only taxpayers, but society at large, foots the bill \nfor this neglect.\n  SAMHSA also funds the Children's Mental Health Program, which \nprovides services for children with very serious emotional disturbances \n[SED]. This program is targeted at the 1 million children with SED--out \nof 7.5 million nationwide--who are in State-administered systems \nencompassing child welfare, juvenile justice, and special education \nprograms. This amendment restores $1.3 million to this program that the \nbill would have rescinded. This money goes to 22 service sites that \nwill not survive without the funds. The future of these children is at \nstake.\n  Even in the face of all these facts, Mr. President, the rescissions \nbill--prior to the Daschle amendment--would have taken a random, \nunexplained, unjustifiable slice out of the budget for SAMHSA.\n  At the same time, it would have taken $100 million out of the Safe \nand Drug Free Schools--Safe Schools--program.\n  Mr. President, on this subject, I would like to take a few moments to \ntalk about a reality that is very separate from the one in which my \ncolleagues and I live.\n  Someone who lives in this reality, Mr. President, wakes up worried \nthat today he could very well be killed. He realistically expects that \nsomeone he knows might be shot this week, or stabbed, or beaten. He \ngoes through his day fearing everyone who passes by, constantly alert \nfor trouble and danger, always keeping an eye on the nearest exit or \nhiding place. He might carry a weapon, purely for protection, and hide \nit on his person--a crude knife hidden in his sleeve, a length of pipe \ntucked into his boot, a makeshift handgun in his pocket, a box-cutter \ntaped to his stomach. One hand is probably always on this weapon, this \nsmall piece of security. If he makes it back to bed at the end of the \nday, he will be thankful, relieved, and certainly a little surprised.\n  This reality is not a war, and the people who inhabit this world are \nnot soldiers. This reality is only blocks away from this Chamber, and \nis mirrored in towns across our country. And the participants in this \nreality are not adults, they are children, they are as young as 5 and 6 \nyears old, and rarely over the age of 18. I am talking about the \nreality found in many elementary and secondary schools across the \nUnited States, where 150,000 students bring a gun every day; where \nshootings and stabbings are commonplace; where gangs are in control; \nand where 3 million violent crimes are committed each year. I am \ntalking about a national disgrace, a monumental embarrassment, a \nfailure on the part of all who care about the future of this country \nand the quality of life of our children.\n  I am talking about a state of events that we cannot tolerate, that we \ncannot allow to endure.\n  In the Steven Speilberg film ``Schindler's List,'' a Nazi soldier \nstands on the balcony of his home overlooking the busy center square of \na Jewish concentration camp. Calm and precise, he aims his powerful \nrifle at random Jews passing through the crowded streets below, and \neffortlessly pulls the trigger. His aim is never faulty, and he always \nsucceeds in ending a life. The people near the murder recoil in fright \nonly momentarily, then continue on their way, perhaps a little quicker, \nperhaps a little slower, thankful for the moment that the gun was not \ntrained on them, fearful that the next shot will terminate their \nexistence. The bullet has struck them, too, and changed them \npermanently, leaving them forever horrified, forever damaged, forever \nin shock.\n  This sequence is brutally painful for so many reasons. The only \nrelief I expected to feel when I watched this sequence was the lack of \nany connection between the events on the screen and present day reality \nin America. But such a connection is exactly what I felt. Violence in \nportions of our country has become so rampant and so deadly that almost \nall of us live in a collective state of fear and acceptance. Our cities \nand schools have become infested with random violence and bloodshed and \ncriminals with no conscience and no check on their destructive \nimpulses. And when this state of affairs has infected our Nation's \nschools, then we know that our children are going to be conditioned to \naccept this disease as normal. Not only are some of our children dying \nin our Nation's schools, but the ones who survive are learning that \nmurder and violence are simply a part of life--in fact, the most \nimportant part. Mr. President, we are permitting our Nation's youth to \ngrow up emotionally scarred, terminally frightened, and permanently \nembittered.\n  Mr. President, the Safe Schools Program is a necessity if this \nsystemic child abuse and neglect is to cease.\n  A study examining the effects of the first 2 years of funding for the \nSafe Schools Program showed increases in \n[[Page S5366]] the number of school districts with formal drug and \nviolence prevention programs in every State and territory in the United \nStates.\n  The same study also showed increases in school-community \ncollaboration on drug prevention issues in 50 States and territories; \nincreases in parent involvement in drug education efforts in 49 States \nand territories; increases in the degree of community involvement in \nprevention programs for youth in 46 States and territories; and \nincreases in the number of high-risk youth served in drug education \nprograms in 38 States and territories.\n  Prior to the Daschle amendment, the rescission would reduce or \neliminate violence and drug prevention programs serving approximately \n39 million students attending the schools operated by 94 percent of \nlocal educational agencies in the Nation.\n  Also at risk would be every state Governor's drug and violence \nprevention programs designed for youth not served by local educational \nagencies. So would be the development and distribution of publications \non school violence and drug/alcohol prevention, which have been the \ncornerstone of nationwide efforts to provide schools with information \non models and effective practices. The Parent's Guide on Drug \nPrevention alone has been requested by over 30 million persons.\n  The original rescission would have eliminated assistance and model \ndevelopment in the area of alternatives to expulsion. With expulsion \nrates increasing dramatically in several regions, it is essential to \nprovide leadership in this area, or more and more kids will go straight \nfrom the schoolhouse to the courthouse.\n  Consequently I commend the Democratic leader for his leadership and \nhis sensitivity to the importance of these issues. I appreciate the \nopportunity to work with him to gain the inclusion of these important \nprovisions in his amendment. And I am pleased that the ultimate goals \nof the amendments I intended to offer were realized. Since the House \nversion of the rescissions bill rescinded no funds from SAMHSA, fiscal \nyear 1995 funds for SAMHSA are now secure. I wish I could say the same \nabout Safe Schools funds. The House bill eliminated Safe Schools funds \naltogether. I urge the conferees to the rescissions bill to protect \nSafe School funds. We owe the children and the future of this Nation \nnothing less.\n                           amendment no. 448\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my \nwholehearted support for the Sense of the Senate resolution proposed as \nan amendment today by Senator Kennedy. As a member of the Finance \nCommittee, I offered an amendment to H.R. 831 that would have closed a \nloophole that allows wealthy citizens who renounce their American \ncitizenships to avoid U.S. taxes. My amendment would have dedicated all \nof the savings from closing this loophole to deficit reduction. \nAccording to estimates of the Joint Committee on Taxation, my amendment \nwould have reduced the deficit by approximately $3.6 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, although the Finance Committee adopted this amendment \non an undivided voice vote and the Senate approved it as part of H.R. \n831, the joint House-Senate conference committee re-opened this \nloophole. Senator Kennedy's resolution simply expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that in the interest of tax equity and in the face of on-\ngoing Federal deficits, we must close this loophole.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I proposed was fundamentally about \nfairness. Not only is it fair to those who enjoyed the benefits of U.S. \ncitizenship to make billions and are now attempting to avoid paying tax \non such gain, it is also fair to those Americans who stay behind to \nshoulder the burdens of citizenship. All my amendment would have done \nis treat those who renounce their citizenship on par with Americans who \nstay and pay their share of the tax burden.\n  While U.S. citizenship confers tremendous benefit, it also requires \nresponsibility. Although we may not always be happy about the amount, \nmost of us willingly pay our fair share of the tax burden. However, for \nmany Americans it becomes just too much when they have to pay not only \ntheir share of taxes, but also an additional share for those few, \nwealthy individuals who made their money in this country, but are now \ntrying to skip town without paying their portion of the tab.\n  Significantly, my amendment would have excluded pension income, real \nestate assets, and the first $600,000 in gain. As a result, of the \nroughly 850 U.S. citizens who renounced their citizenships in 1994, \nonly a handful would be affected by the closing of this loophole. In \nfact, representatives from the Treasury Department testified that the \namendment would have affected only 24 Americans each year.\n  Mr. President, significant deficit reduction will be necessary to put \nour country back on the right track. However, until we close these \nspecial-interest tax loopholes for the few, we cannot ask for the \nshared sacrifice from the many that will be necessary to reduce the \ndeficit. Therefore, I urge all of our colleagues to support the Kennedy \nsense of the Senate amendment.\n                  amendment no. 470--renewable energy\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the rescissions bill we are discussing \ntoday, H.R. 1158, cuts $35 million from the Department of Energy's \nsolar, wind and renewables research and development budget. The \namendment I offer today will limit to $25 million the amount to be \nrescinded from this account, thereby protecting vital renewable energy \nprograms. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator \nWellstone, Senator Chafee, Senator Daschle, Senator Roth, Senator \nCampbell, Senator Harkin, Senator Leahy, Senator Kerry, Senator Pell, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, and Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about creating jobs, reducing our \nforeign debt, reducing our reliance on imported oil, making American \nbusiness more competitive, maintaining our commitment to these small \nenergy companies and continuing on the path of developing clean, cheap, \nefficient energy.\n  Mr. President, we are proposing to restore $10 million to the \nDepartment of Energy's solar, wind and renewables R budget. This \nmoney is primarily used for research, joint ventures with small U.S. \ncompanies, market development and commercialization. Federal support \nfor renewable energy research and development has been a major success \nstory. Costs have declined, reliability has improved and a domestic \nindustry has been born. More work still needs to be done in basic \nresearch at our national labs and applied development to bring down \ncosts and work with industry.\n  The $10 million we restore to renewables will come from the $1 \nbillion Army Corps of Engineer's construction account.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote for clean domestic \nenergy, domestic jobs, reduced trade deficit and a stronger economy. I \nwould like to thank the managers of this bill for their support.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just want to express my appreciation \nto the Senators from Oregon, West Virginia, New Mexico, and Louisiana \nfor their help in allowing this amendment to go forward. The amendment \ndecreases the recission from renewable energy research and development \nby $10 million, paying for it by increasing the recission for the Army \nCorps' general construction activities by the same amount.\n  This amendment reflects the growing recognition that funding for \nresearch and development of renewable energy technologies is money \nwell-spent. The recission provided in the Committee Substitute was just \ntoo high.\n  There is a nationwide movement toward funding only R that is going \nto lead to commercially viable, economically realistic technology in \nthe relatively short-term. Renewable energy R fits that description. \nRenewable energy R has been and continues to be a major success \nstory. Costs have declined, reliability has improved, and a domestic \nindustry has been born. While the United States is currently the world \nleader in renewable energy technologies, other nations are investing \nheavily in this area. Given that many utilities are averse to investing \nin new technologies, the continued strength of DOE's programs is \nnecessary to protect our position in the world market.\n  [[Page S5367]] The American people agree that renewable energy R \nought to be a priority for Federal R funding. According to a December \n1994 survey by RSM Inc., when asked what energy source should be \nhighest priority for R spending, Americans overwhelmingly supported \nrenewables. The top finisher was renewable energy, receiving 42 percent \nof the vote.\n  Again, I appreciate the help of my colleagues in making acceptance of \nthis amendment possible. It is time that our federal energy R dollars \nreflect the public's funding priorities.\n                           Amendment No. 490\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Feingold, and Senator Simon.\n  The amendment will insure continued funding for the National Center \nfor Research in Vocational Education. The Center is a consortium of \ninstitutions of higher education in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, \nNew York, and Virginia. The Center is widely recognized for the \nimportant research work it does in vocational education, and it would \nbe very unfortunate, indeed, if funding to permit it to continue its \nwork were curtailed.\n  As my colleagues know, we will soon be considering reauthorization of \nthe Vocational Education Act. The work of the Center has provided the \nauthorizing committee invaluable information to help guide and \nfacilitate our work. But even more critical, their research efforts are \nvital to improving the quality of vocational education throughout our \nNation.\n  I view the amendment as an important placeholder so that when the \nSenate and House conferees meet on this legislation, they will have the \nopportunity to give this matter full and complete consideration. I am \nvery hopeful they will ultimately decide to retain funding for the \nCenter, but without this amendment there will be no chance whatsoever \nto provide continued funding for the Center and the important work it \ndoes.\n            citizenship training and naturalization services\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I and my colleagues from California and \nIllinois, Senators Feinstein and Moseley-Braun, had intended to offer \nan amendment restoring $6 million dollars for citizenship training and \nnaturalization services that had been rescinded in the Senate, but not \nin the House.\n  Although naturalization has been identified as a priority by the \nadministration in its immigration policy, naturalization services have \nbeen chronically underfunded and naturalization backlogs begin to grow. \nIt is my believe--and I belief that of my colleagues--that these funds \nare essential to the important goal of providing those who want to \nnaturalize with an opportunity to do so. Admittedly, $6 million dollars \nis a small amount of money, but the program rescinded in the Senate is \ncrucial to the continued health of those providing citizenship \ntraining.\n  In discussing my intention with the Honorable Chairman of the Labor/\nHHS Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Specter, I was impressed with \nhis willingness to attempt to resolve this problem in conference with \nthe House of Representatives, which, as I mentioned before, did not \nrescind the $6 million in citizenship training money. I would like to \nask the Honorable Chairman if it is in fact his desire to take a second \nlook at the $6 million citizenship money in conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Illinois. The committee's \nintent, in recommending this rescission, was to revisit funding once \nauthorizing legislation has been enacted through the regular process of \nJudiciary Committee consideration. There is some concern that adding \nthis responsibility to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services could increase pressure on \nalready underfunded domestic resettlement activities, as opposed to \nplacing responsibility under the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. I believe this is an issue the authorizing committees need to \naddress. Nevertheless, it is indeed my intention to resolve this matter \nin conference to the satisfaction of all those who--like myself--value \nlegal immigration and recognize the importance to our immigration \npolicies of an effective naturalization process. I look forward to \nworking with the distinguished Senate Appropriations Committee \nChairman, Mr. Hatfield; my counterpart in the House, Congressman \nPorter, chairman of the House Labor/HHS Appropriations Subcommittee; \nand the other conferees to address this issue, and I thank Senator \nSimon, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Moseley-Braun for their attention \nto this important matter.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. His concern for \nissues of legal immigration and naturalization has long been \nrecognized, and I am gratified that he will undertake to review \nseriously, and hopefully restore, the $6 million Senate rescission with \nour colleagues in the House.\n                        The Mildgas Process Unit\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this amendment has a simple \npurpose--to restore $4.8 million in fiscal year 1995 fossil energy \nresearch and development funds to help complete a small coal technology \ntesting facility, the Mildgas Process Unit.\n  I am joined in this amendment by my distinguished senior Illinois \ncolleague, my good friend, Senator Simon.\n  The Mildgas Process Unit is a facility that will test a technology \nknown as mild gasification, a process where lower-grade domestic coals \nare heated at moderate temperatures and pressures to produce a variety \nof gaseous fuels, liquid hydrocarbons, and a solid product known as \nchar.\n  Char, the primary product of the Mildgas facility, can be briquetted \ninto form coke, creating a new alternative to conventional coke now \nused by American steel firms and foundries. This is particularly \nimportant because the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 imposed strong \nrestrictions on the emissions from coke ovens.\n  Those are two major reasons why my amendment is important, Mr. \nPresident. For a modest investment today, the Mildgas experiment \npromises hundreds of millions of dollars in new uses tomorrow for \nIllinois Basin and Appalachian high-sulfur coals. And those new uses \nsolve a significant economic and environmental problem of our Nation's \niron and steel industries.\n  However, I am concerned that the decision to cut funds for the \nMildgas Process Unit has been based principally on deficit reduction, \nand on a belief that this technology is unwanted and unneeded.\n  This year, overall Federal spending will be in excess of $1\\1/2\\ \ntrillion, and it will take $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction to \nachieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. Laid along figures of that \nsize, the $4.8 million we seek for the Mildgas project may seem to be a \nsmall matter.\n  That is not to say that its relatively small size should not immunize \nthe Mildgas project from review. After all, to paraphrase a famous \nIllinoisan who preceded me in the Senate, the Senate Republican leader \nof his day, Everett Dirksen, ``A few dollars here, a few dollars there, \nand pretty soon you're talking about serious money.'' What that means, \nit seems to me, is that nothing can be off limits--not small items, not \nlarge items, not any item.\n  I therefore agree that review of Federal support for mild \ngasification technology demonstrations is both necessary and \nappropriate. It is because my own review of the facts convinces\n me that going forward is the right decision, the prudent decision, and \nthe right budgetary decision, that I am offering this amendment to \nrestore funding toward completing the Mildgas project.\n\n  It is worth noting, in this era of concern about earmarks and pork-\nbarrel spending, that this project did not originate with the Congress. \nThe Department of Energy originally selected this project in 1991 in a \ncompetitive solicitation. The Mildgas project had to compete with a \nnumber of other proposals.\n  In the years since the Mildgas project won that competition, over \n$7.5 million has been provided by Congress--half of the Federal share. \nThe State of Illinois has funding that amounts to 20 percent of the \ntotal cost. A team of participants, which includes Kerr McGee Coal \nCorp., Southern Illinois University, and the Institute of Gas \nTechnology in Chicago, has broken ground at the Coal Development Park \nin Carterville, IL, in preparation to test this technology.\n  [[Page S5368]] The contracts are now in place to turn this \ndemonstration into reality. Construction of the facility will end late \n1995, followed by 1 year of testing, after which the project will be \nshut down.\n  I am well aware that there are several similar projects currently \nbeing funded by the Department of Energy. But, success cannot be \ndefined as simply demonstrating one example of a broad class of mild \ngasification technologies. The spectrum of mild gasification techniques \nis quite broad. There are different types of coals used, products \nproduced, and markets served.\n  That is why the Mildgas process unit is important. It does not \nreinvent the wheel. It does not duplicate other mild gasification \ntechnologies. It is unique.\n  Mildgas can use many types of coals. The Encoal clean coal \ndemonstration project in Wyoming, a project often compared to Mildgas, \nutilizes only Western coal. Mildgas technology makes use of Illinois, \nWyoming, and West Virginia coals.\n  And although Encoal's primary product is a value-added fuel, its \nmarket is still only a boiler fuel. Mildgas's product, char, creates an \nentirely new market for high-sulfur and lower-grade coals, and solves \nan environmental problem for the Nation's steel industry. And as aging \ncoke ovens are shut down and not replaced, Mildgas can provide American \nsteel industries with a domestically produced alternative to importing \ncoke from the same countries that are our steel-making competitors.\n  Encoal and the other mild gasification technologies have been, and I \nhope will continue to be, successful, but their success will not \naddress the Illinois Basin and Appalachian coals that Mildgas will use, \nnor meet the environmental needs of the steel industry like Mildgas \nwill.\n  Mr. President, the Mildgas Process Unit is based upon years of \ndetailed planning, investment, and careful research by industry and \nscientists in close cooperation with the Department of Energy. It \ndeserves to continue.\n  Mildgas does not break the bank. For a minor investment today, \nMildgas can open hundreds of millions of dollars in markets tomorrow.\n  Mildgas can help the coal industry, by exploring a way to shift high-\nsulfur coals from markets reduced by the Clean Air Act, to markets \nopened.\n  And, Mildgas is unique. Mildgas uses coals, produces products, and \nserves markets that other mild gasification technologies simply do not. \nI think it is worth investing a few more years to complete this \nexperiment.\n  I strongly urge my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, to give every consideration in conference to providing the \nnecessary funds to complete the Mildgas Process Unit.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Illinois for her comments \nregarding the mild gasification facility planned for southern Illinois. \nAs I am sure the Senator knows, given the budget constraints that the \ncommittee was forced to confront, we were simply unable to include the \nfunds needed to initiate construction of the Mildgas Process Unit. I \ncan assure the distinguished Senator, however, that I will give \nappropriate consideration to this project within the budget limitations \nthat we will continue to face in conference.\n                  federal emergency management agency\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise at this time to voice my concerns \nwith apparent inconsistencies in the administration of disaster \nrecommendations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA].\n  As my colleagues well know, H.R. 1158, the fiscal year 1995 Disaster \nSupplemental/Rescissions Bill, contains $1.9 billion for outstanding \nexpenses accrued from previous disasters in 39 States, including recent \nflooding in Southern California.\n  I am sure all of us have seen news footage of the raging winter \nstorms that have wreaked havoc across virtually the entire State of \nCalifornia. The devastation families have endured is terrible. As a \nresult, the President--acting on recommendations made by FEMA--declared \nmany California counties disaster areas. This includes Ventura County, \nwhich is located along the Southern California coast north of Los \nAngeles.\n  There is one particular area of Ventura County I would like to call \nto the attention of my colleagues. Homes located on a hillside in La \nConchita, CA recently sustained considerable damage. Because of the \nPresident's declaration, private and public property damaged by the \ndisaster is eligible for four different kinds of FEMA assistance. These \nhomeowners rightfully have the hope of relief.\n  My concern is not with the fact that relief is being made available \nto those affected by the La Conchita mudslide. Rather, I am concerned \nwith what I believe could very well be an inconsistent approach to \ndisaster recommendations made by FEMA.\n  Permit me to explain. Mr. President, geologists have known for \nseveral decades that the La Conchita hillside has been moving for \n23,000 years. In other words, La Conchita was a potential disaster \nwaiting to happen. Thus, FEMA is making relief available in response to \na disaster resulting from a preexisting condition. This is a policy \nvastly different from one FEMA applied last July.\n  I see my colleague, the chairman of Appropriations Committee, is now \non the floor. I ask the Senator if he is familiar with a similar \nsituation that occurred in Lead, SD.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. No, I am not familiar with the situation. Could the \nSenator from South Dakota please explain.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator from Oregon for inquiring.\n  Last May, a slow moving landslide damaged homes, businesses, and \ninfrastructure. This landslide was exacerbated by excessive \nprecipitation. Despite a request by the governor of South Dakota and \nthe urging of the State's Congressional delegation, FEMA recommended \nthat the President deny South Dakota's relief request for the Lead \nlandslide. According to FEMA, the landslide resulted from a preexisting \ncondition and did not pose ``an immediate threat to public health, \nsafety, and improved property.''\n  The Lead landslide forced the community's only grocery store, \npharmacy, and discount store to close. Some of the stores\n were forced to relocate to the community hall and church basement.\n\n  Clearly, the people of Lead suffered a great deal. This isolated \ncommunity has yet to reopen the only grocery store in the area. \nAlthough the Economic Development Administration has offered a grant to \nhelp mitigate the slide, the city will have to sacrifice vital repairs \nto streets, gas lines, and water lines.\n  By contrast, the residents of the La Conchita hillside in Ventura \nCounty will have access to expedited FEMA assistance. This lack of \nconsistency concerns me.\n  I would like to verify with the Senator from Oregon that monies \nprovided in H.R. 1158 will be used, in part, to assist the victims of \nthis winter's storms in California. Is this correct?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator from South Dakota is correct. The bill, in \nits current form, provides $1.9 billion to FEMA for disaster relief \nfunctions including expenses resulting from disasters in 39 States. \nReport language accompanying this bill acknowledges that these funds \nmay be used to ensure unforeseen expenses associated with the recent \ndisaster in California resulting from winter storms.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I also understand my concerns regarding the consistency \nof disaster declarations are shared by others. As Chairman of the \nCommittee, I am sure the Senator from Oregon is very familiar with \nquestions regarding disaster declaration criteria. Does the Senator \nfrom Oregon agree this is a common concern?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, I do agree with the senior Senator from South \nDakota. As he well knows, the General Accounting Office, the \nCongressional Research Service, and the Congressional Budget Office \nrecently released a comprehensive study of the entire relief process.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will the distinguished Senator from Oregon agree that \nit is imperative that FEMA apply its declaration criteria consistently, \nregardless of where the disaster is taking place?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I could not agree more with my friend from South \nDakota. Consistency in the disaster declaration process should be a \nreasonable expectation of all Americans.\n  [[Page S5369]] Mr. PRESSLER. I think it is clear, Mr. President, that \nFEMA needs to take a close look at its current declaration policies.\n  The similarities surrounding the landslides in Lead and Ventura \nCounty are striking. For the residents of Ventura County, FEMA's \nresponse is reassuring. For the people of Lead, the response from FEMA \nis disconcerting. I must stress a point I have made on this very floor \nin the past: Disasters occurring in isolated rural areas do not seem to \ncapture the attention of the national media, Federal agencies, or the \nPresident. Lead, SD, does not compare to Southern California glamour, \nand it\n certainly is not near a major media outlet.\n\n  However, as we all know, the size of a community or its media outlets \nshould not dictate whether or not Federal relief is granted or how fast \nthe assistance gets to those in need.\n  I believe the time has come for FEMA take a close look at its \npolicies. In the meantime, I have asked GAO to examine FEMA's \nresponsiveness to urban and rural disasters. I hope Congress will be \nable to maintain an oversight role. If there is an inconsistency we \nshould not hesitate to consider legislation to ensure emergency \nassistance is provided consistently and judiciously.\n  In fact, I believe it would be appropriate for the conferees of this \nbill to include language in the accompanying report to direct FEMA to \nreport to Congress on how it found that disaster assistance could be \nprovided in response to the identified preexisting condition in Ventura \nCounty, but came to a different conclusion with the preexisting \ncondition in Lead. I believe this instruction is an appropriate first \nstep in what I hope will be a comprehensive review by FEMA of its \ncurrent declaration policies and criteria.\n  Would the distinguished chairman of the committee agree that this \nreview is necessary?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I agree with the Senator from South Dakota that a \nreview of the disaster declaration process may be appropriate. His \nconcerns have merit. The people of Lead, SD, deserve to be assured that \nthey are being treated fairly by the federal government. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota is to be commended for his diligent attention to the \nneeds of his constituents. The Senator can be assured I will deliver \nthis message to the conferees and will do my best to include a \ndirective to FEMA regarding its declaration policies and criteria in \nthe conference report to this bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my good friend the Senator from Oregon and \nthank him for his leadership. I yield the floor.\n\n\n            health care financing research and demo projects\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the situation with \nrespect to funding of research and demonstration projects by the Health \nCare Financing Administration. The Senate recommendation calls for a \nrescission of $11 million, which would reduce fiscal year \nappropriations to $45.1 million for research and demonstration \nprojects. This is an increase of nearly $2 million over the amount \nneeded to fund continuations of on-going activities, so that even if \nthe entire Senate rescission is enacted into law, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration should be able to fund about $2 million of new \nprojects. I would ask Senator Specter, the chairman of the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, is that his \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, based on information supplied to me by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, there would still be about $2 \nmillion available for new research and demonstration projects by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, even after the Senate recommended \nrescission.\n                         essential air service\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a section in \nchapter IX of this legislation that in my view could have an adverse \nimpact on the future of the Essential Air Service (EAS) Program. \nSpecifically, I am very concerned about the language affecting \n``Payments to Air Carriers,'' otherwise referred to as EAS subsidies.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee on \nthe floor. Would the chairman be willing to enter into a short colloquy \non this issue and explain the intent of this section of the bill?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Certainly. I understand the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has always supported \nEAS. Therefore, I would be pleased to explain the intent of these \nprovisions and answer any questions posed by the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my friend from Oregon. First, I understand this \nlegislation would rescind $5.3 million in ``Payments to Air Carriers.'' \nWhat is the impact of this rescission?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. This rescission should have no real impact on the \nprogram. The Appropriations Committee was informed sufficient funding \nwould remain available to continue the EAS program through the end of \nthis fiscal year. In other words, all communities currently provided \nair service with EAS assistance will continue to be served through this \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I understand about 79 cities rely on EAS to remain \nlinked to the national air transportation system. I am pleased the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee will continue to uphold our \ncommitment to these small communities.\n  Now, as my friend from Oregon knows, there are EAS agreements in at \nleast 13 States that will expire before September 30 of this year. The \ncommittee amendment to the bill before us includes a provision to \nprohibit the Secretary of the Department of Transportation [DOT] from \nentering into any new EAS agreements beyond September 30, 1995. I am \nconcerned about the purpose of this restriction. In my view, it implies \ncongressional support for EAS ends September 30, 1995--the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year. My support for EAS will not end on that date. \nWould the chairman explain the purpose of this specific provision?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. First, let me assure the Senator from South Dakota \nthis provision should not be read by any Member of Congress as an \nattempt to jeopardize future congressional support for EAS. This \nprovision applies only to fiscal year 1995. Further, as the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on\n Transportation, I intend to work with my friend from South Dakota on \nan appropriate level of EAS funding for Fiscal Year 1996.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am very pleased to know my friend from Oregon does \nnot view the provision in question as a threat to the future of EAS. \nHowever, I still have strong concerns about the language in this bill. \nSpecifically, I remain concerned the most economic continuation of EAS \nmay be hindered by this provision. Permit me to explain.\n  As my friend from Oregon knows, when an EAS agreement is about to \nexpire, current law requires the Department of Transportation to invite \nand consider competing proposals from any interested air carriers. The \nobjective of that policy is to maximize the carriers' incentives to be \nefficient, to control costs effectively and to develop demand in the \nEAS market. This process yields two primary benefits: subsidy burdens \nare minimized and service to the community is often enhanced. That \nprocess has served the EAS program very well.\n  As I mentioned, EAS agreements will expire in 13 states before \nSeptember 30th. Several already have expired. The practical reality of \nthe proposed restriction to limit contract commitments would result in \nvery short contracts at much higher costs in order to continue air \nservice to those 13 states for the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  I am concerned efficiencies will be jeopardized if the DOT is \nprohibited from entering into any agreements beyond September 30th. I \ndo not believe new carriers would seek to serve any of these 13 states \nfor such a limited time period. In turn, those EAS carriers serving the \n13 states will almost assuredly demand higher subsidies if they are \nheld into those markets through the end of the fiscal year.\n  Further, DOT already issues notification to carriers that subsidy \npayments under EAS agreements are subject to the availability of funds \nin future fiscal years. Therefore, EAS carriers already know their \nsubsidies are contingent on the annual approval of the Congress.\n  In my view, competition could be eliminated by this provision. In \nturn, \n[[Page S5370]] subsidy rates will go up. What is the view of the \nChairman?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. This language simply forces the EAS office to have EAS \ncontracts conform to the federal fiscal year. The office has had almost \ntwenty years to make this adjustment. When the Appropriations Committee \ntries to get data from this office it often does not comport to the \nfiscal year basis that the Committee must consider in its \ndeliberations.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. As the Chairman knows, I am prepared to offer an \namendment to strike all the language after the rescission provision. I \nam willing to modify my amendment to further ensure the future of EAS \nis not jeopardized. Would the Manager of the bill be willing to accept \nmy amendment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be happy to accept the Senator's amendment \nwhich would strike lines 1 through 3 on page 42. As he knows, the \nlanguage which was provided by the Department had the effect of totally \ncanceling the EAS program which was not the Committee's intent.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Chairman. I very much appreciate his \nsupport for EAS and his leadership on this overall legislation. I also \nthank him for his support of my amendment and urge its adoption.\n              colloquy on smithsonian institution funding\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when debate began on the House rescissions \nbill I intended to offer an amendment prohibiting the Smithsonian \nInstitution from using appropriated funds to develop, plan, or build \nany new museum before congressional authorization had been obtained.\n  After speaking with the distinguished chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, I chose to forgo proposing \nthe amendment. Senator Gorton assured me that the Smithsonian has no \nintention of beginning any new museum without first seeking the \nappropriate authorization from Congress.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Rules Committee, which is \nthe authorizing committee with jurisdiction over the Smithsonian, I \nhave seen the Smithsonian initiate a new project without congressional \nauthorization and then come to Congress to authorize the project \nbemoaning the waste of funds already spent should the project not be \nauthorized.\n  It is important to stress that any new project requesting taxpayer \nfunds, should first go to the committee that has authorizing authority \nand then, if and only if, the project has been authorized should the \nrequest go to the Appropriations Committee for funding.\n  The Smithsonian must not ignore this process.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina \nyield?\n  Mr. HELMS. I welcome comments from the able Senator from the State of \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the decision of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Helms, not to offer his amendment so we \ncan speed up debate on this important bill.\n  The issue that Senator Helms has brought to our attention is a \nserious one that deserves emphasis. I am confident through my \nconversations with the current Secretary of the Smithsonian, Mr. \nHeyman, that the Smithsonian intends properly to fulfill its \nobligations as steward of this public trust. Secretary Heyman agrees \nthat no Federal appropriation will be used for projects that have not \nyet been authorized by Congress.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield for a point of clarification?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield.\n  Mr. HELMS. Senator Gorton, I am not sure that all of our colleagues \nrealize that 72 percent of Smithsonian operating funds are public, \ntaxpayer funds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senator Helms is correct.\n  Therefore, it is important for the Smithsonian, like all other \nentities that receive taxpayer dollars, to take note of the budgetary \nconstraints under which we are working. It is a time for fiscal \nresponsibility and the careful allocation of increasingly scarce \nresources.\n  I have been assured in all conversations I have had with Secretary \nHeyman that he is aware of his institution's role and its attendant \nresponsibilities. The Secretary has underscored the importance of \nprioritizing projects during his tenure.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the distinguished subcommittee chairman yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly. I yield the floor to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I sincerely appreciate the work the Senator from \nWashington has done in this area. The Senate Rules Committee has yet to \nmeet with the current Secretary of the Smithsonian, Mr. Heyman, but I \nhave been assured we will soon be given that opportunity. I will \nwelcome that important hearing.\n NATIONAL BIOLOGICAL SURVEY'S GREAT LAKES SCIENCE CENTER IN ANN ARBOR, \n                                   MI\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and \nRelated Agencies in a brief discussion regarding the impact of S. 617 \non the National Biological Survey's Great Lakes Science Center in Ann \nArbor, MI. The committee's report accompanying S. 617 recommends \nrescinding $4.136 million less than was included in the House-passed \nrecission bill, H.R. 1158. That is almost exactly the amount \nappropriated in fiscal year 1995 to maintain operations at the Great \nLakes Science Center. If the Senate approves the committee's \nrecommended recissions from funds already appropriated for NBS \nresearch, will this center remain in business in fiscal year 1995?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. While there is not a correlation between the funding \nlevels rescinded by the House and by the Senate and the fiscal year \n1995 appropriations level necessary for keeping the Great Lakes Center \nopen, it is the committee's intent to provide sufficient funds for NBS \nresearch so that the Great Lakes Center and other NBS centers can \ncontinue to operate in fiscal year 1995.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if the subcommittee chairman would answer \nan additional question, I would like to know whether he will continue \nto support funding to keep the Great Lakes Center open in fiscal year \n1995, during the conference on S. 617 and H.R. 1158?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware that both of my colleagues from Michigan and \nfrom elsewhere in the Great Lakes region strongly support the work \nbeing done by the NBS Great Lakes Science Center. Hopefully, in \nconference, we can arrive at a compromise which will prevent cuts in \nthe NBS research budget that would close or hamper operations at NBS \ncenters and cooperative units.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Washington for his \nresponsiveness to our concerns. As he may know, the Great Lakes Center \nconducts fishery stock assessments that are relied upon by States, \ntribes, and Canada. And effective management of fish stocks in the \nGreat Lakes is important to the $4 billion fishing industry in the \nregion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would also like to thank my colleague from Washington \nfor his assistance in this matter. As my colleague from Michigan has \nindicated, the Great Lakes Center has important duties. Besides the \nfishery stock management element of its activities, the center conducts \ninvaluable scientific research on preventing, controlling and \nmitigating the impacts on nonindigenous species, such as the zebra \nmussel. And, the center is conducting essential studies on the sources \nand health effects of toxics in the Great Lakes ecosystem.\n                                  wic\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am very worried that the House Republican welfare reform \nbill ultimately could throw millions of pregnant women, infants and \nchildren off the WIC program [the Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants and Children].\n  That part of the Contract with America guts strong competitive \nbidding requirements which have put millions of pregnant women, infants \nand children on the WIC program at no cost to taxpayers in recent \nyears.\n  These are provisions which I and my Senate colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle included in child nutrition legislation in 1987 and in \n1989 and which the Senate Appropriations Committee mandated in 1988 \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  I am concerned that this victory is eliminated by the House bill.\n  These efforts on the House side raise serious concerns about why \nHouse \n[[Page S5371]] members want to provide millions of dollars to the four \nhuge corporations that manufacture infant formula.\n  The details of this tragedy are set forth in articles in the Wall \nStreet Journal ``Four Drug Firms Could Gain $1 Billion Under GOP \nNutrition-Program Revision,'' Hilary Stout, February 28, 1995; the New \nYork Times ``Formula for Tragedy,'' Bob Herbert Op Ed, March 25, 1995; \nand the Washington Post ``Food Program Defender Becomes a Dismantler,'' \nDavid Maraniss and Michael Weisskopf, April 4, 1995.\n  WIC serves children at some of the most critical times of their \nlives. It feeds mothers when they are pregnant or breastfeeding. And it \nfeeds children during their important, early development years.\n  WIC is a proven success story. A 1991 USDA study showed that for \nevery WIC dollar spent on a pregnant woman, between $2.98 and $4.75 was \nsaved in Medicaid costs for the newborn during the first 60 days after \nbirth.\n  Thus competitive bidding saves taxpayers doubly--first, it puts 1.5 \nmillion more eligible women, infants and children on the program at no \ncosts to taxpayers, and it saves millions in Medicaid and other Federal \ncosts, in addition to saving millions of dollars in family, local and \nState medical costs.\n  The details of this system are easy to explain. At retail stores, WIC \nparticipants exchange special vouchers for infant formula. The \nrecipients pay nothing; the State reimburses the store for the full \nretail cost of the formula. The infant formula manufacturers then \nrebate a portion of the retail price to the State. The States are \nrequired to use the rebates to serve more persons who are eligible for \nWIC.\n  Under current law States are required to use competitive bidding, \nwith certain exceptions, to buy infant formula for the WIC program. \nUSDA has calculated that this provision now saves $1.1 billion a year \nand thus puts 1.5 million more women, infants and children on WIC at no \nextra cost to taxpayers.\n  That provision is eliminated by the Contract with America. That \nContract should be renamed the ``Contract to Increase Profits of Drug \nCompanies.''\n  That part of the Contract is a sham. It contains an extremely weak \ncost containment provision which will allow infant formula \nmanufacturers to make a killing off the WIC program while allowing them \nto pretend to help WIC.\n  It will let drug giants donate small amounts of formula to State WIC \nprograms, in front of their cameras, while making hundreds of millions \nof dollars in increased profits.\n  How have they been able to get this done in this Republican Congress? \nThe Washington Post article that I referred to earlier, ``Food Program \nDefender Becomes a Dismantler,'' explains the influence of large \ncorporations on the House. A short history lesson is in order.\n  Some years ago these drug giants hired the former Republican Ranking \nMember of the House Agriculture Committee and a former Republican \nAssistant Secretary of USDA who was in charge of WIC to fight \ncompetitive bidding at the State level.\n  Unfortunately, actions of the infant formula and infant cereals \nmanufacturers have made such mandatory competitive bidding language \nnecessary and\n demonstrate why the House bill will be an invitation to drug companies \nand cereal companies to siphon millions out of WIC.\n\n  As reported in Senate Hearing 101-979 (``Competitive Issues in Infant \nFormula Pricing,'' May 29, 1990) efforts were made by two major \nmanufacturers Ross Laboratories--a division of Abbott Laboratories--and \nMead-Johnson--a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb--to prevent individual \nStates from using competitive bidding procedures. In 1985 three \nStates--Tennessee, Oregon and South Carolina--announced plans to \ninstitute a competitive bidding system for the purchase of infant \nformula for WIC.\n  A group called the Infant Formula Council, an association of formula \nmanufacturers, immediately opposed these cost containment ideas. The \nIFC sent letters to USDA and State officials opposing the plans and \ntestified against this approach.\n  The Council retained a Washington law firm to raise legal concerns \nwith such attempts by States to buy formula more cheaply. The IFC \nargued that State efforts to buy formula through competitive bidding \nwould disrupt commercial channels of distribution of infant formula.\n  Tennessee went ahead anyway and set a deadline for bids from the \ncompanies to supply formula to WIC participants. However, not a single \ncompany submitted a bid.\n  That is why I, and many of my Senate colleagues, are very worried. \nUnder the House Republican bill any State could fall prey to these same \npractices today as already discussed in the April 4, 1995, Washington \nPost article.\n  The former ranking Republican member of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, Congressman Wampler, was hired to oppose these State \nvoluntary efforts to use competitive bidding. Congressman Wampler was \none of several well connected lobbyists hired by Mead Johnson and Ross \nLaboratories to persuade USDA either directly, or indirectly through \nCongressional intervention, to prevent States from moving ahead with \nplans to institute competitive bidding. Senate Hearing 101-979.\n  Mead-Johnson also hired the former Republican Assistant Secretary, \nMary Jarrett, to help make sure that States did not use competitive \nbidding.\n  The new plan of attack by the companies was to only offer paltry cost \ncontainment deals to States. This would include giving States some free \nformula, or modest cash rebates, or free coupons instead of \nparticipating in competitive bidding.\n  I am very worried that smaller States such as my home State of \nVermont could be easily victimized by the drug companies under the \nHouse bill.\n  The lawyers hired by the formula manufacturers then raised legal \nobjections at the State and Federal level to competitive bidding. They \nalso tried to convince States not to use competitive bidding but to \ninstead offer States formula at discounted prices under a system then \ncalled open bidding which is fully described in that report.\n  A full description of the efforts of Republican lobbyists and the \ndrug companies to promote cost containment instead of competitive \nbidding is detailed in Joint Hearing Report 102-135--Pricing and \nPromotion of Infant Formula, March 14, 1991.\n  Also, on Mach 6, 1990, Mead-Johnson sent letters to the other formula \nmanufacturers advising them that Mead would only provide a 75 cent \nrebate for each can of formula purchased through WIC. Ross Laboratories \nand Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories--a division of American Home Products \nCorporation--followed suit and put in much lower rebate bids at or \naround 75 cents.\n  During the next 8 months, Mead submitted 75 cent rebate bids to 12 \ndifferent States. In several States, Ross and Wyeth followed Mead's \nlead. Ross bid 75 cents 9 times, and 75.7 cents once.\n  When one company bids a rebate of $0.75 and soon after another bids \n$0.757, as Mead and Ross did in Wisconsin and Montana in early 1990, it \ndoes not take a genius to see how this could frustrate competitive \nbidding.\n  A very unusual development also took place which tipped off Federal \ninvestigators with the Federal Trade Commission. The same companies \noffered a better bid under what was called an open market system--\nwhereby all companies matching a discounted price could sell formula to \nWIC in that State.\n  This higher rebate bid of $1.00 made no economic sense since the \ncompanies would have made more money off the exclusive competitive bid \nof 75 cents\n rather than the open market bid. This apparently was done to \ndiscourage states from using competitive bidding since it signalled \nstates that the companies would bid $1.00 in an open market setting but \nonly around 75 cents for a competitive bidding system. The chronology \nof infant formula rebate bids for 1990 shows this point.\n\n  I asked the FTC to investigate allegations of price fixing and bid \nrigging in the WIC program and the efforts to discourage states from \nusing the best system for purchasing infant formula. The Federal Trade \nCommission found merit to the charges and filed actions against the \nthree companies. Also, several States filed actions against formula \ncompanies for anti-trade activities which have been well detailed in \nthe press.\n   [[Page S5372]] In June, 1992, the Federal Trade Commission found \nthat three pharmaceutical companies tried to fix prices of infant \nformula they supply to the WIC program.\n  The FTC also concluded that competition was reduced because Mead \nJohnson announced in advance the amounts to be submitted in sealed bids \nto provide formula to the WIC program. Also, it was alleged by the FTC \nthat Mead Johnson sought to limit advertising to the public and \nprovided information to competitors signalling bidding preferences.\n  Two of the drug companies consented to having a Federal court issue \nrelief against them. The companies--Mead Johnson and American Home \nProducts--were ordered to provide formula to the WIC program free of \ncharge as partial restitution.\n  The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities analyzed the harm to \nStates from the advance price signaling in 1990. It concluded that \nafter the Mead-Johnson letter announcing what it would bid in the \nfuture that States were harmed by over $14 million by increases in \nannual infant formula costs including the following: Indiana, $3.7 \nmillion cost increase; Minnesota, $1,811,000 increase; Mississippi, \n$1.7 million increase; Oklahoma, $1.4 million increase; Kentucky, \n$868,000 increase; Oregon, $867,000 increase; Colorado, $820,000 \nincrease; West Virginia, $650,000 increase; Iowa, $539,000 increase; \nand Montana, with a $324,000 cost increase.\n  I am very worried, as are many of my Senate colleagues, that allowing \nthese companies the opportunity to take more than one million \nparticipants off the program so the drug companies can make more \nprofits is outrageous. The fact that the House cut $25 million out of \nthe WIC budget for fiscal year 1995 also raises some concern. We will \nwork to see that no one is taken off the WIC rolls in fiscal year 1995 \nbecause of funding limitations.\n  Senator Bumpers also took the lead in supporting and defending these \ncompetitive bidding requirements. What are the views of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas on this matter?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am also worried and concerned about the provisions in \nthe House bill that eliminate the current WIC competitive bidding \nrequirements. I have supported these efforts right from the beginning \nand will strongly oppose efforts to eliminate competitive bidding.\n  I share Senator Leahy's concern that the new plan of attack by the \ncompanies will be to only offer paltry cost containment deals to \nStates. This would include giving States some free formula, or modest \ncash rebates, or free coupons instead of participating in competitive \nbidding. This could mean that millions of infants, women and children \nwould be forced off WIC.\n  Senator Pryor has been a leader regarding child nutrition programs \nand I would like his views on this issue.\n  Mr. PRYOR. As I said at an Agriculture Committee hearing, I am also \nvery troubled by the House efforts to cut child nutrition programs. The \nworst aspect of their bill relates to efforts to give these drug \ncompanies the opportunity to increase their profits at a high cost to \npoor pregnant women and children.\n  The Senate reports show the efforts drug companies have exerted over \nthe years to sell formula at a high cost to WIC. Since WIC is 100 \npercent federally funded, the Federal Government should insist that it \nget the best return on each dollar spent.\n  Competitive bidding, which is used by the Federal Government for much \nof its procurement, should be required as under current law. Clever \nefforts to hide profiteering under the cloak of weakened, so-called \ncost-containment measures, will hurt the WIC program in my State, and \nthroughout the Nation. I know the drug companies may already be \ncelebrating, but the Senate took the lead in the past in standing up to \nthese corporate interests. I believe that despite all the money spent \nby the drug companies to influence opinion, the Senate will do the \nright thing.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I fully agree with the views expressed by my fellow \nDemocratic colleagues. We cannot give the WIC program to the drug \ncompanies and allow them to turn WIC into a formula for profit.\n  WIC is one of America's most effective child nutrition programs and I \nintend to fight any efforts of the House to repeal the WIC program. \nSenator Harkin led the fight against the practices of one infant \nformula company that sold powdered formula to third-world countries. \nLow-income families would mix the formula with contaminated water and \nthe formula would do more harm than good. I ask Senator Harkin what are \nhis views on competitive bidding?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was very proud of my role in leading the fight against \ncompanies that tried to push formula in the third-world. While I am a \nvery strong supporter of breastfeeding I recognize the formula does \nplay an important role in the WIC program.\n  I agree fully with the remarks that Senator Leahy has made about the \nimportance of competitive bidding for WIC infant formula, and the \ncomments of my colleagues on the subject, and I commend Senator Leahy \nfor his work on this issue as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry and now as ranking member.\n  To get the best deal for taxpayers I believe it is essential that we \nrequire that competitive bidding be used for WIC infant formula so that \nwe can ensure that the States are not subjected to the kinds of \npressure tactics to eliminate competitive bidding that have been so \nthoroughly documented. We owe it to taxpayers and to over a million and \na half additional people who are served each month with the savings \nfrom competitive bidding. I do not want this provision watered down so \nthat companies can increase their profit margins at the expense of WIC \nparticipants and taxpayers.\n  I have had a long involvement in the efforts to implement competitive \nbidding for WIC infant formula. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNutrition and Investigations, I worked to include the provision in the \n1987 Commodity Distribution Reform Act that allowed States to keep a \nportion of savings they achieved through competitive bidding in order \nto cover the increased administrative expenses of bringing additional \nparticipants into WIC.\n  Without that provision, the States could not have used the savings \nfrom WIC cost containment to serve more people in the WIC program. \nUnbelievably, the Republican Deputy Secretary of Agriculture wrote a \nletter to Chairman Leahy officially opposing that provision in the \nbill.\n  I also requested the study by the General Accounting Office that was \nissued in October of 1987 demonstrating the savings that could be \nachieved through competitive bidding for infant formula.\n  And in 1989, as Chairman of the Nutrition and Investigations \nSubcommittee, I introduced the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization \nAct of 1989, which included the provision requiring the use of \ncompetitive bidding or equally effective cost\n containment measures for WIC infant formula. Again, it was my \nprivilege to work with Senator Leahy, as Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, in getting this provision enacted into law.\n\n  The benefits of competitive bidding are simply too large to give up. \nThe national benefits have already been described. In Iowa, as of late \nlast year our State was gaining approximately $630,000 a month for its \nWIC program through infant formula rebates, which allows approximately \n12,000 additional Iowa women, infants and children to be served each \nmonth without increasing spending.\n  WIC is one of our Nation's most successful and cost-effective \nefforts. Competitive bidding makes WIC remarkably more cost-effective. \nWe hear a lot about the importance of letting States have more freedom \nin administering programs. WIC already involves a partnership between \nthe Federal Government and the States--it is already administered by \nthe States, but it is funded entirely with Federal money. This proposal \nto do away with the competitive bidding requirement stands the idea of \nState flexibility on its head. It basically says that if the States \nwant to squander federal taxpayer dollars by lining the pockets of the \ninfant formula companies, that is just fine, have at it.\n  All I can say is that we have made too much progress and there is far \ntoo much at stake for this Senator to stand by and watch a proven and \npractical tool like competitive bidding be thrown out the window for \nthe sake of \n[[Page S5373]] some half-baked, radical theory. Not without a fight, \nnot without a huge fight.\n  Finally, I am also concerned, as are my colleagues, about the \nramifications of the $35 million cut in WIC in this rescissions bill. \nThe Congress should be fully funding WIC as per the President's \nproposals and should be very cautious about cutting the funding \navailable for carrying out WIC efforts in the States. I too will work \nto see that no one is taken off the WIC rolls in fiscal year 1995 \nbecause of funding limitations.\n  I understand Senator Boxer also has concerns about the WIC program.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also am very concerned about the Contract With America \nand how it will seriously hurt the WIC program. I am very proud to \nsupport the WIC program, and it is important to ensure that the \ncompetitive bidding process stays in place so that the largest number \nof women and children possible can be effectively served by this \nenormously successful program.\n                              student aid\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, students on college campuses throughout \nVermont have mobilized against cuts in student aid. The strong \nopposition around the country to these cuts has prevented most student \naid programs from being included in the rescission bill we are debating \ntoday. The next step will be to make sure that students do not get \nshort-changed in next year's budget.\n  On Monday, I had the pleasure of meeting with 19 exceptional college \nstudents in my office in Burlington, Vermont. These students: John \nBoyle of Landmark College; Stephen O'Keefe and Sean Brown of Southern \nVermont College; Terri Taylor of Lyndon State College; Eric Sorenberger \nand Marlene Rye of Sterling College; Cecily Muller of Woodbury College; \nBeth McDermott of the University of Vermont; Alison Maling of Trinity \nCollege; Courtney Ryan of St. Michael's College; Kevin Canney of \nBurlington College; Sue Jean Murray of Champlain College; Theresa \nMorris of Vermont Technical College; John Wyrocki and Laura Whitney of \nGreen Mountain College; Jeff Albertson of Middlebury College; and \nDarryl Danaher, Ryan Carter and Matthew Thornton of Norwich University \nshared with me how cuts in student aid would affect them and other \nVermont students.\n  One student is the youngest of nine children and is holding two work \nstudy jobs. Another is a mother of two and on welfare. Her daughter \nalso is in college. Another is the third child in her family to go to \nschool. Her mother went back to school to get a better job to help pay \nher children's student loans. Another is the mother of four who had to \nleave an abusive marriage. She relies on work study to help her stay in \nschool. She also will have loans to pay for her daughter's education. \nAnother is returning to school after having to change her occupation \ndue to major back surgery.\n  I could go on and on about what these students are going through to \nearn their college degree.\n  These students are working hard to learn. Now, some Members of \nCongress would like to pull the rug out from under them by cutting \nstudent aid.\n  Earlier this week, the House Economic and Educational Opportunities \nChairman confirmed that Republicans are considering eliminating the in-\nschool interest subsidy on Stafford college loans.\n  If House Republicans are successful, 20,000 Vermont students will be \npaying more for college. Individual student debt will increase by 15 to \n50 percent, depending on the length of time spent in school. An \nundergraduate student who borrows the maximum amount for a four year \ncollege could owe an additional $3,407 in interest. This is an increase \nof about 20 percent, on top of debt that already is tough to manage.\n  There also has been talk about eliminating campus-based aid including \nSupplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Perkins loans, and the \nwork-study programs. Eliminating these need-based programs would cause \nhardship for students at 2-year and 4-year colleges throughout the \ncountry. A student who receives an aid package that includes average \nawards from all three programs would stand to lose $3,152.\n  Increasing the financial burden to students and their families will \ndiscourage many students from attending college or enrolling in \nvocational or graduate programs.\n  As we encourage people, both young and old, to pursue higher \neducation, we need to help them achieve this by providing realistic \nfunding options.\n  These students are our future. All of us know just how difficult it \nis to pay for a college education these days. It is important that \nthese students and their families do not see the dream of higher \neducation slip beyond their grasp.\n  Decisions to cut student aid programs are based solely on short-\nsighted politics.\n  I am concerned that the debate over next year's budget is going to \noccur over the summer when many students are not on campus. I hope they \nwill continue to work together to speak out against cuts in student \naid.\n                  restoration of defense cleanup funds\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of restoring $104.2 \nmillion to the Department of Defense accounts that are used to fund the \ncleanup and redevelop of closing military bases. These funds were \nauthorized and appropriated by Congress last year and they now are \nsubject to a possible rescission.\n  Mr. President, less than a month ago the Secretary of Defense \nannounced the 1995 hit list of military base closings. This list \nrecommended closing 25 major bases. Communities with bases on this list \nare currently working to convince the independent Base Closure \nCommission to remove their hometown bases from the list and to spare \nthem the economic trauma of a base closing.\n  Unfortunately, many of these communities will be unsuccessful in \ntheir efforts to save the base. In the first three base closure rounds, \nin 1988, 1991, and 1993, the Commission approved the closing of \napproximately 85 percent of the recommended bases.\n  These first three base closure rounds produced the closing of 75 \nmajor military installations and over 200 smaller installations \nnationwide. Each of these communities are now focusing on beating \nswords into plowshares. And to its credit, the U.S. military is trying \nto do its part to quickly cleanup these bases and prepare them for \ncivilian use.\n  Mr. President, many have argued in the past that the federal \ngovernment should not help beat swords into plowshares--that we do not \nhave a responsibility to help the workers and communities that proudly \nsupported our bases for decades. However, we can not and must not turn \na cold shoulder to those who helped us win the cold war.\n  To be certain, base closings hurt. Communities that lose a base lose \nmuch more than just the daily sights and sounds of the military's \npresence. They lose the heart and soul of their local economy. In many \ncases, the military is the largest employer in the region. As my \ncolleagues know, closing military bases causes an immediate economic \ntrauma in these communities.\n  But some good news is beginning to arise in a few of the towns that \nlost bases in the early rounds. Lost military jobs are slowly being \nreplaced by civilian employment. The private sector is moving in and \njobs are being created at many old bases.\n  The local communities that are experiencing an economic revival have \ntold us that their successful efforts to beat swords to plowshares were \nmade possible only because the federal government, specifically the \nU.S. military, decided to become a partner in this worthy effort.\n  In helping communities rebound, the military services are focused on \nquickly cleaning up contaminated portions of the closing bases so \nprivate sector businesses can move in and begin creating jobs.\n  In order to quickly prepare closing bases for redevelopment, the \nDOD's base closure accounts, or BRAC accounts, must be fully funded.\n  It would be shortsighted to rescind funds for closing bases, \nespecially given that the Base Closure Commission is currently \npreparing to add more bases to the closure list.\n  Cutting funds from the DOD base closure account will slow down the \nprocess of returning these bases back to the communities. By doing so, \nwe would substantially damage the economic development efforts of base \nclosure communities nationwide.\n  [[Page S5374]] I urge my colleagues in the Senate, especially those \non the Senate Appropriations Committee, to restore $104.2 million to \nthe DOD BRAC accounts.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 577\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, if there had been a rollcall vote on the \nDole-Daschle amendment, I would have voted ``no.'' As my colleagues \nknow, I support many, if not all, of the programs that would benefit \nfrom the funding restorations of the amendment. They are worthwhile, \nmeritorious programs that address important national needs.\n  But as I said at the outset of this debate, Mr. President, many of \nthe Appropriations Committee's recommended rescissions were reductions \nin the rate of funding increases, not reductions in actual funding \nbelow the previous year's level. I see no reason to add more money now \nto simply increase the increase. The Appropriations Committee made a \nconsidered judgment on these matters, and we found our recommended \nrescissions to be reasonable. Further, we found them to be urgently \nneeded for the task of deficit reduction.\n  On that point, Mr. President, I believe this amendment is a serious \nmistake. We do not have CBO scoring of this amendment as yet, but it \nwould appear to me that the recommended ``offsets'' of this amendment \nreduce significant amounts of budget authority but very little in \noutlays. The reductions are primarily drawn from accounts with annual \noutlay rates as low as 1 percent, while the funding restorations occur \nin accounts with outlay rates as high as 80 percent. In short, Mr. \nPresident, it appears to me that this amendment may actually increase \nthe deficit. The bill that I brought to the floor on behalf of the \nAppropriations Committee was a first step in the long march toward a \nbalanced budget. This amendment is a step backward.\n                  FUNDING FOR ACIR'S MANDATES STUDIES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to take note of an aspect of the \nmanagers' amendment to H.R. 1158, the supplemental appropriations and \nrescissions bill.\n  As my colleagues know, I helped write the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct of 1995, which just became law. This law passed the Senate on \nJanuary 27 by an 86-10 vote. Part of this law requires the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations to conduct studies on \nunfunded mandates issues. The Senate passed my amendment giving these \nstudies to ACIR by a vote of 88-0.\n  The law requires ACIR to make recommendations to the President and \nCongress about simplifying, consolidating, suspending or terminating \nfederal mandates. It also requires ACIR to examine the measurement and \ndefinition issues involved in calculating the costs and benefits of \nunfunded federal mandates.\n  The law requires ACIR to do these studies very quickly. It must issue \nproposed and final criteria for its studies, hold hearings, and publish \na preliminary and a final report, all by March 22, 1995. The conferees \non the mandates bill recognized that ACIR needed further funding in \nthis fiscal year in order to do the studies. The conferees therefore \nauthorized an appropriation of $500,000 for fiscal year 1995.\n  The managers' amendment contains a provision that would appropriate \nthis money. I am glad that the senior Senators from Oregon and West \nVirginia, Senators Hatfield and Byrd, have funded the mandate on ACIR.\n  I would like to thank them for accommodating the Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Kempthorne, and the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, and \nmyself on this issue. And I look forward to helping ACIR carry out this \nmission.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am supporting the Dole-Daschle compromise \nand the final passage of the supplemental appropriations and \nrescissions bill because I believe, on balance, the bill does take a \nsignificant step towards fiscal control and economy in government.\n  I am particularly pleased that the compromise restores nearly a \nbillion dollars in House rescissions that would have jeopardized \nprograms that benefit children and education.\n  Head Start, Title I Education, impact aid, WIC, Goals 2000, School to \nWork and Drug Free Schools are all programs that constitute investments \nin our national future, and restoration of funding for them lends \nbalance and merit to the bill.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate bill restores funding for the \nLIHEAP program and housing modernization, two programs that are \nimportant to my State.\n  And finally I would note that the Senate bill would restore more than \nhalf of what the House bill would cut from our foreign aid programs--\nnot a perfect outcome, but certainly far preferable to the House \nversion.\n  Mr. President, none of us are going to be completely satisfied with \nthe painful compromises that must be made in the current season of \ndownsizing of government. But this bill does what had to be done with \nless pain than might otherwise have been inflicted. I commend the \nmanagers and give the bill my support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for \nthe successful completion of the managers rescission amendment package \nto H.R. 1158, the fiscal year 1995 supplemental appropriations bill for \ndisaster assistance and rescissions. I am particularly gratified that \nthe leadership has steadfastly retained, through a myriad of \nnegotiations, the restoration of section 8002 of the Federal Impact Aid \nProgram.\n  With funding of only $16.29 million, nearly 200 school districts \ndirectly benefit from section 8002 payments in lieu of taxes for \nFederal properties. As federally owned lands, these properties are tax-\nexempt and contribute nothing to local tax revenues. These monies are \nmade available under strict criteria to help compensate local school \ndistricts for revenues they might otherwise be receiving.\n  The impact aid section 8002 program has been authorized since the \ninception of impact aid in 1950. For 45 years, the Congress has \nrecognized its responsibilities to compensate local schools for tax-\nexempt Federal personnel and properties.\n  Furthermore, the entire impact aid program was just reauthorized last \nyear as a part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This is \nno time to retreat from our longstanding commitment which is so vital \nto federally impacted school districts.\n  I am supporting that impact aid restoration because the York County \nSchool Division in the historic Hampton Roads region of Virginia is the \nlargest recipient of section 8002 funding in the Nation. I commend the \nYork County School Division finance director, Mr. Dennis Jarrett, as \nwell as superintendent Steven Staples for their careful work in \nbringing this urgent matter to my attention.\n  This year alone, more than $1 million of the York County School \nDistrict budget is at risk because of the proposed rescission. I am \nconfident that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee had no \nintention for the budget cutting axe to fall so heavily on only one of \nsome 200 school districts.\n  The restoration of the $16.29 million for impact aid will symbolize \nour support of the communities across the Nation which house and serve \nthe U.S. Armed Services and their families.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and commend this small measure to \nthe support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nthe agreement offered today on H.R. 1158, the rescissions bill. The \nleadership can be commended for their hard work on this compromise. \nThis rescissions bill has been a drawn-out and difficult process. But \nthis hard-fought agreement represents good news for many South \nDakotans: it contains my amendment that would restore funds for Section \n8002 of the Impact Aid Program, otherwise known as Section 2. The \ninclusion of my amendment to save this important program is a \nsignificant reason why I offer my whole-hearted support for this \nagreement.\n  The impact aid program is not aid in the traditional sense. It is \ncalled Impact Aid because the presence of the Federal Government is \nhaving an adverse impact on nearby school districts. The adverse impact \nis the loss of tax revenue to the schools, and the Impact Aid Program \nis designed to compensate schools for that lost tax base.\n  In short, impact aid is an ongoing Federal responsibility. Impact aid \ndoes \n[[Page S5375]] not represent extra dollars for special programs. Impact \naid provides support payments for basic day-to-day operations. It is \nneither a wasteful nor ideologically driven program--these funds go \ndirectly to a school district's operating budget. Impact aid represents \nfairness--to the schools and the parents and children they serve.\n  Section 2 of the Impact Aid Program is the lifeblood of many schools \nacross the Nation. This program provides support payments to school \ndistricts for Federal land. Across the country, schools in 27 States \nrely on Section 2 payments. It would be most unfair to federally \nimpacted districts and the children they serve if the Federal \nGovernment opts to deny them both a tax base and Federal support.\n  If Section 2 payments had been terminated, the Pollock School \ndistrict in northern South Dakota would have closed, forcing \npotentially displaced students to travel up to 50 miles in order to \nreceive an education. Pollock and similarly situated school districts \nwould have been forced into this drastic course of action because no \nother revenue options are available.\n  Mr. President, federally impacted schools already have taken their \nshare of cuts. The Impact Aid Program suffered a $70 million cut last \nyear. If we were to add to this cut the elimination of Section 2 \npayments, federally impacted schools would be left without the \nassistance they had planned on to pay teachers, buy textbooks, or as in \nthe case of Pollock, to even function.\n  Like my colleagues, I am committed to reducing wasteful government \nspending. My voting record consistently has been in favor of a balanced \nbudget. I also appreciate fully the difficult nature of the \nAppropriations Committee's job this year. We are all in the difficult \nposition of needing to cut bureaucracy and federal spending. However, \nour leadership can be commended for realizing where our priorities must \nlie.\n  Impact aid is a program that enjoys support on both sides of the\n   aisle. However, I especially would like to thank my distinguished \nfriends from New York and Virginia, Senators D'Amato and Warner, for \ntheir leadership on this issue. These Senators and others on both sides \nof the aisle were prepared to support my amendment to restore the \nSection 2 payments. It is because of this bipartisan commitment to \neducation that the leadership has restored this important program. I \nappreciate their help and support.\n\n  I hope this bipartisan support for impact aid will send a clear \nsignal to our colleagues and especially to the administration. Impact \naid is vital to our schools and it should continue to be fully funded. \nIt is my hope that we will not have to fight this battle again during \nthe budget negotiations for fiscal year 1996. President Clinton has \nrequested a $109 million cut in the Impact Aid Program for next fiscal \nyear. I hope it has been made clear that such a cut would be \nunacceptable.\n  I would be happy to work with my colleagues to demonstrate why impact \naid is critical to so many school children. I also look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the budget and appropriations committees \nto maintain the vitality of the Impact Aid Program for many years to \ncome.\n\n\n                   restore funding for the cdfi fund\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, one of the provisions in the \namendment the distinguished majority and minority leaders have offered, \nwould partially restore funding for the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions [CDFI] Fund. The full House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittee have both rescinded $124 million of the $125 million \nappropriated for this bill in fiscal year 1995.\n  Although it is not clear when the Senate will have the opportunity to \nvote on this amendment. I want to take a few moments to discuss why the \nfunding for the CDFI Fund is needed.\n  Clearly, the $36 million included in the Daschle amendment is an \ninsufficient amount compared to the $125 million appropriated last \nyear--but, this start up money will help the CDFI Fund get off the \nground. The importance of this Fund is its profound affect on the lives \nof people who want to make their lives better and improve their \nneighborhoods.\n  The CDFI Fund is bipartisan initiative passed in the Riegle Community \nDevelopment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. I was proud to be a \ncosponsor, along with many of my colleagues, of this legislation.\n  The Fund will support and expand existing Community Development Banks \nand Financial Institutions [CDBFI] across the country. The CDFI Fund is \nbased on the simple proposition--helping the private sector to help \ncommunities grow from the bottom up.\n  Over the last two decades, a diverse range of community development \nfinancial institutions have emerged to provide new opportunities for \nneglected communities. In urban, reservation-based and rural settings, \nmore than 300 CDFIs are providing credit, investments and comprehensive \ndevelopment services. These institutions--working in 45 States--manage \nmore than $1 billion in primarily private sector capital. These \ninstitutions have loaned more than $3 billion with a loan loss rates \ncomparable to some of the best banks in this country.\n  Mr. President, across the country, many rural and urban communities \nare starved for affordable credit, capital and basic banking services. \nThe lack of jobs is a critical issue for any community. The lack of \njobs is also the crux of an important issue for the welfare reform \ndebate that the Senate will soon be considering.\n  What the Fund is all about is creating jobs in communities that \ndesperately needs jobs. What this amendment is all about is providing a \nvery, very modest amount of Federal money to spur entrepreneurship, and \nassist small and microbusinesses in low-income communities to help \ncreate those jobs.\n  Job creation is so important to the many critical issues that come \nbefore Congress. It is also the crux of the welfare reform debate now \nbefore Congress.\n  Almost everyone agrees that our welfare system needs major reform, \nand almost everyone agrees that welfare recipients who can work ought \nto be required to work. The question that remains is simple--where are \nthose jobs supposed to come from?\n  The basic truth that must be faced is that there simply aren't enough \njobs now in many communities where the poor are concentrated, are \ndropping. My own home town of Chicago illustrates the problem.\n  Between 1972 and 1990, the City of Chicago lost over 146,000 jobs. \nBetween 1979 and 1990, the city lost over one-third of its \nmanufacturing jobs. Over the same period, the central business district \nactually gained jobs over that period, which means that the impact of \nthe declining job base fell most heavily on Chicago's neighborhoods, \nand particularly its poorest neighborhoods. In the decade of 1980's \nalone, the south and west side Chicago neighborhoods--where many of the \nCity's low-income residents reside--lost over 82,000 jobs.\n  This results in a declining population in the city, and high \nunemployment rates for those who want to stay, or who can't leave. For \nresidents in public housing in the inner cities, jobs are almost non-\nexistent. Of the households in the Robert Taylor Homes--the country's \nlargest public housing complex located on Chicago's southside--an \napproximate 4 percent report any wage income at all.\n  The fact of the matter is--there is not enough economic opportunity \nin poor communities. It's no secret that what is needed to create jobs \nin any community is capital. However, poor communities, simply do not \nhave the access they need to our capital market. What this means is \nthat prospective homebuyers, oftentimes have difficulty getting \nmortgage money. What it also means is that people who want to start \nbusinesses--or expand businesses--in poor communities where all too \noften cannot get access to the money they need. The creation of the \nCDFI FUND is a crucial first step in helping low-income communities \nhelp themselves.\n  The CDFI Fund will invest in community development banks and other \ncommunity development financial institutions which have a primary \nmission of community development, lending and equity investment and \nloan counseling services in distressed, underserved communities.\n  This capital assistance will serve only as seed capital that must be \nmatched by private funds. All types of new and existing CDFIs will be \neligible for assistance, including community \n[[Page S5376]] development banks, credit unions, micro-enterprise and \nrevolving loan funds, minority-owned banks and community development \ncorporations.\n  One of the exciting aspects of the Fund is the Bank Enterprise \nprogram will catalyze new community lending and investment activities \nby conventional financial institutions--complementing community \nreinvestment efforts by lenders.\n  Mr. President, the Fund will have an extraordinary impact on many of \nthis country's low-income neighborhoods. It will support financial and \ntechnical support for new community development banks--which will \nsupport thousands of new loans--which, in turn, can result in thousands \nof new full-time jobs in low-income communities.\n  I have seen first hand what an important role community development \nfinancial institutions can play in the economic development of \ndistressed communities and provide jobs to those who have relied on \npublic assistance.\n  South Shore Bank--the country's first community development bank in \nmy home town of Chicago--has had a tremendous impact in the South Shore \nneighborhood of Chicago. Since 1973, the bank and its affiliated \ncommunity development activities have invested $450 million in its \ntarget communities, financing the rehabilitation of 15,000 housing \nunits and hundreds of businesses. South Shore was once a rapidly-\ndeteriorating, inner city community abandoned by conventional lenders. \nToday it is a stable community with access to a range of sources of \nconventional credit.\n  Another example is the Women's Self Employment Project in Chicago \nwhich has lent more than $800,000 to low income women--many of whom \nrelied on public assistance--to start and grow microenterprises. This \nsuccessful program has a repayment rate of over 94 percent.\n  Mr. President, these are just two examples of how community \ndevelopment works. The list of success stories in community lending \ngoes on and on: the Self-Help Credit Union in North Carolina; the \nFederation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises in North Carolina; The \nCoalition for Women's Economic Development in South Central Los \nAngeles.\n  Mr. President, as I said in my opening remarks, the $36 million \nincluded in this amendment is clearly not enough for the investment \nthat is needed in low-income communities now. But it is a start to help \nthe institutions I referred to, any many others throughout the country. \nThey will be able to expand their capacity through modest federal \ninvestments provided by the CDFI Fund.\n  It is important to point out that the Fund does have an experienced \nand knowledgeable transition team to begin setting up operations and \nprograms. While the Fund cannot issue regulations or take applicants \nuntil the administrator is confirmed, this team is making significant \nprogress to ensure that the programs are up and running.\n  By using very little Federal money to leverage significant private \ndollars, the Fund's investments will build partnerships between banks, \nthrifts, credit unions, and CDFIs.\n  The results in every equity dollar invested in a community \ndevelopment bank or loan fund can leverage at least $10 in new private \ncapital for development lending.\n  Community Development Banks and Financial Institutions provide \ncapital where it is critically needed--and jump start a local economy. \nThe CDFI Fund will support these institutions and represents an \nessential part of what's needed to build and strengthen the economies \nin many urban, reservation-based and rural communities.\n  In closing, let me add that the CDFI Fund, is a very good step in the \nright direction in creating jobs. If the federal government is going to \nsucceed in reforming welfare, we must start by creating jobs and \neconomic growth in impoverished communities where they are needed most.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of success \nstories be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       In North Carolina, the Self-Credit Union and its affiliated \n     Self-Help Ventures Fund made a $50,000 loan in 1985 to a \n     small, rural worker-owned sewing company threatened with \n     closing because it could not obtain credit from its local \n     banks. With Self-Help's technical assistance and a series of \n     working capital loans, the business now employs 80 people, \n     making it the second largest private employer in its county. \n     By 1992, the company had almost tripled its sales, to $1.8 \n     million.\n       In Chicago, the Women's Self Employment Project set up an \n     entrepreneurial training and lending program to enable women \n     receiving public assistance and with little or no asset to \n     start their own income-producing enterprises. Seventy percent \n     of the 20 women participating in the pilot program in 1987 \n     were able to move off public assistance permanently as a \n     result of their business activities. An expanded program now \n     includes 150 women. WSEP's three lending programs have lent \n     more than $500,000 to 350 low- and moderate-income women for \n     micro business ventures.\n       In Central Appalachia, the Federation of Appalachian \n     Housing Enterprises [FAHE] provides loans that make \n     homeownership a reality for very low-income families, many of \n     whom have previously lived in rented trailers without heat or \n     running water. FAHE has lent $3.2 million for more than 172 \n     housing units, including loans to borrowers with incomes as \n     low as $5,000 a year.\n       The Coalition for Women's Economic Development in South \n     Central Los Angeles operates a 12-week training program in \n     Spanish and English, for low-income women seeking to operate \n     their own enterprises.\n       Santa Cruz Community Credit Union in California, which has \n     lent more than $27 million to small businesses, non-profits \n     and cooperatives, supplements its credit union lending with a \n     non-profit housing development subsidiary, Seascape Senior \n     Housing. Seascape developed and owns an 80 unit low-income \n     housing project.\n       The Quitman County Federal Credit Union in Mississippi is \n     located in one of the ten poorest counties in the United \n     States. As a community development credit union, the credit \n     union has been able to supplement the small savings of its \n     600 members with more than $1 million in nonmember deposits, \n     enabling the development of home improvement and minority \n     small business lending programs.\n       For years, the Delaware Valley Community Loan Fund was one \n     of the only lenders in Camden, New Jersey. Its successful \n     lending has led to a 7 bank multimillion dollar loan pool for \n     the disinvested area managed by the loan fund.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I understand that an agreement has been \nworked out between the two sides on this legislation, but I want to set \nthe record straight on a few issues which I believe to be of particular \nimportance.\n  The initiative in question is the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service. In the last few days, several of our colleagues have \ncome to the floor and, for one reason or another, discussed this \ninitiative in a way which has deviated substantially from the facts. I \nwant to provide information for the record to eliminate some of the \nmisconceptions which may have been formed about National Service.\n  First, I would like all of us to be clear on the facts. Contrary to \nwhat we have heard on the Senate floor in the last week, AmeriCorps \ndoes not cost the taxpayer outrageous sums. Counting all costs, the \naverage annual cost per AmeriCorps member is $17,600. $4,725 of that \namount is an education award which is not given until after the year of \nservice is complete.\n  Additionally, the program has benefited the efforts of many private \norganizations which depend on volunteers for their work. Many \ncharitable organizations, from Habitat for Humanity to the Red Cross \nhave resoundingly rebutted the argument that National Service injures \nthe ethic of voluntarism in this country. These groups have often \nstated that the presence of AmeriCorps members has made their efforts \nto attract traditional volunteers even more effective.\n  Charitable organizations are not the only ones who have seen \nsufficient worth in the program to give it their vocal support. Many \nbusinesses also have seen the value of AmeriCorps as an investment and \ngiven it their own dollars to supplement those provided by the federal \ngovernment. These private partners range from Alcoa to Xerox, with many \nothers in between. I request unanimous consent that this information \nregarding the cost per AmeriCorps participant and the number of \nvolunteers and business organizations supporting AmeriCorps be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NUNN. My second point is that National Service is successfully \naccomplishing its primary mission--performance of service. The \nanecdotal evidence \n[[Page S5377]] on this score is abundant. From helping clean up after \nlast year's floods in the Midwest to immunizing 105,000 children in \nTexas, to building 60 homes for poor people in Americus, Georgia, these \nyoungsters are performing real work that is needed by our communities. \nThe independent research firm of Aguirre, International provides \nconfirmation. They did a study of 52 randomly selected AmeriCorps sites \nacross the country, and the findings from the study confirm that the \nachievements of this program are many and varied. I ask consent that \nthe Aguirre International study be also printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, my final point is that this project should \nnot be a partisan issue. The debate on the original authorization was \nnot marred by the misinformation and partisan rancor that we have seen \nduring the last week. Indeed, the 1993 bill passed with the support of \na number of Republicans in both Houses. I would hope that we could \nreturn the debate to that higher plane in the future. To that end, I \nwould hope that my colleagues, whether they agree or disagree with the \nprogram, would take the time over the upcoming recess to visit an \nAmeriCorps site in their states. To my colleagues who are willing to \nmake this visit, if you still have concerns about the program after you \nhave made this good-faith effort to see it in action, that will be \nuseful to an open, straightforward debate on the upcoming \nreauthorization. I believe that the minds of my colleagues will be \nchanged when they see the results of this program.\n  In conclusion, I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues on this \nmatter, and I hope that we can continue the debate in an objective \nfashion. I am fully aware of the funding constraints which face our \nnation's government, but I am confident that the program will be judged \nvaluable to our nation if judged on its true merits and true costs.

The question is on agreeing to the Hatfield \nsubstitute.\n  The amendment (No. 420) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote yes on final passage of this \nsupplemental Appropriations/Rescission bill, but I do so with \nreservations.\n  This bill provides 6.7 billion dollars for disaster assistance, more \nthan 70 percent of which will go to California earthquake and flood \nvictims. This is an urgent and necessary response to the heartbreaking \ndisasters California has faced.\n  [[Page S5379]] I regret that Republicans have played politics with \ndisaster assistance--for the first time in history--by using it as a \nhook for their agenda to slash programs that benefit children, \neducation, working families, and the poor.\n  If the Senate were considering the House passed version of this \nlegislation, I would vote no, because that is a bad bill for both my \nState and my country.\n  But the Senate bill is different in two significant ways:\n  First, the Senate Appropriations Committee added back funds in \ncritical education and housing programs.\n  Second, Senate Democrats were successful on the floor in restoring \nfunds for Head Start, Child Nutrition, Safe and Drug Free Schools, \nHousing, and other programs that are so important to the well-being of \nour children.\n  So I will vote to send this bill to conference with the House. But I \nreserve the right to vote no on the conference agreement if it comes \nback looking like the mean-spirited House bill. I cannot support any \nbill that does not maintain funds for our children at the Senate-passed \nlevel or higher.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to finish \nconsideration of a Rescissions bill that reduces the Operation and \nMaintenance Account of the Bureau of Reclamation by $10 million. This \namount is identical to the sum rescinded by the House, and I support \nit. As the former Chairman and current ranking member of the \nSubcommittee with authorizing jurisdiction over the Bureau, I have seen \nopportunities for the Bureau of Reclamation to reduce spending. I have \nno doubt that this cut can be absorbed, given the streamlining that is \nnow occurring within the Bureau.\n  I note, however, that the Senate has wisely avoided commenting on \nparticular operations. This has two benefits. First, it gives the \nBureau the flexibility to deal with this cut in the most effective and \nappropriate manner. It won't be easy to cut this account, given that \nthe fiscal year is half over. The project managers need to be creative \nand do not need legislative handcuffs.\n  Second, the House report suggests that one way to balance this \naccount is to stop a study of the San Joaquin River that was \nestablished in law through the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. \nThis language is notably absent from the Senate report.\n  As the author of this landmark CVPIA law, I am surprised at the House \nreport language. This San Joaquin study is specifically ordered in this \npublic law and, in fact, has a statutory deadline for action by the \nBureau. Clearly, this statute is unaffected by any Committee Report \nlanguage, and the law remains binding on the Bureau.\n  Additionally, I am puzzled by this suggested target, since cutting \nthe San Joaquin River Comprehensive Plan, either directly or through \nreport language if possible, would not save the taxpayer any money. \nIndeed, the study is not even funded out of the Bureau's Operating \nAccount! The Plan was established in the statute and financed through a \nsurcharge on the sales of water from the Central Valley Project. In \nfact, if these funds are not spent on this Plan, the law still requires \nthat the full amount be spent on other fish and wildlife restoration \nefforts. There can be and will be no deficit reduction from stopping \nthis Plan.\n  Mr. President, in summary, I'm pleased with the Senate action. \nSpending cuts will occur, as agreed with the House. And the San Joaquin \nstudy will continue, as specifically directed in public law. The \nrestoration of the San Joaquin River would bring benefits throughout \nCalifornia. We need to know if this restoration can occur and how it \nwould be achieved.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will vote for this rescission bill \nbecause I believe it will greatly benefit the citizens of Michigan by \nreducing the burden of Government spending and deficits on the economy. \nEach dollar that Washington does not spend on Government programs means \n$1 more than Americans can spend for their families.\n  While I did fight to restore funding for a few specific programs \nslated for rescission because of their critical importance to \nMichigan--such things as the Low-Income Heating Energy Assistance \nProgram and the Center for Ecology Research and Training slated to be \nlocated in Bay City, MI--I do believe that this rescission package is a \nwin for the people of Michigan because it is the first down-payment \ntoward reducing the size and scope of Government.\n  Specifically, this bill will reduce Government spending by $15 \nbillion. That represents a reduction of 1 percent of the entire Federal \nbudget of $1.5 trillion this year--hardly a draconian reduction in \nGovernment spending as some special interest groups have claimed.\n  Nonetheless, these spending reductions are crucial to our Nation, and \nto Michigan in particular. This bill will help my State by reducing the \ndeficit, freeing up economic resources for the economy, and job \ncreation in particular. Moreover, American taxpayers send 25% of their \npaychecks to Washington.\n  Furthermore, it is clear that we need to take immediate action to \nreduce Government spending because projected deficits are getting \nlarger, not smaller, under President Clinton's budget policies.\n  Contrary to conventional wisdom, President Clinton's budget policies \nhave had almost nothing to do with the slight improvement in the size \nof the budget deficit that has occurred in recent years. According to \nthe CATO Institute, almost all of the deficit reduction since 1992 is \nattributable to three main factors: No. 1, the one-time sale of assets \nand properties acquired by the Federal Government during the savings \nand loan bailout of the late 1980's--which alone has accounted for \nabout $75 billion in deficit reduction in recent years; No. 2, \nreductions in defense spending resulting from the end of the cold war; \nand No. 3, the cyclical economic recovery that began well before \nPresident Clinton took the oath of office.\n  Federal spending continues to spiral out of control. Under President \nClinton, the level of Federal spending as a share of the national \nincome is about 23 percent, near historic levels. According to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, unless we take action to halt \nthe growth of Government spending, it will automatically rise from \n$1.531 trillion this year to $2.202 trillion by 2002.\n  Under the President's budget plan, deficit spending would continue to \nexplode. The CBO reports that the annual deficit will rise from $170 \nbillion this year to over $200 billion next year and to almost $300 \nbillion a year over the next 4 years. Under President Clinton's \npolicies, $1.4 trillion dollars will be added to the national debt, \nthereby increasing interest payments, crowding out private sector \ninvestment, and reducing the economic well-being of America's children.\n  I am particularly concerned about the budget crisis occurring in the \nHousing and Urban Development's subsidized housing program. The CBO \nprojects that the future obligations to renew the expiring section 8 \ncontracts will add $20 billion to the budget by the year 2000. This $15 \nbillion rescission package would partially offset these added budget \ncosts.\n  Mr. President, this rescission package is only a small example of the \nkind of reductions in the growth rate of Government spending that will \nbe required to balance the budget. According to the CBO projections, if \nwe simply limit annual spending increases to 2.9 percent between now \nand 2002, we can balance the budget. In other words, achieving a \nbalanced budget requires not absolute cuts in Government spending, but \nrather reductions in the rate of growth of Government spending.\n  Mr. President, the best thing I can do for the citizens of Michigan \nis to reduce the burden of Government and let them keep more of what \nthey earn. By reducing the growth rate of Government spending and \ncutting taxes, we can strengthen America's and Michigan's families, \nbusinesses, and voluntary organizations. This rescission bill is an \nimportant first step in achieving the electorate's desire for smaller \nGovernment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, with all the rhetoric spoken over the last \nfew days, some of us seem to have forgotten why we are here--to cut \nunnecessary spending. Yes, there will always \n[[Page S5380]] be differences of opinion as to priorities, but the \nfundamental commitment to reassess every Federal program and reduce \nFederal expenditures must be paramount.\n  I am pleased the Democratic leader and I have reached agreement, \nsupported by our colleagues, that will enable us to help keep our \npromise to the American people. In the amendment, a very limited number \nof programs which Members on both sides of the aisle support, have \nreceived smaller reductions in their rate of increase. At the same \ntime, the amendment also contains a number of items that will result in \nadditional savings being achieved. Most important to this Senator, \noverall the amendment will result in additional deficit reduction.\n  As a result of this amendment, the package we will send to the \nconference will contain approximately $16 billion in savings. I repeat, \n$16 billion--that's not over 2 years or 5 years, that's this year.\n  For all those who supported a balanced budget--rest assured we are \ncommitted to achieving that goal even if it means making some tough \nchoices. Of course, the real hard decisions have yet to be made. And, \nwe will not be deterred by the hue and cry of the last few days about \nall the so-called terrible things the Republicans have proposed. This \nbill is certainly progress, but we still have a long way to go. While I \nam pleased we were finally able to reach consensus--I caution everyone \nthat the real hard choices are yet to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment. If \nthere be no further amendment to be proposed, the question is on the \nengrossment of the amendments and the third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my understanding there will be no requests for a vote \non either side on the defense supplemental bill, no request for a vote \non the contract board, the District of Columbia, no request for a \nrecord vote on child pornography, and the paperwork simplification \nconference report is done, and other wrap-up material with only minor \nchanges in the Constitution.\n  But I just say for my colleagues, it will be our intention at 1 \no'clock on Monday, April 24, to begin consideration of H.R. 956, the \nproduct liability bill, and following disposition of product liability \nit will be my intention to proceed to S. 652, the telecommunications \nbill. Votes could occur during Monday's session of the Senate but will \nnot occur prior to the hour of 3 p.m. on Monday, April 24.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How about tonight?\n  Mr. DOLE. This will be the last vote until hopefully April 24, after \n3 p.m. There could be votes after 3 p.m. If we should decide in the \ninterim there will be no votes, we will try to notify you the earliest \npossible time before you are in the air.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce [Ms. Mikulski] as necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting. [Ms. Mikulski] would \nvote ``nay'',\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 years ago, when President Clinton marked \nhis 100th day in office, I said the occasion ``should not be regarded \nas a magical threshold for defining achievement or failure.''\n  The same thought applies now. This is a logical time to take stock, \nbut the real measure of success can't be taken for many months--not \nuntil the rest of the Democratic process, namely the Senate and the \nPresident, bring their perspectives to bear.\n  I give the new House leadership credit for lots of energy and \nactivity in the flush of electoral victory, but this should not be \nmistaken for definitive accomplishment.\n  The fact is the Contract With America is a contract made by \nRepublican candidates for the House of Representatives. It is not a \ncontract made by the Senate and certainly not one made by Senate \nDemocrats nor by the President of the United States.\n  Since the contract seems to be the product of pollsters and campaign \nconsultants, it is not surprising that nearly everyone can agree with \nat least several of its objectives. But when we look at the fine print \nof some of them and when we get down to the hard job of deciding on the \nmeans for achieving those objectives, there are bound to be vast \nphilosophical disagreements.\n  I certainly agree with the objectives of fiscal responsibility, \nwelfare reform, continued action on crime control, job creation, \nfairness for senior citizens, and promotion of family values.\n  And I even agree with some of the means proposed, such as unfunded \nmandate reform and capital gains tax relief to create jobs, child \nsupport enforcement to advance family values and an increase in the \nSocial Security earnings limit for the benefit of senior citizens.\n  But I find myself in profound disagreement with several of the major \nobjectives as well as the means to implement them. These include:\n  The balanced budget amendment, which I opposed because it would have \ncut too much too soon.\n  The line-item veto, which I opposed because it yields too much \ncongressional power to the President and because it is administratively \nunwieldly.\n  Term limitations.\n  Increased defense spending.\n  Reinstatement of the death penalty and cuts in spending on social \nprograms (such as midnight basketball) to control crime.\n  Tax cuts without deficit reduction.\n  Welfare reforms without compassion.\n  Reduced support for the United Nations.\n  Any reduction in support for education or elimination of support for \nthe arts and humanities.\n  So, Mr. President, it is far too early to tally up score cards on a \ncontract made by one party in one House of the legislative branch. Many \nof us simply don't subscribe to substantial parts of it and don't \nbelieve that implementation of it in toto would be good for the \ncountry.\n  The streamroller needs to be slowed down and the contract needs to be \npruned, modified, and in some cases excised. This is the role that the \nSenate is so admirably equipped to do. And only when it has done so \nwill the revised elements of the contract be candidates for \nPresidential consideration. Then and only then, when the executive \nbranch has concurred, can the final score be tallied.\n  As I said 2 years ago, the true measure of success should be taken \nover the extended timeframe of this whole process, without drawing \nhasty conclusions here and now. One hundred days is only the first \nmilestone of a long journey.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5383-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5383-S5387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE UCONN HUSKIES ON THEIR NCAA NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP \n                                VICTORY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Sunday, April 2, the University of \nConnecticut Huskies made history by becoming the second women's \nbasketball team ever to finish an NCAA season undefeated and win a \nnational championship. The Huskies' dramatic 70-64 come-from-behind \ndefeat of the Tennessee Volunteers brought their final season record to \n35-0, the best finish by any team--men's or women's--in the history of \nNCAA basketball.\n  On behalf of the citizen's of Connecticut, I rise to congratulate and \nthank this remarkable group of young women.\n  Those who watched the game on Sunday afternoon may recall that as the \nHuskies celebrated their victory, the UConn pep band played Aretha \nFranklin's hit song, ``Respect.'' Mr. President, there simply could not \nhave been a more appropriate accompaniment for this long-awaited \ncelebration. Perhaps as much as any sports team in recent memory, the \nUConn women's basketball team has generated the respect and admiration \nof all who have had the privilege of watching them play. In so doing, \nthey have reminded the citizens of Connecticut, as well as people \nthroughout the country, what college athletics is all about.\n  The Huskies' list of accomplishments on the court is nothing short of \namazing. On their way to the NCAA title, they broke 14 NCAA records, \nincluding most victories, longest winning streak, most points, most \npoints in a game and largest margin of victory. In addition, four \nConnecticut players--Rebecca Lobo, Jen Rizzotti, Kara Walters and \nJamelle Elliott--were named to the all-tournament team. That is the \nfirst time in history that four players from the same team have \nreceived this honor. [[Page S5384]] \n  No less impressive than their basketball heroics are the Huskies' \naccomplishments off the court. Rebecca Lobo, winner of numerous \nindividual basketball honors awarded by the NCAA and the Big East \nConference this year, has maintained a near-perfect grade point average \nas a political science major and was a finalist for the prestigious \nRhodes Scholarship. Last semester, seven of the 12 Husky players were \nnamed to the University's dean's list.\n  What has touched basketball fans throughout the country more than \nanything else, however, are those qualities exhibited by the Huskies \nthat cannot be measured by grade point averages, records or point \ntallies. Anyone who saw the team play this year was struck by their \ntremendous enthusiasm for the game of basketball, their unwavering \ncommitment to fair play and good sportsmanship and their obvious \ndedication to and respect for one another and their coaches.\n  In this era of season-ending strikes, multi-million dollar contract \ndisputes, recruiting scandals and low athlete graduation rates, this \ngroup of women has reminded us that the term, ``student-athlete'', is \nnot just a catch-phrase for college brochures. It is an attainable \nideal to which all college athletes should aspire, and it is what makes \ncollegiate athletics so special.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to recognize what this remarkable \ngroup of young women has done for women's college athletics. This year, \non average, roughly 8,000 people attended the women's home games at \nGampel Pavilion, which represents a 485 percent increase over the \naverage crowd size during their 1991 Final Four season. Young girls, \nwith their hair braided like Rebecca Lobo or wearing replicas of Jen \nRizzotti's number 21 jersey, watched the team play on national \ntelevision. Autograph seekers mobbed the players before and after \ngames, and the players' mailboxes were literally flooded with letters \nfrom fans and well-wishers.\n  People of all ages in Connecticut and throughout the nation caught \nwind of ``Husky-mania'' and demonstrated that women's athletics could \ngenerate every bit as much enthusiasm and spectator support as men's. \nNationwide, total attendance for women's college basketball games has \nskyrocketed from 1.3 million in 1984 to 3.6 million in 1995.\n  As we look back on this spectacular season of women's college \nbasketball, it is important that we note just how far collegiate \nathletic programs for women have come. Once little more than small, \npoorly-funded intramural organizations, women's collegiate athletic \nteams have begun to enjoy the same status as the men's teams. This is \ndue in part to Title IX of the Equal Education Amendment Act, the 1972 \nlegislation that guarantees women equal opportunity in all scholastic \npursuits--including sports--at schools that receive federal funding.\n  Although disparities and inequities between men's and women's \nprograms persist, it is clear that this law has forced colleges and \nuniversities to re-examine how they allocate resources. The law has \nhelped ensure that scholarship money is available for women like \nRebecca Lobo, Pam Webber, Kara Wolters or Jamelle Elliott and that the \ncoaching and facilities provided to female athletes allow them to \ndevelop their talents to the fullest.\n  While it is true that we may look upon the Huskies' success as \npositive evidence of Title IX at work, it is also true that their \naccomplishments underscore the need for further progress in this area. \nNot all schools have made efforts to improve their women's athletic \nprograms, and many of those that have made significant progress have \nyet to fully comply with Title IX.\n  What is clear, however, is that the American people, as evidenced by \nthe immense popularity of the UConn women's basketball team, are ready \nand willing to lend their enthusiastic support to women's collegiate \nathletics.\n  Mr. President, when the Huskies traveled to Washington earlier this \nyear, they waited in line outside a White House gate only to be told \nthat a scheduling mistake made it impossible for them to get inside. On \nSunday, after having won the national championship, Head Coach Geno \nAuriemma spoke with President Clinton on the phone and pointed out that \nperhaps the next time his team traveled to Washington, his players \ncould enter the White House through the front door.\n  The President has honored his request.\n  Mr. President, when the Huskies walk through the front door of the \nWhite House, they will not only experience a great honor, but will also \nhelp ensure that the door remains open for future generations of female \nathletes.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to mention the names of all the \nUConn players and coaches who contributed to the 1995 undefeated title \ncampaign: Geno Auriemma (Head Coach), Chris Dailey (Assistant Coach), \nTonya Cardoza (Assistant Coach), Meghan Pattyson (Assistant Coach), \nCarla Berube, Kim Better, Jamelle Elliott, Jill Gelfenbien, Kelley \nHunt, Rebecca Lobo, Brenda Marquis, Jen Rizzotti, Missy Rose, Nykesha \nSales, Pam Webber and Kara Wolters.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nby Owen Canfield that recently appeared in the Hartford Courant, as \nwell as a 1992 editorial by Greg Garber, Lori Riley and Woody Anderson \nthat was also printed in the Hartford Courant.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Apr. 3, 1995]\n\n                     The best: It's pure and Simple\n\n                           (By Owen Canfield)\n\n       Minneapolis--Glory. Really. What a brave bunch, this UConn \n     women's basketball team, and a fighting bunch.\n       The NCAA Division I women's college basketball championship \n     flag will fly over the state university in Storrs. They \n     should haul it down and have it dry-cleaned every day just to \n     preserve the purity of the memorable season that ended with a \n     surging, 70-64 victory over Tennessee at the Target Center.\n       The Huskies wound up 35-0. That's pure.\n       Hey, Connecticut, let's have a parade. Bet you already have \n     started planning back there? Wait for us, we who traveled \n     here to watch. We'll be home today.\n       UConn won all the easy ones this year, and then it won the \n     toughest game imaginable, under the most trying, challenging \n     conditions.\n       This was the time for it. Put it down as one of the more \n     dramatic and gutty performances in the state's sports \n     history.\n       ``No way they can do it now,'' a pessimist said after \n     Rebecca Lobo picked up her third personal foul and had to go \n     to the bench to sit out more than 11 minutes of the first \n     half. Then it was Jen Rizzotti, then Nykesha Sales with three \n     personals. And Kara Wolters with two before the half ended. \n     UConn had to alter its game and its personnel. Emboldened, \n     the Volunteers went up by one, by three, by five, by six.\n       ``No way,'' Joe Pessimist said. ``It's over.''\n       It wasn't over. It hadn't even started, friends. But you \n     know that. You saw it, right?\n       Say it slowly and savor it: Connecticut is the national \n     champion in women's basketball.\n       ``More wins [35],'' said Nykesha Sales, the 18-year-old \n     freshman who scored 10 points, ``than I won in my whole \n     [Bloomfield] high school career. Gosh. A perfect season.''\n       Yes sir. A perfect season. The last word.\n       Players on both teams cried at the end. It always happens. \n     There are winners' tears and losers' tears. But these \n     winners' tears were different because . . . well, can you \n     picture Jamelle Elliott crying over anything? She is the \n     toughest person on the team, maybe the toughest in all of \n     women's basketball while the game is in progress. But when \n     this game ended, while Rebecca Lobo ran in a wide semicircle \n     with her hand in the air and the ultimate triumph on her \n     lips, Elliott stood flatfooted in one spot on the court and \n     did a little public bawling.\n       Well, this was the time for it. There were no more games to \n     win, no more criticism to answer and no more people to fling \n     doubts.\n       Win one like this and the job is finished. Time now to be \n     human and celebrate not only with cheers and hugs and high-\n     fives, but celebrate within yourself. That's what Elliott was \n     doing, having a happy, moving little private party inside. \n     Expressing love for her teammates is what she was doing.\n       She was celebrating the perfect season the perfect way.\n       The losers' tears were not bitter ones, though this was a \n     bitter loss for Tennessee because, as Carla Berube said, ``We \n     gave them everything they could have wanted. Maybe we wanted \n     it more.''\n       Berube, the wiry reserve who, like Sales, simply had to \n     make the plays this day because at times there was no one \n     else, wore a cap that said ``National Champions'' in bold \n     blue across the front. She sat in a chair in the locker room, \n     cool as ice, but her eyes were dancing.\n       ``You are not as big as those Tennessee kids,'' a man said. \n     ``Tiffani Johnson, Vonda Ward, Abby Conklin, Dana Johnson . . \n     . [[Page S5385]] they're a lot bigger. And they're athletes. \n     But you got some rebounds [three] and you played some \n     defense. You were tough.''\n       ``I'd better be tough,'' Berube said. ``I practice against \n     Rebecca Lobo and Jamelle Elliott every day. I'd better be.''\n       Referee Dee Kantner is said to be one of the best in the \n     business, but it appeared to Connecticut people she was \n     calling them a little too close. UConn does not have the \n     depth of Tennessee, and coach Geno Auriemma had to improvise \n     as never before after Lobo, Wolters and Rizzotti all got in \n     first-half foul trouble. At time all three were on the bench, \n     which meant that the responsibility fell to Berube, the soph, \n     and Sales, the frosh.\n       Did you say tough?\n       ``I think I got rid of my nervousness in the last game,'' \n     Sales said. She didn't have to mention it. She did amazing \n     things with the ball, made some astonishing championship \n     moves to the hoop, and played 33 minutes because the team \n     needed her.\n       ``Today I started off well and that's always good,'' Sales \n     said. ``Coach hasn't said anything to me [after a weak \n     showing against Stanford]. He never puts the pressure on \n     me.''\n       There was pressure enough in this game to buckle an old \n     colonel going under fire for the thousandth time. But these \n     UConn women didn't budge.\n       So, you go ahead and arrange the parade. The whole state \n     will come. And let's have Rebecca ride in the lead limousine \n     and be governor for a day. She's a straight-A political \n     science major, you know.\n       But wait for us, will you?\n       Glory, what a story.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, May 24, 1992]\n\n                 Women's Progress in College Athletics\n\n            (By Greg Garber, Lori Riley and Woody Anderson)\n\n       When Jaymie Hyde arrived at the University of New Hampshire \n     four years ago, she looked past the cracked public tennis \n     courts, the 15-year-old uniforms that didn't fit, and the \n     lack of scholarships. She was just happy to play tennis.\n       Then, last July, New Hampshire took that away, too.\n       After the shock of the program's elimination wore off, Hyde \n     did something about it. Like so many young female athletes, \n     Hyde, 21 of Essex, had never heard of Title IX of the Equal \n     Education Amendment Act, the law that gave women equal \n     opportunity in all scholastic pursuits, including sports, at \n     schools that receive federal funds.\n       She learned quickly.\n       Led by Hyde and her mother, the 11 women's tennis team \n     members hired Washington attorney Arthur Bryant and \n     threatened to sue the Durham University. After all, the \n     school's budget cuts didn't affect the men's tennis team.\n       The university capitulated. The two parties reached an out-\n     of-court settlement March 12. New Hampshire reinstated the \n     team and agreed to implement a five-year plan to upgrade its \n     women's athletic program.\n       ``I hope from this whole thing that everybody else realizes \n     that you don't have to sit around and let it happen,'' Hyde \n     said. ``We didn't know about Title IX, which is kind of \n     funny. I sort of felt stupid.''\n       Title IX marks its 20th anniversary next month. With regard \n     to sports, the law insists that the ratio of male and female \n     athletes be proportional to that of the student body.\n       Though some progress has been made, women in college \n     athletics are still struggling for equality nationally and in \n     Connecticut. And with many colleges now hard-pressed \n     economically, women's programs seem unlikely to expand in the \n     '90s.\n       ``In the '70s and '80s, women's athletics \n     expanded and left us with extravagant expectations,'' said \n     Judith A. Davidson, athletic director at Central Connecticut \n     State University in New Britain. ``Now we're in \n     retrenchment.''\n       And yet, women are curiously quiet. Although men outnumber \n     women in collegiate athletics by about 2-to-1 in Connecticut, \n     the federal agency responsible for enforcing Title IX has \n     received no complaints about the state's schools in the last \n     two years. Nationally, in two years, the agency has received \n     only 20 college complaints.\n       Many in college athletics do not understand their rights. \n     And many are not as willing as Jaymie Hyde to fight for them. \n     Some fear reprisals from those in charge.\n       Nationally, women collegiate athletes are also outnumbered \n     2-to-1. Some say that is not because of a lack of \n     opportunity, but a lack of interest.\n       ``I think every male and female athlete on campus should \n     have the same opportunities,'' said Carolyn Vanacore, a \n     former physical education department chairwoman and professor \n     emeritus at Southern Connecticut State University in New \n     Haven. ``But there do not appear to be as many women \n     interested in sports as men.''\n       Others argue that lack of women doesn't necessarily mean \n     lack of interest.\n       ``For years, athletic departments have contended that women \n     just don't want to play sports in the numbers that men do,'' \n     said Lyn St. James, the president of the New York-based \n     Women's Sports Foundation, a non-profit organization \n     dedicated to promoting and enhancing sports for girls and \n     women.\n       ``They say, because of football, there will be more men \n     playing sports than women. Perhaps there may always be a few \n     more male athletes than females, but the kind of disparity \n     that we now see--a 70-30 ratio in Division I schools--is due \n     to a denial of opportunities rather than a lack of \n     interest.''\n       What happened at Washington State University supports the \n     point. After the school was found in violation of Title IX, \n     it added women's soccer and crew teams. As a result, the \n     percentage of women athletes increased from 29 to 44.\n       ``If the opportunities are there,'' St. James says, ``women \n     will play.''\n       In compliance or not? Title IX is so complex and unwieldy--\n     there are 14 major criteria to judge whether a school is in \n     compliance--that it took 16 years of debate and lawsuits to \n     define the law so it could be enforced. The Office of Civil \n     Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing Title IX, and there \n     is sharp disagreement over whether it has done its job.\n       ``We had a chance to move into a period of permanent \n     equity,'' said Jeff Orleans, who helped write Title IX as a \n     lawyer in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. General \n     Counsel's Office. ``But there was no federal leadership for \n     the colleges. It was disappointing that there wasn't [OCR] \n     enforcement.''\n       Most of Connecticut's colleges and universities say they \n     think they are in compliance with the law, but no one is \n     sure.\n       At the state's 18 four-year colleges, male athletes \n     outnumber female athletes almost two to one, 3,975 to 2,089. \n     Yet full-time female undergradutes outnumber males by almost \n     2,500.\n       At only two Connecticut schools--the University of \n     Bridgeport and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London--is \n     the number of women athletes in proportion to the number of \n     students.\n       In the state's worst case, female students outnumber males \n     at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield. Yet, its 40 female \n     athletes are outnumbered by male athletes by more than 5-to-\n     1.\n       Double standards? Clearly, there are disparities large and \n     small.\n       At the University of Connecticut, male athletes always have \n     been given jockstraps as a matter of courses. Not until 1990 \n     were female athletes given sports bras. At most other \n     Connecticut schools, men are given jockstraps, but women buy \n     their own athletic bras.\n       At Quinnipiac College in Hamden, the men's basketball coach \n     is a full-time employee; the women's basketball coach is part \n     time. It is the same with the track program at Central \n     Connecticut State University.\n       At Yale University's ancient Payne Whitney Gymnasium, women \n     athletes still walk into women's bathrooms and see urinals, \n     leftovers from Yale's pre-coed days.\n       This year at Central, the football and men's basketball \n     teams traveled to games in buses with hired drivers, while \n     coaches drove all other sports teams in vans.\n       These slights hint at larger imbalances.\n       A recent National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) \n     study shows that:\n       The average Division I school spends $849,000 on \n     scholarships for male athletes and only $373,000 for women.\n       Division I schools spend nearly five times more recruiting \n     male athletes than women athletes. Much of the spending is \n     for recruiters' and recruits' travel.\n       Division I schools spent nearly 3\\1/2\\ times more on men's \n     sports than on women's.\n       Closing the gap? ``Gender equity: It's the hot topic of the \n     90s,'' UConn athletic director Lew Perkins said. \n     ``Everybody's just beginning to talk about it. I'll be \n     honest, like many schools we don't fully understand it. \n     That's why we're studying it. We need to find out where we \n     are.''\n       Even armed with the thick title IX manual and a battery of \n     lawyers, schools have found that is not easy.\n       For example, if numbers are awry, but a university \n     determines by studies and surveys that there is no interest \n     in a particular sport on campus, then the\n      school may still be in compliance.\n       About seven years ago, a women's softball club was formed \n     at Connecticut College. Last spring, the 30-member club \n     petitioned for varsity status. The proposal was approved by \n     the student advisory board but was turned down by the \n     administration. Athletic director Charles Luce said lack of \n     space on campus for a softball field was the main reason. The \n     club pays to play at a public field in Groton.\n       Luce, who is retiring this summer, said the school does not \n     discriminate against women athletes. There are more women's \n     teams (12) than men's (11), but 18 fewer women athletes than \n     men, and 240 more women students than men overall.\n       Does this put Connecticut College out of compliance with \n     Title IX? Luce, who wasn't sure what the participation \n     numbers were, doesn't think so. ``We try to bend over \n     backward to make sure we don't'' discriminate.\n       Under Title IX, lack of facilities or money are not \n     acceptable reasons for not adding a women's sport when there \n     is interest and women are underrepresented.\n       Kathryn Reith, director of communications and advocacy at \n     the Women's Sports Foundation, said the school's decision on \n     softball ``could be a violation.'' Reith recently produced a \n     Title IX guide, ``Playing Fair,'' for high school and college \n     sports. ``They have more than enough players, a demonstrated \n     interest. The school should add the team.''\n       Terry Perreault, a junior softball captain, didn't \n     understand how Title IX could help [[Page S5386]] her club \n     become a varsity sport. Her coach, Deana Kiefer, doesn't want \n     to challenge Connecticut College's administration.\n       ``I think if we keep petitioning, we'll get it sooner or \n     later,'' Kiefer said. ``I'm not going to go sue for it; what \n     are my chances of being the varsity coach if I did?'' What is \n     compliance? There are other factors by which compliance is \n     measured, including the amount and quality of equipment, \n     locker rooms, practice facilities and playing fields.\n       When assessing compliance, an overall comparison must be \n     made between men's and women's programs. For example, if an \n     assistant coach is provided for the men's basketball team and \n     not the women's, a school could still be in compliance if \n     another men's team did not have an assistant coach.\n       At the team level, comparisons of similar sports, such as \n     baseball and softball, are also valid, even if the program is \n     balanced overall. So, if the baseball team travels by \n     airplane and the softball team uses a van, that could be a \n     violation, depending on the distance traveled.\n       When University of New Hampshire administrators eliminated \n     women's tennis, they believed they were still in compliance \n     because they also cut men's wrestling. But when the tennis \n     team threatened to sue, the OCR informed the school that they \n     were out of compliance. Since women were already \n     underrepresented in athletics, cutting one sport for each sex \n     maintained the disparity.\n       At Yale, 36.3 percent of all athletes are women, based on \n     the team rosters, while 44.2 percent of Yale's undergraduates \n     are women.\n       Yet Barbara Chesler, Yale's associate athletic director, \n     said her sports program would have been in compliance even if \n     women's ice hockey had been cut, as was rumored last spring.\n       Members of the ice hockey team's alumni association and \n     parent support groups contemplated suing the university if \n     their team was eliminated. After consulting with the OCR, \n     Yale cut men's water polo and wrestling instead.\n       College administrators often say, ``If you don't count \n     football, we're fairly equitable.'' Before Title IX took \n     effect, the NCAA unsuccessfully tried to exclude football \n     from the legislation.\n       Title IX makes no distinction between revenue-producing \n     sports, such as basketball and football, and non-revenue \n     sports such as cross country and swimming.\n       But if football is removed, more men than women still \n     participate in sports at most schools. The University of New \n     Haven, for example has 147 male athletes and only 46 female \n     athletes even when the football team isn't counted.\n       That means men athletes would outnumber women athletes by \n     3-to-1 although they outnumber women only 2-to-1 in the \n     student body.\n       ``If we're out of whack there, we're out of whack in the \n     other areas,'' said Debbie Chin, New Haven's associate \n     athletic director. ``I take the blame for this.''\n       Glass ceiling drops while women are underrepresented as \n     athletes, the situation with coaches and athletic program \n     administrators is worse. While about one of every three \n     college athletes is a woman, less than one of every four \n     college coaches is a woman. And only one of every 17 athletic \n     directors is a woman.\n       Title IX does not say anything about the hiring of women \n     coaches or administrators; ironically, it has led to a \n     decrease in the number of women in coaching. Only 65 of 139 \n     women's teams in the state are coached by women. Nearly all \n     women's teams were coached by women before Title IX. But when \n     the visibility and pay increased, so did men's interest in \n     applying for the jobs.\n       Fifteen of the state's 18 schools have male athletic \n     directors. Nationally, there are only 57 women directors \n     among the 860 coed college athletic departments.\n       ``The glass ceiling in the gymnasium appears to be even \n     lower than in the nation's business office,'' said Brooklyn \n     College physical education professor Vivian Acosta, a leading \n     authority on women in sports. ``In athletics, it appears that \n     women are being carved out of the work force.''\n       Six years ago, UConn associate athletic director Pat \n     Meiser-McKnett found herself discussing the vacant athletic \n     director's job at Virginia Commonwealth University in \n     Richmond with the school's president at the NCAA convention. \n     The conversation took place in a hotel lobby and lasted less \n     than 30 minutes.\n      Meiser-McKnett submitted a three-page letter to VCU, but was \n     not formally interviewed.\n       Months later, Meiser-McKnett was stunned to read in The \n     Courant that she was one of three finalists for the job.\n       ``I was furious,'' Meiser-McKnett said. ``It was so absurd. \n     They were suing me to fill the slot--I was the token \n     female.''\n       VCU officials say they did not release Meiser-McKnett's \n     name as a finalist. However, John Packett, a reporter at the \n     Richmond Times-Dispatch, says he got his information from a \n     university source.\n       It was, Meiser-McKnett says, the Old-Boy network at work. \n     According to a 1988 Brooklyn College study by Acosta and \n     fellow professor Linda Jean Carpenter, the Old-Boy network--\n     made up of males in power who aren't willing to recognize \n     women as equals--is the main reason women don't get hired by \n     athletic departments. As a rule, men have been in power \n     longer and there are vastly more of them.\n       ``Who do they look [to hire]?'' said Linda Wooster, \n     director of women's athletics at Quinnipiac. ``People not \n     posing a threat, people they're comfortable with. It's \n     frustrating sometimes.''\n       In the Ivy League, all eight athletic directors are men. \n     Meanwhile, 13 of the 28 associate athletic directors are \n     women. Recently, Columbia University in New York had the \n     chance to break up the male monopoly.\n       ``I was approached last year by a search firm about the \n     AD's job at Columbia,'' said Davidson, Central's athletic \n     director. ``The four finalists were two women [including \n     Davidson] and two minority men. And then, they decided to \n     reopen the search.\n       ``They hired a white male who fits the traditional image of \n     an AD. You can't tell me of those four people there wasn't \n     one qualified. I just don't think the Ivy League is ready for \n     a woman AD.''\n       Fred Knubel, director of public information at Columbia, \n     said ``Davidson's inference is incorrect.\n       ``The search for an athletic director was continuous until \n     a consensus was reached,'' he said, reading from a statement. \n     ``Special efforts were made to seek out minorities and women. \n     Along the way, a number of strong candidates withdrew, \n     including one woman who did so for personal reasons at the \n     last moment.''\n       Often, there is a smaller pool of qualified female \n     applicants than male for each open position. There is also a \n     feeling among some women in athletic administration that \n     women are less willing to work through the low-paying low-\n     status coaching and administrative positions.\n       ``Men, for whatever reasons, are more willing to take those \n     entry-level jobs,'' Davidson said. ``They will do anything \n     they have to to succeed. I think part of it has to do with \n     the opportunities that are opening up for women. There are \n     more women lawyers, doctors. It leaves the women's athletic \n     pool smaller.''\n       UConn women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma bristles when \n     people say men are intruding on the women's game.\n       ``People see me in this big beautiful office inside Gampel \n     Pavilion and say, `How does he get that?' This is my 17th \n     year of coaching. Those five years I coached high schools, I \n     spent working three jobs trying to do that.''\n       The early years as difficult as things seem for women in \n     athletics today, it used to be worse.\n       In 1979, a patch of grass between two dormitories passed \n     for the varsity softball field at Eastern Connecticut State \n     University in Willimantic. When coach Clyde Washburne hit \n     balls in practice, he had to compete with errant Frisbees and \n     footballs.\n       Meanwhile, the baseball team enjoyed a state-of-the-art \n     facility. The baseball coach was athletic director Bill \n     Holowaty. ``I told the athletic director, I told the \n     president, that it wasn't fair to my players safety-wise or \n     to me as a teacher,'' Washburn said. ``By the time practice \n     began, you were angry. It was hard to not take it out on the \n     players.''\n       Washburne, who would win four national Division III \n     softball titles before retiring in 1988, took it out on \n     Eastern Connecticut instead--by way of the Boston OCR. After \n     the OCR descended on Eastern and tied up the athletic \n     director's and president's office for several weeks with \n     paperwork, the money for a new fenced-in field and dugouts \n     suddenly appeared.\n       Said Holowaty: ``When softball saw what we [baseball] had, \n     they had to have it, too. I said to Clyde, `Fine. I agree \n     with you.' But people forgot how many years it took us to get \n     our field, and we did it with private money. It took us 11 \n     years to get lights. You don't do it overnight and you don't \n     tear down a successful program to build something else. They \n     got a softball field a lot quicker than we got our field.''\n       After they framed the dugout roofs, Washburne told the OCR \n     he was satisfied and its investigators returned to Boston.\n       But when the complex was built, the softball players would \n     look up through the skeleton of the dugout frame at the dark \n     sky and say, ``Isn't this a great place to get in out of the \n     rain?'' It was two years before roofs were added.\n       At some colleges, the scramble to accommodate women led to \n     controversy.\n       Fred Barakat, the former Fairfield University men's \n     basketball coach, was furious to discover one day, in the \n     mid-1970s, that his office was literally cut in half to make \n     room for the women's basketball coach.\n       ``There was no warning. I was shocked by it,'' said \n     Barakat, now the assistant commissioner of the Atlantic Coast \n     Conference.\n       ``I was on the brink of something good. I wanted to show \n     recruits what other Division I programs were showing \n     recruits, like a nice office. None of us were ready for it. \n     Coaches didn't understand it.''\n       Now, Barakat says of equal opportunity for women: ``It's \n     here to stay and we'd better dance with it.''\n       In 1975, UConn offered 12 sports for men, eight for women. \n     Women's soccer, a fledgling sport nationwide, was not one of \n     them.\n       Felice Duffy grew up in Storrs as part of a large soccer-\n     playing family. When she went to UConn and found no team, she \n     lobbied for one. She said the administration told her and the \n     78 members of her women's soccer club they would have to wait \n     eight years for a varsity program.\n       Duffy didn't have eight years.\n       Realizing athletic opportunities for men outnumbered those \n     for women at the school, she contacted lawyers and then-U.S. \n     Rep. [[Page S5387]] Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and finally \n     filed a Title IX complaint. After a year of club status and a \n     year of ``trial varsity'' status, Duffy got her varsity team \n     and became an All-American.\n       Duffy now coaches the Yale women's soccer team, which loses \n     to UConn's nationally ranked program every year.\n       In the early 70s, most women were simply content to play \n     sports for the first time. Whatever accompanied that new-\n     found privilege--scholarships, practice uniforms, new \n     equipment--was more than most expected. At Trinity, for \n     instance, coach Robin Sheppard's field hockey team happily \n     accepted castoff football jerseys as their first uniforms in \n     1974.\n       Originally, colleges and secondary schools were given six \n     years, until 1978, to comply with the 1972 law, but progress \n     was slow. Then, Title IX lost most of its punch in 1984, when \n     the Supreme Court ruled that the law's protection extended \n     only to programs directly receiving federal funding, not to \n     the institution as a whole.\n       It wasn't until 1988 that the Civil Rights Restoration Act, \n     spearheaded by then-U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., \n     and fellow Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., put the teeth back \n     into Title IX.\n       An awakening Before this year, school officials would get \n     their hands slapped for discriminating against women.\n       But this past February, the Supreme Court sent a strong \n     message to schools who practice discrimination. For the first \n     time, the justices agreed to permit a plaintiff to recover \n     monetary damages in a Title IX case. A young woman from \n     Georgia said she was forced into a sexual relationship by a \n     male athletic coach and economics teacher while she was a \n     high school student. A lower court had refused to allow her \n     to seek damages.\n       Many believe this decision will encourage more women to \n     file Title IX complaints.\n       ``Now,'' said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the \n     Women's Sports Foundation and a Southern Connecticut \n     graduate, ``all the major civil rights issues are at the \n     beginning of a new cycle. People are trying again to get \n     homosexual, racism, sexism issues on the table. I see that as \n     a national trend.''\n       To upgrade the women's program at Temple University in \n     Philadelphia, athletes pursued a Title IX lawsuit through the \n     courts for almost a decade. Female basketball players at the \n     College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., and the \n     University of Oklahoma in Norman threatened lawsuits to keep \n     their teams from being cut.\n       Like New Hampshire's Hyde, they took matters into their own \n     hands. Still, women like Hyde remain in the minority.\n       ``I had one athlete say the other night, `Title 19, or \n     whatever . . .' It makes me sad,'' said Quinnipiac's Wooster. \n     ``Kids in this day and age expect these opportunities.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5383-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5387-S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO COLLEGE BASKETBALL STAR, REBECCA LOBO\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Rebecca Lobo, who \nthis year led the University of Connecticut women's basketball team to \nan undefeated season and a national championship. I have already spoken \nat length about the team's accomplishments--its 35 to 0 perfect record \nand its dramatic come-from-behind national championship victory. I want \nto take this opportunity, however, to focus on Rebecca Lobo, whose \ntremendous athletic skill and personal character have captured the \nimagination of people throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, contemporary writers, pundits, and philosophers have \nlong bemoaned the absence of leadership figures worthy of our emulation \nand adoration. Young Americans are frustrated by athletic heroes who \nfail to lead exemplary lives off the playing field, politicians who \nseem focused solely on their re-election prospects or movie stars whose \nreal-life personas pale in comparison to those of the characters they \nportray on screen. In Rebecca Lobo, however, America has found a role \nmodel that not only meets our expectations, but exceeds them.\n  Ms. Lobo's accomplishments on the basketball court are well known. On \nher way to leading the Huskies to an undefeated season and national \nchampionship, Lobo averaged 17 points, 10 rebounds, 3.5 blocked shots \nand 3.7 assists per game. She was named a first team All-American and \nthe national player of the year, and, despite having to sit out much of \nthe first half with three fouls, sparked the dramatic second half come-\nfrom-behind victory over Tennessee in the NCAA championship game.\n  Her accomplishments in the classroom are equally impressive. As a \npolitical science major, Ms. Lobo has maintained a 3.63-grade point \naverage and was a nominee for the prestigious Rhodes scholarship. She \nwas also named a first team Academic All-American both this season and \nlast.\n  Yet what sets this talented young athlete apart is not just her \nathletic or academic accomplishments, but her care for and commitment \nto her teammates and her fans.\n  As Connecticut Head Coach, Geno Auriemma is quick to point out, \nRebecca's greatest weakness as a player is that she is too unselfish \nand too unwilling to grab the spotlight. Foremost in her mind is her \nconnection and responsibility to her team, a trait which is shared by \nall her fellow Huskies and which is undoubtedly the source of their \ngreat success.\n  Mr. President, beyond Rebecca Lobo's athletic and academic \naccomplishments lies her ability and willingness to reach out to her \nnumerous fans and admirers. Along with her teammates, Rebecca made it a \npoint to chat with fans and sign autographs for an hour after each \ngame. Despite being overwhelmed by letters, she has devoted hours of \nher time to personally answering each and every piece of correspondence \nshe has received, and she has been a regular at summer basketball camps \nand clinics, where she has patiently worked with aspiring basketball \nstars of all ages.\n  Mr. President, Rebecca Lobo has reminded people of what being an \nathlete, a student, and a human being is all about. She has struck a \nbalance and a harmony between her goals and those of the people around \nher. In this day and age, when millionaire athletes defiantly proclaim \non television commercials that they are not role models, Rebecca Lobo \nreminds us that being a role model is not a blight but a privilege. It \nis a privilege for her to be afforded the opportunity to showcase her \narray of talents, and it is a privilege for us watch her and urge \nothers to follow her lead.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article \nwritten by Ira Berkow that was printed in the New York Times be printed \nin the Record.\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 3, 1995]\n                        UConn Can Count On Lobo\n\n                            (By Ira Berkow)\n\n       Minneapolis.--Rebecca Lobo's parents hadn't spoken with her \n     before the game, the game yesterday afternoon that would \n     decide the N.C.A.A. women's national basketball championship \n     between Connecticut and Tennessee.\n       ``We rarely do talk with her beforehand,'' said her mother \n     RuthAnn, in section 129 of the Target Center arena. ``But we \n     can guess how she's feeling: anxious.''\n       A couple of hours later, with 28.9 seconds left in the \n     game, RuthAnn and her husband, Dennis, were the obviously \n     anxious ones, as they leaned forward in their seats. Becca, \n     as they call her, was stepping to the free-throw line. It was \n     perhaps the single most important moment in their daughter's \n     brilliant athletic career--no, her brilliant college career.\n       After all, Rebecca Lobo, the 6-foot-4-inch senior forward \n     with the French braid and the determined demeanor, the player \n     who sparked a 70-64 victory in the championship game to \n     complete an undefeated season, is Connecticut's basketball \n     version of Frank Merriwell, Eleanor Roosevelt and Larry Bird \n     all rolled into one. For the last two seasons, she has been \n     first-team all-American. In her spare time, the political \n     science major has been a candidate for a Rhodes scholarship.\n       She epitomizes the women's game, because for the most part \n     the women are truly scholar-athletes, not just jocks majoring \n     in eligibility with dreams only of slam-dunk highlights in \n     the pros.\n       And she is part of a game that is substantially different \n     from the men's game, one in which egos seem to meld into the \n     concept of the team, and which makes the game so satisfying \n     for a basketball fan.\n       And this moment on the free-throw line was what one dreams \n     about, or sweats over. Lobo's Huskies were up by 3 points, \n     65-62. She has a one-and-one: if she makes the first she gets \n     a second.\n       If she misses either, Tennessee is still in the game.\n       Now, Lobo bounces the ball and looks up at the rim.\n       It had been a long, long day for Lobo, a day in which she \n     quickly picked up three fouls and played just eight of the 20 \n     minutes in the first half, scoring just 3 points.\n       And when undefeated Connecticut went into the locker room \n     at halftime, the team was losing by 38-32. It was only the \n     second time this season that UConn was behind at the half, \n     the first being last week in the East regional final, when it \n     came back from a 7-point deficit to beat Virginia.\n       Could the Huskies do it again?\n       Lobo returned to the lineup for the start of the second \n     half, though she still seemed away from the action, affected \n     by her fouls. But her teammates were keeping the team in the \n     game: Jen Rizzotti, the guard who was aptly described as \n     being all ponytail and knee guards, stole a pass, hit a \n     drive; [[Page S5388]] Jamelle Elliott, the junior from \n     Washington's inner city whom Coach Geno Auriemma calls their \n     rock, battled for rebounds and banked in a shot, and Nykesha \n     Sales, the smooth but sometimes nervous freshman, hit a key \n     3-pointer.\n       Then Lobo struck, again and again: she hit a spin shot, \n     threw in a drive, sank a jumper from the left side, and then \n     another from the right side, and Connecticut was back in the \n     ball game, 3 points off the lead, with seven minutes to go.\n       ``When the game is on the line,'' said Pat Summitt, the \n     Tennessee coach, ``you naturally go to your all-American.''\n       One recalled the time last year when Rebecca learned that \n     her mother had breast cancer, and she broke down in tears. \n     Her mother said, ``You do what you have to do, and I'll take \n     care of my end.''\n       RuthAnn's cancer is in remission, and she never misses a \n     game, because Becca says she always wants her there.\n       And so it seemed not unusual for Rebecca to be taking \n     responsibility, on or off the court. RuthAnn remembers a \n     significant moment, when Rebecca was 6 years old, and had \n     taken an eraser from the home of Mrs. Lukasik, a neighbor in \n     Southwick, Mass.\n       ``I told Rebecca that the eraser wasn't hers, and she had \n     to return it,'' RuthAnn said. ``And I watched as she walked, \n     sobbing, to Mrs. Lukasik's house. It broke my heart to see \n     it, but I think it helped her understand right from wrong. \n     And to think about other people.''\n       If there was one criticism Coach Auriemma had of Lobo, it \n     is that she has sometimes thought too much about other \n     people. He had wished her at times to be more selfish, to \n     shoot more. But the blend was there in this game.\n       And now on the free-throw line she had a chance to ice the \n     proceedings. Lobo made her first free throw and with that her \n     teammates on the floor mobbed her. RuthAnn, in section 129 \n     and seated beside Dennis, clasped her hands in anticipation \n     of the second free throw.\n       Rebecca bent, perched the ball near her ear, and let it go. \n     It sailed right through the hoop, giving Connecticut the \n     lead, at 67-62, that they would not relinquish.\n       Shortly after the victory, it was announced that Lobo had \n     been named the outstanding player in the Final Four.\n       It was a hugely satisfying comeback for the Huskies, for a \n     couple sitting in section 129 and for Becca Lobo. The fans \n     cheered, the band blasted, and the team zealously cut down \n     the nets.\n       As for Mrs. Lukasik, one imagines that she still has her \n     eraser and the memory of a little girl who grew up to become \n     a national champion.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5387-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  IN RECOGNITION OF THE ONE-HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY OF FREDERICK BENSON OF \n                            BLOCK ISLAND, RI\n\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege to pay \ntribute to Mr. Frederick Benson of Block Island, RI, in recognition of \nhis one-hundredth birthday on April 14, 1995.\n  In the 92 years Fred has lived on Block Island, since arriving as an \norphan in 1903, he has immersed himself in almost every level of \ncommunity activity on this small, close-knit island. His impressive \nlist of efforts on behalf of the community include service as the \nisland civil defense director for 12 years, police commissioner, first \ncaptain of the local rescue squad, and president of the Chamber of \nCommerce five times. In recognition of his selfless devotion he was \nchosen as Block Island's Man of the Year by the Chamber of Commerce in \n1972.\n  But it is the children of this picturesque wind-swept island, 11 \nmiles off the Rhode Island coast, that have benefited the most from \nFred's unbounded generosity. After winning the lottery in 1976, Fred \nannounced the money would go into a scholarship fund for worthy Block \nIsland students. Since 1977, scores of Block Island High School \ngraduates have been awarded Fred Benson scholarships.\n  Many Block Islanders have fond memories of Fred from their school \ndays. Beginning as the island's high school baseball coach, Fred went \non to teach auto shop, carpentry, machine repair, and driver \ninstruction until he retired at the age of 69. His contributions to the \nyouth of Block Island have extended to many generations, and the island \nis richer for it.\n  I commend Mr. Benson for his years of selfless community service and \nwish all the best to him and his many island friends. Mr. Benson is a \ntruly remarkable man and a distinguished educator. I am proud to honor \nhim on this joyous occasion.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5388-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MARTHA HANSON KILPATRICK\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the \nbest teachers I ever had, Martha Kilpatrick. She taught me at Colbert \nCounty High School and has kept in touch over the years by attending my \ntown meetings in Reform, AL, her hometown, and by sending me letters \nand news clippings from time to time. She is a dear friend to me, and I \nknow she had a great deal to do with guiding me at an early age and \npointing me in the right direction. Her wisdom, advice, and \nencouragement were helpful to me not only as a student long ago, but \nalso throughout the several stages of my career.\n  It might surprise my colleagues to learn that I still have former \nteachers who are alive and well, but Martha is indeed among them. On \nApril 25, she will turn 80, and Reform is planning a gala celebration \nof this milestone in her life, to take place on the 22d at the \nMethodist Church there. She will be surrounded by many friends and \nfamily members, each of whom have been influenced by Martha in special \nand unique ways.\n  Martha Hanson was born in Columbus, MS, and as a baby moved with her \nfamily to Carrollton, AL, where she spent her formative years. Her \nfamily later moved to Reform, where she graduated high school. That \nsame year, she entered Alabama College at Montevallo, now the \nUniversity of Montevallo, where she majored in education. Her entire \ncareer was spent as a teacher in Alabama and Georgia. Her husband, \nWilbur Kilpatrick, was born and raised in Reform, and although they \nlived in a variety of places during their married life, Reform was \nalways home to them.\n  Martha continued her own education in Atlanta, earning her masters \ndegree and teaching in that school system for many years. When their \nchildren, Kay and Joe, were grown, Martha and Wilbur retired and moved \nback to the quiet peace of their roots in Reform, where she remains \ntoday. She has three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n  Her home is a virtual museum of the things she has collected over the \nyears--bottles, stamps, salt and pepper shakers, antique Christmas \nornaments, pictures, linens, glassware, and books. Her husband has \npassed away, and Martha lives alone in the large, comfortable museum of \nher life. She stays busy doing things for others, as she has always \ndone.\n  One of Martha's great characteristics is making and keeping friends. \nShe is perhaps her local post office's best private customer, keeping \nan active correspondence with friends and family all over the world, \nincluding myself. She never forgets birthdays, anniversaries, special \nholidays, and her cards saying ``Get well soon'' or ``With deepest \nsympathy'' are always the first to arrive when a crisis hits.\n  Martha Hanson Kilpatrick has been one of the true treasures of my \nlife and the lives of many others. I am proud to commend her on an \noutstanding life, one that has been lived out in the best American \ntradition, her nurturing of young minds, and her sincere love for \nfamily and friends, whom she counts as her most valuable collection of \nall. As she turns 80 later this month, I trust those many family \nmembers and friends will reflect on the outstanding qualities this \nextraordinary lady has exhibited throughout her life. We can all learn \nfrom her.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5388-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5388-S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ALABAMA BUSINESS CONNECTIONS 1995\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

Mr. President, another thoughtful voice has joined the \ndebate in favor of re-inventing public broadcasting. Jack Kemp has \nwritten an article, published in today's Wall Street Journal, making \nthe case that public broadcasting can be re-invented and become self-\nfunding. This would be a win-win proposition for taxpayers, for \ntelevision and radio audiences, and for the public broadcasting \nindustry.\n  Secretary Kemp's analysis is timely, because through the rescission \nbill Congress has an opportunity to begin an orderly and reasonable \nphasing out of Federal subsidies for public broadcasting. I support the \napproach of the House of Representatives, to begin phasing out the \nsubsidies in a significant measure, now.\n  Secretary Kemp just this week has been named chairman of the new \nNational Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform. This is by \nappointment of Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich. Secretary \nKemp is superbly qualified for this position. I offer Secretary Kemp my \nhearty congratulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nSecretary Kemp's article, entitled ``Privatizing PBS Doesn't Mean \nKilling Big Bird,'' from today's Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                The Wall Street Journal , April 5, 1995\n\n             Privatizing PBS Doesn't Mean Killing Big Bird\n\n                           (By Jack F. Kemp)\n\n       Politics doesn't have to be a zero-sum game, even when it \n     comes to budget cutting--and especially when it comes to as \n     contentious an issue as cutting the public television budget. \n     I believe it's possible to find a compromise where both sides \n     of this debate emerge winners and happy.\n       First, let's look at the impasse we seem to have reached in \n     Congress. On the one hand, we have a new generation of \n     Republicans who are absolutely serious when they talk about \n     limiting the size, scope and power of the federal government. \n     For these ``neo-Federalists,'' it isn't enough that a program \n     have some positive benefits or a committed political \n     constituency (almost all programs do); there must be a \n     compelling reason why the federal government, as opposed to \n     state and local governments, or the private sector, is \n     involved. As they have said, no domestic program, except \n     Social Security, will be exempt from scrutiny.\n       Energizing the neo-federalists is a budget deficit that \n     they have claimed they could get under control, when no one \n     else could--and to a great extent, they realize that their \n     political legitimacy rides on making good on their promise. \n     The almost $300 million yearly subsidy to the Corporation for \n     Public Broadcasting (CPB) will add up to almost a billion \n     dollars over the next three years. That's not chicken feed, \n     even for Big Bird.\n       On the other hand, there are large numbers of people inside \n     and outside Congress who value public broadcasting. Leaving \n     aside for a moment questions of political bias, they have for \n     many years found on the PBS stations quality programming that \n     is hard to find elsewhere. those with young children \n     especially value what I would call the ``trust factor,'' the \n     fact that one can leave one's children watching PBS without \n     having to constantly monitor the TV for fear that they will \n     be exposed to the kind of mind-numbing violence so common on \n     the other stations. For adults, the ``MacNeil-Lehrer \n     Newshour'' provides a similar respite from ``sound-bite'' \n     news programs.\n       What is the solution? It lies, as it so often does, in a \n     growing, technologically expanding private sector--in a \n     future that is bigger than the present, where one person \n     doesn't have to lose for another to gain. Where both sides \n     can be winners.\n       The following is a brief sketch of how the CPB can be \n     privatized in such a way that it emerges stronger, healthier \n     and in a better position to continue the kinds of quality \n     programs that many admire it for.\n       It must first be stressed that ``privatization'' does not \n     mean ``extinction.'' Far from it. Look at Britain's \n     experience: British Airways, British Telecom and British \n     Petroleum are good examples. In our own country, Conrail has \n     benefited from privatization. Privatization is the new rage \n     in our nation's cities and towns because local governments \n     have found that services are often delivered better when they \n     are transferred back to the private sector.\n       The fact is, as many on the side of public broadcasting \n     concede, the CPB, like most government-funded agencies, has \n     its share of waste and redundancy. An analysis by the \n     Twentieth Century Fund found that 75% of its budget went to \n     overhead (including inflated executive salaries). The most \n     expensive, and least necessary, expenses are the number of \n     stations that carry its programming. ABC, the largest \n     network, has 221 stations. NBC has 213. CBS and Fox have 208 \n     and 201 stations, with sometimes as many as four or five \n     signals serving essentially the same market.\n       As part of any privatization scheme, CPB should be asked to \n     choose a core group of, say, 160 stations that would cover \n     the entire country. All other stations would have the \n     opportunity to ``merge'' into the core station that served \n     their market. PBS could shift the licenses of the ``non-\n     core'' stations to commercial usage and auction them off to \n     the highest bidder. The proceeds would go to a National \n     Programming Endowment that would be administered by PBS and \n     used to make the network self-sustaining.\n       Pro-PBSers should realize that spectrum auctions are no \n     small potatoes. Even with the current technology, PBS could \n     garner some $2 billion from auctioning off its redundant \n     stations. But the technology is changing, making each one of \n     these station's signals potentially many times more valuable. \n     Meanwhile, the market is getting more competitive as the \n     newly created networks of United Paramount and Warner Bros. \n     scramble to pick up affiliates--and that pushes value up, \n     too.\n       A conservatively estimated endowment of $2 billion would \n     eliminate PBS's need for federal subsidies. CPB--which \n     currently administers government subsidies to PBS--would no \n     longer need to exist, eliminating an expensive layer of \n     bureaucracy. Certainly, PBS's cushy executive salaries would \n     have to be trimmed to be more in line with the private \n     sector, but each core station would receive increased \n     membership contributions (from the redundant ``non-core'' \n     stations that have been eliminated), as well as corporate and \n     foundation grants. Meanwhile, PBS would, by dint of \n     necessity, become entrepreneurial by developing and owning \n     shows that it would sell around the world, as well as \n     merchandising rights to its children's productions (an area \n     of funding that officials admit they have not taken proper \n     advantage of).\n       Will there be resistance to this plan? Yes, by those who \n     distrust the private sector, no matter what. And by those \n     politicians who like having a PBS station in their district \n     that is required to carry local school board or city council \n     meetings, giving incumbents a free platform. But for those \n     who honestly want to cut the budget deficit, and for those \n     who care about the future of PBS, this is a plan that makes \n     everyone a winner.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5389-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, a little over 40 years ago--January 28, \n1955--the Nation's pre-eminent defender of workers' freedom was founded \nin the basement of Washington's Mayflower Hotel.\n  It was named the National Right to Work Committee, and it was \norganized by a small group of railroad workers and small businessmen. \nThe Right to Work Committee has grown into a proud home for freedom-\nloving Americans who believe that while workers may have the right to \nunionize, no American worker should ever be compelled to join, or even \nsupport, a labor union.\n  Mr. President, upon the founding of the committee, its first \npresident, Congressman Fred A. Hartley, Jr., of New Jersey, declared, \n``[We] will not shrink because of attacks which may be made against us. \nWe intend to do everything [[Page S5390]] possible to educate the \nAmerican people to the perils of compulsory unionism and to encourage \nthem to resist it.''\n  Three years later, in 1958, after piloting the successful fight for \nKansas' Right to Work Law, a dedicated American named Reed Larson left \nhis job as an engineer in Kansas to lead the right to work movement in \nAmerica.\n  At the time, the power of the Big Labor bosses was virtually \nunchecked. By 1965, the unions had rolled up what appeared to be\n a filibuster-proof majority in the U.S. Senate favoring legislation to \nobliterate the one obstacle in their path to total dominance of the \nAmerican work force: State Right to Work Laws.\n\n  Such legislation was Big Labor's number one priority. The bosses were \nbacked by President Lyndon Johnson and the Congressional leadership.\n  But, Mr. President, Reed Larson and the Committee's members refused \nto be intimidated by the power arrayed against them. With the help of \nlegendary Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen and after a fierce 2 \nyear struggle, the Committee defeated the enemies of worker freedom.\n  The fight to preserve State Right to Work laws marked the coming of \nage of the National Right to Work Committee. From that moment on, the \nBig Labor bosses realized that someone was finally going to stand up to \ntheir ceaseless demand for power over the lives of American working men \nand women.\n  As further protection for working Americans, Larson in 1968 founded \nthe National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation to aid workers in \nlegal confrontations with union-boss despots.\n  In the 27 years since, the Foundation has been a leader in protecting \nthe legal rights of workers and has won several significant Supreme \nCourt cases--including the landmark 1988 Beck case which declared that \nforced union dues for politics was unconstitutional.\n  During the 1970s the Committee battled attempts by Big Labor and its \nCongressional allies to throw the net of compulsory unionism over the \nAmerican construction industry with the ``Common Situs'' picketing \nscheme.\n  Big Labor steamrolled this legislation through both the House and \nSenate amid President Ford's Labor Secretary John Dunlop's assurances \nof presidential approval.\n  Against all odds, Reed Larson launched what was at the time the \nlargest grassroots mobilization in American history, flooding the White \nHouse with over 700,000 cards and letters of protest.\n  Despite the pleas of his own Labor Secretary (who resigned shortly \nafterwards) President Ford vetoed the bill.\n  When the Common Situs Picketing bill returned in 1977, Larson rallied \nthe same grassroots coalition he had so painstakingly assembled the \nyear before and did battle with a seemingly stronger Big Labor \npolitical machine.\n  However, Mr. President, in one of the most stunning upsets in \nAmerican\n political history, Right to Work forces emerged victorious in the \nHouse of Representatives by a slim 217 to 205 vote.\n\n  As Reed stated after the vote, ``The history and death of the \ncoercive piece of legislation should serve as a very important lesson \nto powerful union officials . . . seemingly limitless doses of money \nand muscle are no match for the will of the American people.''\n  In 1978, Big Labor was razor close to enacting a so-called ``Labor \nLaw Reform'' bill which would have given union organizers tremendous \npowers to blackmail employers into granting forced-dues contracts.\n  Reed Larson mobilized the majority of Americans opposed to compulsory \nunionism through a massive mail, media, and lobbying campaign which \ngenerated over 4 million cards and letters to the Senate during the \ncourse of the fight.\n  Mr. President, after a marathon of six separate cloture votes in the \nSenate, the labor bosses gave up.\n  Throughout the 1980s, Larson and the Committee kept up their campaign \nto bring the benefits to workers freedom to more and more Americans. \nThat campaign resulted in the successful 1986 referendum making Idaho \nthe Nation's 21st Right to Work State.\n  But the decade of the 1990s opened with yet another big labor power \ngrab.\n  This time it was the Pushbutton Strike bill, or the so-called ``Anti-\nStriker Replacement bill.'' And once again, Reed and the Committee \ncranked up their grassroots network of freedom loving Americans to put \nthe heat on Congress.\n  This bill would have handed union czars new strike powers so they \ncould blackmail employers into signing contracts forcing their workers \nto pay union dues.\n  In response to Larson's letters and phone calls, the Senate was \nflooded with nearly two million cards, letters, faxes, and phone calls.\n  After 3 long years (and four more cloture votes) Larson and the \nCommittee emerged victorious once again.\n  Today, the National Right to Work Committee, 1.9 million members \nstrong and growing, stands on the vanguard for worker freedom and has \ncompiled an outstanding record of commitment to principle and effective \naction.\n  So, Mr. President, I proudly salute the members of the National Right \nto Work Committee--and especially my good friend, Reed Larson, upon his \n35th anniversary as president of the Committee for their unswerving \ndedication and tireless action on behalf of every American's birthright \nnot to be forced to join a labor union to get or keep a job.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5389-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5390-S5396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         COMMERCE COMMITTEE ACTION ON S. 565, PRODUCT LIABILITY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Rather, it built upon the good work of \nSenators Gorton and Rockefeller.\n  I want to have the amendment printed in the Record so that my \ncolleagues have the opportunity to review the legislation over the \nrecess period we are about to begin. I understand the leadership \nintends to take up S. 565 when we return from the recess and I want all \nSenators to have ample time to understand its provisions.\n  In addition to the original provisions contained in S. 565, the \nChairman's mark incorporates the entirety of S. 303, the Biomaterials \nAccess Assurance Act of 1995. Senators Lieberman and McCain introduced \nS. 303 on January 31, 1995 and the bill was referred to the Commerce \nCommittee. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of S. 303. The biomaterials \nprovisions are found in Title II of the Chairman's mark.\n  The Chairman's mark made two other notable changes to S. 565. \nModifications were made to address the vicarious liability of rental \ncar companies and of equipment lessors. Such entities would be treated \nas ``product sellers'' under the mark.\n  Another exception was added to the statute of repose for durable and \ncapital goods used in the workplace. Now, when there is an express \nwarranty in writing as to the safety of the product involved, and the \nwarranty period is longer than the 20 year statue of repose, a product \nliability action is timely for the duration of the warranty.\n  Mr. President, beyond these changes made by the Chairman's mark, \nSenators will find S. 565 remains much as introduced several weeks ago. \nIn other words, it remains very much a product liability reform bill. \nThe Committee did not act to expand the legislation beyond its \njurisdiction--tort reform connected to injuries caused by products in \nthe stream of commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Chairman's mark to S. 565, which the \nCommerce Committee voted to report this morning, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S.565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Product Liability Fairness \n     Act of 1995''.\n     [[Page S5391]]\n     \n                       TITLE I--PRODUCT LIABILITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that [[Page S5394]] the \n     products are properly designed and have adequate warnings or \n     instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to an \nimportant historic landmark. It is the 10th anniversary of Mikhail \nGorbachev's accession to power in Moscow, an event which set in motion \na mostly non-violent process of change that brought down the Iron \nCurtain and Soviet domination of Eastern Europe in 1989, followed two \nyears later by the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself--arguably the \nmost important developments in the second half of the 20th century.\n  Unfortunately, the momentous upheaval of 1989-91 did unleash some \nviolence--most notable and tragically in the former Yugoslavia, and \nalso in the Caucasus, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, in Georgia, and, \nmost recently, in Chechnya. We should not ignore the tragedy or the \ndangers to European security posed by the fighting in the former \nYugoslavia and in the Caucasus, but we should not lose sight of how \nmuch safer we are now than during the Cold War's global confrontation \nwith the Soviet Union and the nuclear balance of terror with its \ndoctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction.\n  Now, 10 years after Gorbachev's rise to power, Russia appears to be \nat another historic crossroad. One path leads toward democratization \nand integration into the global market economy; another points back \ntoward authoritarianism and a sullen, isolated militarism. Russia's \nfuture lies first and foremost in the hands of its own people and their \nleaders. We should have no illusions about our ability to control \nevents there. But we do have some influence. The outcome in Russia is \nstill very important to the United States.\n  Russia will play a major role in determining the future security \nenvironment in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Russia is a key \nplayer in implementing the START I and II strategic force reduction \ntreaties and in preventing nuclear proliferation. The U.S. budget \ndeficit, the peace dividend, defense conversion, the future of NATO, \nand the United States role in the world will all be strongly affected \nby developments in Russia. Also, although Russia's economy is now \nseverely distressed, it is potentially an important market and trading \npartner. Russia is the only country in the world that has more \nbountiful natural resources than the United States, including vast oil \nand gas reserves. It has a large, well-educated labor force and a huge \nscientific establishment. Furthermore, many of Russia's needs--food and \nfood processing, oil and gas extraction, computers, communications, and \ntransportation--are in areas in which the United States is highly \ncompetitive. Thus, although the former Soviet military threat is \ngreatly diminished, we ought not turn our backs on Russia now.\n  Moscow's clumsy but brutal use of military force to regain control of \nthe secessionist republic of Chechnya has triggered a new political \ncrisis for the regime of President Boris Yeltsin, whose support in \nRussian public opinion polls has fallen below 10 percent. Many \nobservers fear that if Chechnya becomes a protracted guerrilla war, it \nwill drag down both Yeltsin and the prospects for reform. It may be too \nearly to write Yeltsin's political obituary. He has made some \nremarkable recoveries in the past. But we also cannot ignore the \npossibility that the post-Yeltsin transition has already begun. In any \ncase, these developments call attention to the importance of the other \nmajor locus of political power in Russia--the parliament.\n  The Yeltsin Constitution of December 1993 created a very powerful \npresidency, but there is also a separation of powers between the \nexecutive and legislative branches that resembles our own system in \nmany ways. The constitutional checks and balances on presidential power \nin Russia are more limited than in the United States, but the \nparliament does have real authority. Historically, the threat of \nauthoritarianism and totalitarianism comes from excessive and \nultimately unlimited executive power. This has certainly been Russia's \nexperience. Whether or not Yeltsin regains his democratic equilibrium, \nand regardless of who succeeds him or when, in the long run, the best \ninstitutional protection against a turn toward authoritarianism in \nRussia is a healthy, independent, and democratically elected \nlegislature. Congress may be able to help the one year-old Russian \nparliament become more effective and democratic.\n  The new Russian Federal Assembly is a bicameral legislature. The \nlower (and more powerful) chamber, the State Duma, has 450 seats, half \nchosen from single-member\n constituencies and half from national party lists based on \nproportional representation. The upper chamber, the Federation Council, \nnominally has 178 seats, two from each [[Page S5397]] of the 89 regions \nand republics of the Russian Federation. Many of its Deputies are \nregional leaders. It does not meet on a continuous, full-time basis and \nis more like the French or German upper chamber than the U.S. Senate. \nDeputies in both chambers serve 4-year terms. The first Federal \nAssembly, however, was elected in December 1993 for only a 2-year term, \nwith new elections due this December.\n\n  After the December 1993 election, it seemed that the Duma might be \ndominated by an anti-democratic coalition of hardline ultranationalists \nand communists. In its first year, however, the parliament avoided \nextreme confrontation with Yeltsin and, despite some missteps, \nsupported some of the Government's key economic reform legislation. \nSurprisingly, the parliament approved Government budgets for 1994 and \n1995 that imposed relatively strict fiscal discipline and sharply \nrestrained defense spending despite intense pressure from the military-\nindustrial complex. The parliament also enacted key parts of a new \ncommercial code and laws protecting property rights.\n  There is strong parliamentary opposition to the Government's actions \nin Chechnya. Many Deputies were angered by Yeltsin's failure to consult \nthem in advance or seek parliamentary approval of a state of emergency. \nBoth chambers voted their disapproval of the assault several times by \nlopsided majorities, calling for the cessation of hostilities and a \npolitical resolution of the conflict. Parliamentary opposition, \nhowever, has had minimal impact on Russian policy in Chechnya, in part \nbecause the Constitution gives predominant power to the president on \nnational security issues.\n  The Federal Assembly is a political training ground in which an \nimportant segment of the post-Yeltsin generation of politicians is \nlearning democratic principles and skills that are not part of \ntraditional Russian political culture, such as compromise and \ncoalition-building, respect for the rule of law and representative \ngovernment. Most Russian Deputies are overwhelmed by the enormity and \nurgency of their legislative responsibilities and the meagerness of \ntheir experience and resources. They know that they have a great deal \nto learn and the majority are not only willing but eager to benefit \nfrom foreign experience, including U.S. experience. Despite, or perhaps \nbecause of, the legacy of the cold war, many Russian Deputies view the \nU.S. Congress as an important and appropriate model. They are also \nstuck by similarities in the size and demographic diversity of our \ncounties and our constitutional systems based on separation of powers, \nbicameralism, and federalism. Imperfect as our own institutions are, \nfrom a Russian perspective they are impressive examples of stability \nand continuity, functioning federalism, and peaceful resolution of \ncompeting political, economic, social, ethnic, and spiritual interests.\n  There is already a significant level of mostly informal travel \nbetween Washington and Moscow by Members of Congress and Russian \nDeputies. This is healthy and should be expanded as much as possible. \nThere are already overtures from the Russian side for committee-to-\ncommittee consultations on issues of mutual interest. Staff \nconsultations, exchanges, and training are another fruitful avenue. \nFrankly, on the American side the constraints are not so much financial \nbut the commitment of time by busy Members. But I would urge my \ncolleagues to think about the potential payoff on a modest investment \nof time in such endeavors. Russian Deputies are so eager to learn about \nU.S. legislative procedure and about the U.S. experience on a wide \nrange of legislative issues. Here is an opportunity to influence \npositively and perhaps even help to shape the procedures, policies, and \nperspectives of the legislature of the world's other nuclear \nsuperpower. This should be done not in spite of the conflict in \nChechnya, but all the more because of it. The Chechen crisis underlines \nthe increased importance of the Russian parliament.\n  The Congressional Research Service is already embarked on an \nambitious program of technical assistance to the Russian Federal \nAssembly. Funded by the Agency for International Development, $3.5 \nmillion over 3 years, beginning in May 1994, with congressional \napproval, the CRS program aims to:\n  Help the Russian Federal Assembly create its own research and \nanalysis capability independent of the executive branch.\n  Enhance the automation and interconnectivity of both chambers of the \nFederal Assembly and the Parliamentary Library.\n  Strengthen the collections and capabilities of the Russian \nParliamentary Library.\n  Provide training in Moscow and Washington for Russian parliamentary \nstaff specializing in automation, research and policy analysis, and \nlegislative drafting.\n  Bring a leadership delegation from both chambers of the Federal \nAssembly to Washington to learn and observe first hand about \ndevelopment and oversight of legislative research and policy analysis.\n  CRS has considerable experience in such activity, having been \ndirected by Congress to provide similar parliamentary assistance \nthrough the Gift of Democracy, to Poland, program, which was \nsubsequently expanded under the House of Representative Special Task \nForce on the Development of Parliamentary Institutions in Eastern \nEurope, to include assistance to the parliaments of Poland, Hungary, \nthe Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and \nAlbania. There is a comparable AID-funded program in Ukraine.\n  These programs have made significant contributions to the development \nof democratic parliamentary institutions in Central and Eastern Europe \nand now hope to do the same in Russia. At the same time, these programs \nprovides CRS and the Congress with literally unique access to and \ninsight into political developments in those countries. It is an \nactivity from which all parties benefit in a variety of ways.\n  The Russian parliamentary leadership delegation that has been invited \nby CRS to visit Capitol Hill in the first week of April 1995 is led by \nMikhail Mityukov, First Deputy Chairman of the Duma and Valerian \nViktorov, Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council, and includes the \nchairmen of five important committees from both chambers.\n  On behalf of the Congress I would like to welcome these distinguished \nvisitors in the spirit of interparliamentary cooperation and exchange.\n  I would also encourage my colleagues to meet with their Russian \ncounterparts to help them gain a deeper appreciation of our legislative \nexperience as well as our shortcomings so that they may benefit both \nfrom our example and from mistakes as they build the foundation of \ntheir own legislature. At the same time, this will give Members an \nunusual opportunity to discuss legislative issues of mutual interest \nwith senior Russian Deputies and to learn first-hand about developments \nin Russia as it struggles to redefine itself politically, economically, \nsocially, and spiritually.\n  This is not only a historic moment for Russia but also a historic \nopportunity for both our countries to redefine the relation between us. \nCooperative interparliamentary relations can play a role in this \nredefinition.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5396-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5397-S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        HONORING THE 1995 KIMBALL HUMANITARIAN AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to three \noutstanding citizens of New Jersey who are being honored by the Kimball \nMedical Center Foundation of Lakewood, NJ on Wednesday, April 12, 1995.\n  At the Ninth Annual Awards Program, Edmund Bennett, Jr., Thomas F. \nKelaher, Esq., and Robert H. Ogle will each receive the Kimball \nHumanitarian Award as a way to recognize ``extraordinary leadership to \nthe nonprofit sector of society, to acknowledge distinguished service \ntowards the advancement of health care, and to honor individuals whose \ndaily lives reflect the essence of humanitarianism.''\n  Today, when the fragile ecology of our social environment is as \nthreatened as that of our natural environment, I am delighted to have \nthe opportunity to pay tribute to the efforts of these three \nindividuals who recognize the importance of civil society. \nCivilizations cannot be constructed out of government and markets \nalone--we must also have a healthy and robust [[Page S5398]] civic \nsector--a place in which the bonds of community can flourish.\n  Edmund Bennett, Thomas Kelaher and Robert Ogle recognize that civil \nsociety is the place where Americans make their home, sustain their \nmarriages and raise their kids. They know that civil society is in our \nschools, fraternities, community centers, churches, PTAs, libraries and \nlocal voluntary associations. They recognize that a sense of common \npurpose and consensus need to be forged to tackle our nations' \nproblems. Civil society is the sphere of our most basic humanity--the \npersonal, everyday realm that is governed by values such as \nresponsibility, trust, fraternity, solidarity and love. With every \nmeeting attended, board sat on, speech delivered and helping hand that \nis extended, these three men challenge the notion that life today is \ntoo fastpaced and global in scope for individuals to make a difference \nin their own communities. I salute Edmund Bennett, Thomas Kelaher and \nRobert Ogle for their spirit of volunteerism, leadership among local \nvoluntary organizations and their continuing contributions to their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5397-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF McCARTER & ENGLISH OF NEWARK, NJ\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nsesquincentennial anniversary of the founding of McCarter & English, \nthe oldest and largest law firm in New Jersey.\n  Originally a small firm with fewer than a dozen lawyers, McCarter & \nEnglish has grown in both size and prominence in the century and a half \nsince its founding. At its current size of 210 lawyers, with five \noffices and a sizable international legal services group, McCarter & \nEnglish has established a reputation as one of the preeminent firms in \nNew Jersey and the country.\n  If you were to ask a member of the New Jersey business community to \ndescribe McCarter & English, they might use the word prestigious or \nperhaps venerable; if you were to ask a New Jersey historian the same \nquestion they would undoubtedly use a much different word and it would \nbe colorful. Since its founding by Thomas Nesbitt McCarter in 1845, \nMcCarter & English's unique history of legal representation has \nincluded: handling legal matters for one of New Jersey's most famous \nhistorical figures, Thomas Alva Edison; defending one-time client Annie \nOakley in a libel case and successfully contesting the New Jersey \nSenate election of 1893.\n  McCarter & English has contributed more than just color to New \nJersey's legal history, it has also provided the State with many fine \npublic and business leaders throughout the 15 decades since its \nfounding. These leaders have included the founder's son Robert, who \nbecame New Jersey attorney general, son Uzal, who founded First \nFidelity Bank and a third son, Thomas Jr. who created Public Service. \nThis history of leadership in both the public and private sector \ncontinues today. McCarter & English plays an on-going leadership role \nin support of charitable, educational, cultural and civic organizations \nin the State. Generous contributions to the New Jersey Center for \nPerforming Arts and other projects have played a vital role in the \nrevitalization of downtown Newark. This commitment to the city of \nNewark, where McCarter & English has been headquartered since it moved \nfrom Newton, Sussex County in 1865, has helped Newark weather difficult \ntimes over the past three decades.\n  McCarter & English has played an historic role in the development of \nNew Jersey's business and legal communities and continues to play a \nvital role in these arenas. Once again, I congratulate McCarter & \nEnglish on its 150th anniversary.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5398-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5398-S5401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n CONFERENCE REPORT ACCOMPANYING S. 244, THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF \n                                  1995\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Conference \nReport on the ``Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995'', S.244, a bill which \nI introduced on January 19, with strong bipartisan support. I \nanticipate that the conference report will be accepted by the Senate. \nThe leadership of the House is eager to take action before the recess. \nRepresentatives of the administration have stated that the President is \nequally eager to sign into law this legislation to substantially \nstrengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and reauthorize \nappropriations for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n[OIRA], which has been without an authorization since October of 1989.\n  Mr. President, before making some observations about the substance of \nthe conference report upon which the Senate is about to act, I would \nlike to briefly share with some of our newer colleagues some highlights \nof the very long march that had to be taken to get us to this point.\n  The effort has spanned more than 5 years, beginning in 1989. In the \nfall of 1989, the small business community sought the assistance of \nmembers of the Committee on Small business to advance a package of \namendments to S. 1742, legislation in the 101st Congress. They asserted \nthat these amendments were desperately needed if the effectiveness of \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act was to be preserved. These proposed \namendments garnered bipartisan support within the Small Business \nCommittee and were advanced during the Governmental Affairs Committee's \nconsideration of the bill. S. 1742 was not passed by the Senate before \nthe end of the 101st Congress.\n  With the beginning of the 102d Congress, I offered the ``Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1991'', the first predecessor to the legislation being \nconsidered today. From the outset, this legislation has garnered strong \nbipartisan support, especially within the membership of the Committee \non Small Business. Successive ranking Republican Members of the \nCommittee on Small Business, including Senators Boschwitz, Kasten, and \nPressler, have all been original cosponsors. My friend from Arkansas \n[Mr. Bumpers], then chairman of the committee, has each time consented \nto serve as the principal Democratic cosponsor.\n  With the introduction of S. 1139, the effort has had the strong \nsupport of a broad Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition, representing \nvirtually every segment of the business community, but especially the \nsmall business community.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about the Paperwork Reduction \nAct Coalition later in my remarks.\n  The 102d Congress ended without seeing any action on S. 1139. \nConsideration of that bill became ensnared in the controversies \nregarding OIRA's regulatory review activities on behalf of the \nPresident, conducted pursuant to executive order, and the activities of \nthe Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Quayle.\n  At the beginning of the 103d Congress, I introduced S. 560, again \nwith strong bipartisan support. Our former colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Danforth, served as the principal Republican cosponsor. Senator \nDanforth had been the principal Republican cosponsor of the legislation \nsponsored by our former colleague from Florida, Lawton Chiles, that \nbecame the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.\n  During the last Congress, real progress was finally made. S. 560 was \nskillfully blended with Senator Glenn's bill, S. 681. Both had the same \nbasic objective--to reauthorize appropriations for OIRA and to \nstrengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Each bill, however, \nreflected substantially different perspectives of how the\n Paperwork Reduction Act should be strengthened. A committee substitute \nfor S. 560 was developed, reflecting the core of both bills. My friend \nfrom Ohio [Mr. Glenn], then chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee displaying skillful leadership and tenacity to break the \nlogjam. Progress would not have been possible without the steadfast \nsupport of my friend from Delaware [Mr. Roth], and many of my \nRepublican friends on the Governmental Affairs Committee. Before the \nend of the last Congress, we were able to have the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1994, S. 244, as amended, approved by the Senate not once but \ntwice in the closing days of the 103d Congress. S. 560 passed the \nSenate by unanimous voice vote on October 6, 1994. The following day, \nthe text of S. 560 was attached to a House-passed measure, and returned \nto the House. Unfortunately, neither bill was cleared for action before \nadjournment of the 103d Congress. [[Page S5399]] \n\n  With the convening of the 104th Congress, I introduced the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995, S. 244, a bill substantially identical to the \ntext of S. 560, as passed by the Senate.\n  A substantially identical House companion, H.R. 830, was introduced \nin the House. H.R. 830 was passed by the House on February 22 by a \nrollcall vote of 418-0.\n  Given all of the bipartisan consensus that had been developed around \nS. 560 during the prior Congress, the Senate was able to promptly turn \nto the consideration of S. 244, following its being unanimously ordered \nreported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs on February 1. On \nMarch 7, the Senate passed S. 244 by a rollcall vote of 99-0.\n  Since the version of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 passed by \nthe House contained virtually all of the provisions of S. 244, as \nreported by the Governmental Affairs Committee, the conferees' focus \nwas on those provisions of the House-passed bill that sought to further \nstrengthen provisions of the 1980 act and the provisions added during \nconsideration on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, the text of S. 244 is truly not the least common \ndenominator of the two versions of the bill, but rather almost an \naggregation of the best features of both. Those who have worked long \nand hard on this effort over the years, within this body, within the \nHouse, and especially the organizations that comprise the Paperwork \nReduction Act Coalition, can be justifiably proud of what has been \naccomplished. Only the fewest of House provisions to further strengthen \nthe 1980 act were not included in the conference report.\n  S. 244 forcefully reaffirms the fundamental congressional objective \nof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980: to minimize the Federal \npaperwork burdens imposed on the public. It improves the act's \neffectiveness as a restraint on the natural tendencies of individual \nFederal agencies to levy a relentless stream of paperwork requirements \non businesses, small and large, State and local governments, \neducational institutions, non-profit organizations, and individual \ncitizens.\n  S. 244 makes a series of specific amendments to the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1980, based upon almost 15 years of experience under \nthe act. These amendments reemphasize the fundamental responsibilities \nof each agency to carefully consider each proposed paperwork \nrequirement to determine if it meets the act's fundamental standards of \nneed and practical utility. And, if needed, assures that the proposed \nrequirement imposes the least burden on those segments of the public \nagainst whom the paperwork requirement is directed.\n  S. 244 also substantially improves the opportunity for public \nparticipation in the review of proposed paperwork burdens. Under the \nchanges made by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the public will \nhave a chance to review and comment on the proposed paperwork \nrequirement, while the agency is conducting its review, so that the \npublic comments or suggestions for a less burdensome alternative \napproach can more effectively influence the final outcome.\n  S. 244 will not merely preserve, but substantially enhance the role \nof OIRA, which was created by the 1980 act. Located within the Office \nof Management and Budget, OIRA was from the outset expected to regulate \nthe regulators in the words of President Carter, when he signed the \norginal Paperwork Reduction Act into law. OIRA brings a Government-wide \nperspective to the act's implementation, serving as both traffic cop \nand honest broker, regarding paperwork requirements advanced by \nindividual Federal agencies without regard to related burdens being \nimposed by other Federal agencies. We all hear complaints that it is \nthe cumulative effect of Federal paperwork burdens that so infuriates \nthe public.\n  To demonstrate congressional confidence in OIRA, the conference \nagreement on S. 244 provides a 6-year authorization of appropriations. \nThe conferees rejection of the provision from the House-passed bill \nproviding a permanent authorization of OIRA's appropriations should not \nbe construed negatively. In fact, most of the pending legislation \nrelating to reform of the regulatory process expands OIRA's role as the \nfocal point within the Executive Office of the President for the fight \nto minimize regulatory and paperwork burdens which Government imposes \non the public.\n  S. 244 begins that process. Under the provisions of the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995, OIRA has more authority and more responsibility \nto spur individual agencies in the direction of minimizing regulatory \npaperwork burdens.\n  For example, S. 244 reaffirms OIRA's authority to prescribe standards \nunder which agencies estimate the number of burden hours imposed by a \nproposed paperwork requirement. Today, too many agency paperwork \nestimates severely underestimate the total burden likely to be imposed. \nIt is not merely the time needed to complete the form. That is just \npart of the burden. The time needed to understand the paperwork \nrequirement, collect the information, and then array it in the manner \nrequested, cannot be ignored. Further, if the paperwork requirement is \nto be a recurring requirement, it may require the establishment of a \nspecial record keeping system and the associated equipment and \npersonnel. S. 244 modifies the Act's definition of burden to capture \nthe full range of regulatory paperwork compliance costs.\n  S. 244 clarifies and strengthens the act's public protection \nfeatures. The act currently permits a member of the public to ignore a \npaperwork collection requirement that does not display a valid OMB \ncontrol number, indicating that the paperwork collection requirement \nhas been approved by OIRA, and that approval has not expired. The \nconference agreement makes explicit that the protection afforded by the \nact may be asserted or raised in the form of a complete defense at any \ntime if the agency should seek to enforce compliance with the \nunapproved collection of information or impose a penalty through \nadministrative or judicial action.\n  The enhanced public protection provision of S. 244 also requires the \nagencies to provide an explicit notice on the form that the public need \nnot comply with a paperwork requirement that fails to display a valid \ncontrol number. Such a warning label should\n help educate the public regarding the protections afforded them by the \nact against unauthorized collections of information.\n\n  The conference agreement reflects another provision of S. 244 \ndesigned to empower individual members of the public to help police \nunauthorized paperwork requirements. Under S. 244, a member of the \npublic empowered to seek a determination from the OIRA Administrator \nregarding whether the manner in which an agency is implementing a \npaperwork requirement is in conformity with the act. The provision \nestablishes response times and provides the OIRA Administrator with \nauthority to seek appropriate remedial action by the agency, if \nwarranted.\n  The conference agreement also includes a substantially strengthened \nrequirement relating to paperwork reduction goals. S. 244 requires the \nestablishment of a Government-wide paperwork burden reduction goal of \nat least ten percent for each of the fiscal years 1996 and 1997. A \nGovernment-wide goal of at least 5 percent would be required in each \nthe fiscal years 1998 through 2001. After the establishment of the \nGovernment-wide goals, goals would be negotiated between OIRA and the \nindividual agencies, which reflect the maximum practicable opportunity \nfor paperwork burden reduction.\n  More important than the simple establishment of more aggressive \nGovernment-wide paperwork reduction goals is the provision adopted from \nthe House-passed bill which will contribute to making them a reality. \nUnder the conference agreement, OIRA's annual report to the Congress \nwould identify those agencies which had failed to attain their burden \nreduction, set forth the reasons given by the agency for such failure, \nand specify the agency's proposals for remedial action.\n  Mr. President, such a burden reduction program is sorely needed. In \nfiscal year 1994, the American people spent more than 6.6 billion hours \nfilling-out forms, answering survey questions, and compiling records \nfor the Federal Government. On the basis of a 40-hour work week, that's \nthe equivalent of 3 million Americans being employed full-time solely \nto meet the Government's [[Page S5400]] paperwork demands. And, these \nare conservative estimates, compiled by OIRA on the basis of the burden \nhour estimates assigned by the agencies to their approved paperwork \nburdens. Burden estimates, which many in the private sector, those on \nthe receiving end of these paperwork demands, believe to be very low. \nThese estimates are contained in an Information Collection Budget, \nannually published by OIRA. Our former colleague, Lawton Chiles, the \nfather of the Paperwork Reduction Act, used the word budget to \nemphasize that Federal paperwork requirements impose real costs on the \npublic and the Nation's economy.\n  Mr. President, at the same time, there can be no doubt that \nGovernment requires information to serve the people. We are in the \nInformation Age. In the words frequently used by my colleague from \nGeorgia the Speaker of the House the ``Third Wave'' is upon us.\n  With respect to Government's real need for information, the key is to \nobtain only what is necessary and to do so in the least burdensome \nmanner. Improving the Government's use of information technology is, \nand should be, an important function of OIRA. It can simultaneously \nlessen the burden of information collection on the public, enhance \nGovernment's effective use of the information collected, and foster \ndissemination of Government information for the benefit of the public. \nAlthough the product of an era in which mechanical typewriters \ndominated Government offices, the Paperwork Reduction Act provides the \nbroad legislative foundation to serve as a key tool for copping with \nthe\n new demands being placed upon the Federal Government. That foundation \nwas broadened and substantially enhanced by the provisions in the \nSenate's version of S. 244 derived from the work of my good friend from \nOhio [Mr. Glenn].\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight one additional point about \nS. 244, although it was not an issue in conference since both versions \nof the bill contained identical language. The Paperwork Reduction Act \nof 1995 clarifies the 1980 Act to make explicit that it applies to \nGovernment-sponsored third-party paperwork burdens. These are \nrecordkeeping, disclosure, or other paperwork burdens that one private \nparty imposes on another private party at the direction of a Federal \nagency.\n  In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that such Government-\nsponsored third-party paperwork burdens were not subject to the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. The Court's decision in Dole versus United \nSteelworkers of America created a potentially vast loophole. The public \ncould be denied the act's protections on the basis of the manner in \nwhich a Federal agency chose to impose a paperwork burden, indirectly \nrather than directly. It is worth noting that Lawton Chiles filed an \namicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that no such exemption for \nthird-party paperwork burdens was intended. Given the plain words of \nthe statute, the Court decided otherwise.\n  S. 244 makes explicit the act's coverage of all Government-sponsored \npaperwork burdens. We can feel confident that this major loophole is \nclosed. But given more than a decade of experience under the act, it is \nprudent to remain vigilant to additional efforts to restrict the act's \nreach and public protections.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, like its predecessor bills, has \nenjoyed the steadfast support of the Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition, \nrepresenting virtually every segment of the business community. \nParticipating in the Coalition are the major national small business \nassociations--the National Federation of Independent Business [NFIB], \nthe Small Business Legislative Council [SBLC], and National Small \nBusiness United [NSBU], as well as the many specialized national \nindividual small business associations, like the American \nSubcontractors Association, that compromise the membership of SBLC or \nNSBU.\n  Other business associations participating in the coalition represent \nmany types of manufacturers, aerospace and electronics firms, \nconstruction firms, providers of professional and technical services, \nretailers of various products and services and the wholesalers and \ndistributors who support them. I would like to identify a few of the \ncoalition's member organizations: the Aerospace Industries Association \n[AIA], the American Consulting Engineers Council [ACEC], the American \nSubcontractors Association [ASA], the Associated Builders and \nContractors [ABC], the Associated General Contractors of America [AGC], \nthe Contract Services Association [CSA], the Electronic Industries \nAssociation [EIA], the Independent Bankers Association of America \n[IBAA], the International Communications Industries Association [ICIA], \nthe National Association of Wholesalers and Distributors, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers [NAM], the National Tooling and Machining \nAssociation [NTMA], the Printing Industries of America [PIA], and the \nProfessional Services Council [PSC].\n  Leadership for the Coalition is being provided by the Council on \nRegulatory and Information Management [C-RIM] and by the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce. C-RIM is the new name for the Business Council on the \nReduction of Paperwork, which has dedicated itself to paperwork \nreduction and regulatory reform issues for a half century.\n  The coalition also includes many other professional associations and \npublic interest groups that support strengthening the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1980. Because of their efforts, two deserve special \nmention. The Association of Records Managers and Administrators [ARMA] \nhave worked long and hard. The conference agreement reflects their \nvaluable contribution--a requirement that any collection of information \nimposing a recordkeeping requirement also specify how long the public \nmust retain the required record. According to ARMA, tens of millions of \ndollars are being wasted in the needless retention of records.\n  The coalition has also been substantially enhanced by the \nparticipation of Citizens for a Sound Economy [CSE]. With this victory \nnearly at hand, CSE has been working hard at reform of the Government's \nbasic regulatory processes.\n  Given the regulatory burdens faced by State and local governments, \nlegislation to strengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act is high on the \nagenda of the various associations representing our Nation's elected \nofficials. As Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, has worked hard for \nthe cause with the National Governors Association [NGA]. NGA adopted a \nresolution in support of this legislation during its 1994 annual \nmeeting, thanks to the work of Governor Chiles and others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record a list \nof the membership of the Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nconference report on S. 244, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                 The Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition\n\n       Aerospace Industries Association of America.\n       Air Transport Association of America.\n       Alliance of American Insurers.\n       American Consulting Engineers Council.\n       American Institute of Merchant Shipping.\n       American Iron and Steel Institute.\n       American Petroleum Institute.\n       American Subcontractors Association.\n       American Telephone & Telegraph.\n       Associated Builders & Contractors.\n       Associated Credit Bureaus.\n       Associated General Contractors of America.\n       Association of Records Managers and Administrators.\n       Association of Manufacturing Technology.\n       Automotive Parts and Accessories Association.\n       Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturers' Association.\n       Bristol Myers.\n       Chemical Manufacturers Association.\n       Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association.\n       Citizens Against Government Waste.\n       Citizens For A Sound Economy.\n       Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association.\n       Contract Services Association of America.\n       Copper & Brass Fabricators Council.\n       Dairy and Food Industries Supply Association.\n       Direct Selling Association.\n       Eastman Kodak Company.\n       Electronic Industries Association.\n       Financial Executives Institute.\n       Food Marketing Institute.\n       Gadsby & Hannah.\n       Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association.\n       General Electric.\n       Glaxo, Inc.\n       Greater Washington Board of Trade.\n       Hardwood Plywood and Veneer Association.

PRESIDENT--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  It is my special pleasure to transmit herewith the Annual Report of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts for the fiscal year 1993.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts has awarded over 100,000 grants \nsince 1965 for arts projects that touch every community in the Nation. \nThrough its grants to individual artists, the agency has helped to \nlaunch and sustain the voice and grace of a generation--such as the \nbrilliance of Rita Dove, now the U.S. Poet Laureate, or the daring of \ndancer Arthur Mitchell. Through its grants to art organizations, it has \nhelped invigorate community arts centers and museums, preserve our folk \nheritage, and advance the performing, literary, and visual arts.\n  Since its inception, the Arts Endowment has believed that all \nchildren should have an education in the arts. Over the past few years, \nthe agency has worked hard to include the arts in our national \neducation reform movement. Today, the arts are helping to lead the way \nin renewing American schools.\n  I have seen first-hand the success story of this small agency. In my \nhome [[Page S5402]] State of Arkansas, the National Endowment for the \nArts worked in partnership with the State arts agency and the private \nsector to bring artists into our schools, to help cities revive \ndowntown centers, and to support opera and jazz, literature and music. \nAll across the United States, the Endowment invests in our cultural \ninstitutions and artists. People in communities small and large in \nevery State have greater opportunities to participate and enjoy the \narts. We all benefit from this increased arts presence, and yet the \ncost is just 65 cents per American. The payback in economic terms has \nalways been several-fold. The payback in human benefit is incalculable.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, April 6, 1995.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5401-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5402-S5403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The United States has always been blessed with an abundance of \nnatural resources. Together with the ingenuity and determination of the \nAmerican people, these resources have formed the basis of our \nprosperity. They have given us the opportunity to feed our people, \npower our industry, create our medicines, and defend our borders--and \nwe have a responsibility to be good stewards of our heritage. In recent \ndecades, however, rapid technological advances and population growth \nhave greatly enhanced our ability to have an impact on our \nsurroundings--and we do not always pause to contemplate the \nconsequences of our actions. Far too often, our short-sighted decisions \ncause the greatest harm to the very people who are least able to \ninfluence them--future generations.\n  We have a moral obligation to represent the interests of those who \nhave no voice in today's decisions--our children and grandchildren. We \nhave a responsibility to see that they inherit a productive and livable \nworld that allows their families to enjoy the same or greater \nopportunities than we ourselves have enjoyed. Those of us who still \nbelieve in the American Dream will settle for no less. Those who say \nthat we cannot afford both a strong economy and a healthy environment \nare ignoring the fact that the two are inextricably linked. Our economy \nwill not remain strong for long if we continue to consume renewable \nresources faster than they can be replenished, or nonrenewable \nresources faster than we can develop substitutes; America's fishing and \ntimber-dependent communities will not survive for long if we destroy \nour fisheries and our forests. Whether the subject is deficit spending \nor the stewardship of our fisheries, the issue is the same: we should \nnot pursue a strategy of short-term gain that will harm future \ngenerations.\n  Senators Henry Jackson and Ed Muskie, and Congressman John Dingell \nunderstood this back in 1969 when they joined together to work for \npassage of the National Environmental Policy Act. At its heart, the \nNational Environmental Policy Act is about our relationship with the \nnatural world, and about our relationship with future generations. For \nthe first time, the National Environmental Policy Act made explicit the \nwidely-held public sentiment that we should live in harmony with nature \nand make decisions that account for future generations as well as for \ntoday. It declared that the Federal Government should work in concert \nwith State and local governments and the citizens of this great Nation \n``to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can \nexist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and \nother requirements of present and future generations of Americans.''\n  Over the past 25 years, America has made great progress in protecting \nthe environment. The air is cleaner in many places than it was, and we \nno longer have rivers that catch on fire. And yet, this year in \nMilwaukee, more than 100 people died from drinking contaminated water, \nand many of our surface waters are still not fit for fishing and \nswimming. One in four Americans still lives near a toxic dump and \nalmost as many breathe air that is unhealthy.\n  In order to continue the progress that we have made and adequately \nprovide for future generations, my Administration is ushering in a new \nera of common sense reforms. We are bringing together Americans from \nall walks of life to find new solutions to protect our health, improve \nour Nation's stewardship of natural resources, and provide lasting \neconomic opportunities for ourselves and for our children. We are \nreinventing environmental programs to make them work better and cost \nless.\n  My Administration is ushering in a new era of environmental reforms \nin many ways. Following is a description of a few of these reforms, \ngrouped into three clusters: first, stronger and\n smarter health protection programs such as my proposed Superfund \nreforms and EPA's New common sense approach to regulation: second, new \napproaches to resource management, such as our Northwest forest plan, \nthat provide better stewardship of our natural resources and sustained \neconomic opportunity; and third, the promotion of innovative \nenvironmental technologies, for healthier air and water as well as \nstronger economic growth now and in the future.\n\n  Stronger and Smarter Health Protection Programs.--Throughout my \nAdministration, we have been refining Government, striving to make it \nwork better and cost less. One of the best places to apply this \nprinciple in the environmental arena is the Superfund program. For far \ntoo long, far too many Superfund dollars have been spent on lawyers and \nnot nearly enough have been spent on clean-up. I've directed my \nAdministration to reform this program by cutting legal costs, \nincreasing community involvement, and cleaning up toxic dumps more \nquickly. The reformed Superfund program will be faster, fairer and more \nefficient--and it will put more land back into productive community \nuse.\n  Similarly, EPA is embarking on a new strategy to make environmental \nand health regulation work better and cost less. This new common sense \napproach has the potential to revolutionize the way we write \nenvironmental regulations. First, EPA will not seek to adopt \nenvironmental standards in a vacuum. Instead, all the affected \nstakeholders--representatives of industry, labor, State governments, \nand the environmental community--will be involved from the beginning. \nSecond, we will replace one-size-fits-all regulations with a focus on \nresults achieved with flexible means. And at last, we're taking a \nconsistent, comprehensive approach. With the old piecemeal approach, \nthe water rules were written in isolation of the air rules and the \nwaste rules, and too often led to results that merely shuffled and \nshifted pollutants--results that had too little health protection at \ntwo great a cost. With its new common sense approach. EPA will address \nthe full range of environmental and health impacts of a given \nindustry--steel or electronics for example--to get cleaner, faster, and \ncheapter results.\n  Better Stewardship of our Natural Resources.--Just as representative \nof our new approach to the environment--and just as grounded in common \nsense--is the Administration's commitment to ecosystems management of \nthe Nation's natural resources. For decades ecologists have known that \nwhat we do with one resource affects the others. For instance, the way \nwe manage a forest has very real consequences for the quality of the \nrivers that run through the forest, very real consequences for the \nfishermen who depend on that water for their livelihood, and very real \nconsequences for the health of the community downstream. But until \nrecently, government operations failed to account adequately for such \ninteraction. In many cases, several Federal agencies operated \nindependently in the same area under different rules. In many cases, no \none paused to ponder the negative consequences of their actions until \nit was too late.\n  Often, these consequences were catastrophic, leading to ecological \nand economic train wrecks such as the collapse of fisheries along the \ncoasts, or the conflict over timber cutting in the Pacific Northwest. \nWhen I convened [[Page S5403]] the forest Conference earlier this year \nI saw the devastating effects of the Federal Government's lack of \nforesight and failure to provide leadership. Here, perhaps more than \nanywhere else, is a case study in how a failure to anticipate the \nconsequences of our actions on the natural environment can be \ndevastating to our livelihoods in the years ahead. Our forest plan is a \nbalanced and comprehensive program to put people back to work and \nprotect ancient forests and future generations. It will not solve all \nof the region's problems but it is a strong first step at restoring \nboth the long-term health of the region's ecosystem and the regions \neconomy.\n  Innovative Environmental Technologies--Environmental and health \nreforms such as EPA's common sense strategy and natural resource \nreforms such as the forest plan provide an opportunity, and an \nobligation, to make good decisions for today that continue to pay off \nfor generations to come. In much the same way, sound investments in \nenvironmental technology can ensure that we leave to future generations \na productive, livable world. Every innovation in environmental \ntechnology opens up a new expanse of economic and environmental \npossibilities, making it possible to accomplish goals that have eluded \nus in the past. From the very beginning, I have promoted innovative \nenvironmental technologies as a top priority. We've launched a series \nof environmental technology initiatives, issued a number of Executive \norders to help spur the application of these technologies, and taken \nconcrete steps to promote their export. Experts say the world market \nfor environmental technology is nearly $300 billion today and that it \nmay double by the year 2000. Every dollar we invest in environmental \ntechnology will pay off in a healthier environment worldwide, in \ngreater market share for U.S. companies, and in more jobs for American \nworkers.\n  Innovations in environmental technology can be the bridge that \ncarries us from the threat of greater health crises and ecological \ndestruction toward the promise of greater economic prosperity and \nsocial well-being. Innovation by innovation, we can build a world \ntransformed by human ingenuity and creativity--a world in which \neconomic activity and the natural environment support and sustain one \nanother.\n  This is the vision that Jackson, Muskie, and Dingell articulated more \nthan two decades ago when they wrote in the National Environmental \nPolicy Act that we should strive to live in productive harmony with \nnature and seek to fulfill the social and economic needs of future \ngenerations. We share a common responsibility to see beyond the urgent \npressures of today and think of the future. We share a common \nresponsibility to speak for our children, so that they inherent a world \nfilled with the same opportunity that we had. This is the vision for \nwhich we work today and the guiding principle behind my \nAdministration's environmental policies.\n                                                   William J.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nprograms of research regarding Parkinson's disease, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n THE MORRIS K. UDALL PARKINSON'S RESEARCH ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION ACT \n                                OF 1995\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, if you want to know more about \nParkinson's disease all you have to do is read the newspaper or watch \nthe nightly news. You don't even have to read the whole paper, the \ninformation is usually on page 1. Prestigious and international papers \nsuch as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal believe that the \nnews is worthy of front page coverage. ``Prime Time'' had a feature on \nParkinson's, and our very own Washington Post devoted three pages to \npromising new developments. What has caused the media fervor is the \nexciting new and dramatic medical discoveries in the field of neurology \nand neurosurgery. As I speak, scientists are uncovering new important \ndata on nerve cell function and repair. Our biomedical research teams \nare on the cusp of breaking the code to nerve regeneration.\n  In these times of exciting new developments, we are unfortunately \nencountering a financial impediment. Last year, the Federal funding for \nParkinson's disease at the NIH was $26 million. To put that number in \nprospective, the annual Federal budget for Alzheimers is $300 million, \n$1 billion each for cancer and heart disease. Our commitment to \neradicating Parkinson's disease is minuscule in comparison. I cannot \nunderstand the lack of financial support for a disease that affects \nover 1 million Americans and costs our society over $6 billion a year. \nThis disease is so widespread that each one of us has a close friend or \nloved one who is facing the challenge of life with Parkinson's. We must \nchange our message to the American public and declare that increased \nFederal funding for Parkinson's disease research is a worthy investment \nin the future health of our Nation. [[Page S5405]] \n  Today, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation that accomplishes that \ngoal. The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research, Assistance, and \nEducation Act of 1995, increases the Federal investment in Parkinson's \nresearch to $100 million for fiscal year 1996. The bill establishes an \nInteragency Coordinating Council, composed of representatives from the \nrelevant agencies and NIH, which will develop a strategic plan for \nParkinson's research.\n  At the heart of the bill is the funding of Morris K. Udall \nParkinson's Centers which will conduct basic and clinical research and \npatient care. Having these three individual areas of research and \ntreatment linked in a center will assure that the research developments \nwill be coordinated and the quality of patient care will be greatly \nimproved. In addition, the centers may develop teaching programs for \nhealth professionals and\n dissemination programs for public information. To compile necessary \ndata on patients and their families a clearinghouse will be \nestablished. Morris K. Udall Leadership and Excellence Awards will be \ngranted to scientists who excel in Parkinson's research. Finally, a \nnational Parkinson's Disease Education Program will be established to \nprovide technical assistance to advocacy groups and facilitate public \nunderstanding of Parkinson's.\n\n  This important legislation honors Mo Udall, a dedicated Congressman \nfrom the Second District in Arizona. For 30 years, Mo represented his \nconstituents with integrity, compassion, and humor. He is remembered \nfor his stewardship of the public lands by setting aside millions of \nacres of wilderness. He also championed civil rights and political \nreform. In 1980, Congressman Udall was diagnosed with Parkinson's \ndisease, and struggled with the neurologic decay for years. He resigned \nfrom Congress in 1991, his career prematurely and tragically ended. \nOther famous individuals such as Mohammed Ali and Harry S Truman have \nall succumbed to this disease which knows no boundaries and strikes \nwithout warning.\n  For Mo Udall and the millions of Americans who suffer from \nParkinson's, we must enact this legislation now. By uniting the \nadvocacy groups, the scientists, the caregivers, the patients and their \nfamilies, we can become a solidified and cohesive group dedicated to \nalleviating the hardship of Parkinson's. We must give our world-\nrespected researchers the funding and the time to combat this and other \nneurological diseases, and improve the future health of all Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill, a section-by-section summary, \nvarious letters of support, and two newspaper articles appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 684\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Morris K. Udall Parkinson's \n     Research, Assistance, and Education Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Parkinson's disease and related disorders (hereafter \n     referred to in this Act as ``Parkinson's'') is a neurological \n     disorder affecting as many as 1,500,000 Americans.\n       (2) Approximately 40 percent of persons with Parkinson's \n     are under the age of 60.\n       (3) While science has yet to determine what causes the \n     disease, research has found that cells that produce a \n     neurochemical called dopamine inexplicably degenerate, \n     causing uncontrollable tremors, muscle stiffness, and loss of \n     motor function.\n       (4) Eventually, Parkinson's renders the afflicted \n     individuals incapable of caring for themselves. In addition \n     to causing disability and suffering for the afflicted \n     individuals, Parkinson's places tremendous and prolonged \n     physical, emotional, and financial strain on family and loved \n     ones.\n       (5) It is estimated that the disease costs society nearly \n     $6,000,000,000 annually.\n       (6) To date, the federally funded research effort has been \n     grossly underfunded. Only $26,000,000 is allocated \n     specifically for research on Parkinson's, or only about one \n     dollar for every $200 in annual societal costs.\n       (7) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n     potential for finding a cure or effective treatment, the \n     Federal investment in Parkinson's must be expanded, as well \n     as the coordination strengthened among the National \n     Institutes of Health research institutes.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide for \n     the expansion and coordination of research concerning \n     Parkinson's, and to improve care and assistance for afflicted \n     individuals and their family caregivers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Thank you from the bottom of our \n     hearts for your great leadership in authoring the Morris K. \n     Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act.\n       The impact of Parkinson's disease on its victims and their \n     loved ones is devastating. As Parkinson's neurologic \n     devastation progresses, it leaves its targets with increasing \n     difficulty with every simple motor function. That process \n     changes forever the lives, the careers and the dreams of the \n     million Americans who suffer from Parkinson's, and millions \n     more loved ones.\n       Moreover, it causes Parkinson's victims and their families \n     to drop out of public life, so consumed are they with the \n     struggle to survive.\n       Scientists promise that the cure of Parkinson's is very \n     near--as long as adequate support for research is available. \n     Unfortunately, this great need for research support has been \n     neglected by our government in the past.\n       Your legislation can end this deadlock, by giving the \n     research community the support they need to deliver our cure.\n       Words are inadequate to express our profound gratitude for \n     this bill. Equally profound is our determination to do \n     whatever it takes to ensure swift enactment of this \n     legislation, so that our suffering community can be rescued. \n     We commit to you that we no longer will be an invisible \n     community, so that our suffering will be recognized and \n     ended.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne J. Udall,\n       Chair.\n     Joan I. Samuelson,\n       President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    The American Parkinson Disease\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC., April 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The American Parkinson Disease \n     Association and the more than 1 million people with \n     Parkinson's and their families, commend and enthusiastically \n     support the introduction of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's \n     Research, Education & Assistance Act to the 104th Congress.\n       Your introduction of this bill; the first legislative \n     initiative to strengthen the federal Parkinson's research \n     program, will ensure proper funding and coordination of \n     Parkinson's research. The current science gives us hope that \n     major breakthroughs are within reach. We can no longer ignore \n     the tremendous scientific potential.\n       The Udall Bill will assure that scientific advances are \n     able to move to the stage of treating and curing people with \n     Parkinson's.\n       Thank you for your leadership and initiative embodied in \n     this legislation, as we work together to achieve the ultimate \n     goal--a cure for Parkinson's.\n           Sincerely,\n     Salvatore J. Esposito, Jr.,\n           President, Board of Directors.\n     Frank L. Williams,\n       Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Oregon Health    \n                                              Sciences University,\n\n\n                                   Parkinson Center of Oregon,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Your introduction of the ``Morris K. \n     Udall Parkinson's Research Assistance and Education Act'' \n     could not have come at a more opportune time. Medical \n     scientists need support to follow up on some very important \n     clues into the cause and treatment of Parkinson's disease and \n     related neurodegenerative disorders. We have a greater \n     understanding of Parkinson's disease in comparison to other \n     neurodegenerative disorders; medical scientists are closer to \n     breakthroughs in the understanding of the cause and treatment \n     of Parkinson's disease, which could serve as a model for \n     similar approaches in the other disorders such as Alzheimer's \n     disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.\n       I am particularly pleased that not only does the bill fund \n     research centers but also productive biomedical researchers \n     with good ideas who can train younger, promising \n     investigators to continue the work. The data system and \n     information and clearing house provided in the bill will be a \n     valuable tool for facilitating the work of the scientists.\n       Because Parkinson's disease is a chronic disorder that \n     consumes valuable family and community resources, the \n     education program is also extremely important. We need to \n     facilitate the delivery of education and assistance to the \n     families and communities struggling with this debilitating \n     disease.\n       Thank you again for providing the leadership to provide the \n     much needed support to conquer Parkinson's disease and \n     related degenerative disorders.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         John P. Hammerstad, M.D.,\n                                           Professor of Neurology.\n     [[Page S5407]]\n     \n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                     WILL-COPE    \n                                     (Williamette Columbia    \n\n                                        Parkinsonian Society),\n\n                                                    April 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: We are delighted to learn of your \n     intention to introduce a revised version of the Morris K. \n     Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act.\n       Parkinson's disease steals the golden years from many of us \n     and is taking away the economic productive lives of younger-\n     onset Parkinsonians. We know what causes our tremors and \n     makes our bodies freeze but research has not yet provided the \n     cause. Without this needed research, many fine people are \n     trapped in bodies that limit their potential.\n       Nationwide there are approximately one million Parkinson's \n     patients. U.S. support for research for research of this \n     condition amounts to less than $30.00 per patient which is \n     far less than the help other diseases receive.\n       Please continue with whatever actions are needed to secure \n     additional Federal funds for continued research towards \n     finding an early cure for this dreaded condition.\n       Our thanks for your attention, efforts and support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      L.R. Greger,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            University of Colorado\n\n\n                                       Health Sciences Center,\n\n                                       Denver, CO, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I wish you well with your bill, the \n     Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act, which \n     you will reintroduce to the Senate on April 6th. As a \n     physician and scientist who has spent the last 20 years \n     trying to improve the treatment of Parkinson's disease, I am \n     delighted to see a proposal which recognizes that Parkinson's \n     disease may be cured if adequate resources are devoted to the \n     problem for the next few years.\n       Even with the current low level of Federal research support \n     for Parkinson's disease, this disease is still the neurologic \n     disorder most likely to be cured in the next decade. While \n     neural transplantation with fetal tissue has already been \n     shown to produce substantial clinical benefit in some \n     patients, genetically engineered alternatives to fetal cells \n     offer promise to supply a limitless amount of tissue for \n     brain repair. These and other fundamental breakthroughs will \n     certainly occur with accelerated research.\n       Your bill recognizes this unusual opportunity. If we can \n     cure Parkinson's disease, the lessons that we learn will \n     apply to many other disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, \n     Huntington's disease, and epilepsy. Research in other areas \n     such as diabetes will also be benefited.\n       Although we live in a time of fiscal constraint, I can \n     assure you that money spent on research for Parkinson's \n     disease will be repaid many times over by increased \n     productivity and reduced medical costs. Research success will \n     take people who are frozen invalids and give them back the \n     freedom to move.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                          Curt R. Freed, M.D.,\n\n         Professor and Head, Division of Clinical Pharmacology and \n           Toxicology.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Springfield, MO,\n\n                                                    April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Mel Hancock,\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Hancock: On July 19, 1994 Senator Mark O. \n     Hatfield and Congressman Henry Waxman introduced the Morris \n     K. Udall Parkinson's Research, Education and Assistance Act \n     of 1994. (S. 2294 & H. 4789) This bill is critical to the \n     Parkinson's community. We are seeking strong support for this \n     bill and would like your cosponsorship.\n       The Udall Bill would establish research and education \n     centers, promote a coordinated research agenda, establish \n     research and training grants and establish a national \n     education program.\n       More than 1 million Americans are afflicted with \n     Parkinson's disease. Approximately 50,000 Americans are \n     diagnosed with Parkinson's each year. Parkinson's disease is \n     estimated to cost the U.S. $6 billion a year in direct \n     health-related expenses, lost productivity and indirect \n     disability costs.\n       I am able to speak in regard to this matter with authority \n     and experience. Three years ago my family was virtually torn \n     apart when I received the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease at \n     the early age of 37. Four years prior to my diagnosis, I went \n     through many emotional ups and downs, expensive tests and 4 \n     different doctors. I was a hard-working career mom with two \n     teenage daughters and a 10 year old son. Two weeks after my \n     diagnosis my oldest daughter ran away. With increasing \n     disability, I had to leave my job at the Prosecuting \n     Attorneys Office 8 months ago which I truly loved and still \n     miss every day. In a year and a half I will lose my benefits \n     with my previous job and my family will be responsible to \n     pick up the costs of sky-rocketing prescription costs. At the \n     present time my health care pays $418 for my drug treatment \n     which will only increase with progression. We are scared, \n     really scared and no longer make plans for our future. Do we \n     even have a future?\n       I urge you to co-sponsor the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's \n     Research, Education and Assistance Act of 1994 to give my \n     family and so many families HOPE! I look forward to hearing \n     your views on this subject.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karen Kidwell.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        The Parkinson's Institute,\n                                    Sunnydale, CA, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I strongly support and applaud your \n     re-introduction of the ``Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research \n     and Education Act'' to the U.S. Senate. I am a neurologist \n     who treats a large number of patients with Parkinson's \n     disease and I know first hand of their suffering. In my view, \n     passage of this bill would greatly bolster promising research \n     efforts that are now in limbo because of reduced funding by \n     NIH and others.\n       A few areas of research that would benefit if this bill \n     were to pass include: 1) a project testing several compounds \n     that have been shown to revive damaged dopamine producing \n     neurons in several models of Parkinson's disease, 2) a \n     project aimed at testing the possibility of inducing certain \n     brain cells to produce dopamine by directly injecting \n     specific genes into the brain, 3) several projects \n     investigating possible genetic factors that might predispose \n     to the disease, 4) a project aimed at discovering the \n     underlying mechanisms of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's \n     disease. All of these projects are very promising, but are \n     suffering because of insufficient funding.\n       I do hope that Congress will recognize the compelling \n     arguments for this legislation. I commend your efforts as \n     well as those of Ms. Samuelson and all who have supported \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     James W. Tetrud, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                American Parkinson\n\n\n                                          Disease Association,\n\n                                    Salisbury, MD, March 30, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield and other Members of the Senate: We, \n     the Parkinsonians and the caregivers of the Delmarva Chapter/\n     Support Group of the American Parkinson Disease Association, \n     strongly support and encourage passage of the Morris K. Udall \n     Parkinson's Research, Assistance, and Education Act of 1995 \n     and hope that adequate funding will follow.\n       Parkinson's disease is stealing the ``golden years'' from \n     many in our group, and, increasingly, is taking away the \n     economic productive life of the young-onset Parkinsonians and \n     many caregiver children. We know the thief who causes our \n     tremors and makes our bodies writhe or freeze, but we do not \n     know where he comes from or how to rid ourselves of him. \n     Research does not guarantee our finding the cause or the \n     cure, but, without medical research, we can be sure we will \n     never know where Parkinson's disease comes from.\n       We want to help ourselves, but we can do only so much. I \n     give financially in spite of an early unplanned Parkinson's \n     induced retirement. I give my time as a local hospital \n     volunteer worker; as president of the Delmarva Pakinson's \n     chapter/support group; and as writer, editor, printer, and \n     circulation manager of the monthly Parkinson's Newsletter \n     with a complimentary circulation of 483 [March 1995] which \n     carries chapter news, hints for coping with Parkinson's, and \n     a synopsis of research. I give myself. Since 1991 I have been \n     a ``guinea pig'' in two double blind Parkinson's experimental \n     drug tests at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New \n     Brunswick, New Jersey; been a subject in a PET scan \n     Parkinson's diagnosis experiment at Johns Hopkins in \n     Baltimore which resulted in a medical journal article; and \n     participated in a Parkinson's olfactory test experiment at \n     Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia. It is not enough.\n       We need help. A national investment now in finding the \n     cause and cure for Parkinson's should pay off in better and \n     more productive lives for us and future Parkinsonians.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Will Johnston,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Delmarva Chapter/Support Group.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      University of Minnesota,\n\n                                  Minneapolis, MN, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I have recently learned that you \n     will re-introduce the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research \n     and Education Act. I am writing to show my strong support for \n     this bill.\n       I am a Ph.D. candidate in Neuroscience at the University of \n     Minnesota. My research work for my thesis is on the cellular \n     mechanisms involved in the death of brain cells and novel \n     protective therapies that can be utilized to prevent cell \n     death. As you know, the hallmark of Parkinson's disease is \n     the death of the dopamine-producing cells (neurons) in the \n     brain. [[Page S5408]] \n       This is an extremely exciting time in neuroscience \n     research. Breakthroughs in our understanding of how the brain \n     functions in normal and diseased states as well as new \n     therapies to treat neurological disorders are occurring at an \n     unprecedented pace. Research relating to Parkinson's disease \n     (PD) is at an especially exciting crossroads, since we \n     understand more about PD than many other neurological \n     disorders. Novel therapies, such as neural tissue \n     transplantation, selective neural ablation techniques, and \n     protective drug therapies, are being aggressively studied in \n     laboratories at the University of Minnesota, as well as in \n     laboratories across the country. These important studies hold \n     hope and promise for the more than 1 million people in the \n     United States who have Parkinson's disease, as well as the \n     many more people in the next generation destined to be struck \n     down with this devastating disease.\n       I would like to make one additional point about this type \n     of neuroscience research. The death of neurons in Parkinson's \n     disease undoubtedly employs cellular mechanisms similar to \n     that which occurs in many other neurodegenerative diseases. \n     Therefore, advances made in Parkinson's disease research \n     today will be applicable to many, many other neurological \n     diseases. The knowledge gained will advance the research on \n     diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, as \n     well as stroke and cerebral palsy, to name just a few. This \n     bill promises to give a boost to so many areas of \n     neuroscience research which affect each and every one of us.\n       Thank you for your attention and your support of these \n     important efforts. Please contact me if there is anything \n     that I might do to answer questions or to help facilitate the \n     passage of this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elizabeth M. Jansen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Axion Research Foundation,\n\n                                        Hamden, CT, April 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The Axion Research Foundation, its \n     supporters, and researchers are most grateful to you and \n     other supporters for the re-introduction of the Morris K. \n     Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act.\n       Our Foundation has played an important role in carrying out \n     and funding important breakthroughs related to cellular and \n     genetic brain circuit restorations as possible treatments for \n     Parkinson's disease. We have recently helped to develop the \n     first practical diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease, \n     which should dramatically facilitate studies aimed at \n     determining its cause. Other research areas also offer great \n     promise at the present time. But it is clear that the \n     combined efforts of the private sector and the federal \n     government must increase to produce clinical benefits for \n     patients and the reduction of health care costs which would \n     result from a cure.\n       The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act \n     is a great step in the right direction and will be eagerly \n     supported by patients, their families, and neuroscience \n     researchers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     D.

Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: As director of the Neural Transplant \n     Program at Yale University, I am writing to thank you and \n     other supporters for re-introducing the Morris K. Udall \n     Parkinson's Research and Education Act to the 104th Congress.\n       This is a particularly exciting period of research in which \n     novel treatments for Parkinson's disease are being developed \n     and evaluated, and research is progressing to determine the \n     cause of the disease. Although there is potential for \n     incredible breakthroughs, such progress is not inevitable. \n     Without funding, the breakthroughs might never happen. \n     Techniques for cellular and genetic reconstruction of neural \n     circuits which are being developed in our research and \n     elsewhere may some day be applicable to other neurological \n     and medical diseases as well.\n       I hope that you will be able to explain to your colleagues \n     in the Congress that this investment in research will save \n     money on health care and increase productivity from people \n     who now become incapacitated over a period of many years.\n       This excellent legislation will not be helpful unless it \n     actually adds dollars to the funding relevant to this \n     disease, and does not shift funding from investigator-\n     initiated basic science projects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     D.

Udall Parksinson's Research and Education Act.\n\n     The Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of my fellow directors of \n     the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), I am writing to \n     thank you and to support your introduction of this bill.\n       The authorization of funds to launch a Parkinson's research \n     initiative, coordinating between the several institutes now \n     conducting research in Parkinson's disease, would give added \n     impetus to the efforts of scientists to improve their \n     understanding of this debilitating illness. Although PDF \n     scientists are working to improve our understanding of the \n     brain, we still do not know what causes people to develop the \n     illness, so we cannot develop a cure. The boost to the \n     research effort that the establishment of the Morris K. Udall \n     Research Centers would provide would allow for additional \n     resources toward our goal: to find the cause and then the \n     cure.\n       As our population ages, there is no doubt that the \n     prevalence of Parkinson's disease will increase. It is, \n     therefore, imperative to work together towards a breakthrough \n     in Parkinson's disease. Only the federal government can \n     provide sufficient financial support and leadership to \n     sustain a coordinated approach to the search for the cause \n     and cure.\n       Your leadership, and that of your Congressional supporters, \n     are deeply appreciated by all of us who seek to improve the \n     quality of life of those afflicted with Parkinson's and \n     related disorders.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                                Page Morton Black,\n     Chairman of the Board.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Movers & Shakers, Young\n\n\n                                  Parkinson's Support Network,\n\n                                     San Diego, CA, April 4, 1995.\n     The Morris K. Udall Parkisnon's Research and Education Act.\n\n     Senator Mark Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Parkinson's disease and related \n     neurological disorders are said to cost society $6 billion \n     annually. This monetary cost, although staggering, is \n     minuscule when compared to the human suffering these \n     disorders inflict on the patient and family. Research is \n     needed to push ever closer to finding the cause and the cure \n     for these disorders. In the mean time quality of life can be \n     raised through education of patients, care givers and \n     community support services.\n       The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act \n     allows Congress to embark on a major effort to increase the \n     knowledge of the causes, treatments and cures for these \n     disorders. It further sets patient, care giver, support \n     services and community understanding as a priority in raising \n     the quality of life of those affected by these disorders. The \n     1990's form the Decade of the Brain. It is only fitting that \n     Congress move swiftly to enact this important legislative \n     initiative for it symbolizes hope of major breakthroughs for \n     the millions of Americans affected by these disorders.\n       I commend you for your leadership in this very important \n     legislative initiative. Your leadership is much appreciated \n     and supported by the Young Parkinson's Support Network of \n     California.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom G. Brown,\n       President.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alan L. Bonander,\n       Past President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 4, 1995]\n\n                     Diseases That Attack the Brain\n\n                            (By Rick Weiss)\n\n       She was a retired Swedish lawyer, 69, and during the past \n     eight years she had sunk into the foggy oblivion of \n     Alzheimer's disease. Long gone were the details of case law \n     and logic upon which she had built her career. Now she was \n     housebound and confused, unable to survive without round-the-\n     clock care.\n       He was a 45-year-old high school teacher and basketball \n     coach in Wisconsin who began to notice a loss of strength in \n     his hands--some difficulty unscrewing jars or turning house \n     keys. Then he watched in despair over a period of months as \n     the muscles in his arms and neck grew flaccid and weak. The \n     diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's \n     disease, the paralytic syndrome that stole the strength and \n     ultimately the life of the baseball great.\n       The alzheimer analogy is apt. Viewed under a microscope, \n     nerve cells look a lot like trees and shrubs, with \n     bifurcating roots and boughs sprouting from either end of a \n     stem or trunk. As every gardener knows, fertilizer is the key \n     to growth, and scientists have long assumed that the body \n     makes its own neural nutrients--in great quantities, no \n     doubt, during embryo development, but perhaps in smaller \n     maintenance doses throughout life.\n       The challenge faced by neuroscientists pursuing nerve \n     regeneration was to identify those naturally occurring \n     products and mass produce them in the laboratory so they \n     could be given as drugs.\n       In their quest to discover such substances, researchers \n     have gone to great and gory lengths.\n       Figuring the best place to look for a nerve nurturing \n     compound was around nerve cells themselves, one team ground \n     up 100 pig brains. They distilled from that mass less than a \n     drop of a rare brain chemical called BDNF, which does indeed \n     now show promise as drug to protect nerves in patients with \n     Lou Gehrig's disease.\n       Another team teased thousands of sciatic nerves from the \n     legs of rats, then ground the nerves up to get a smidgen of \n     something they call CNTF, which is also now in clinical \n     trials in Lou Gehrig's patients. [[Page S5409]] \n       Yet another group isolated a potent nerve growth factor \n     from the juices of hundreds of mouse salivary glands. Saliva, \n     it turns out, is rich in natural healing compounds--a fact \n     that may explain the propensity of animals to lick one's \n     wounds. The salivary substance, known as NGF, is now being \n     tested in diabetics with peripheral neuropathy and in a \n     handful of patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n       Then there was the 63-year-old woman from Stockholm with \n     Parkinson's disease. For the past 19 years her condition had \n     gradually worsened, despite treatment with the best available \n     drugs, like L-dopa. At times now her entire body would \n     suddenly freeze up, becoming so rigid she would crash to the \n     floor. At other times her hands trembled so severely and her \n     head shook so much that she felt as though the whole world \n     were crumbling.\n       Three patients with three very different diseases. But all \n     of them have one thing in common: They are among the first to \n     enter a radical new field of medicine, in which doctors are \n     using a novel class of drugs to regenerate dying nerve cells \n     in the brain and spinal cord.\n       No one can say yet whether the treatments will work. \n     Preliminary results from about 1,000 patients getting a \n     handful of different compounds for various neuro-degenerative \n     diseases are a mix of encouragement and disappointment. In \n     some cases, patients' symptoms subsided but were replaced by \n     worrisome side effects.\n       But for each of these diseases the prognosis is so poor \n     that even a sliver of improvement--or a brief reprieve from \n     the otherwise inevitable decline--would be welcome.\n       ``We are dealing with diseases that are uniformly fatal,'' \n     said Ted Munsat, a neurologist and professor of neurology at \n     Tufts University in Boston, ``so the hope and anticipation is \n     more heightened than ever.''\n       It's almost impossible to get ailing nerve cells to grow, \n     or to get injured ones to sprout new parts. Unlike most \n     peripheral neuropathy (the painful nerve irritation that \n     afflicts many people with advanced diabetes and some patients \n     getting cancer chemotherapy), Huntington's disease (the \n     dementia-inducing brain disease that strikes by surprise in \n     the prime of life) or the paralysis that results from serious \n     injuries to the spine or head.\n       But everyone has grown nerve cells at least once before. \n     The central nervous system, which includes the brain and \n     spinal cord, is one of the first organ systems to develop in \n     a fertilized egg, its rudimentary structure already evident \n     in the third week of gestation when the embryo is still less \n     than 3 millimeters long. Nine months later more than a \n     trillion neurons have settled into position, some of them \n     almost six feet long.\n       If we can do it once, why not again?\n       For decades, the common wisdom was that it can't be done. \n     But with a little help from some compounds called nerve \n     growth factors, scientists are changing their minds.\n       ``These are nerve fertilizers,'' said Steven Ringel, a \n     professor of neurology at the University of Colorado Medical \n     Center in Denver. ``We can make these neurons grow like \n     grass. It's a remarkable tool and incredibly exciting.''\n       ``Until growth factors were discovered there was no \n     molecule known that could rescue dying neurons. When neurons \n     died, they were gone forever,'' said Frank Baldino, president \n     and CEO of Cephalon, a biotech company in West Chester, PA. \n     ``When growth factors were discovered, everyone was \n     thrilled.''\n       The newest nerve growth factor, recently purified from rat \n     brain cells, may be the most promising of them all. The \n     substance is called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic \n     factor, or GDNF. In experiments with brain-injured animals \n     published in January, researchers documented its ability to \n     spur regeneration of the types of nerve cells that disappear \n     in people with Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's diseases.\n       ``You can really get substantial regeneration of nerve \n     fibers,'' said Frank Collins, a neuroscientist at Amgen in \n     Thousand Oaks, Calif., speaking of GDNF's effects in animals. \n     ``It suggests that the benefits in early-stage patients may \n     be very profound. And that's very exciting.''\n       Exciting, yes, except for one problem: It's almost \n     impossible to get GDNF--or any of the other nerve growth \n     compounds--into the human brain, where the compounds are \n     needed.\n\n\n                           delivery problems\n\n       It turns out that every nerve growth factor so far \n     discovered is, to put it plainly, a big fat protein. Proteins \n     tend to break down quickly when taken as pills or injected \n     into the blood. And even if these particular proteins could \n     survive in the bloodstream and make it to a person's head, \n     they are too large to diffuse through blood vessel walls and \n     make their way into the brain.\n       This may not be a serious problem when it comes to treating \n     peripheral neuropathy, where the problem is mostly limited to \n     nerve cells in the fingers and toes that can be treated with \n     injections beneath the skin. Simple injections may also work \n     for Lou Gehrig's disease, since the motor neurons that are \n     affected extend out from the brain, down the spine and all \n     the way to every extremity. Studies have shown that CNTF and \n     BDNF injected into the thigh, arm or elsewhere in the body \n     are absorbed by nerve endings and travel up those cells into \n     the spinal cord.\n       But when it comes to the most common and serious \n     neurological diseases--Alzheimer's and Parkinson's--the \n     neurons that are dying are deep within the brain, where no \n     nerve growth factor can get on its own. So with the \n     physiological potency of growth factors now well established, \n     the challenge of making these compounds into useful drugs is \n     actually more a problem of engineering and delivery than of \n     medicine or biology.\n       In animal experiments, scientists have gotten around this \n     problem by injecting doses directly into the creatures' \n     brains. And though most researchers have been reluctant to \n     try this in people, one team of scientists in Sweden is doing \n     so.\n       The first patient to get such a treatment was the retired \n     lawyer with Alzheimer's disease. Lars Olson and his \n     colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm \n     surgically implanted a pump the size of a hockey puck into \n     the woman's abdomen. They ran a thin plastic tube from the \n     pump up through her torso and neck, all within her body, and \n     underneath her scalp to the crown of her head. There they \n     drilled a hole through her skull and fed the hidden tube \n     through the opening and into a space in her brain near the \n     area that degenerates in Alzheimer's patients. For three \n     months, the pump supplied a constant low dose of NGF, the \n     nerve growth factor isolated from mouse salivary glands.\n       It is still not clear whether the approach is worth the \n     trouble. The researchers did note an increase in blood flow \n     in the brain, a more normal electroencephalogram (EEG) and \n     improvement in a word recognition test that is used to \n     measure cognitive function. But the woman also experienced \n     serious back pain, anxiety, sleeplessness and weight loss--\n     symptoms the scientists think may be due to an unintended \n     activation of nearby nerves in the brain. She also had a \n     painful outbreak of shingles, which indicated that a herpes \n     virus that normally stays dormant inside nerve cells had for \n     some reason ``woken up.'' And in every cognitive test other \n     than the word recognition test, the woman's performance \n     stayed the same or declined.\n       The Swedish team is trying the technique on a few other \n     patients, and researchers in the United States have proposed \n     doing essentially the same thing, using plastic tubes, or \n     cannulas, to get NGF into the brain. The Food and Drug \n     Administration officials have so far rejected the approach, \n     in part because animal studies suggest that the procedure can \n     itself cause brain damage.\n       ``Cannulas in the brain may be fine for animals, but not \n     for 4 million Alzheimer's patients,'' said Baldino of \n     Cephalon. ``It's a great way to show proof of concept--to \n     show that growth factors can have an effect in the brain. But \n     practically speaking, I don't think patients are going to be \n     lining up at the clinic.''\n\n\n                             mini-factories\n\n       Another way to get bulky proteins into a person's gray \n     matter is to first give a drug that temporarily pokes holes \n     in the brain's blood vessels--that is, make those vessels \n     leaky--and then infuse the nerve growth factor into such a \n     vessel. Some scientists are already using this technique to \n     get cancer drugs, some of which are molecular mammoths, to \n     brain tumor. But the approach makes it difficult to aim the \n     shot of growth factor to the precise part of the brain where \n     it is needed, and so risks stimulating ``innocent bystander'' \n     neurons better left alone.\n       ``A good drug in the wrong place can give serious side \n     effects,'' said Fred Gage, a neuroscientist at the University \n     of California-San Diego.\n       Gage and others suggest that the best way to give the brain \n     a healthy dose of growth factors is to arrange for those \n     factors to be made on-site, in the brain itself. ``Instead of \n     giving a drug,'' Gage said, ``you engineer some cells to make \n     what's needed.''\n       The idea of implanting robust, hormone-secreting cells into \n     the brain to nurse ailing nerve cells back to health has its \n     roots in an older and more controversial strategy for \n     Parkinson's disease. In the original approach, scientists \n     took cells from the brains of aborted fetuses and \n     transplanted them into the brains of people with Parkinson's \n     disease. Fetal cells produce copious quantities of dopamine, \n     the brain chemical lacking in Parkinson's patients.\n       Such transplants do seem to hold some potential. More than \n     40 patients with Parkinson's disease have been treated that \n     way in the United States, and some patients are showing \n     modest improvement. But 95 percent or more of the \n     transplanted fetal cells generally die in the weeks or month \n     after transplantation.\n       Olson and his colleagues in Sweden recently used nerve \n     growth factors to better those odds. After transplanting \n     healthy dopamine-producing cells into the brain of a patient \n     with Parkinson's, they drenched the transplanted cells with \n     NGF for 23 days, dripping the liquid fertilizer through a \n     plastic tube inserted directly into her brain. Preliminary \n     results suggest that the patient became less rigid and more \n     mobile than did patients who got cell transplants without \n     NGF, though it's difficult to tell much from a single \n     patient. Two others have since been treated but results have \n     not been published.\n       Gage, however, proposes a more elegant means of getting \n     growth factors into the brain--a method that would make \n     plastic tubes and fetal transplants completely unnecessary. \n     He and others have put the genes for nerve growth factors \n     like NGF into [[Page S5410]] hardy, laboratory-reared skin \n     cells, instantly endowing those ordinary cells with the \n     specialized ability to churn out the therapeutic factors. \n     They have transplanted those cells into the brains of rodents \n     with a condition resembling Alzheimer's disease, with the \n     hope that these growth-factor mini-factories might revitalize \n     failing nerve cells nearby.\n       Sure enough, the animals began to spout new and healthy \n     neurons in the area around the nutrient-spewing transplants. \n     While highly experimental, the approach is about to get its \n     clinical debut. This month, Swiss researchers will insert \n     CNTF genes into cells and inject the cells into the spines of \n     patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, marking the first human \n     test of cells engineered to produce a nerve growth factor. \n     They hope that the locally made CNTF will revive ailing motor \n     neurons there more effectively than if the substance were \n     injected into the skin.\n\n\n                            Avenues of Hope\n\n       Even if researchers find a good way to administer nerve \n     growth factors, there is no guarantee that patients will be \n     able to tolerate the drugs. CNTF injections already have run \n     into trouble in preliminary experiments in Lou Gehrig's \n     patients, causing flu-like symptoms and weight loss serious \n     enough to convince one company to give the research up. \n     Another company is now trying smaller doses, and others are \n     testing BDNF. Though side effects have been rare in these \n     latter studies, it's too soon to say whether the more mellow \n     regimens will be potent enough to stem the disease's \n     progress.\n       Similarly, some of the early tests of NGF injections for \n     peripheral neuropathy have been plagued by a serious side \n     effect: A super-sensitivity to pain that makes normally \n     innocuous stimuli unbearable. A lukewarm shower, for example, \n     can become an excruciatingly painful experience in which \n     drops of water feel like little burning arrows.\n       Ultimately, scientists said, a cocktail of different nerve \n     growth factors--perhaps delivered by a variety of different \n     routes--may work best of all. ``We now have a number of \n     molecules looking good,'' said Ronald Lindsay, a \n     neuroscientist at Regeneron, a Tarrytown, N.Y., biotech \n     company developing nerve growth factors. ``It doesn't make \n     sense to bet on a single horse.''\n       Unfortunately, the race is still far from the home stretch, \n     and that's disappointing news for people already suffering \n     from nervous system diseases. The lawyer with Alzheimer's \n     disease, for example, has continued down the path of senility \n     since receiving her experimental drizzle of nerve growth \n     factor. And her counterpart with Parkinson's is again subject \n     to freeze-ups and jitters.\n       On the other hand, the basketball coach with Lou Gehrig's \n     disease has improved since getting treated with CNTF. ``He \n     has more neck strength and breathing strength,'' said \n     Benjamin Brooks, a professor of neurology and director of the \n     University of Wisconsin's ALS Clinical Research Center in \n     Madison. ``Now he's back at work one hour a day, which is \n     something we never would have expected with this disease.''\n\n\n    Brain and Nerve Diseases for Which Nerve Growth Factors May Help\n\n       Alzheimer's Disease--4 million patients in the United \n     States.\n       Nerve growth factor (NGF) is being infused directly into \n     the brains of a few patients in Sweden; potentially serious \n     side effects have been reported, including extreme \n     sensitivity to pain. NGF is also being given by injections \n     under the skin in the United States as an experimental \n     treatment for peripheral neuropathy, a loss of sensation in \n     the extremities common among diabetics and patients getting \n     cancer chemotherapy.\n       Parkinson's Disease--1 million patients in the United \n     States.\n       One patient in Sweden has received brain infusions of NGF \n     to enhance survival of healthy neurons that researchers had \n     previously transplanted into his brain, with some possible \n     benefits. A newly discovered nerve growth factor, called \n     glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), looks \n     promising in animal studies and may enter human trials in the \n     next year or two.\n       Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) 5,000 \n     new cases a year in the United States.\n       A nerve growth factor called ciliary neurotrophic factor \n     (CNTF) is being injected into the skin, where it can be \n     absorbed by nerves. Doses have recently been lowered, \n     however, because of side effects. Swiss researchers are about \n     to transplant the first genetically engineered versions of \n     CNTF-secreting cells into the spines of ALS patients. Another \n     growth factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is \n     also in clinical trials with apparently fewer side effects, \n     Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an injectable cell \n     growth factor not specific for nerve cells but now being \n     tested in patients with ALS.

Regeneron, Amgen, Genentech \n     and several other biotech companies are researching other \n     promising nerve-growth factors.\n       Even so, the new experiments, published today in the \n     British journal Nature, provide several hints that in \n     uncovering GDNF, scientists have found a new doorway to the \n     treatment of nerve diseases that continue to defy adequate \n     treatment. ``It's a fairly exciting set of results,'' says \n     Ronald Lindsay, vice president for neurobiology research at \n     [[Page S5411]] Regeneron, noting that ``it provides strong \n     competition for the [factors] we've been working with.''\n       In several experiments using GDNF developed by Synergen and \n     now owned by Amgen, researchers used the substance to protect \n     nerve cells from destruction caused by a toxic substance \n     called MPTP. When given to mice, MPTP produces symptoms \n     similar to the debilitating muscle tremors caused by \n     Parkinson's disease in humans.\n       In one surprising experiment by scientists at Karolinska \n     Institute in Stockholm and at Synergen in Boulder, Colo., \n     GDNF restored nerve activity to cells already damaged by the \n     MPTP toxin.\n       GDNF was first isolated in 1990 by Frank Collins, a \n     biologist working at Synergen. He identified it in glial \n     cells, which provide nutrients to neurons. Dr. Collins didn't \n     publish the discovery until 1993, when Synergen received a \n     patient. About the same time, Dr. Collins was hired by Amgen. \n     In an interview, Dr. Collins said that acquiring the rights \n     to GDNF was one of the reasons Amgen bought Synergen several \n     months ago.\n       ``I've been given the green light to go full steam ahead in \n     developing GDNF for use against Parkinson's disease,'' says \n     Dr. Collins, senior director of neuroscience research at \n     Amgen. He said it may be possible to begin testing the \n     substance in humans within a year or two.\n       Currently, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be \n     treated with several medicines, but their effectiveness wears \n     off after time. Amgen hopes GDNF can protect nerve cells \n     being relentlessly killed by the disease, thereby prolonging \n     the existing treatments' usefulness. But GDNF will do nothing \n     to stop the underlying cause of the illness, which is still \n     unknown.\n       A significant hurdle facing GDNF is that cells under attack \n     by Parkinson's are located in the brain. Because GDNF is a \n     large molecule that can't get into the brain if ingested or \n     injected into the bloodstream, it will have to be infused \n     directly.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 685. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain lighthouses \nlocated in the State of Maine; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n                   lighthouse conveyance legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would help to preserve historic lighthouses in the State of Maine \nand ensure that future generations will be able to appreciate these \ntreasured landmarks.\n  The legislation, also known as the Maine Lights Program, authorizes \nthe Secretary of Transportation to convey four lighthouses in Maine to \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and (29) others to the Island \nInstitute of Rockland, ME. Founded in 1983, the Island Institute is a \nnationally recognized nonprofit organization dedicated to the \npreservation and protection of Maine's coastal lights. This legislation \nwas crafted in close coordination with the Island Institute, and it is \nan extraordinary opportunity to preserve the most obvious symbols of \nMaine's living maritime heritage.\n  The Maine Lights Program is strongly supported by the U.S. Coast \nGuard. The Coast Guard currently owns each of these lighthouses, and it \nis a strong proponent of preserving their historic character. But the \ncost of maintaining these historic structures is becoming particularly \ndifficult for the Coast Guard in these times of tight budgetary \nconstraints. These lighthouses were built in an age when they had to be \nmanned continuously. Today's advanced technology has made it possible \nto build automated aids to navigation that do not require around-the-\nclock manning, and this technology has made these historic lighthouses \nexpensive anachronisms for the Coast Guard. The Maine Lights Program \nwould relieve the Coast Guard of the financial burden of maintaining \nthese lighthouses.\n  The program also mandates continued Coast Guard maintenance of the \nactive aids to navigation in these lighthouses--the lights and horns--\nand it ensures that each lighthouse will remain an effective marine \nnavigational aid despite the conveyance. Maritime safety will not be \nsacrificed in the name of saving money. The Coast Guard will still be \nresponsible for maintaining the aids to navigation themselves. Only the \nlighthouses and structures associated with them are impacted by this \nprogram.\n  By conveying these lighthouses to the Island Institute, the program \nensures that the lighthouses will be preserved as an important part of \nour coastal maritime heritage. The Island Institute will never be \nallowed to sell these properties. The institute would be required to \ntransfer the lighthouses to third parties without any compensation to \nitself within a 3-year period beginning on the date of the conveyance \nof the lighthouse to the institute by the Coast Guard. The Island \nInstitute would be required to identify appropriate nonprofit \ncorporations, educational agencies, community development \norganizations, and any Federal, State, or local government or other \neligible entity that would assume responsibility for the lighthouse.\n  This legislation sets specific eligibility requirements for \norganizations and entities that wish to take the responsibility of a \nlighthouse. They must be financially able to maintain the lighthouse, \nand they must agree to regular inspections by the State historic \npreservation officer of the State of Maine in order to ensure that the \nlighthouses are being properly maintained in a manner that preserves \ntheir historic characteristics. Moreover, those receiving a lighthouse \nmust also assure continued public access to the lighthouse.\n  This legislation also provides that if the Secretary of \nTransportation determined at any time that a lighthouse is not being \nused or maintained as required by the law, that the lighthouse would \nrevert to the United States and then be transferred to other \ninstitutions or entities according to existing law.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the Secretary to report to Congress \nafter 5 years about the effectiveness of the program in maintaining, \npreserving, and repairing historic lighthouse properties, maintaining \npublic access, and finding and transferring lighthouse property to \nappropriate third parties.\n  The Island Institute has already identified suitable candidates for \nreceiving many of these lighthouses. For example, the town of Camden \nwill receive the Curtis Island Light, which is located in Camden \nHarbor. The town already owns Curtis Island and all of the buildings on \nit except for the light tower itself, and this program will \nappropriately convey the light tower to the town of Camden.\n  The Maine Lights Program is an innovative approach to historic \nmaritime preservation. It will become a model for the conveyance of \nother lighthouses for historic preservation all across the country. At \nthe same time it will save the Coast Guard hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions, of dollars a year in maintenance costs. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Commission to examine the costs and \nbenefits, and the impact on voter turnout, of changing the deadline for \nfiling Federal income tax returns to the date on which Federal \nelections are held; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the voter turnout enhancement study commission act\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce the Voter Turnout \nEnhancement Study [VoTES] Commission Act, a bill to establish a \ntemporary Commission to consider whether the deadline for filing \nFederal income tax returns should be changed to the date on which \nFederal elections are held.\n  Our constituents demonstrated last fall that they want real change. I \ncan't think of anything that would change the Congress more than to \nmove tax day to election day so the American people could vote as they \npay. It would not only enhance voter turnout rates, but also give the \nAmerican people an opportunity to vote at the same time they pay their \ntaxes, thus holding politicians accountable to the people on the day \nthey are most focused on the cost of their Government.\n  While just about every day of the year is celebrated by special \ninterest groups around the country for the Government largesse they \nreceive, the taxpayers--the silent majority--have only one day of the \nyear to focus on what that largesse means to them--how much it costs \nthem--and that is tax day.\n  The Voter Turnout Enhancement Study [VoTES] Commission Act would \nprovide for a thoughtful and thorough analysis of the date change, its \npotential impact on voter turnout, as well as any economic impact it \nmight have. The bill explicitly requires that an independent Commission \nconduct a cost-benefit analysis--a requirement that Congress would be \nwise to impose routinely on legislative initiatives to separate good \nideas from the bad, and save taxpayers a lot of money in the process. A \nnumber of other cost-limiting provisions have been included to protect \ntaxpayers' interests.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Voter Turnout Enhancement \n     Study Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a \n     fundamental right;\n       (2) Federal, State, and local governments have a duty to \n     promote the exercise of the right to vote to the greatest \n     extent possible;\n       (3) the power to tax is only guardedly granted to Federal, \n     State, and local governments by the citizens of the United \n     States;\n       (4) the only regular contact that most Americans have with \n     their government consists of filing personal income tax \n     returns and voting in Federal, State, and local elections;\n       (5) in 1992, almost 115,000,000 Federal income tax returns \n     were filed by individuals and couples, but only approximately \n     104,000,000 votes were cast in the year's presidential \n     election;\n       (6) an estimated 116 million Federal income tax returns \n     will be filed by individuals and couples for 1994, but only \n     about half that number of votes were cast in that year's \n     congressional elections; and\n       (7) more closely tying the rights of individuals as voters \n     to their obligations as taxpayers will provide additional \n     incentives for individuals to both participate in the \n     electoral process and scrutinize the costs and benefits of \n     government policies.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the Voter \n     Turnout Enhancement Study Commission (in this Act referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4.

The study shall \n     include an analysis of--\n       (1) the costs and benefits of the change in filing date; \n     and\n       (2) the likelihood that establishment of a single date on \n     which individuals can fulfill obligations of citizenship as \n     both electors and taxpayers will increase participation in \n     Federal, State, and local elections.\n       (b) Consultation.--The Commission shall consult with \n     Governors, Federal and State election officials, the \n     Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and any other person, \n     agency, or entity that the Commission determines to be \n     appropriate.\n     [[Page S5414]]\n     \n     SEC. 6.

The \n     head of the department or agency shall provide the \n     information to the Commission unless release of the \n     information to the public by the agency is prohibited by law.\n\n     SEC. 7. STAFF ASSISTANCE FROM FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n       Upon the request of the Commission or the Chairperson of \n     the Commission, the head of any Federal department or agency \n     may detail any of the personnel of the department or agency \n     to the Commission to assist the Commission to carry out this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 8.

A bill to improve and strengthen child support enforcement, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the child support enforcement act of 1996\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Support \nEnforcement Act of 1995. This bill is modeled after the bipartisan \napproaches contained in child support enforcement legislative proposals \nof last year.\n  The problems that we currently face in this area have been well \nresearched and analyzed in a recently released report, written at my \nrequest, by the General Accounting Office [GAO]. One of the most \ntelling facts in the GAO report is that the national child support \nenforcement caseload grew 180 percent between 1980 and 1992. This \nstatistic speaks volumes. In 1994, the 15 million support cases \nnationwide represent a significant portion of our neediest families. If \nthe estimated $34 billion that is owed these families could be \ncollected, the taxpayers would receive some much needed relief as a \nresult of the corresponding reductions that would be possible in many \nwelfare programs.\n  Mr. President, I held a hearing on child support enforcement last \nJuly to try to better understand why this money is not being collected. \nThis hearing lead me to conclude that until we improve the way the \nsystem works at the local, State, and Federal levels we will never be \nable to ensure that children receive the financial support from their \nrespective families to which they are entitled.\n  There were many issues raised in the hearing that are worthy of \nattention, but one I wish to especially highlight is the caseload of \nmost of the State workers who are trying to help custodial parents \ncollect their payments.\n  One witness, a caseworker from Virginia, testified that she could \nonly spend about 12 minutes a month with any one client. Mr. President, \n12 minutes a month is simply not enough time to effectively deal with \nall of the complex issues involved in these cases.\n  Another witness was Ms. Judy Jones Jordan, the administrator of the \nChild Support Enforcement Program in Arkansas. My State is indeed \nfortunate to have an outstanding administrator of such a critical \nprogram. She testified that the system had bogged down. Rather than \nhaving a clear mission, the State programs are subject to so much \nFederal oversight that getting the job done has become almost \nimpossible. She said:\n\n       The program has changed from one designed to assist \n     families and reduce the cost of public assistance programs to \n     one focused on passing audits and avoiding Federal penalties.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today is an attempt \nto address the problem identified by Ms. Jordan. In a country where the \ndefault rate on used car loans is 3 percent and the default rate on \nchild support orders is nearly 50 percent, we need to greatly improve \nthe way that the partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates works.\n  This legislation that I am introducing addresses the key issues that \nI think will make a significant difference in the operation of the \nchild support system. First, the Federal audit requirements will be \nrevised so that they become a far less onerous burden on the States. In \nfact, I believe the new procedures will transform this process into a \nhelpful and necessary evaluation that will provide the States with \nuseful information on the effectiveness of their program while ensuring \naccountability of Federal dollars.\n  The second thing that my legislation would do, is the funding system \nwill be modified to address the GAO's finding that the present system \ndoes not provide incentives to States for improving the performance of \nthe program.\n  Third, the legislation will require States to suspend drivers \nlicenses and other licenses, both professional and recreational, of \nparents who are delinquent in their child support payments. My State of \nArkansas has found that this program is very effective in encouraging \nnoncustodial parents to promptly pay their child support obligations.\n  Finally, the legislation attempts to address the difficult issue of \nthe overburdened case workers in of the State child support offices. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services and the States will sit \ndown together and determine the level of staffing necessary for each \nState to effectively carry out its child support program. It is my hope \nthat with the benefit of this joint effort, the State programs will \nthen be able to at least partially address this critical area.\n  Mr. President, while personal responsibility is the key to taking \ncare of children, it is my belief the Government has a limited but \nimportant role to ensure that it is easy for noncustodial parents to \nfulfill their duties, and difficult for them to avoid it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n    Title I--Eligibility and Other Matters Concerning Child Support \n                      Enforcement Program Clients\n\n     Sec. 101. Cooperation requirement and good cause exception\n       Section 101 amends the CSE, AFDC, and Medicaid statutes to \n     require that, effective 10 months after enactment (or \n     earlier, at State option)--\n       The State CSE agency (rather than the AFDC and Medicaid \n     agencies, as under current law) will make determinations of \n     whether applicants for AFDC and Medicaid are cooperating with \n     efforts to establish paternity and obtain child support, or \n     have good cause not to cooperate;\n       The AFDC and Medicaid agencies must immediately refer \n     applicants needing paternity establishment services to the \n     CSE agency, and the CSE agency must make an initial \n     cooperation or good cause determination within 10 days of \n     such referral;\n       The mother or other custodial relative of a child born 10 \n     months or more after enactment of these amendments will not \n     be found to cooperate with efforts to establish paternity \n     unless that individual names the putative father and supplies \n     information that could assist the IV-D agency to identify \n     him; and\n       Cooperation with initial efforts to establish paternity \n     (except where good cause is found) is a precondition to \n     eligibility for program benefits, except where the applicant \n     is eligible for emergency assistance under title IV-A or is a \n     pregnant woman presumptively eligible for Medicaid, where an \n     appeal of a finding of lack of good cause is pending, or \n     where the CSE agency has not made a timely determination.\n     Sec. 102. State obligation to provide paternity establishment \n         and child support enforcement services\n       Section 102 requires State laws to require that--\n       Every child support order established or modified in the \n     State on or after October 1, 1998 be entered in a central \n     case registry to be operated by the IV-D agency (see section \n     301 of the bill); [[Page S5415]] \n       Child support be collected (except where parents agree to \n     opt out under limited circumstances) through a centralized \n     collections unit to be operated by the IV-D agency or its \n     contractor (see section 302 of the bill)--\n       On and after October 1, 1998, in all cases being enforced \n     under the State plan; and\n       On and after October 1, 1999, in all cases entered in the \n     central case registry.\n       Section 102 amends the IV-D State plan requirements to \n     eliminate distinctions between welfare recipients and other \n     applicants for IV-D services with respect to services \n     available and fees for such services. Under these \n     amendments--\n       No fees may be imposed on any custodial or noncustodial \n     parent--\n       After September 30, 1998, for application for IV-D \n     services; or\n       At any time, for inclusion in the central state registry;\n       No other fees (other than those specified in current law \n     for genetic testing and tax refund offset) may be imposed on \n     the custodial parent; and\n       Any other costs or fees may be imposed on the noncustodial \n     parent (but any fees for support collections through the \n     centralized collections unit must be added to and not deleted \n     from the support award).\n     Sec. 103. Distribution of payments\n       Section 103 amends the provisions of title IV-D concerning \n     the order of priority for distribution of child support \n     collections, to provide that--\n       A family not receiving AFDC shall be paid the full amount \n     of current support, plus arrearages for any period after the \n     family ceased to receive AFDC, before any amount is retained \n     by the State to reimburse AFDC;\n       The State would have the option, in the case of a family \n     receiving AFDC, either to make distribution as under current \n     law or to pay the family the full amount of current support \n     due before retaining any amount to reimburse the AFDC agency;\n       Where the parent owing support marries (or remarries) the \n     custodial parent, and the parents' combined income is less \n     than twice the Federal poverty line, the State must, upon \n     application by the parents, suspend or cancel any debts owed \n     the State on account of AFDC paid to the family.\n       This section also requires the Secretary to promulgate \n     regulations--\n       Under title IV-D, establishing a uniform national standard \n     for distribution where a parent owes support to more than one \n     family; and\n       Under title IV-A, establishing standards for States \n     choosing the alternative distribution formula, to minimize \n     irregular monthly payments to AFDC families.\n       Finally, this section, together with the corresponding \n     amendment to title IV-A in title VII of this bill, increases \n     the amount of monthly support to be paid to the family by the \n     CSE agency and disregarded for purposes of AFDC eligibility \n     and benefits. The new ``passthrough and disregard'' amount \n     would be the current $50 increased by the CPI, or such \n     greater amount as the State may choose.\n     Sec. 104. Due process rights\n       Section 104. requires State IV-D plans, effective October \n     1, 1997, to provide for procedures to ensure that--\n       Parties to cases in which IV-D services are being provided \n     receive notice of all proceedings in which support \n     obligations might be established or modified, and of any \n     order establishing or modifying a support obligation within \n     10 days of issuance; and\n       Individuals receiving IV-D services have available to them \n     fair hearing or other formal complaint procedure.\n     Sec. 105. Privacy safeguards\n       Section 105 requires State IV-D plans, effective October 1, \n     1996, to provide for safeguards to protect privacy rights \n     with respect to sensitive and confidential information, \n     including safeguards against unauthorized use of disclosure \n     of information relating to paternity and support proceedings, \n     and prohibitions on disclosing the whereabouts of one \n     individual to another person who is subject to a protective \n     order, or convicted of criminal assault or abuse against such \n     individual, or against whom a proceeding is pending seeking \n     such a protective order or conviction.\n     Sec. 106. Requirement to facilitate access to services.\n       Section 106 requires State IV-D plans, effective October 1, \n     1996, to include outreach plans to increase parents' access \n     to CSE services, including plans responding to the needs of \n     working parents and parents with limited proficiency in \n     English.\n\n\n              title ii--program administration and funding\n\n     Sec. 201. Federal matching payments\n       Section 201 increases the basic eral matching rate for \n     State IV-D programs (currently 66 percent) to 69 percent for \n     FY 1997, 72 percent for FY 1998, and 75 percent for FY 1999 \n     and thereafter.\n       Section 201 also adds a maintenance of effort requirement \n     that--\n       Total State expenditures (other than for automated data \n     processing systems development), after deducting Federal \n     matching payments (but not incentive payments) not be less \n     than such expenditures for FY 1996, and\n       Total State expenditures for FY 1997 and 1998, after \n     deducting Federal matching payments and incentive payments, \n     not be less than such expenditures for FY 1996.\n     Sec. 202. Performance-based incentives and penalties\n       Section 202 replaces the system of incentive payments to \n     States under section 458 of the Act with a new program of \n     incentive adjustments to the Federal matching rate. Under \n     this program, States could receive increases of up to 5 \n     percentage points based on Statewide paternity establishment, \n     and increases of up to 10 percentage points based on overall \n     CSE performance.\n       Section 202 also makes amendments (effective with respect \n     to quarters beginning on and after the date of enactment) \n     providing for a penalty reduction of AFDC matching payments \n     where a State's CSE program does not meet specified \n     performance standards:\n       Section 452(g) is amended to make minor and technical \n     amendments to the formula for determining the paternity \n     establishment percentage under the IV-D program (the \n     amendments correct errors introduced by OBRA 1993).\n       Section 403(h) is amended (effective with respect to \n     calendar quarters beginning one year or more after enactment) \n     to simplify the penalty reduction procedure. The penalty is \n     to be deferred for one year pending State corrective action, \n     and to be canceled if all deficiencies are eliminated by the \n     end of that year.\n       The Secretary would specify in regulations the levels of \n     accomplishment (or improvement) needed to qualify for each \n     incentive adjustment rate. States would report performance \n     data after the end of FY 1995 and each succeeding year; the \n     Secretary would determine the amount (if any) of adjustment \n     due each State, based on State data determined by the \n     Secretary to be reliable, and would apply the adjustment to \n     matching payments for the succeeding fiscal year (beginning \n     with FY 1997).\n     Sec. 203. Federal and State reviews and audits\n       Section 203 makes amendments, effective beginning one year \n     after enactment, shifting the focus of title IV-D audits from \n     the manner in which activities are conducted to performance \n     outcomes, as follows:\n       A new State plan element requires the States annually--\n       To determine, and report to the Secretary concerning, \n     conformity with State plan requirements; and\n       To extract from their ADP systems, and transmit to the \n     Secretary, data and calculations concerning their compliance \n     with Federal performance requirements.\n       The Secretary's responsibilities are revised to require--\n       Annual review of the State reports on plan conformity; \n     determinations of amounts of penalty adjustments to States; \n     and provisions of comments, recommendations, and technical \n     assistance to the States);\n       Evaluation of elements of State programs in which \n     significant deficiencies are indicated by the State reports; \n     and\n       Triennial audits of State reporting systems and financial \n     management, and for other purposes the Secretary finds \n     necessary.\n     Sec. 204. Automated data processing\n       Section 204 recognizes and clarifies title IV-D State plan \n     requirements concerning automated data processing, and adds \n     requirements that the State agency ADP system (1) be used to \n     calculate the State's performance for purposes of the \n     incentive and penalty adjustments under sections 403(h) and \n     458; and (2) incorporate safeguards on information integrity \n     and security.\n       This section also revises the statutory provisions for \n     State implementation of all Federal ADP requirements \n     (currently required by October 1, 1995), to provide that:\n       All requirements enacted on or before enactment of the \n     Family Support Act of 1988 are to be met by October 1, 1996; \n     and\n       All requirements (including those enacted in OBRA 1993 and \n     this bill) are to be met by October 1, 1999.\n       Ninety percent Federal matching for ADP start-up costs \n     remains available through FY 1996. For the next 5 years, the \n     match rate for startup costs is the higher of (i) 80 percent \n     or (ii) the matching rate generally applicable to the State \n     IV-D program (including any incentive increases); total \n     Federal payments to States are limited to $260,000,000, to be \n     distributed among States on a formula set in regulations \n     which takes into account the relative size of State caseloads \n     and the level of automation needed to meet applicable ADP \n     requirements.\n     Sec. 205. Director of CSE Program; training and staffing\n       Section 205--\n       Eliminates the requirement that the individual responsible \n     for day-to-day operation of the Federal CSE program report \n     directly to the Secretary;\n       Requires the Secretary to develop a national training \n     program for State IV-D directors, and a core curriculum and \n     training standards for State agencies, and authorizes the \n     Secretary to charge States fees for such programs;\n       Requires State IV-D agencies to have training programs \n     consistent with the national standards and curriculum, and to \n     provide for initial standards and curriculum, and to provide \n     for initial and ongoing training of all staff, and permits \n     use of IV-D funds (with the Secretary's approval) for \n     training of non-agency personnel with related \n     responsibilities (including judges, law enforcement \n     personnel, and social workers); and\n       Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on \n     the staffing of each State's [[Page S5416]] CSE program \n     (including a review of needs created by requirements for ADP \n     systems, central case registries, and centralized support \n     collections).\n     Sec. 206. Funding for secretarial assistance to State \n         programs\n       Section 206 makes available to the Secretary, from annual \n     appropriations for payments for State programs under title \n     IV-D for FY 1995 and succeeding years--\n       An amount equal to 1 percent of the Federal share of child \n     support collections on behalf of AFDC recipients for the \n     preceding fiscal year, for use for assistance to State IV-D \n     agencies through technical assistance, training, and related \n     activities; projects of regional or national significance; \n     and\n       An amount equal to 2 percent of the Federal share of such \n     collections, for operation of the FPLS and the National \n     Welfare Reform Information Clearinghouse established by \n     section 305 (to the extent such costs are not recovered in \n     user fees.)\n     Sec. 207. Data collection and reports by the Secretary\n       Section 207 amends data collection and reporting \n     requirements, effective with respect to FY 1994 and \n     succeeding fiscal years, to conform the requirements to the \n     changes made by the bill, and to eliminate requirements for \n     unnecessary or duplicative information.\n     Sec. 208. Coordination with income eligibility verification \n         system\n       Section 208 amends the authority for the Income Eligibility \n     Verification System (IEVS)--\n       To permit IEVS information furnished to state CSE programs \n     to be used to assist in carrying out any title IV-D program \n     purpose (rather than only for income eligibility \n     verification); and\n       To require the state CSE agency to make information in the \n     central State case registry available to State agencies \n     administering the AFDC, Medicaid, Food Stamp, and \n     unemployment compensation programs.\n\n\n                  Title III--Locate and Case Tracking\n\n     Sec. 301.

Centralized collection and disbursement of support \n         payments\n       Section 302 requires State IV-D agencies, on and after \n     October 1, 1997--\n       To operate a centralized, automated unit for collection and \n     disbursement of child support which--\n       Is operated directly by the State IV-D agency or by a \n     contractor responsible directly to the State agency;\n       Collects and disburses support in all cases being enforced \n     by the State agency (including all cases under orders entered \n     on or after October 1, 1998);\n       Uses automated procedures, electronic processes, and \n     computer-driven technology to the maximum extent feasible, \n     efficient, and economical; and\n       Is coordinated with the State agency's ADP system;\n       To use the State agency ADP system to assist and facilitate \n     the operations of the centralized collections unit, through \n     functions including--\n       Generation of wage withholding notices and orders to \n     employers;\n       Ongoing monitoring to promptly identify nonpayment; and\n       Automatic use of administrative enforcement mechanisms; and\n       To have sufficient State staff (including State employees \n     and contractors) to carry out these monitoring and \n     enforcement responsibilities.\n     Sec. 303. Amendments concerning income withholding\n       Section 303 requires State laws concerning income \n     withholding to provide--\n       That all child support orders issued or modified before \n     October 1, 1995, which are not otherwise subject to income \n     withholding, will become subject to income\n      withholding immediately if arrearages occur, without need \n     for a judicial or administrative hearing;\n       That employers withholding wages must forward payments to \n     the State centralized collections unit within 5 working days \n     after the amount withheld would otherwise have been paid to \n     the employee;\n       That the notice from the State to employers directing wage \n     withholding must be in a standard format prescribed by the \n     Secretary;\n       For the imposition of fines against employers who fail to \n     withhold support from wages, or to make appropriate and \n     timely payment to the State collections unit.\n       This section also makes amendments--\n       Conforming the income withholding requirements to the \n     requirement for a centralized State collections unit; and\n       Requiring the Secretary to promulgate regulations defining \n     income and other terms for purposes of title IV-D.\n     Sec. 304.

National Child Support Information Clearinghouse\n       Section 305 amends title IV-D to require the Secretary to \n     establish and operate a National Child Support Information \n     Clearinghouse (NCSIC).\n       The NCSIC would include Federal Parent Locator Service \n     under section 453 of the Act, The Secretary is also required \n     to establish within the NCSIC, by October 1, 1998, two new \n     automated data matching services designed to locate \n     individuals (and their assets) for CSE purposes:\n       The National Child Support Registry would contain minimal \n     information (including names, social security numbers or \n     other uniform identification numbers, and State case \n     identification numbers) on each case in a State central case \n     registry, based on information furnished and regularly \n     updated by State IV-D agencies.\n       The National Directory of New Hires would contain \n     identifying information--\n       Supplied by employers, within 10 business days of hiring \n     (or, if the employer makes automated reports, 10 business \n     days after the close of the corresponding payroll period), on \n     each individual hired on or after October 1, 1998, and\n       Consisting of extracts from reports to the Secretary of \n     Labor under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, supplied by \n     States either quarterly or on such more frequent basis as \n     such reports are supplied to the Secretary of Labor, in such \n     format and containing such information as the Secretary may \n     require.\n       (An employer failing to make a timely report concerning an \n     employee would be subject to a civil money penalty of the \n     lesser of $500 or 1 percent of the wages paid to the \n     employee.)\n       The Secretary is required to disclose or match data in the \n     Clearinghouse as follows:\n       Data are to be shared with the Social Security \n     Administration for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of \n     identifying information reported.\n       The New Hire Directory and Child Support Registry are to be \n     matched every 2 working days, and resulting information to be \n     reported to State CSE agencies.\n       Other Clearinghouse registries are to be matched against \n     each other, and resulting information is to be reported to \n     State CSE and AFDC agencies, to the extent found effective.\n       Data in Clearinghouse registries are to be disclosed \n     through the IEVS system to the AFDC, Medicaid,\n      unemployment compensation, food stamp, and territorial cash \n     assistance programs, for income eligibility verification \n     and any other purpose permitted under section 1137 of the \n     Act.\n       Registry data are to be disclosed to the Social Security \n     Administration for use in determining the accuracy of \n     supplemental security income payments under title XVI and in \n     connection with benefits under title II of the Act.\n       Data in the New Hire Directory are to be disclosed--\n       To the Secretary of the Treasury, for administration of the \n     earned income tax credit program and for verification of \n     claims concerning employment on tax returns; and\n       To State agencies administering unemployment compensation \n     and workers compensation programs, to assist determinations \n     on the allowability of claims.\n       The Secretary may disclose Clearinghouse data, without \n     personal identifiers, for research serving the purposes of \n     specified programs under title IV of the Act.\n       This section provides for reimbursement by the Secretary to \n     SSA and to State employment security agencies (SESAs) for \n     their costs of carrying out this section; and for \n     reimbursement to the Secretary by State and Federal agencies \n     receiving information from the Clearinghouse. This section \n     also include provisions designed to safeguard information in \n     the Clearinghouse from inappropriate disclosure or use.\n       This section makes related amendments to the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act and title III of the Social Security \n     Act, requiring [[Page S5417]] SESAs to furnish wage and \n     unemployment compensation information to the Directory of New \n     Hires.\n     Sec. 306. Expanded locate authority\n       Section 306; makes various amendments to remove legal \n     barriers and otherwise increase the effectiveness of \n     electronic data matches for CSE purposes. The FPLS authority \n     is amended--\n       To broaden the purpose of the FPLS to include locating \n     information on wages and other employment benefits, and on \n     other assets (or debts), for purposes of establishing or \n     setting the amount of support obligations;\n       To require the FPLS to obtain information from consumer \n     reporting agencies; and\n       To authorize the Secretary to set reasonable rates for \n     reimbursement to other Federal agencies, State agencies, and \n     consumer reporting agencies for the costs of providing \n     information to the FPLS.\n       This section also makes complementary amendments to other \n     laws, as follows:\n       Section 608 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to \n     make available to the FPLS all information on individuals in \n     the files of consumer reporting agencies (rather than only \n     locate information, as under current law).\n       Section 6103(1) (6) and (8) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (providing for IRS and Social Security Administration \n     disclosures of tax return information to Federal, State, and \n     local CSE agencies) are amended--\n       To eliminate the restriction that IRS may disclose return \n     information only if the information is not reasonably \n     available from any other source; and\n       To permit disclosures by the Social Security Administration \n     to OCSE.\n     Sec. 307.

State laws concerning paternity establishment\n       Section 501 amends the provisions concerning State laws on \n     paternity establishment to require such laws--\n       To permit the initiation of proceedings to establish \n     paternity before the birth of the child concerned;\n       To provide authority to order genetic testing upon request \n     of a party when such request is supported by a sworn \n     statement establishing a reasonable possibility of parentage;\n       To require the IV-D agency, when it orders genetic testing, \n     to pay the costs (subject (at State option) to recoupment \n     from the putative father if paternity is established), and to \n     obtain additional testing (upon advance payment) where test \n     results are disputed;\n       To require the State to admit into evidence results of any \n     genetic test that is of a type generally acknowledged by \n     accreditation bodies designated by the Secretary as reliable \n     evidence of paternity, and performed by a laboratory approved \n     by such an accreditation body; [[Page S5418]] \n       To make cooperation by hospitals and other health care \n     facilities in voluntary paternity acknowledgment procedures a \n     condition of Medicaid participation;\n       To require any State that treats a voluntary acknowledgment \n     as a rebuttable presumption to provide that the presumption \n     becomes conclusive within one year (unless rebutted or \n     invalidated);\n       To provide (at State option, notwithstanding the preceding \n     provision) for vacating an acknowledgement of paternity, upon \n     the request of a party, on the basis of new evidence, the \n     existence of fraud, or the best interest of the child; and\n       To provide that no judicial or administrative proceedings \n     are required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged \n     acknowledgement of paternity;\n       To provide that parties to a paternity proceeding are not \n     entitled to jury trial;\n       To require issuance of an order for temporary support, upon \n     motion of a party, pending an administrative or judicial \n     determination of parentage, where paternity is indicated by \n     genetic testing or other clear and convincing evidence;\n       To provide that bills for pregnancy, childbirth, and \n     genetic testing are admissible without foundation testimony;\n       To grant discretion to the tribunal establishing paternity \n     and support to waive rights to amounts owed to the State (but \n     not to the mother) for costs relating to pregnancy, \n     childbirth, genetic testing, and child support arrears, where \n     the father cooperates or acknowledges paternity;\n       To ensure that putative fathers have a reasonable \n     opportunity to initiate paternity actions.\n     Sec. 502. Outreach for voluntary paternity establishment\n       Section 502 requires State IV-D plans, effective October 1, \n     1996, to provide that the State will publicize the \n     availability and encourage the use of procedures for \n     voluntary establishment of paternity and child support \n     through a variety of means, which--\n       Will include distribution of materials at health care \n     facilities and other locations, such a schools; and follow-up \n     on each child for whom paternity has not been established \n     discharged from a hospital after birth; and\n       May include programs to educate expectant couples on rights \n     and responsibilities relating to paternity, in which all \n     expectant IV-A recipients may be require to participate).\n       90 percent Federal matching would be available for the \n     above outreach activities in quarters beginning on and after \n     October 1, 1996.\n     Sec. 503. Penalty for failure to establish paternity promptly\n       Section 503 provides for reduction of Federal matching \n     otherwise payable to a State IV-A program, for quarters \n     beginning 10 months or more after enactment of this bill, for \n     failure to establish paternity for children born 10 months or \n     more after enactment who are receiving public assistance, \n     whose mothers or custodial relatives have cooperated with \n     State agency efforts for the entire preceding year, but for \n     whom paternity has not been established. The reduction \n     formula would be establish in regulations; it would equal the \n     product of (1) the number of such children in the State \n     (after making allowance for a tolerance level of a percentage \n     of such children, ranging from 25 percent for FY 1998 to 10 \n     percent for FY 2004 and succeeding fiscal years); (2) the \n     average monthly AFDC payment; and (3) one-half the applicable \n     Federal matching rate under title IV-A.\n     Sec. 504. Incentives to parents to establish paternity\n       Section 504 authorizes the Secretary to approve IV-D State \n     plan amendments providing for incentive payments to families \n     to encourage paternity establishment. State payments for this \n     purpose would be matched as ordinary IV-D expenditures.\n       This section also requires the Secretary to authorize up to \n     3 States to conduct demonstrations providing financial \n     incentives to families for establishment of paternity. 90 \n     percent Federal matching would be available under title IV-D \n     for State payments to families under these demonstrations, up \n     to a $1 million cap on Federal expenditures.\n\n\n       title vi--establishment and modification of support orders\n\n     Sec. 601. National Commission on Child Support Guidelines\n       Section 601 authorizes the Secretary to establish a \n     National Commission on Child Support Guidelines to consider \n     the advisability of a national child support guideline (or \n     parameters for State guidelines) and, if appropriate, to \n     develop a proposed guideline for congressional consideration. \n     The Commission is to consider matters including the adequacy \n     of State guidelines; the definition of income and \n     circumstances under which income should be imputed; tax \n     treatment of support; cases in which parents have\n      obligations to more than one family, treatment of expenses \n     for child care, health care, and special needs; the \n     appropriate duration of support, and issues raised by \n     shared custody.\n       The Commission would have 2 members appointed by the \n     Chairman and 1 by the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate \n     Finance Committee; 2 appointed by the Chairman and 1 by the \n     Ranking Minority Member of the House Ways and Means \n     Committee; and 6 appointed by the Secretary. Members would be \n     appointed by March 1, 1996, and would make a final report to \n     the President and the Congress within 2 years after \n     appointment.\n       Appropriations are authorized of $1 million for each of FYs \n     1996 and 1997, to remain available until expended.\n     Sec. 602. State laws concerning modification of child support \n         orders\n       Section 602 requires States, effective October 1, 2000, to \n     have in effect laws concerning modification of child support \n     order under which--\n       The IV-D agency modifies all support order (including \n     judicial orders) included in the central case registry, in \n     accordance with State guidelines on award amounts;\n       All orders in the central case registry are revised and \n     adjusted at least every 36 months unless adjustment is not in \n     the child's best interests, or unless both parents decline \n     modification in writing.\n       Support orders must be reviewed upon the request of either \n     parent whenever either parent's income has changed by more \n     than 20 percent, or other substantial changes in \n     circumstances have occurred, since the order was established \n     or most recently reviewed.\n       This section also amends current due process provisions to \n     eliminate specific Federal timetables and to require instead \n     application of State due process safeguards.\n     Sec. 603. Study on use of tax return information for \n         modification of child support orders\n       Section 603 requires the Secretaries of HHS and Treasury to \n     conduct a study to determine how tax return information might \n     be used to facilitate the process of modifying child support \n     awards.\n     Sec. 604. Cost-of-living adjustment of child support awards\n       This section directs the States to include in their State \n     plan procedures to ensure that child support orders shall be \n     adjusted an annual basis in line with the Consumer Price \n     Index.\n                Title VII--Enforcement of Support Orders\n\n     Sec. 701 Revolving loan fund for program improvements to \n         increase collections\n       Section 701 authorizes appropriation of a total of $100 \n     million ($10 million each for FYs 1999 and 2000, and $20 \n     million each for FYs 2001 through 2004), to establish in \n     title IV-D a revolving fund for loans by the Secretary to \n     States for short-term projects making operational \n     improvements in State and local IV-D programs with the \n     potential for achieving substantial increases in child \n     support collections.\n       Loans from the fund could not exceed $5 million per State \n     or $1 million per project (or $5 million for a single \n     Statewide project in a large State); loan durations could not \n     exceed 3 years. Loans would be repaid through offsets against \n     the increase in State incentive payments, plus additional \n     offsets against State IV-D payments as necessary to ensure \n     full repayment in 3 years. Loan funds received by a State \n     could be used by the State as the non-Federal share of \n     expenditures under the State IV-D program.\n     Sec. 702. Federal income tax refund offset\n       Section 702 makes amendments, effective January 1, 1997, \n     relating to the authority to offset child support arrearages \n     against Federal income tax refunds, as follows:\n       The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to provide \n     that offsets of child support arrears (whether owed to the \n     family or assigned to the State) against income tax \n     overpayments would take priority over debts owed Federal \n     agencies (other than debts owed to HHS or the Department of \n     Education for student loans);\n       Title IV-D is amended--\n       To eliminate disparate treatment of families not receiving \n     public assistance, by repealing provisions (applicable only \n     to support arrears not assigned to the State) that--\n       Make the offset available only for minor or disabled \n     children who are still owed current support;\n       Set a higher threshold amount of arrears before tax offset \n     is available; and\n       Permit higher fees to be charged for the offset service.\n     Sec. 703. Internal Revenue Service collection of arrears\n       Section 703 amends the provision of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 which provides authority to collect child \n     support arrears as if they were a tax owed by the obligor, \n     upon certification of arrears by the Secretary of HHS, to bar \n     imposition by IRS of additional fees for adjustment to the \n     amount of arrears previously certified with respect to the \n     same obligor.\n     Sec 704. Authority to collect support from employment-related \n         payments by the United States\n       Section 704 amends title IV-D, effective 6 months after \n     enactment, to eliminate the separate rules for withholding of \n     child support from wages, pensions, and other employment-\n     related compensation of Federal employees. These amendments \n     treat U.S. employment income the same as income from any \n     other employer for purposes of the income withholding \n     provisions of title IV-D.\n       This section also amends 10 U.S.C. to remove barriers to \n     availability of military retirees' compensation for payment \n     of child support, by making clear that these funds can be \n     reached by administrative as well as judicial orders, and to \n     provide for payment through a designated governmental entity.\n     Sec. 705. Motor vehicle liens\n       Section 705 amends the title IV-D requirements for State \n     laws concerning liens with [[Page S5419]] respect to child \n     support arrears to require that States have and use \n     procedures to place liens on titled motor vehicles owned by \n     individuals owing child support arrears equal to two months \n     of support. Such liens would take precedence over all other \n     encumbrances on a vehicle title, other than a purchase money \n     security interest, and could be used to force seizure and \n     sale of the vehicle.\n     Sec. 706. Voiding of fraudulent transfers\n       Section 706 requires States to have in effect the Uniform \n     Fraudulent Conveyance Act of 1981, the Uniform Fraudulent \n     Transfer Act of 1984, or an equivalent law providing for \n     voiding of transfers of income or property made to avoid \n     payment of child support.\n     Sec. 707. State law authorizing suspension of licenses\n       Section 707 requires enactment of laws giving the State \n     authority to withhold, suspend, or restrict use of driver's \n     licenses, professional and occupational licenses, and \n     recreational licenses of individuals owing overdue child \n     support or failing to respond to subpoenas or warrants \n     relating to paternity or child support proceedings.\n     Sec. 708. Reporting arrearages to credit bureaus\n       Section 708 amends the requirement for a State law \n     providing for the reporting of child support arrears to \n     consumer credit bureaus (which currently must permit such \n     reporting) to require such reporting when payment is one \n     month overdue.\n     Sec. 709. Extended statute of limitation for collection of \n         arrearages\n       Section 709 requires that State law provide a statute of \n     limitations on child support arrears extending at least until \n     the child reaches age 30. (This amendment would not require a \n     State to revise any payment obligation which had lapsed on \n     the effective date of the State law.)\n     Sec. 710. Charges for arrearages\n       Section 710 requires State laws to provide, not later than \n     October 1, 1998, for assessment of interest or penalties for \n     child support arrearages.\n     Sec,. 711. Visitation issue barred\n       Section 711 requires State laws to provide that failure to \n     pay child support is not a defense to denial of visitation \n     rights, and denial of visitation rights is not a defense to \n     failure to pay child support.\n     Sec. 712. Denial of passports for nonpayment of child support\n       Section 712 amends 4 U.S.C., effective October 1, 1996, to \n     provide that the Secretary of State, upon a certification by \n     a State IV-D agency that an individual owes child support \n     arrears of over $5,000, must refuse to issue a passport to \n     the individual and may revoke or restrict a passport already \n     issued.\n     Sec. 713. Denial of Federal benefits, loans, and guarantees\n       This section provides that no Federal agency may make a \n     loan to, provide any guarantee for the benefit or, or provide \n     any benefit to any person who has a child support arrearage \n     exceeding $1,000 and who is not in compliance with a plan or \n     an agreement to repay this obligation. This provision is \n     designed to elevate the issue of child support in the \n     operations of the Federal government. The Federal agencies \n     determine, for example, if a contractor is on the suspension \n     and debarment list before the agency awards a contract to the \n     company. The purpose of this section is to create this type \n     of screening system for child support obligations.\n     Sec. 714. Seizure of lottery winnings\n       This section provides that the distributor of lottery \n     winnings, insurance settlements, judgments, and/or property \n     seizures shall first seek a determination from the State \n     child support enforcement agency as to whether the person \n     owes a child support arrearage. If there is an arrearage, \n     then there shall be a withholding of that amount which shall \n     be sent to the Child Support agency for distribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5404-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5419-S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n     Sec. 801. Child support enforcement and assurance \n         demonstrations\n       Section 801 requires the Secretary to fund grants to 3 \n     States for demonstrations, beginning in FY 1998 and lasting \n     from 7 to 10 years, providing assured levels of child support \n     for children for whom paternity and support have been \n     established. The projects would be administered by the State \n     IV-D agency or the State department of taxation and revenue. \n     Annual benefit levels set by States could range from $1,500 \n     to $3,000 for a family with one child, and from $3,000 to \n     $4,500 for a family with four or more children. States could \n     require absent parents with insufficient income to pay \n     support to work off support by participating in work \n     programs.\n       Ninety percent Federal matching would be available from \n     appropriations for payments to States under title IV-D, but \n     total Federal funds available for these demonstrations would \n     be capped at $27,000,000 for FY 1998; $55,000,000 for FY \n     1999; $70,000,000 for each of FYs 2000 through 2003; and \n     $55,000,000 for FY 2004. This section authorizes \n     appropriation of $10 million for FY 1998, to remain available \n     until expended, for the Secretary's costs for evaluating \n     demonstrations under this section.\n     Sec. 802. Social Security Act demonstrations\n       Section 802 amends section 1115(c) of the Act (which \n     currently requires that IV-D demonstrations not result in \n     increased costs to the Federal Government under AFDC) to \n     require instead that such demonstrations not result in an \n     increase in total costs to the Federal Government.\n\n\n                 Title IX--Access and Visitation Grants\n\n     Sec. 901. Grants to States for access and visitation programs\n       Section 901 adds a new section 469A of the Act providing a \n     new capped entitlement program of grants to States for \n     programs to support and facilitate noncustodial parents' \n     access to and visitation of their children. The program would \n     be funded at $5 million for each of FYs 1997 and 1998, and \n     $10 million per year thereafter; Federal funding would be \n     available to match 90 percent of a State's expenditures up to \n     the amount of its allotment under a formula based on the \n     numbers of children living with only one biological parent. \n     State programs could be administered by the CSE agency either \n     directly or through courts, local public agencies, or non-\n     profit private entities, and could be Statewide or \n     geographically limited.\n\n\n                      Title X--Effect of Enactment\n\n     Sec. 1001.

Severability\n       Section 1002 provides that the provisions of this title are \n     severable, and that any provision found invalid will not \n     affect the validity of any other provision which can be given \n     effect without regard to the invalid provision.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Office of Child Support Enforcement, Department of \n           Finance and Administration,\n                                  Little Rock, AR, March 30, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: We share your concern regarding the \n     future of the children and families of Arkansas and the \n     nation. Congress is considering sweeping changes to reform \n     the welfare system that will affect families struggling to \n     support their children. An effective child support \n     enforcement program is a essential part of that reform. \n     Regular child support payments must be ensured if single \n     parent families are to have financial security necessary for \n     children to thrive and to be successful citizens and relieve \n     the burden of taxpayers.\n       As child support enforcement professionals, we support the \n     efforts of congress to improve the present program. We \n     realize the importance of our role in empowering individuals \n     to become self-sufficient and we embrace the challenges \n     ahead. Our mission is to provide assistance to children and \n     families in obtaining financial and medical support through \n     locating parents, establishing paternity and support \n     obligations, and enforcing those obligations. Our vision for \n     the future is to put children first by helping parents assume \n     responsibility for the social and economic well-being and \n     health of their children.\n       To accomplish these goals we must have improved and uniform \n     enforcement remedies that reach across state lines. We must \n     also have improved operational support from both the state \n     and federal government and increased funding. While other \n     programs may lend themselves to block grants, nonpayment of \n     child support transcends state lines and requires some \n     uniformity in enforcement. Competing state interests affect \n     state legislation more readily than at the federal level. \n     Many state child support programs welcome federal mandates of \n     proven enforcement and operational remedies to assist them in \n     acquiring effective collection tools. Not all mandates are \n     bad. Much of the progress in child support has come about \n     through federal mandates and the resulting uniformity from \n     state to state has been most beneficial.\n       Child support advocates and professionals agree on much of \n     what is needed to improve the program nationwide. They \n     include the following:\n       1. Central Registry of Child Support Orders--States should \n     be required to develop and implement a central registry of \n     all child support orders. State central registries should be \n     formatted similarly to form a national central registry of \n     child support orders.\n       2. Central Collection Systems--It is difficult to enforce \n     child support orders because of the variety of collection \n     points. To enforce an order, payments made or not made must \n     be accounted for to determine past due support. With child \n     support payments being paid directly to custodial parents, \n     court clerks or local agencies it becomes a time consuming \n     process to collect payment records from different sources in \n     order to determine past due arrears. Central payment \n     processing has proven to be effective and efficient where \n     implemented. Central processing enables IV-D agencies to \n     monitor delinquencies in child support cases and allows \n     [[Page S5420]] for expedited enforcement remedies to be \n     implemented immediately upon delinquency. Many of the IV-D \n     agency's cases have been delinquent for months or years when \n     they enter the caseload. Central monitoring is essential if \n     we as a nation are to have an effective child support \n     program. Collections should not become delinquent. If they do \n     become delinquent, immediate enforcement actions must be \n     taken.\n       3. New Hire Reporting--New hire reporting has proven \n     effective in fifteen states. It is an effective tool to \n     locate job hoppers. Employers report new hires to the state \n     IV-D agency or in cooperation with state employment security \n     agencies when a new employee is hired. At present, there is \n     no good way to locate a job hopper for at least one quarter \n     of the year when withholding is first reported. Custodial \n     parents cannot wait that long to feed and clothe their \n     children. There are those who feel that this is too heavy a \n     burden upon employers. It need not be. It cold be as simple \n     as forwarding a copy of a W-4 form. We have found employers \n     to be responsive and concerned about child support issues. \n     When new hire reporting was erroneously reported as having \n     passed our legislature, employers called wanting to know how \n     to report new hires. There was no opposition in the employer \n     community but certain business interests presented strong \n     opposition to the measure. It is difficult to win approval \n     for such a measure on the local level and to do so requires \n     federal leadership.\n       4. License Revocation--License suspension or revocation is \n     a proven and effective administrative procedure to compel\n      payment of past due arrears. It is somewhat controversial \n     because of vested interest and licensing agencies \n     reluctance to participate, but it has proven to be \n     effective in Maine, California and Arkansas. Nineteen \n     states have adopted some form of license suspension or \n     revocation. To be an effective remedy all states need to \n     have access to licensing revocation and suspension. For \n     interstate enforcement a request to suspend a license in \n     another state would be most beneficial and would be a \n     deterrent to nonpayers to flee from one state to another \n     to avoid paying child support.\n       In addition to new enforcement techniques, support from the \n     federal government not just in dollars and cents but in \n     cooperation is paramount if we are to solve the national \n     nonsupport problem. Federal government agencies have \n     information we need to locate nonpaying noncustodial parents \n     and their assets. Yet, it is difficult to obtain that \n     information, it is outdated or; if provided, cannot be used \n     without additional verification.\n       1. Social Security Administration--We recommend that \n     Congress pass laws that would require the Social Security \n     Administration (SSA) to provide information to the child \n     support agencies for the purpose of determining the location \n     and the ability of the noncustodial parent to pay support. \n     Currently, information from SSA is available through the \n     Federal Parent Locator Service. However, the information that \n     we receive is minimal and outdated. We need to know if a \n     noncustodial parent has filed a claim for benefits, the \n     amount of benefits paid to the noncustodial parent and the \n     children, the amount of any lump sum payment to the \n     noncustodial parent or the custodial parent. This information \n     is vital in determining support obligations and arrearage.\n       2. IRS Locate and Asset Information--The IRS provides a \n     valuable service in the form of the Federal Tax Offset \n     program. Information on income is available from 1099 files. \n     However, The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has some concerns \n     with regard to safeguarding the information it shares with \n     state child support agencies and does not want the \n     information shared with anyone who is not a state employee. \n     Many states have contracted with local jurisdictions or \n     private entities, since 1975 in some states, to provide child \n     support services in their areas. After 20 years, the IRS has \n     suddenly raised issues of safeguarding confidentiality. These \n     contractors are agents or designees of the state and are \n     entitled to the same level of information as state employees \n     performing the same functions. Confidentiality is a high \n     priority\n      for all child support professionals and the information we \n     gather is used solely to establish or enforce child \n     support obligations. The Department of Defense has \n     contractors that have access to secure information that \n     could affect national security, certainly child support \n     contractors should have access to all information needed \n     to pursue a case. Something is very wrong when an agency \n     of the federal government can throw up road blocks to \n     obtaining information on delinquent noncustodial parents \n     affecting the ability of a child to receive the support he \n     deserves.\n       3. IRS Full Collection--The IRS full collection process \n     could be a valuable enforcement tool. However, our experience \n     has been that child support cases receive a low priority when \n     referred to the IRS field office. We suggest that Congress \n     provide funding for staff and resources to enhance the full \n     collection process and require that child support cases \n     receive priority over all other collection cases.\n       4. Automated Systems--The new child support data systems \n     being developed nationwide are sorely needed to manage the \n     growing number of delinquent child support cases. These \n     systems will assist child support workers who have caseloads \n     of 500 to 1000 cases to be more productive and enhance their \n     ability to make child support collections. However, the \n     resources of both the private vendors and states have been \n     exhausted in their attempt to make fifty statewide systems \n     operational by the deadline date. Few states will be up and \n     running by October 1, 1995 and the rush to get ``something \n     up'' by October 1 will produce inferior systems. There are \n     numerous reasons why these projects are in trouble. One of \n     the chief reasons for delay in implementation was that the \n     final federal regulations were not issued until October 1992 \n     and the certification requirements were not issued until June \n     1993. Both the state and the federal government have enormous \n     sums of money invested. We should get our moneys worth. By \n     extending the deadline for one more year to October 1, 1996 \n     without approving any additional funds for furthering the \n     project, state administrators will be allowed the opportunity \n     to make these projects successful. If there is no extension, \n     there is going to be mass confusion on or about October 1, \n     when all states try to bring up these new systems nationwide. \n     It does not make good sense to allow this to occur. We, \n     therefore, recommend an extension to October 1, 1996 at\n      the 90% FFP rate with no additional funding allowed other \n     than those funds previously approved in the state's \n     Advance Planning Documents.\n       The 1993 Amendments to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act (OBRA) required states to establish programs that provide \n     a simple civil process for unmarried parents to voluntarily \n     acknowledge paternity for their children. In Arkansas, all 56 \n     birthing centers are assisting parents by providing \n     information on establishing paternity and completing the \n     necessary forms. Since the program implementation date of \n     January 25, 1994, over 4,500 acknowledgements have been \n     signed. The acknowledgements are matched to the existing IV-D \n     caseload on a continual basis. To date, twenty-five percent \n     (25%) of the signed acknowledgements have been identified as \n     IV-D cases. To be truly successful, the program should be \n     extended to encompass postnatal follow-up to provide yet \n     another opportunity for parents to acknowledge the paternity \n     of their children. The IV-D agencies will follow-up with \n     families that receive child support services. However, the \n     Public Health agencies have an opportunity through public \n     education, nutrition, immunization and home health services \n     to reach the parents that are not served by the IV-D program. \n     We suggest that Congress provide a funding mechanism for the \n     public health agencies, Headstart and any other agencies \n     concerned with the welfare of children and families, to \n     provide paternity acknowledgement services to their clients.\n       Federal regulations require states to periodically review \n     and adjust child support orders utilizing state guidelines. \n     We agree that periodic review is essential to ensure that the \n     children receive the support they deserve and that parents \n     are ordered to pay a fair and reasonable amount. The process \n     by which review and adjustment is accomplished is restrictive \n     and incompatible with states' Rules of Civil Procedure. \n     States should have more flexibility to determine the process \n     by which review and adjustment is accomplished. One \n     alternative might be the award of Cost of Living Allowances \n     (COLA). This method could be automated and more evenly \n     applied.\n       Arkansas has implemented an administrative process to \n     revoke or suspend Commercial Driver's License of noncustodial \n     parents who are six (6) months behind in their child support \n     obligations. In less than six months of operation, we have \n     collected over $106,000. A total of 107 commercial driver's \n     licenses have been suspended, 12 licenses have been \n     reinstated and 70 noncustodial parents have signed agreements \n     to pay the delinquent accounts and avoid suspension of their \n     licenses. One of the most difficult case for us to collect is \n     the independent truck driver. With this program, drivers are \n     detained in weigh stations throughout the nation or at their \n     terminals until the child support issues are resolved. \n     Arkansas has recently extended the license suspension for\n      nonpayment of child support to all business and professional \n     licenses, hunting and fishing licenses and permanent \n     license plates. We recommend that all states be required \n     to suspend licenses to include all professional/business \n     licenses, regular drivers' licenses and personal vehicles, \n     trucks, boats and airplanes registered in the state. \n     States have found that the most successful programs are \n     administrative and automated. Congress should consider \n     requiring state IV-D agencies to implement such \n     administrative programs and provide funding for licensing \n     boards to become automated with electronic links to the \n     IV-D agencies.\n       No one wants to discuss funding in today's environment. \n     However, there is a direct relationship between the amount of \n     child support collected and the ratio of child support \n     workers per case. The more workers, the more child support is \n     collected. At some point there would be diminishing returns, \n     but this is not likely in the foreseeable future. Originally, \n     states received 75% FFP plus incentives on collections. Only \n     AFDC cases were mandated. Over the years since the program \n     began, FFP has decreased to 66% plus 6-10% incentives on AFDC \n     cases and 6-10% on non-AFDC cases. Incentives on non-AFDC \n     collections are capped at 115% of AFDC collections, creating \n     somewhat of a disincentive to work non-AFDC cases. During the \n     same time period that federal financial participation was \n     decreasing, Congress mandated services to non-AFDC clients \n     and Medicaid recipients, increasing caseloads \n     [[Page S5421]] dramatically. Caseloads, nationally, have \n     increased by 128% with collections increasing by 345% during \n     the same period, FFP has decreased by 5.7%. States are \n     continually asked to do more with less funding, which has \n     contributed to the growing problem of uncollected child \n     support.\n       While the intent of the current proposal being considered \n     is to provide some relief and to redistribute federal dollars \n     among states, it is important to understand the effect of the \n     proposed funding scheme. Under the proposed distribution \n     rules, states will lose dollars in the form of retained AFDC \n     collections which provide match dollars for half of the \n     states. Currently, states can earn more than 100% funding. \n     Some make a profit. Under the new scheme, the best a state \n     can do is 90% FFP. Since many states pass incentives on to \n     the contractors providing services in some local \n     jurisdictions, many local offices will be asked to enter into \n     contracts knowing that they will experience at least a 10% \n     loss each year or state cost will increase. Once again, as \n     Congress attempts to improve the nation's child support \n     problem, a funding cut is proposed. We know that more dollars \n     must be invested in caseworkers and automation if we are to \n     work more cases and collect more child support. Why then \n     reduce funding to state programs by at least 10% when you \n     want them to do more? If we are to remove custodial parents \n     from welfare and make parents financially responsible for \n     their children, a strong child support program is essential. \n     A return to the 75% FFP plus incentives would be helpful and \n     we recommend that incentives by sufficient to allow for a \n     100% reimbursement. Any funds over 100% should be returned to \n     the federal government.\n       We greatly appreciate your interest in child support \n     enforcement. Thank you for the opportunity to express our \n     views on these very important issues. We join in your \n     commitment to assist the children and families of Arkansas \n     and the nation to realize their full potential.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Judy Jones Jordan,\n                                                    Administrator.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 688. A bill to provide for the minting and circulation of $1 \nsilver coins; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                The U.S. Silver Dollar Coin Act of 1995\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would permit the minting of a $1 silver-plated coin \nwith a likeness of President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the front and a \nrendering of the Iwo Jima monument on the reverse side of the coin. I \nam pleased that Senator Grassley is joining in this effort that will \nprovide a boost to our domestic silver mining industry and could serve \nto reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Our currency system has not been significantly altered over the past \ncentury even though the economy has fundamentally changed. Not long \nago, an individual could use one coin--a nickel, dime, or quarter--to \npurchase a coke from a vending machine or ride a bus. Today, that's \njust not possible. Vending machines require two, three, or four coins, \nor, even worse, a dollar bill. And you know how frustrating those \ndollar bill readers can be on vending machines and Metro fare machines. \nTo make matters worse, a dollar bill reader on a vending machine costs \n$400 to $500--an utterly unnecessary cost if a dollar coin were \navailable.\n  According to the Coin Coalition, processing dollar coins instead of \ndollar bills would save the mass transit industry alone more than $124 \nmillion a year. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation \nAuthority would save $3.5 million a year if it did not have to expend \nthe time and labor in processing--unwrinkling dollar bills. Those \nsavings could be used too buy 24 new buses to move people instead of \npaper. The Chicago Transit Authority does its own bill-unfolding, at a \ncost of $22 per thousand. Processing coins costs just $1.64 per \nthousand.\n  In addition, many economists project that a dollar coin could save \nthe Federal Government several million dollars. Although coins cost \nmore to mint than dollar bills to print, coins last far longer. A bill \nwears out in an average of about 17 months while coins can last 30 \nyears.\n  Since this is the 50th anniversary of the allied victory in World War \nII, I believe it is appropriate that the new coin present a likeness of \nPresident Eisenhower who also served as the Supreme Commander in \nEurope. The rendition of the raising of the flag on Mount Surabachi on \nIwo Jima has become a symbol of the dedication and valor of our Armed \nForces in restoring freedom in the Pacific.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in getting this coin modernization \nenacted into law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 688\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Silver Dollar \n     Coin Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ONE-DOLLAR COINS.\n       (a) Color and Content.--Section 5112(b) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The dollar,'' and \n     inserting ``The''; and\n       (2) by inserting after the fourth sentence the following: \n     ``The dollar coin authorized under subsection (a)(1) shall be \n     silver in color, shall have a distinctive edge and have \n     tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the \n     coin readily discernible, shall be minted and fabricated in \n     the United States, and shall have metallic and anti-counter-\n     feiting properties similar to those of United States clad \n     coinage, except that the dollar coin shall be a clad coin \n     with 3 layers of metal, including 2 outer layers of silver. \n     The dollar coin authorized under subsection (a)(1) shall \n     contain not less than 1 gram of newly mined fine silver.''.\n       (b) Adjustments to Silver Content.--Section 5112(c) of \n     title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following: ``Notwithstanding subsection (b), the \n     Secretary may prescribe the weight of silver in the dollar \n     coin if the Secretary determines that such action is \n     necessary to ensure an adequate supply of dollar coins to \n     meet the needs of the United States.''.\n       (c) Design.--Section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the fourth sentence, by striking ``the dollar, half \n     dollar,'' and inserting ``the half dollar''; and\n       (2) by striking the fifth and sixth sentences and inserting \n     the following: ``The obverse side of the dollar coin shall \n     bear a likeness of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the \n     reverse side shall bear a rendering of the Iwo Jima \n     Memorial.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Not later than 30 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall place into circulation the one-dollar coins authorized \n     by section 5112(a)(1) of title 31, United States Code, in \n     accordance with the amendments made by subsections (a), (b), \n     and (c).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 689. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act regarding the \nuse of organic sorbents in landfills, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            THE LANDFILL TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing today the \nLandfill Technical Improvement Act of 1995. This legislation will allow \nus to maximize technical advances of the last decade in carrying out \nour Nation's environmental protection strategy. It will also promote \nsmall business and entrepreneurship and help our Nation complete in the \nglobal market for new, environment driven technologies.\n  By passing the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste amendments, Congress \nrequired the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to issue regulations \nrestricting the disposal of organic absorbents in hazardous waste \nlandfills. In the past decade, however, developments in natural \nabsorbent technologies show more efficiency than traditional sorbents \nproduced for fossil fuels.\n  For example, a company in Bellingham, WA, manufactures organic \nsorbents from a local paper mill's sludge. Sludge recycled into \nproductive use is kept out of landfills. This small company employs 20 \nto 30 Washingtonians and, with other similar companies across the \ncountry, seeks to expand in the marketplace with this new, recycled \nproduct.\n  Normal landfill conditions are anaerobic, and studies have shown that \nno biodegradtion takes place in the anaerobic environment of landfills. \nThus, in this anaerobic environment of RCRA landfills, these sorbents \nwill not degrade. These organic absorbents, made totally from reclaimed \nmaterials, may actually outperform current chemical absorbents. \nHowever, because of the 1984 amendments and subsequent EPA regulations, \nthese absorbents have been effectively shut out from disposition in \nlandfills.\n  This disposition issue threatens to undermine the existence of these \nnew technologies, since that which cannot be disposed economically will \nnot be [[Page S5422]] used. Moreover, innovative and environmentally \nconscious technologies, such as those developed by this small company \nin my State, are discriminated against.\n  The administration has clearly stated its preference for such \nrecycled/reclaimed materials, but this flawed regulation has prejudiced \nthe widespread availability and use of these products. This is to the \ndetriment of our national environmental goals.\n  This bill remedies this situation, allowing the fullest use of \nenvironmentally sound landfill technologies.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 690. A bill to amend the Federal Noxious Week Act of 1974 and the \nTerminal Inspection Act to improve the exclusion, eradication, and \ncontrol of noxious weeds and plants, plant products, plant pests, \nanimals, and other organisms within and into the United States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n        THE FEDERAL NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. AKAKA.\n Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Noxious Weed Control \nImprovement Act of 1995. Senators Campbell and Dorgan have joined me as \ncosponsors of this bill. The objective of this legislation is to curb \nthe wave of noxious weeds that is sweeping over productive rangeland, \nagricultural land, and native ecosystems across America.\n\n  I hope my colleagues saw the article on invasive alien species that \nappeared in the New York Times magazine last November. It vividly \ndescribed the threats to the tropical ecosystems of Hawaii posed by \nnonindigenous species. In Hawaii, gorse, ivy gourd, and the banana poka \nvine are ravaging native forest and rangeland. But Hawaii is not alone \nin facing this threat. Nearly 200 species of troublesome imported weeds \ninfest the continental United States.\n  We see evidence of this problem within a few miles of the Capitol. \nDrive to the edge of the Potomac or through Rock Creek Park and you \nwill see impenetrable mats of hydrilla and honeysuckle. Another weed, \nkudzu, topples grown trees and smothers shrubs and plants. In New \nEngland, Oriental bittersweet and porcelain berry vine cause similar \ndamage. Purple loosestrife has decimated wetlands across the country \nfrom Maine to Washington.\n  Leafy spurge, spotted knapweed, cheatgrass, thistle, salt cedar, and \nMedusa-head cover millions of acres of grasslands in Montana, Idaho, \nOregon, and Washington. All of these weeds are foreign to the United \nStates. Some are toxic to livestock. Others are heavy consumers of \nwater, or fuel forest and rangeland fires. These weeds ruin the \ngrasslands for birds, elk, and grizzly bears. In Montana alone, \ncattlemen suffer millions of dollars of forage losses due to spotted \nknapweed. At its current rate of spread, Montana's projected losses due \nto spotted knapweed could exceed $100 million by the year 2000. Another \nweed, leafy spurge, occupies over 2.5 million acres in 30 States. \nNationwide, $100 million in direct and indirect losses to livestock are \nattributable to leafy spurge.\n  The cost of weed control and losses due to weed infestation are \nestimated at over $20 billion per year, more than the combined losses \nfor all other pests.\n  Nearly 16 million acres of Federal land are infested with noxious \nweeds. On Bureau of Land Management lands, weed infestation expands at \na rate of 2,000 acres per day. If current trends continue, a quarter of \nBLM lands in the continental United States could be overrun with weeds \nby the turn of the century.\n  At least one hundred of our national parks face serious harm to their \nnatural resources as a result of invasive foreign plants. Everglades \nNational Park and Big Cypress National Preserve are overrun by the \nAustralian melaleuca tree. More than 400,000 acres of the everglades \nare infested by this tree, and 50 additional acres are consumed each \nday. Wildlife habitat and water supplies are also threatened by \nmaleleuca in the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Another tree, \nthe Brazilian pepper, is crowding out the mangroves along Florida's \nsouthwestern coast. Both of these alien trees make habitat unsuitable \nfor native water birds.\n  Competition from 25 exotic plants threatens the habitat of rare \nplants in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Among the damaging \nspecies are stink tree, multi-flora rose, and an imported grass with a \nscientific name I won't even attempt to pronounce.\n  River margins and rare desert springs in the beautiful slickrock \nparks of Utah, including Canyonlands and Zion National Parks, as well \nas in Death Valley National Park, have become overgrown with tamarisk, \na tree which literally sucks the water out of the ground, depriving \nwildlife and native plants of precious water supplies.\n  Efforts to safeguard private and public land from these threats are \ngrossly inadequate. In 1993, the Congressional Office of Technology \nAssessment called U.S. efforts to counter the effects of invasive \nexotic species ``a largely uncoordinated patchwork of laws, \nregulations, policies, and programs.''\n  The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for preventing noxious \nweeds from entering the country either accidentally or as intentional \nimports, as well as for spearheading\n control efforts for those noxious weeds that have already become \nestablished. However, the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 has not been \nan effective tool to address this problem.\n\n  Under current law, the Secretary of Agriculture must wait until a \nweed is an established, documented nuisance before action can be taken. \nThat's like waiting until the cows have run away before you close the \nbarn door.\n  For example, tropical soda apple, a plant in the nightshade family, \nwas introduced from Brazil into pastures in Florida. It was first \nobserved in 1987 and now occupies more than 400,000 acres in Florida. \nAlthough cattle cannot eat the plant because of its sharp spines, seeds \nfrom this invasive weed easily contaminate hay and other forages. \nTropical soda apple presents a particularly difficult control problem \nbecause seeds are passed through cattle manure. In Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Georgia, more than 20 outbreaks have been linked to cattle \npurchased in Florida. Tropical soda apple can also be transported in \ncommercially packaged manure used for gardening. Despite the danger and \nthe relative ease of dealing with the original infestation, it took the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture 8 years to declare it a noxious weed. \nDuring that time, the problem has become so widespread that containment \nmay be beyond hope.\n  To correct weaknesses in the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974, my \nbill would grant emergency authority to prohibit the entry of foreign \nweeds that have not been formally added to the Federal noxious weed \nlist. Weeds could also be added to the list through a petition process. \nAlso, the bill would prohibit the international movement of Federal \nnoxious weeds across State lines except under permit. Finally, this \nlegislation would establish a Noxious Weed Technical Advisory Group to \nevaluate weed species, develop appropriate classification criteria for \nnoxious weeds, and make recommendations to implement the act.\n  As the hearings that I chaired during the 103d Congress clearly \ndemonstrated, the lack of coordination between Federal agencies that \nare responsible for the control of alien weeds is a serious problem. \nTwenty-four Federal agencies located in 8 different Cabinet departments \nhave responsibility for pest control. They enforce more than an dozen \nmajor laws, and a host of minor ones.\n  With so many statutes and so many agencies, Federal policy resembles \na piece of swiss cheese, and noxious, foreign pests are streaming \nthrough the holes in policy and enforcement. Hawaii and other States \nsuffer the consequences of piecemeal Federal enforcement.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the prompt passage of this bill. I \nhope that we can consider this legislation as part of the 1995 farm \nbill. All of our constituents will benefit from a stronger and more \nsecure foundation for agriculture and conservation of our natural \nresources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Federal Noxious Weed \nControl Improvement Act of 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of early detection of prostate cancer and certain \ndrug treatment services under part B of the medicare program, to amend \nchapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, to provide for coverage of \nsuch early detection and treatment services under the programs of the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs, and to expand research and education \nprograms of the National Institutes of Health and the Public Health \nService relating to prostate cancer; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Prostate Cancer \nDiagnosis and Treatment Act of 1995. Prostate cancer is the leading \ncancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among American men. \nOver 215,000 Americans will be diagnosed with the disease this year and \nover 40,000 men will die from it.\n  Despite recent advances in the early detection and treatment of \nprostate cancer, the number of cases and the number of deaths continue \nto rise. Prostate cancer is as common today in men as breast cancer is \nin women, and the death rates for the two diseases are similar as well. \nOver this decade, prostate cancer cases and deaths are expected to \ncontinue their rapid rise--with cases increasing by 37 percent and \ndeaths by 90 percent between 1985 and 2000.\n  Early detection has been greatly improved with the development of the \nprostate specific antigen [PSA] test--a simple and inexpensive blood \ntest for the presence of prostate cancer. As a result, the American \nUrological Association and the American Cancer Society now recommend \nthat men ago 50 and over get an annual screening with the PSA test. \nTreatment has been improved through new surgical techniques that remove \nthe cancer without disastrous side effects, and through new drug \ntherapy that can extend life expectancy and improve patient comfort for \npatients with advanced stage cancer.\n  These improvements have meant the difference between life and death \nfor many men. The ability to detect prostate cancer in the first stage \nof the disease has made it possible to surgically remove the cancer \nwhen it is still confined to the prostate. Over 70 percent of patients \ntreated in this way never have a recurrence of the disease. Waiting \nuntil the second stage or later, which was necessary under previous \ntechniques, greatly increases the risk that the cancer has spread, with \nsmall hope for a cure.\n  I know how important it is to get screening and early treatment for \nprostate cancer--I am a prostate cancer survivor. I had a PSA test--I \nhad a positive score--I had my prostate removed--and I am here to tell \nabout it as a result. A number of my colleagues in this Chamber--\nSenator Dole, Senator Stevens, among them--are here with us today \nbecause their prostate cancer was spotted early and treated \neffectively. General Schwarzkopf, the hero of the gulf war, is another \nman nearly felled by prostate cancer, but saved through screening and \nsurgery. General Schwarzkopf has become a national spokesman for \nprostate cancer detection. General Schwarzkopf and all of us in \nCongress are lucky to have the kind of insurance coverage we do through \nthe Military and Federal Employees Health Benefit plans and the access \nwe have to the finest medical facilities and doctors at Walter Reed \nHospital among other places.\n  We can all be sure we get our annual PSA test and any treatment we \nmay need.\n  The tragedy is that 13 million American men who are at the highest \nrisk for this disease do not have health insurance coverage for the \nbest early detection methods and drug therapies. They do not have it \nbecause we, the Congress, have not seen fit to provide it for them \nthrough the Medicare and Veterans Health programs. Medicare covers the \nold diagnostic test but does not provide for an annual PSA test. The \nVeterans Health services could provide annual tests for their resident \nand in-patient populations, but rarely do the tests or the follow-on \nsurgery. Both of these programs cover part of the hormonal drug therapy \nfor treatment of advanced prostate cancer, but leave out the oral drug \nwhich is particularly effective when given in combination therapy. \nThese omissions are particularly troubling because these programs cover \nthe overwhelming majority of men who have the disease.\n  Finally, it is remarkable that we have had these breakthroughs in \ndetection and treatment given that we have so completely neglected \nfunding for prostate cancer research. Prostate cancer is a disease that \nhas a similar incidence and death rate to breast cancer \n[[Page S5427]] yet receives one-fourth as much research money. This is \na serious oversight that we should correct to increase the pace of \nresearch and develop conclusive evidence on what really works and does \nnot work in treating prostate cancer.\n  The Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 1995 would take \nthree important steps to halt the progression of this disease. First, \nit would nearly double spending on research to develop more effective \ntreatments of the disease. Second, it would make PSA tests available \nunder the Medicare and Veterans Health programs. Third, it would extend \nMedicare and Veterans Health coverage for prostate cancer drugs to \ncover the advanced combination therapy including oral drugs that can \nsignificantly extend and improve the lives of prostate cancer victims.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we increase our efforts to combat \nthis deadly form of cancer and address these deficiencies in our \nFederal health coverage and research programs. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in sponsoring the legislation that could make a difference for \nthousands of men who might otherwise have suffered greatly or died an \nuntimely death from prostate cancer.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 694.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsummary of the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Rights Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nProvisions of the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim's Rights Act of \n                                  1995\n\n\n                 title i--equal protection for victims\n\n       Sec. 101.

Right of the victim to an impartial jury.\n       Protects the right of victims to an impartial jury by \n     equalizing the number of peremptory challenges afforded to \n     the defense and the prosecution in jury selection. (Current \n     law affords defendants 10 peremptory challenges, but affords \n     the prosecution only 6, in felony cases.)\n       Sec. 103. Right of the victim to fair treatment in legal \n     proceedings.\n       Establishes higher standards of professional conduct for \n     lawyers in federal cases to protect victims and other \n     witnesses from abuse, and to promote the effective search for \n     truth. Specific measures include prohibition of: harassing or \n     dilatory tactics, knowingly presenting false evidence or \n     discrediting truthful evidence, willful ignorance of matters \n     that could be learned from the client, and concealment of \n     information necessary to prevent violent or sexual abuse \n     crimes.\n       Sec. 104. Rebuttal of attacks on the victim's character.\n       Provides that if a defendant presents negative character \n     evidence concerning the victim, the government's rebuttal can \n     include negative character evidence concerning the defendant.\n       Sec. 105. Use of notice concerning release of offender.\n       Repeals provision that notices to state and local law \n     enforcement concerning the release of federal violent and \n     drug trafficking offenders can only be used for law \n     enforcement purposes. This removes an impediment to other \n     legitimate uses of such information, such as advising victims \n     or potential victims that the offender has returned to the \n     area.\n       Sec. 106. Balance in the composition of rules committees.\n       Provides for equal representation of prosecutors with \n     defense lawyers on committees in the judiciary that make \n     recommendations concerning rules affecting criminal cases.\n       Sec. 107. Victim's right of allocution in sentencing.\n       Extends the right of victims to address the court \n     concerning the sentence to all criminal cases. Current law \n     provides such a right for victims only in violent crime and \n     sexual abuse cases, though the offender has the right to make \n     an allocutive statement in all cases.\n\n\ntitle ii--sexual violence, domestic violence, and offenses against the \n                                 family\n\n       Sec. 201. Implementation of evidence rules for sexual \n     assault and child molestation cases.\n       Provides that F.R.E. 413-15, which establish general rules \n     of admissibility for similar crimes evidence in sexual \n     assault and child molestation cases, will take effect \n     immediately.\n       Sec. 202. HIV testing of defendants in sexual assault \n     cases.\n       Provides effective procedures for HIV testing of defendants \n     in sexual assault cases, with disclosure of test results of \n     the victim.\n       Sec. 203.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the Tallgrass \nPrairie National Preserve in Kansas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the tallgrass prairie national preserve act\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nKansas, Senator Dole, to introduce legislation to create a tallgrass \nprairie preserve in the Flint Hills of Kansas.\n  At a time when some in Congress are asking hard questions about the \ncost and role of some units in the national park system, one may wonder \nwhy I am proposing the addition of another preserve to an already \noverburdened system. I am aware and sympathetic to those who complain \nthat some members of Congress have taken a parochial interest in the \npark system, passing bills to create parks and historical sites more \nfor their economic benefits to neighboring communities than because the \narea is nationally significant, either naturally or historically.\n  James Ridenour, former director of the National Park Service under \nPresident Bush, calls this the ``thinning of the blood'' of park system \nand points out that we are spreading limited personnel and scarce funds \ntoo thin. As a consequence, we have been spending an increasing \npercentage of Federal dollars on sites with questionable significance \nand devoting less to protecting our Nation's naturally significant \nresources. However, Mr. Ridenour strongly supports the bill being \nintroduced today as a unique solution to the creation of an important \naddition to the park system.\n  This legislation was crafted in response to these concerns. It \ncreates for the first time a private-public partnership, where capital \nfrom a private conservation organization is combined with limited funds \nfrom the Federal Government to create a national preserve open to the \nAmerican public. We will be doing this at a fraction of the cost that \nthe Federal Government would otherwise spend if it were to purchase the \nproperty for preservation. By taking this approach, we will be \npreserving for the first time an ecosystem that is found nowhere in the \npark service system. The approach taken in this bill is the kind of new \nthinking we in Congress must explore if we are to wisely spend scarce \nFederal dollars to protect important natural and historic areas in the \nfuture.\n  For those who have never been to the Flint Hills of Kansas, let me \nexplain why this area is so unique and special. From Nebraska to \nOklahoma there remains a narrow swath of tallgrass prairie--the \nremnants of a once vast tallgrass prairie ecosystem that covered \n400,000 square miles from Ohio to the Rocky Mountains, from Canada to \nTexas. Today, less than 1 percent of this ecosystem remains, much of it \nin the Flint Hills, which are too steep and too rocky to farm.\n  There is no better example of this tallgrass prairie ecosystem in the \nFlint Hills than the 10,894-acre Spring Hill Ranch in Chase County. \nHundreds of species of native plants and grasses grow on the ranch. \nNearly 200 kinds of [[Page S5428]] birds, 29 species of reptiles and \namphibians, and 31 species of mammals can be found on the property. The \nNational Park Service, after an extensive survey of the property in \n1991, concluded the property was\n nationally significant became of its natural resources and said it \ndeserved conservation as a unit of the national park system.\n  Beyond the natural splendor of the ranch, the property includes a \nhouse, barn, and several outbuildings listed on the National Register \nof Historic Places because of their unique second empire architectural \nstyle. Each of these buildings was built in the 1880s from hand-cut \ncottonwood limestone quarried in the area. They illustrate the elegance \nand style of the ranch's first owner, a local cattle baron. A mile way \nfrom the house, over a rise in the land, also sets a one-room prairie \nschool built in 1882.\n  For the past 4 years, I have been involved in efforts to preserve \nthis ranch and open it to the public. Last year, the National Park \nTrust, a private conservation organization, purchased the ranch and has \nbeen working with members of the Kansas congressional delegation and \nofficials with the Department of the Interior to develop legislation to \npreserve the ranch through a private-public partnership. The results, \nwhich have come only after painstaking negotiations with the Trust, \nInterior officials, and representatives of Kansas' agricultural and \nconservation groups, is reflected in the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n  The Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Act will allow the National \nPark Service to purchase or accept donations of up to 180 acres, or \nless than 2 percent of the ranch. In meetings I have had with Secretary \nof the Interior Bruce Babbitt, he has stated that he would like to see \nthe National Park Service own, maintain, and operate this historic core \narea, which includes the house, barn, and outbuildings.\n  The rest of the ranch will continue in private ownership, but the \nSecretary of the Interior is given the authority in this bill to enter \ninto a cooperative agreement with the National Park Trust to provide \ninterpretative and resource management assistance for the rest of the \nranch, as well as police and emergency services.\n  What is different about this proposal and why it makes such sense \nfrom the standpoint of the Federal Government is that the American \npeople will have access to and use of the 10,894-acre ranch for the \ncost of operating a 180-acre site. The National Park Trust, in a letter \nthat I will ask be printed in the Record following my statement, has \ncommitted to donating to the Federal Government at no cost up to the \n180 acres of the ranch's historic core. This donation, estimated by the \ntrust to exceed $2 million in value, was one of the elements we \nnegotiated to make this bill a true private-public partnership.\n  Mr. President, as Congress looks for innovative ways to make \nGovernment work better, I believe the approach taken in this bill \nsignals departure from the way the Federal Government has protected \nimportant natural and historic areas in the past. I am pleased\n officials with the Department of the Interior have been so willing to \nwork with me to explore this partnership. They have gone to great \nlengths to ensure the quality of this Park Service unit will not be \ncompromised, while remaining open to suggestions to new ways of \napproaching issues. As former Director Ridenour says in a letter \nendorsing the legislation, this bill ``represents the kind of creative \nthinking that will have to take place to guarantee that we take care of \nour great parks in the future.''\n\n  In addition to the care that was taken to draft this private-public \npartnership, equal care was given to address the legitimate concerns of \narea ranchers. In this bill, National Park Service ownership is limited \nto 180 acres, and no further expansion is permitted. Language was \nincorporated into the bill to address concerns regarding fence \nmaintenance and to require compliance with State noxious weed, \npesticide, animal health, and water laws. The bill establishes an \nadvisory committee consisting of conservationists, landowners, local \ncommunity officials, and range management specialists to help determine \nhow the ranch should be managed. The bill also incorporates language \nthat requires the Federal Government to be a good partner with \nneighboring communities and work cooperatively to deliver emergency and \nother services.\n  Mr. President, we have a wonderful opportunity to protect for future \ngenerations a portion of the tallgrass prairie--the only ecosystem not \ncurrently represented in the National Park System. Passage of this bill \nwill give the American public an opportunity to enjoy and explore this \nbeautiful area and grow to appreciate its history and importance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Park Trust \nand a letter from James Ridenour be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nother material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senator Kassebaum,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: It is a privilege for the National \n     Park Trust to endorse the legislation you are introducing to \n     establish a Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas. We \n     commend you for your leadership in recognizing the importance \n     of America's tallgrass prairie, which once covered more than \n     140 million acres across our nation's heartland, but today \n     only survives in remnant swatches.\n       The Spring Hill/Z Bar Ranch encompasses a magnificent \n     unspoiled swath of the Flint Hills. Its rolling, nearly \n     treeless landscape with grasses, sometimes reaching ten feet \n     in height, sustains the biological riches of a vanishing \n     American landscape. Nearly 200 kinds of birds, 29 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and 31 species of mammals can be \n     found on the property. Its distinctive century-old limestone \n     buildings, looming large amid ocean-like waves of prairie, \n     give enduring voice to local traditions and can serve as an \n     appropriate setting to tell the story of Native Americans and \n     pioneers and our nation's westward expansion. Because of its \n     outstanding natural and cultural resources, the National Park \n     Service's 1991 special resource study concluded that the \n     property met the standards as a unit of the National Park \n     System.\n       The National Park Trust acquired the Spring Hill/Z Bar \n     Ranch last June as a first important step toward ensuring \n     that this country's tallgrass heritage is preserved and \n     interpreted for all Americans. The Trust is a 501(c)(3) non-\n     profit educational and charitable corporation which is \n     celebrating more than ten years as the land conservancy of \n     the national parks. Its mission is to assist the National \n     Park Service in the acquisition of inholdings from willing \n     sellers, and to acquire and protect properties, such as the \n     Spring Hill/Z Bar Ranch, that merit protection as units of \n     the National Park System.\n       Now more than ever, the acquisition of properties for \n     inclusion in the National Park System is limited by shrinking \n     federal funds. In view of the condition of the federal budget \n     and because inclusion of a tallgrass prairie unit is believed \n     by many to be the highest priority for the National Park \n     System, the Trust will consider as its May meeting a proposal \n     to donate up to 180 acres of the historic core area of the \n     ranch, with a value of more than $2 million, to the national \n     Park Service. The property would be donated once the federal \n     designation has occurred and the National Park Service has \n     completed its study to determine the amount of acreage that \n     is needed. It is our hope that this potential donation \n     indicates the strength of our conviction that the Spring \n     Hill/Z Bar Ranch is of great national significance and \n     deserves to be part of the National Park System.\n       We also continue our pledge to manage the remainder of the \n     property not under the direct control of the National Park \n     Service in a manner that is compatible with the preserve's \n     general management plan--a plan that will be developed by the \n     National Park Service in cooperation with a citizen advisory \n     committee.\n       We welcome this opportunity to support this legislation and \n     look forward to its completion so that this deserving \n     resource can be part of the National Park System.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               J. Paul Duffendack,\n        Chairman, Tallgrass Prairie Interim Management Committee, \n     Member, National Park Trust Board of Trustees.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Indiana University,\n\n                                   Bloomington, IN, April 3, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: This is a letter in support of your \n     efforts to set aside a tall grass prairie in Kansas. You may \n     recall that I was Director of the National Park Service in \n     the Bush Administration.\n       In lectures I have been giving around the country, I have \n     been saying that the last great natural park to be purchased \n     is a tall grass prairie park. We may have some trades between \n     various federal agencies from time to time, but the tall \n     grass park is one in which private ownership will be \n     involved.\n       You have reached a unique solution to creating the park. \n     Private ownership has been recognized and respected while the \n     core area of 180 acres would become the management \n     responsibility of the NPS. This represents the kind of \n     creative thinking that will have to take place to guarantee \n     that we take care of our great parks in the future.\n       A tall grass prairie is a missing link in our system. This \n     statement comes from a former director who in leery of \n     creating additional parks. In my book, National Parks \n     Compromised, I talk of the concern I have with ``thinning the \n     blood'' of our system with parks with little or no national \n     significance. A tall grass addition to the system would not \n     be a ``Thinning of the blood'', especially in the creative \n     manner you are bringing it into the system.\n       Good luck and thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            James M. Ridenour,\n\n                                        Director, Eppley Institute\n                                       for Parks and Public Lands.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, for several years there have been attempts \nto create a national tall grass prairie preserve on nearly 11,000 acres \nin Kansas, known as the Z-Bar Ranch. Proposals for this preserve have \nfaced valid opposition from concerned citizens and landowners in the \narea. Today, Senator Kassebaum is introducing legislation which I \nexpect will establish a successful public/private partnership.\n  I commend Senator Kassebaum's leadership efforts to establish a \nprairie park in Kansas. In January 1992, she organized the Spring Hill/\nZ-Bar Ranch Foundation to raise money for the purchase of the ranch. \nThis private foundation also addressed many of the concerns of local \nresidents and landowners.\n  Last summer, the Z-Bar Ranch was sold to a private trust. But \nestablishing Z-Bar as a national preserve requires legislation. Senator \nKassebaum has worked diligently to strike a balance which is acceptable \nto all parties. This bill authorizes the Federal Government to purchase \nor to accept a donation of up to 180 acres of the Z-Bar Ranch.\n  I have always supported Senator Kassebaum's efforts to encourage \nprivate participation in the establishment of a national prairie \npreserve. With a private/public partnership, we can officially \nrecognize the tall grass prairie while limiting the involvement of the \nFederal Government.\n  This year, the National Park Trust, who currently owns the ranch, \noffered to donate the core area of land to the Federal Government. This \nwill minimize the cost of establishing the preserve. In my view, a \ncompromise which includes minimal Federal ownership and continued local \ninput sets this proposal apart from other efforts.\n  The tall grass prairie is a vital part of the natural environment and \nheritage of the high plains. We must protect and preserve it. Anyone \nwho has driven through the Flint Hills of Kansas appreciates the beauty \nof this prairie. I am pleased to join Senator Kassebaum today in \ncosponsoring this legislation. Her success in creating a partnership \nbetween public and private efforts will help preserve the history of \nthe Midwest.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 696. A bill to assist States and secondary and postsecondary \nschools to develop, implement, and improve school-to-work opportunities \nsystems so that all students have an opportunity to acquire the \nknowledge and skills needed to meet challenging State academic \nstandards and industry-based skill standards and to prepare for \npostsecondary education, further learning, and a wide range of \nopportunities in high-skill, high-wage careers, and for \n[[Page S5431]] other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n              THE CAREER PREPARATION EDUCATION REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege, on behalf of the \nClinton administration, to introduce the Career Preparation Education \nReform Act. This measure will reform vocational education and \ncontribute to the development of school-to-work opportunities. This \nlegislation represents major change. It consolidates more than 20 \ncurrent Perkins Act programs and gives states an increased role and \nincreased flexibility.\n  The legislation ensures that funds for in-school youth are \nadministered at the local level by local schools, and that federal \nfunds are allocated by a more effective needs-based formula.\n  This legislation adopts a new approach. It stresses high performance \nfor all students. It places greater emphasis on outcomes and the \nreporting of results. It links outcomes with corrective actions, \nincluding sanctions and rewards. It requires each State's plan to \ndescribe how the state will serve at-risk students. And it uses a local \nallocation formula which targets funds to the neediest communities.\n  The report of the National Assessment of Vocational Education found \nthat at-risk and special education students are too often concentrated \nin programs that do not adequately prepare them for careers or higher \neducation. By raising performance for all students and ensuring that \nplanning, reporting and evaluation reflect this priority, these \nstudents will be better served.\n  At-risk students should have a greater opportunity to receive the \nquality services and assistance they need to be successful. We intend \nto pay close attention to this issue as this legislation moves through \nCongress.\n  This bill encourages States to use their vocational education, \nelementary and secondary education, and second-chance programs to \ndevelop comprehensive, integrated, and effective school-to-work \nsystems.\n  It proposes two funding streams--a State grant and a national program \nauthority. It increase the amount of the state grant distributed to \nschools and colleges under the formula.\n  It calls on vocational education to support development of the in-\nschool part of school-to-work systems.\n  It takes a new approach to meeting the needs of special populations \nby emphasizing quality for all students.\n  It no longer requires separate State Boards for Vocational Education \nor separate State Advisory Councils.\n  It gives States the waivers necessary to develop comprehensive \neducation systems.\n  It proposes a performance partnership with the states in cooperation \nwith the Secretary of Labor, in order to develop a system to measure \nperformance, that ensures accountability and provides information on \nprogram success.\n  This legislation closely parallels other education reform initiatives \non education reform and career preparation. I look forward to working \nclosely with other Senators to achieve the bipartisan support we need \nin order to do a better job of preparing students for the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Career Preparation Education Reform \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n                        Organization of the Act\n\n       Sec. 2.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe training of health professions students with respect to the \nidentification and referral of victims of domestic violence, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduce the Domestic Violence \nIdentification and Referral Act with my colleagues Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Murray, Senator Moseley-Braun, and Senator Bradley. \nRepresentative Wyden and Representative Morella are introducing \nidentical legislation in the House.\n  Spouse abuse, child abuse, and elder abuse injures millions of \nAmericans each year, and is growing at an alarming rate. An estimated 2 \nto 4 million women are beaten by their spouses or former spouses each \nyear. In 1992, 2.9 million children were reported abused or neglected, \nabout triple the number reported in 1980. Studies also show that spouse \nabuse and child abuse often go hand-in-hand.\n  Doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals are on the front \nlines of this abuse, but they cannot stop what they have not been \ntrained to see or talk about. The Domestic Violence Identification and \nReferral Act addresses this need by encouraging medical schools to \nincorporate training on domestic violence into their curriculums.\n  There is a need for this legislation. While many medical specialties, \nhospitals and other organizations have made education about domestic \nviolence a priority, this instruction typically occurs on the job or as \npart of a continuing medical education program. A 1994 survey by the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges [AAMC] found that 60 percent \nof medical school graduates rated the time devoted to instruction in \ndomestic violence as inadequate.\n  The bill I am introducing today would give preference in Federal \nfunding to those medical and other health professional schools which \nprovide significant training in domestic violence. It defines \nsignificant training to include identifying victims of domestic \nviolence and maintaining complete medical records, providing medical \nadvice regarding the dynamics and nature of domestic violence, and \nreferring victims to appropriate public and nonprofit entities for \nassistance.\n  The bill also defines domestic violence in the broadest terms, to \ninclude battering, child abuse, and elder abuse.\n  I hope my colleagues agree that this legislation is a critical next \nstep in the fight to bring the brutality of domestic violence out in \nthe open. It mobilizes our Nation's health care providers to recognize \nand treat its victims--and will ultimately save lives by helping to \nbreak the cycle of violence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 S. 697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building at 33 College Avenue \nin Waterville, Maine as the ``George J. Mitchell Federal Building'', \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n          THE GEORGE J. MITCHELL FEDERAL BUILDING ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, at the request of the City of \nWaterville, Maine, I am introducing S. 698, legislation to name a \nfederal building in Waterville the ``George J. Mitchell Federal \nBuilding.''\n  As most of you know, George Mitchell and I shared more than the \nposition of Senator from Maine. We both grew up in similar \ncircumstances with very similar backgrounds. George Mitchell is half \nIrish and half Lebanese. I am half Irish and half Jewish. Both of us \ngraduated from Bowdoin College and both became lawyers before entering \npublic service. We worked together over the years on many issues of \nconcern to Maine people and wrote a book together on the Iran-Contra \nAffair.\n  From a quiet young lawyer in Waterville, Maine, came a great leader \nwho has done his country and his State proud. George Mitchell was born \nin Waterville in 1933. Waterville is located 18 miles north of the \nState capitol on the west bank of the Kennebec River. It was settled in \n1764 and became Maine's 137th town in 1802. Waterville is home to Colby \nCollege, Hathaway Shirt Company, and the Redington Museum which \nexhibits a number of 18th and 19th century artifacts from the region \nincluding the revolver used by Lieutenant Charles Shorey, of \nWaterville, at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n  George attended St. Joseph's grammar school and graduated from \nWaterville High School in 1950. He graduated from Bowdoin in 1954; \nserved in the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps in Berlin, Germany, \nfrom 1954-56; and then went on to Georgetown University to get his law \ndegree.\n  George Mitchell's litany of accomplishments are many: lawyer, trial \nattorney in the Antitrust Division in the U.S. Department of Justice in \nWashington, D.C.; executive assistant to U.S. Senator Ed Muskie; U.S. \nAttorney for Maine; and U.S. District Judge for Maine.\n  In 1980, he was appointed by Governor Brennan to fill the unexpired \nterm of Senator Muskie who was appointed by President Carter to be \nSecretary of State. There is a Chinese proverb that says ``when \ndrinking the water, it is important to remember those who dug the \nwell.'' To really understand George's success, one need look no further \nthan to the fact that Ed Muskie was his mentor. Ed, like George, began \nhis political career in Waterville as a young lawyer and state \nlegislator. Ed provided George with the basic principles of public \nservice which have guided him over the years. It was no surprise that \nGeorge Mitchell demonstrated many of the qualities which typify Senator \nMuskie and Maine: intelligence, integrity, and independence. Senator \nMitchell was elected Senate Majority Leader in 1988 and served his \ncolleagues and the institution with distinction.\n  George Mitchell was a gifted public servant. His voice reminds us \nthat public service is a noble calling. It was both a pleasure and an \nhonor to have served with him. I hope my colleagues will work with me \nin passing this legislation as a means of paying tribute to the many \nyears of outstanding service Senator Mitchell has given to the State of \nMaine and the country.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to offer my \nstrong support for legislation to honor our colleague and my \npredecessor, former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell. This \nlegislation, which I am proud to cosponsor with my colleague, the \nsenior senator from Maine, would designate the Federal building at 33 \nCollege Avenue in Waterville, Maine, as the ``George J. Mitchell \nFederal Building.''\n  There is perhaps no more fitting tribute to George Mitchell than \nnaming the federal building in his home town--Waterville, Maine--in his \nhonor. George Mitchell is a man who dedicated himself to government. \nFollowing his graduation from Georgetown Law School in Washington, \nGeorge Mitchell devoted himself to public service: at the U.S. Justice \nDepartment; as the leader of his party in the State of Maine; as one of \nMaine's gubernatorial candidates; as a federal, U.S. District judge; \nand, for the past fourteen years, as Maine's junior senator. George \nMitchell devoted himself to government because he believed in \ngovernment, and it is appropriate today that we name the seat of our \nfederal government in his hometown in his honor.\n  George Mitchell's story is well known in Waterville, Maine. His \nmother was a first-generation Lebanese immigrant; his father, an \norphan, was a janitor at Colby College. They instilled strong values in \ntheir son. George Mitchell dedicated himself to learning, to knowledge \nand justice, and throughout his youth he surpassed the arbitrary \nceilings our society so often builds. He graduated from Bowdoin \nCollege, served in the Army, and then went on to law school. He \ntypified the Maine work ethic, and that ethic served him well as an \nattorney, a judge, and as a United States Senator.\n  George Mitchell came to the U.S. Senate when another distinguished \nMainer, Senator Edmund Muskie, resigned his seat to become Secretary of \nState. Immediately, Senator Mitchell put a lifetime of experience to \nwork. He became one of the earliest advocates--and chief sponsors--of \nthe landmark Clean Air legislation that passed a decade later, in 1990. \nHe recognized the importance of standing up for [[Page S5442]] Maine--\nand also made his mark on our nation's political system. Because of his \ndedication to his party's ideals, he was chosen as this body's Majority \nLeader in 1988, and served in that important and prestigious position \nuntil his retirement from the Senate.\n  Always, during his tenure, George Mitchell remembered the people who \nsent him to Washington. As Maine's Second District Representative, I \nwas honored to serve alongside George Mitchell throughout his tenure in \nthe United States Senate. We worked together on a bipartisan basis to \nensure that the men and women of Maine were treated fairly, and had \nopportunities extended to other Americans.\n  With this legislation, we make an appropriate acknowledgement of \nGeorge Mitchell's years of leadership in the public arena. This is but \na small token of our appreciation: a fitting gesture which the City of \nWaterville has requested.\n  So in closing, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation and to extend to George Mitchell the hometown honor he \nso deeply deserves.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 699. A bill to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, to \nextend the authorization of appropriations for the Office of Government \nEthics for 7 years, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n      the office of government ethics reauthorization act of 1995\n\n Mr. COHEN.\n Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 699, legislation on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Levin to reauthorize the Office of Government Ethics \n(OGE).\n\n  To quote American statesman John C. Calhoun: ``The very essence of a \nfree government consists in considering offices as public trusts, \nbestowed for the good of the country, and not for the benefit of an \nindividual or party.''\n  This sums up the way we expect our government officials to conduct \nthemselves. Government service is a privilege that carries with it \ntremendous responsibilities. Public servants in all three branches of \ngovernment have an important obligation to the citizens who have put \ntheir faith and trust in them. Government officials should abide by a \ncertain code of conduct and adhere to high ethical standards so that \nour citizens may have confidence in the integrity of their government.\n  Unfortunately, however, many Americans are disenchanted with their \npublic officials. As a result, the need for strict ethical standards, \nand vigilant oversight of compliance with our ethics laws, is as great \nas ever. Almost daily headlines purport allegations of ``unethical'' or \n``inappropriate'' conduct by government officials in one form or \nanother. These stories only further erode the public's confidence in \nthe integrity of their government officials which is already at one of \nthe lowest points in our recent history.\n  Senator Levin and I have long been proponents of strong ethics laws. \nWe serve as the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member on the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management which has \njurisdiction over ethics matters within the Executive Branch. Senator \nLevin and I have made many changes to strengthen the ethics laws since \nthe Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which created OGE, was passed. We \nauthored the Independent Counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government \nAct which provides for the appointment of an independent counsel to \ninvestigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing by top level Executive \nBranch officials, and we worked together to strengthen the revolving \ndoor laws. Moreover, Senator Levin and I have consistently sought to \naid OGE in its mission of providing overall direction to the Executive \nBranch in developing policies to prevent conflicts of interest and \nensure ethical conduct by Executive Branch officers and employees.\n  The reauthorization bill Senator Levin and I are introducing today is \nnearly identical to the legislation we introduced last Congress which \nwas passed by the Senate in October. Unfortunately, however, no action \nwas taken by the House of Representatives prior to Congress' \nadjournment.\n  OGE's authorization expired on September 30 of last year. It is very \nimportant, therefore, that the Congress move as quickly as possible to \nreauthorize the agency. The bill will reauthorize OGE for seven years. \nThis is a slightly longer reauthorization than we have sought in \nprevious years. As in the past, we want to avoid the need to \nreauthorize OGE during the firs year of a Presidential term when a \nlarge portion of OGE's resources are devoted to the nominee clearance \nprocess.\n  The bill would also, for the first time, grant OGE gift acceptance \nauthority to address the problem that arises when federal government \nfacilities are not adequate either in terms of size or equipment \nresources to accommodate OGE's ethics education and training programs \nwhich are held around the country. This authority is intended to enable \nOGE to accept the use of certain non-federal facilities, such as an \nauditorium that might be offered by a State or local government or a \nuniversity, which may be better suited for OGE's needs.\n  As I have often noted in the past, the Office of Government Ethics is \na small office with large responsibilities. Over the years, we have \nimposed more responsibilities on OGE and we haven't always provided the \nnecessary staff or resources to carry out those responsibilities. \nSpecifically, I would note the additional functions OGE had to perform \nwhen it became an independent agency in 1989 and in complying with the \nEthics Reform Act of 1989. Congress moved to make OGE a separate agency \nbecause it was believed that OGE was not independent enough. In \naddition, Congress wanted to enhance the agency's prestige and \nauthority within the Executive Branch given its important and sensitive \nresponsibilities.\n  While OGE's budget has increased rather significantly since we last \nreauthorized the agency in 1988, OGE still has a lean budget with which \nto operate when you consider the critically important responsibilities \nof the agency. That said, in light of looming budget deficits, OGE, \nlike all agencies will be called upon to meet its responsibilities in \nthe most cost-effective manner possible. The bill also contains a \nnumber of technical changes to the ethics laws.\n  OGE's mission is critically important in ensuring strict ethical \nstandards in government. I hope my colleagues will move expeditiously \nto pass this legislation and reauthorize this important agency.\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Cohen and I, in our \ncapacities as the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, are introducing a \nbill to Reauthorize the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). \nReauthorization of the OGE is essential so that the agency can continue \nto perform its mission to provide overall direction of executive branch \npolicies related to preventing conflicts of interest on the part of \nofficers and employees of any executive agency. The OGE's previous \nauthorization expired on September 30, 1994.\n  Senator Cohen and I first introduced this bill bank in August of \n1993. The Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on the reauthorization \nin April of 1994, with the Director of the OGE, Stepehn Potts, as a \nwitness. The reauthorization bill was reported out of the Oversight \nSubcommittee and the Governmental Affairs Committee with strong \nbipartisan support and was approved by the Senate. The bill \nsubsequently died when the House of Representatives failed to act upon \nthe reauthorization in the last Congress. Therefore, Senator Cohen and \nI seek to reauthorize the OGE, so that the agency can carry on its very \nimportant responsibilities.\n  OGE was created in 1978 as part of the Office of Personnel \nManagement. Over the years, Congress has given more authority and \nautonomy to the OGE, making it a separate agency as of October 1, 1989. \nThis was an important step in recognizing the significance of OGE's \nrole and its need for independence. In addition, through Executive \nOrder, President Bush and President Clinton have given the OGE new \nresponsibilities for guiding and implementing an effective ethics \nprogram throughout the Executive Branch. The responsibilities of the \nOGE range from teaching to enforcement; from issuing regulations to \nproviding guidance and [[Page S5443]] interpretation; from reviewing \nfinancial disclosure forms to auditing agency ethics programs.\n  In the process of developing this bill, the Oversight Subcommittee \nreviewed OGE's budget, its personnel, and its accomplishments. Based on \nthat effort, I am satisfied that the OGE has improved in areas where \nweaknesses were identified in the past and that the agency is currently \non track in performing its duties in an effective, professional matter.\n  In addition to reauthorizing OGE, this bill would give OGE authority \nto accept donations or gifts that would facilitate the agency's work. A \nfederal agency can't accept gifts unless it has specific statutory \nauthority to do so. Many agencies have such authority but, up until \nnow, the OGE has not been one of those agencies. The reason OGE seeks \nthis authority is in connection with it's training mission. OGE \nconducts multiagency ethics training sessions around the country, and \nsometimes there is no nearby Federal facility that is appropriate in \nterms of size and services. This gift acceptance authority would allow \nthe OGE to accept the use of non-Federal facilities--for example, an \nauditorium and related services such as might be offered by a State or \nlocal government or a university.\n  I hope that the Senate will act quickly in reauthorizing this \nimportant agency.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n        Graham):\n  S. 700. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to revise \nthe tax rules on expiration, to modify the basis rules for nonresident \naliens becoming citizens or residents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                            Tax Legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to address a problem that has come to light recently \nconcerning the ability of U.S. citizens to avoid taxes by abandoning \ntheir citizenship. We should not countenance the evasion of taxes by \nthose who renounce their citizenship. The Senate should act to address \nthis problem expeditiously, and the bill that I introduce today will, I \nhope, represent significant progress towards that end. It is a revision \nof provision passed by the Senate Finance Committee recently, and \nresponds to some of the criticisms that have been raised concerning the \noriginal proposal.\n  A genuine abuse exists in this area. Although the current tax code \ncontains provisions, dating back to 1966, designed to address tax-\nmotivated relinquishment of citizenship, these provisions have proven \ndifficult to enforce and are easily evaded. One international tax \nexpert described avoiding them as child's play. Individuals with \nsubstantial wealth can, by renouncing U.S. citizenship, avoid paying \ntaxes on gains that accrued during the period that they acquired their \nwealth and were afforded the myriad advantages of U.S. citizenship. \nMoreover, even after renunciation, these individuals can maintain \nsubstantial connections with the United States, such as keeping a \nresidence and residing in the United States for up to 120 days a year \nwithout incurring U.S. tax obligations. Indeed, reports indicate that \ncertain wealthy individuals have renounced their U.S. citizenship and \navoided their tax obligations while still maintaining their families \nand homes in the United States, being careful merely to avoid being \npresent in this country for more than 120 days each year.\n  Meanwhile, the rest of Americans who remain citizens pay taxes on \ntheir gains when assets are sold or when an estate tax becomes due at \ndeath.\n  It was this Senator who made the first proposal in the Senate to deal \nwith the expatriation tax abuse. On February 6, the President announced \na proposal to address the problem in his fiscal year 1996 budget \nsubmission. Three weeks ago, on March 15, during Finance Committee \nconsideration of the bill to restore the health insurance deduction for \nthe self-employed, I offered a modified version of the administration's \nexpatriation tax provisions as an amendment to the bill. My amendment \nwould have substituted the expatriation proposal for the repeal of \nminority broadcast tax preferences as a funding source for the bill. \nThe amendment failed when every Republican member of the Committee \nvoted against it. Subsequently, Senator Bradley offered the \nexpatriation provision as a free-standing amendment, with the\n $3.6 billion in revenue that it raised to be dedicated to deficit \nreduction. Senator Bradley's amendment passed by voice vote. That is \nhow the expatriation tax provision was added to the bill that came \nbefore the Senate.\n\n  After the Finance Committee reported the bill, but before full Senate \naction and conference with the House, the Finance Committee held a \nhearing to further review the issues raised by the expatiation \nprovision. Tax legislation routinely gets polished in its technical \naspects as it moves through floor action and conference. At the Finance \nhearing, we heard criticisms of some technical aspects in the operation \nof the provision, as well as testimony raising the issue of whether the \nprovision comported with article 12 of the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, which the United States ratified in 1992. \nSection 2 of article 12 states: ``Everyone shall be free to leave any \ncountry, including his own.'' Robert F. Turner, a professor of \ninternational law at the U.S. Naval War College, argued that the \nexpatriation provision was problematic under the Covenant. The State \nDepartment's legal experts disagreed, as did two other outside experts \nwhose letters were before the Committee. I refer to Professor Paul B. \nStephan III, a specialist in both international law and tax law at the \nUniversity of Virginia School of Law; and Mr. Stephen E. Shay, who \nserved as International Tax Counsel at Treasury under the Reagan \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the day when I addressed this matter I \nasked that the materials to which I am presently referring be inserted \nin the record following my remarks. These materials, and others \nmentioned in this statement, can be found there.\n  Although there was considerable support for the legality of the \nprovision, I thought it best to proceed with caution in these \ncircumstances. These are matters of human rights under international \nlaw, on which we have rightly lectured others, and involve out solemn \nobligations under treaties. I sought the views of other experts. \nLetters concluding that the expatriation provision did not raise any \nproblems under international law were received from Prof. Detlev Vagts \nof Harvard Law School and Prof. Andreas F. Lowenfeld of New York \nUniversity School of Law. The State Department issued a lengthier \nanalysis upholding the legality of the provision, and the American Law \nDivision of the Congressional Research Service reached a like \nconclusion. However, there were dissenting views, most notably Prof. \nHurst Hannum of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts \nUniversity, who first wrote to me on March 24.\n  This is where things stood when the House-Senate conference met on \nMarch 28. The weight of authority appeared to be on the side of \nlegality under international law, but there was some question, and the \nbill had to move at great speed. As my colleagues well know, the \nlegislation restoring the self-employeds' health insurance deduction \nfor calendar year 1994 needed to be passed and signed into law well in \nadvance of this year's April 17 tax filing deadline, so that the self-\nemployed would have time to prepare and file their 1994 tax returns. \nThe decision regarding the expatriation provision had to be made \nwithout further opportunity of deliberation. I opted not to risk making \nthe wrong decision with respect to international law and human rights.\n  The decision to drop the expatriation tax provision from the final \nconference version of the bill has been the subject of much debate over \nthe last week. I certainly don't presume to speak for the other \nconferees. But for myself I repeat as I have said on two occasions on \nthis floor over the past week: we should proceed with care when we are \ndealing with human rights issues, particularly when the group involved \nis a despised group--that is, millionaires who renounce their \ncitizenship for money.\n  As the Senator who first proposed the expatriation tax provision, I \nwill see this matter through to a conclusion. We are getting more \nclarity on the human rights issue, and it appears that a consensus is \ndeveloping to the [[Page S5444]] effect that the provision does not \nconflict with our obligations under international law. In particular. \nit is worth noting that Professor Hannum, who first wrote me on March \n24 expressing his concern that that expatriation provision was a \nproblem under international law, has, after receiving additional and \nmore\n specific information about the expatriation tax, now written a second \nletter of March 31 stating that he is convinced that neither its \nintention nor its effect would violate present U.S. obligations under \ninternational law. This is the growing consensus, although it is not \nunanimous.\n\n  As for criticisms of the technical difficulties of the original \nproposal, I believe they can be satisfied. Indeed, I would venture that \nif some of those criticizing the provision's technical aspects had put \neven half as much effort into devising solutions as in highlighting \nshortcomings, we would already be much further along toward a \nsatisfactory statute.\n  One final point of utmost importance. As we take the time to write \nthis law carefully, billionaires are not slipping through some loophole \nand escaping tax by renouncing their citizenship. The President \nannounced the original proposal on February 6, and made it effective \nfor taxpayers who initiate a renunciation of citizenship on or after \nthat date. This was an entirely appropriate way to put an end to an \nabusive practice under current law. Both the proposal that I initiated, \nand the one that was ultimately adopted by the Finance Committee, also \nused February 6, 1995, as the effective date of the new provision \npreventing tax evasion through expatriation. The House conferees had \nproposed slipping the effective date to March 15, 1995--the date of \nSenate Finance Committee action on the provision. The two chairmen of \nthe tax-writing committees ultimately--and wisely--resisted that \noverture, and have issued a joint statement giving notice that February \n6 may be the effective date of any legislation affecting the tax \ntreatment of those who relinquish citizenship. Given the potential for \nabuse under current law, I believe that February 6 must be the \neffective date for a new rule. In any event, given the President's \nannouncement in the budget, the Finance Committee action, and the joint \nstatement of the two chairmen of the tax-writing committees, \nindividuals who are contemplating renunciation of their U.S. \ncitizenship are on fair notice of the February 6, 1995, effective date.\n  To repeat, as the Senator who first offered the proposal to end the \nexpatriation tax abuse, I will do everything I can to see that this \nmatter gets resolved. We will do it this session. Fundamental justice \nto all taxpaying Americans requires no less.\n  In an effort to advance that goal, I am today introducing legislation \nembodying a revised expatriation tax proposal. I do so in the interest \nof ensuring that the issues that have been raised are addressed \nsatisfactorily, and in a timely manner. This bill represents a serious \neffort to address the criticisms that have been raised, and I believe \nit represents a major step forward. It will provide an opportunity for \ncomment and further review. In addition, I anticipate that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation will include an analysis of this bill in its \ncomprehensive study of the subject of expatriation that the Committee \nstaff has been directed to present to the chairmen of the tax-writing \ncommittees.\n  Mr. President, we will end this abuse, and promptly, but in a careful \nand orderly way, as we should do in matters of this importance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A long-term resident would be an individual who \n     has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States \n     (i.e., a green card holder) in at least 8 of the prior 15 \n     taxable years. For purposes of satisfying the 8-year \n     threshold, taxable years for which such individual was a \n     resident of another country under a treaty tie-breaker rule \n     would be disregarded. The tax on expatriation would apply to \n     a long-term resident when (a) the individual is no longer \n     treated as a lawful permanent resident of the United States \n     as that term is defined in section 7701(b)(6), or (b) the \n     individual is treated as a resident of another country under \n     the tie-breaking provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty (and \n     the individual does not elect to waive treaty benefits). \n     Long-term residents would be considered domiciled in the \n     United States for purposes of calculating the tax on \n     expatriation.\n\n\n                 2. fair market value basis adjustment.\n\n       An individual who has been a nonresident alien would be \n     considered to have a fair market value basis in property \n     owned by the individual as of the earlier of: (1) the date \n     the individual first became a U.S. citizen or resident, or \n     (2) the date the property first became subject to U.S. tax \n     because it was used in a U.S. trade or business or it was a \n     U.S. real property interest. The fair market value basis \n     would apply for all purposes of computing gain or loss on \n     actual or deemed dispositions (not just the tax on \n     expatriation), but would not apply for purposes of computing \n     depreciation.\n       Under this provision, the taxpayer would have the burden of \n     proving fair market value. However, in determining whether \n     the individual has satisfied his burden of proof, the \n     Secretary will take into account the difficulty of \n     establishing fair market value (especially for years prior to \n     the enactment of this rule). If adequate evidence regarding \n     the fair market value of a piece of property is not \n     available, a taxpayer may elect to use historical cost to \n     determine any gain on the disposition of the property; the \n     historical cost election would not be available to claim a \n     loss on the disposition of the property. No fair market value \n     basis would be given to the assets of a foreign trust that \n     becomes a domestic trust. This provision would be effective \n     to calculate the tax under section 877A for expatriations \n     occurring on or after February 6, 1995, or for any other \n     dispositions after the enactment date.\n\n\n              3. election to be treated as a u.s. citizen\n\n       Each taxpayer would be allowed to irrevocably elect, on an \n     asset-by-asset basis, to continue to be taxed as a U.S. \n     citizen with respect to assets designated by the taxpayer. \n     The taxpayer would therefore continue to pay U.S. income \n     taxes following expatriation on any income generated by a \n     designated asset and on any gain from the disposition of the \n     asset, as well as any excise tax imposed with respect to the \n     asset (see e.g., section 1491). In addition, the asset would \n     continue to be subject to gift, estate, and generation-\n     skipping transfer taxes.\n       However, the amount of any transfer tax so imposed would be \n     limited to the amount of income tax that would be due if the \n     property were sold for its fair market value immediately \n     before the transfer or death, taking into account any \n     remaining portion of the expatriate's $600,000 exclusion. To \n     make this election, the taxpayer would be required to waive \n     treaty benefits with respect to designated assets. An \n     expatriating individual would be required to provide security \n     to ensure payment of the tax under this election in such \n     form, manner, and amount as the Secretary may require.\n\n\n                4. Administration of Tax on Expatriation\n\n       The current ``sailing permit'' requirement of section \n     6851(d) would be replaced with a new requirement to file a \n     tax return and pay a tentative tax for the portion of the tax \n     year through the date of expatriation. Section 6851(d) and \n     the regulations thereunder currently require any alien who \n     physically leaves the country--regardless of the duration of \n     the trip--to obtain a certificate from the IRS District \n     Director that he has complied with all U.S. income tax \n     obligations. This provision would be modified to require any \n     citizen or resident alien of the United States who becomes a \n     nonresident to file a tax return within 90 days of the date \n     that he ceases to be a U.S. citizen or resident, and pay the \n     relevant tentative tax. No tax return would be required of a \n     departing alien who intends to maintain U.S. residence.\n\n\n                        5. Technical Corrections\n\n     A. Allow deferral of tax on expatriation where estate taxes \n         would be deferred\n       Payment of the tax on expatriation should be extended in \n     circumstances that are similar to situations in which payment \n     of estate taxes may be extended under current law. Therefore, \n     the time for the payment of the tax on expatriation could be \n     extended for any period at the request of the taxpayer, as \n     provided by section 6161 (without regard to the ten-year \n     limitation of that section). In addition, the tax on \n     expatriation could be deferred on interests in closely-held \n     businesses as provided in section 6166. The tax on \n     expatriation could also be extended for reversionary or \n     remainder interests in property as provided in section 6163. \n     Payment of tax liabilities could also be extended under \n     section 6159 to facilitate the collection of tax liabilities.\n     B. Method of providing security\n       If a taxpayer is required to provide security under this \n     section, it is anticipated that in many cases adequate \n     security could be provided by contributing assets to a trust \n     with a responsible U.S. trustee (see section 2056A). Other \n     mechanisms determined to be effective by the Secretary could \n     be used, such as providing a bond or letter of credit. If an \n     expatriating individual is a beneficiary of a trust, and the \n     beneficiary elects to defer payment of the tax on \n     expatriation with respect to the trust interest, a U.S. \n     trustee of that trust will be required to provide security if \n     the beneficiary provides actual notice of such requirement to \n     the domestic trustee.\n     [[Page S5447]]\n     \n     C. Exceptions for relinquishment of citizenship by certain \n         minors\n       The tax on expatriation would not apply to an individual \n     who resided in the United States under the substantial \n     presence test of section 7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) for less than five \n     years and relinquishes U.S. citizenship by the age of 18 \n     years and 6 months.\n     D. Ownership of interests in trusts\n       The ownership of any interest in a trust which is not \n     determined under the general facts and circumstances rule of \n     section 877A(f)(1)(A) will be allocated to the grantor if the \n     grantor is a beneficiary of the trust. Otherwise, the \n     ownership of the trust interest will be based on the rules of \n     intestate succession. Unless otherwise prescribed by the \n     Secretary, the applicable rules of intestate succession will \n     be the rules under the Uniform Probate Code as promulgated by \n     the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel.\n     E. Coordination with estate and gift tax rules\n       The tax on expatriation would be allowed as a credit \n     against U.S. estate or gift taxes to the extent that the \n     property subject to the tax on expatriation is subsequently \n     subject to additional U.S. estate or gift taxes solely by \n     reason of the estate or gift tax expatriation rules (sections \n     2107 and 2501(a)(3)).\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to introduce, along \nwith Senator Moynihan, a bill that a would close a tax loophole that \nallows wealthy citizens who renounce their American citizenships to \navoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes. As a member of the Finance \nCommittee, I offered a similar amendment to H.R. 831 that would have \nclosed this loophole. My amendment would have dedicated all of the \nsavings from closing this loophole to deficit reduction. According to \nestimates of the Joint Committee on Taxation, my amendment would have \nreduced the deficit by approximately $3.6 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Unfortunately, although the Finance Committee adopted this amendment \non an undivided voice vote and the Senate approved it as part of H.R. \n831, the joint House-Senate conference committee re-opened this \nloophole. The bill that we are introducing today would close this \nloophole once and for all.\n  Mr. President, this bill is fundamentally about fairness. Not only is \nit fair to those who enjoyed the benefits of U.S. citizenship to make \nbillions and are now attempting to avoid paying tax on such gain, it is \nalso fair to those Americans who stay behind to shoulder the burdens of \ncitizenship. All this bill would do is treat those who renounce their \ncitizenship on par with Americans who stay and pay their share of the \ntax burden.\n  While U.S. citizenship confers tremendous benefit, it also requires \nresponsibility. Although we may not always be happy about the amount, \nmost of us willingly pay our fair share of the tax burden. However, for \nmany Americans it becomes just too much when they have to pay not only \ntheir share of taxes, but also an additional share for those few, \nwealthy individuals who made their money in this country, but are now \ntrying to skip town without paying their portion of the tab.\n  Significantly, this bill would exclude pension income, real estate \nassets, and the first $600,000 in gain. As a result, of the roughly 850 \nU.S. citizens who renounced their citizenships in 1994, only a handful \nwould be effected by the elimination of this loophole. In fact, \nrepresentatives from the Treasury Department testified that provisions \nsimilar to those contained in this bill would affect only 24 Americans \neach year.\n  Mr. President, significant deficit reduction will be necessary to put \nour country back on the right track. However, until we close these \nspecial-interest tax loopholes for the few, we cannot ask for the \nshared sacrifice from the many that will be necessary to reduce the \ndeficit.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 701. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to limit \nthe interest deduction allowed corporations and to allow a deduction \nfor dividends paid by corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    the equity incentive act of 1995\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code to limit the interest deduction allowed \ncorporations and to allow a deduction for dividends paid by \ncorporations.\n  Our current system of taxation encourages American businesses to use \ndebt, rather than equity, to provide needed financing. My bill would \nencourage firms to shift from greater debt financing to more equity \nfinancing by limiting the interest deduction allowed corporations and \nallowing a deduction for dividends paid by corporations.\n  My proposal would be revenue neutral, although in the long run it \nshould add to revenue because it would help the economy.\n  I propose that, while 80 percent of interest payments remain \ndeductible, 20 percent of the interest payments of all but the smallest \ncorporations (including farm corporations) should be disallowed. And 50 \npercent of dividends should be deductible.\n  If a corporation borrows money to acquire another company or to buy \nequipment or for any other purpose, the interest on that debt is \ndeductible, even though the debt can--and often does--put the \ncorporation in a precarious position. But if the same corporation \nissues stock, and then pays dividends, there is no deduction. The tax \nlaws favor debt.\n  That same corporation, if it cannot meet the payments of principal \nand interest, will have to sell itself or go bankrupt, neither of which \nare desirable goals. But if that corporation issues stock, and there is \na downsizing in the economy, the only penalty the corporation must pay \nis that it cannot issue dividends. It can continue to thrive, employ \npeople, and be a productive part of our society.\n  Our tax laws have encouraged corporations and banks and law firms to \nmake ``the fast buck'', rather than take the slow, constructive steps \nthat are necessary to build their businesses and the economy of this \nNation. I favor tax laws that give corporations deductions for \nresearch, for creating jobs, for adding to the productivity of the \nNation.\n  My proposal would provide the incentive corporations need. It would \nencourage investment and help the growth of productivity. It would also \nhelp eliminate the excessive debt our country has accumulated, and it \nwould go a long way toward strengthening the economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, Mr. President. It \nmay need to be refined, but the idea is sound. I hope we can make it a \npart of the Tax Code.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 704. A bill to establish the Gambling Impact Study Commission; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               THE NATIONAL GAMBLING STUDY COMMISSION ACT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would establish an 18 month commission to review the impact \ngambling has had on State and local governments, and native American \ntribes. As these entities find themselves strapped for financial \nresources, many public officials and residents believe gambling can be \nan economic panacea.\n  Gambling is now one of the largest growth industries in the country. \nLegal wagering now totals almost $400 billion compared to $17.3 billion \nin 1974, according to the last--and only--national gambling study \nreleased in 1976 by the Commission on the Review of the National Policy \nToward Gambling.\n  Federal policy on gaming should not be a moral one, rather it should \nbe a practical one. Gambling is a matter of personal choice, and I have \nno problem with individuals who enjoy and are able to play the lottery \nor the slots. But I am concerned with the substantial costs to \nindividuals, families, and society. Legalized gambling can lead to \nproblem and pathological gambling, deterioration of family \nrelationships, lost work productivity, unpaid taxes, bankruptcies, \nhigher crime rates, and increased costs to the criminal justice system.\n  On the other hand, legalized gambling offers the promise of economic \ndevelopment, tourism, increased jobs and tax revenues, which is \nextremely appealing to State, local and tribal governments that compete \nwith one another for financial resources.\n  While State governments have primary responsibility for regulating \ngambling, the scope of gaming has broadened to a national level in \nrecent years. I am introducing the Gambling [[Page S5448]] Impact Study \nCommission Act to address these issues of national concern, so State, \nlocal and tribal governments can make fully informed decisions about \nfuture economic development investments.\n                                 ______\n\n\n             By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself and Mr. Brown):\n\n  S. 707. A bill to shift financial responsibility for providing \nwelfare assistance and medical care to welfare-related medicaid \nindividuals to the States in exchange for the Federal Government \nassuming financial responsibility for providing certain elderly low-\nincome individuals and nonelderly low-income disabled individuals with \nbenefits under the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act and long-term care benefits under a new Federal program \nestablished under title XIX of such act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the welfare and medicaid responsibility exchange act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a revision \nof the ``Welfare and Medicaid Responsibility Exchange Act of 1995'' \nwith my colleague Senator Brown. This legislation incorporates the \nchanges which I indicated would be forthcoming when we introduced the \n``swap'' legislation earlier this year.\n  The basic principle embodied in both this and the earlier proposal is \nthat true reform will occur only when there is a clear delineation of \nresponsibilities between the federal and state governments.\n  The legislation we are introducing today shifts to the states \nresponsibility for the nation's largest welfare programs--Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Food Program for \nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC), Food Stamps, and the AFDC portion of \nMedicaid. In exchange, the Federal Government will assume \nresponsibility for that portion of the Medicaid program designed to \nprovide acute care and long-term care to elderly and disabled \nAmericans.\n  Currently, the overlapping regulation and dual administration of the \nAFDC and Medicaid programs, in particular, has resulted in a \nsignificant lack of accountability. In contrast, this legislation makes \na clear-cut decision about who will run the welfare programs, who will \nfinance them, who will make key decisions, and who will be responsible \nfor the outcomes.\n  This legislation will allow both the States and the Federal \nGovernment to build a more cohesive safety net for the populations each \nsector is serving. At the end of a five-year transition period during \nwhich the States will be freed from the vast majority of restrictive \nFederal regulations, the States will have complete autonomy for \ndesigning welfare and medical programs for low-income individuals--\nwithout Federal mandates, but with their own money at stake.\n  The Federal Government will be able to improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Medicaid \nprogram--a program which now consumes 70 percent of Medicaid costs yet \nserves only 30 percent of the Medicaid population--by better \ncoordinating choronic care services for elderly and disabled Medicaid \nrecipients, by promoting competition, and by allowing these individuals \nto have a broader choice of private health plans. To reduce the \nreliance on Medicaid, the revised legislation also includes tax \nincentives for the purchase of private long-term-care insurance and \nlong-term care services, and standards for long-term care insurance. \nThese provisions are similar to those contained in legislation which \nwas introduced earlier this year by Senator Cohen.\n  I would like to highlight some of the other key components of this \nrevised swap legislation:\n  State responsibilities: As in the earlier swap legislation (S. 140), \nthe states will assume full costs for the AFDC, WIC, and Food Stamp \nprograms. In addition, however, the states also will assume \nresponsibility for providing health care for ``AFDC-related'' Medicaid \nrecipients (non-elderly and non-disabled individuals). This population \nrepresents about 30 percent of current Medicaid expenditures.\n  Federal responsibilities: Instead of assuming the full costs of the \nMedicaid program, under the revised legislation the federal government \nwill assume financial responsibility for the ``SSI-related Medicaid'' \nprogram (elderly and disabled individuals). This group represents the \nremaining 70 percent of Medicaid costs.\n  Five-year transition period: The revised legislation still contains a \nfive-year transition period during which states will have freedom to \ndesign low-income assistance programs and time to build the \ninfrastructure to support these programs. During this period, an \nindependent Commission will work with Congress to develop the specific \nprovisions of the federal Medicaid program for elderly and disabled \nindividuals. Also, the federal government will continue to provide \nfunding to states during this period so that no state will suffer \nsignificant losses of funding.\n  State maintenance-of-effort: During the transition period, the states \nmust spend the funds made available by the swap and any money \npreviously used as a state match for AFDC, food stamps, WIC, and AFDC-\nrelated Medicaid, to provide cash and non-cash assistance to low-income \nindividuals and families. Unlike S. 140, however, the states may direct \nup to 15 percent of these funds annually to savings or other uses.\n  Medicaid during the transition: Under the revised legislation, \nfederal Medicaid benefit and coverage requirements for children will be \nfrozen at 1995 levels during the transition. Beyond that, however, the \nstates will be given significant freedom to redesign the AFDC-related \nMedicaid program without applying for federal waivers.\n  At the end of the transition period: Under the revised legislation, \nCongress must determine at the end of five years whether to continue \nthis arrangement or, instead, to grant the states complete autonomy to \ndesign welfare and low-income medical care programs. If this complete \nswap goes into effect, states that experience a significant loss of \nfederal funds and have the greatest need for public services will be \neligible for a targeted grant program.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about returning substantial \nauthority, autonomy, and responsibility to state and local governments; \nif we are serious about rejecting the ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to \nincome support programs which has frustrated those who have sought \ninnovative solutions; and if we are serious about breaking the cycle of \ndependence that has frayed the current social welfare system; then I \nbelieve we must make systemic changes that will have a profound and \nlong-lasting impact on the way services are delivered to needy \nAmericans. We must cross the threshold from a Washington that simply \nshares power with the states to a Washington that actually surrenders \npower.\n  This legislation goes a long way toward achieving that goal. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in working toward its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 708. A bill to repeal section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the electric utility ratepayer act\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to repeal \nsection 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 \n(``PURPA'').\n  Section 210 of PURPA is no longer in the public interest. It is \ncosting consumers billions of dollars in higher electric bills. It is \ninterfering with the increasingly competitive wholesale market for \nelectricity. It has been overtaken by changes in energy policy, \nparticularly the transmission access and PUHCA reform provisions of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992. It is no longer needed to promote a once-\nfledgling independent power industry. In short, it is time to repeal \nsection 210 of PURPA.\n  Enacted in 1978, PURPA was one of several laws created by President \nCarter to address the energy crisis. All involved heavy government \ninterference in the marketplace; all but PURPA have since been \nrepealed.\n  PURPA was created to stimulate the construction of non-conventional \nelectric powerplants, referred to by PURPA as a qualifying facility \n[QF]. A QF can be a cogeneration powerplant of unlimited size, or a \nsmall power production facility of less than 80 megawatts. A \ncogeneration powerplant is a facility which produces heat along \n[[Page S5449]] with electric power. A small power production facility \nis as a renewable driven electric power generator, such as a windmill, \na biomass or waste-fueled powerplant, a geothermal generator, a solar \npower facility, or a hydroelectric dam.\n  Section 210 of PURPA encourages QFs in two ways. First it requires \nelectric utilities to purchase the power they produce--whether or not \nit is needed. Second, it requires electric utilities to pay an avoided \ncost price for the electricity purchased from the QF--which may or may \nnot bear any relationship to actual market price.\n  When PURPA was enacted, everyone thought that it would benefit \nprimarily unconventional power generating facilities, such as solar, \ngeothermal, wind, and waste. These were unproven technologies at the \ntime, and even with the host of benefits provided by PURPA plus tax \nincentives, it was not clear that they could ever be profitable. \nInstead, PURPA has primarily benefitted the more traditional turbine-\npowered cogenerators. According to data provided by the Edison Electric \nInstitute, more than three-fourths of installed QF generation capacity \nare cogenerators. Small power producers--solar, geothermal, wind and \nwaste--account for less than one-forth of installed QF generation \ncapacity.\n  PURPA was also enacted on the assumption that it would not increase \nthe price of electricity to consumers. Congress thought that it had \nguarded against this by limiting the price of QF electricity to the \navoided cost--the price that the electric utility would have incurred \nhad it generated the electricity itself or had it purchased it from \nsomeone else. But it did not work out that way. The Edison Electric \nInstitute estimates that nationwide PURPA will add $38 billion to the \nfuture price of electricity, calculated in net\n present value. This continues to occur for several reasons.\n\n  First, in many instances PURPA's avoided cost rate is being based on \nfuel price projections which often prove to be wildly wrong. Second, \nseveral States are setting the avoided cost rate above true avoided \ncost in order to encourage QFs. QFs are viewed as being socially \ndesirable, even if not the cheapest source of power. The FERC has \nrecently acknowledged that over the years it has given State public \nutility commissions wide latitude in implementing PURPA in order to \nmaximize the development of QFs. Third, environmental adders continue \nto be included in the avoided cost rate to promote certain types of QF \nfacilities. This further increases the price of QF power above true \navoided cost. Fourth, because PURPA requires QF power to be purchased \nwhether or not it is needed, utility-owned generation will continue to \nbe idled, which someone has to pay for. Thus, unless we repeal PURPA \nsection 210, this will continue for new QF contracts.\n  Mr. President, some will argue that section 210 ought to be retained \nbecause it fosters competition in the wholesale power marketplace, but \nthat is not true. The essence of competition is allowing choice, not \nmandating what must be purchased. Moreover, there are other key reasons \nwhy the wholesale electric power market has become competitive. They \ninclude the following: First, state public utility commissions have \nrequired their utilities to become more competitive. Second, Congress \nopened the wholesale market to all electric generators through \ntransmission access and PUHCA reform. Third, and most importantly, the \nmarket itself denies everyone the luxury of avoiding competition. Thus, \nthe repeal of PURPA section 210 will not adversely affect competition.\n  Mr. President, while everyone agrees that renewable energy can and \nshould play a role in the future energy mix, that should not be \naccomplished through PURPA's mandated purchase requirement. In this \nconnection, I might note that there are other programs on the books to \npromote renewables. For example, section 1212 of the Energy Policy Act \nof 1992 provides a renewable energy production incentive of 1.5 cents \nper kilowatt hour, subject to appropriations, for solar, wind, biomass, \nand geothermal powerplants. Section 1914 provides a tax credit of 1.5 \ncents per kilowatt hour for wind and closed-loop biomass. This is not \nsubject to appropriations. Section 1916 provides a permanent extension \nof the energy investment credit for solar and geothermal properties.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong believer in contract sanctity. The bill \nI am introducing does not abrogate existing contracts; they will \ncontinue to operate by their own terms. Section 4 of the bill \nspecifically states that ``Nothing in this Act abrogates any existing \ncontract.''\n  Mr. President, it is clear the time has come to repeal section 210 of \nPURPA. It is distorting competition and it is hurting consumers. It is \ntime to substitute the discipline of the marketplace for the judgment \nof regulators. In short, it is time for PURPA section 210 to go. I urge \nmay colleagues to join me in my efforts to update our energy policy to \nbenefit consumers and our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``The Electric Utility Ratepayer \n     Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress findings that--\n       (1) implementation of section 210 of the Public Utility \n     Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 results in many consumers \n     paying excessive rates for electricity;\n       (2) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 gives producers of \n     electricity additional access to the wholesale electric \n     market through transmission access and exemption from the \n     Public Utility Holding Company Act; and\n       (3) in light of the increasingly competitive wholesale \n     electric marketplace being brought about by the Energy Policy \n     Act of 1992, there no longer is any justification for section \n     210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL.\n\n       Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \n     of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3) is hereby repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRANSITION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act abrogates any existing contract.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this act are effective April 7, \n     1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 709.

Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Bryan, in \nintroducing the Consumer Reporting Reform Act of 1995. We have spent \nseveral sessions of Congress in perfecting this legislation, and I \nexpect this bill to enjoy wide bipartisan support. In particular, this \nlegislation balances the needs of the consumer to have accurate credit \ninformation, while ensuring that the credit industry provides such \ninformation without the imposition of unreasonable regulatory burdens.\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act is overdue for revision and reform. I \nknow that we have all heard too many horror stories about inaccurate \ncredit information and the inability of consumers to get the \ninformation corrected. The Fair Credit Reporting Act was written long \nbefore computer technology was as sophisticated as it is today. These \ntechnological advances have meant a drastic increase in the amount of \ninformation that can be kept and is kept on individuals. Current law \nsimply does not adequately protect consumers.\n  For example, currently the law only requires that credit bureaus \nreinvestigate within a reasonable period of time. It was not uncommon \nfor it to take months, even years, to get a credit report corrected and \ncleaned up. And even in cases where a consumer does succeed in getting \nthe incorrect information removed or corrected, there is nothing to \nprevent the incorrect information from being put back on the credit \nreport.\n  I believe that the single most important consumer protection \nprovision in this legislation is the 30-day limit on the \nreinvestigation procedure. If the disputed information cannot be \nverified or is found to be inaccurate within 30 days, then it is \ncorrected or removed from the credit report and cannot be reinserted \nwithout a notice to the consumer. [[Page S5450]] \n  This is the cornerstone of the legislation--the most significant \nimprovement over current law.\n  In addition, I realize that the credit bureaus have voluntarily \ninstituted a 30-day standard in recent years, but there is no force of \nlaw behind it to hold them to it. I congratulate the credit bureaus for \ntaking steps to make the system more accurate, but I feel that \nlegislation is still needed. It was the threat of this legislation that \nhas cleaned up the system, and I think we have an obligation to finish \nthe job. This legislation, in particular, will address concerns about \naccuracy in the system and the need for consumer privacy.\n  I emphasize that I have met with many of my constituents to listen to \ntheir horror stories of trying to fix mistakes on their credit reports. \nThey have met with many of the same obstacles that millions of other \nconsumers have faced--months of waiting for their credit reports to be \nfixed, credit grantors who are unresponsive, and no one to talk to who \nwill listen to their complaints. As you know, these problems are not \nnew. I have been hearing about these problems for years and trying to \nfind a way to address them. This legislation is designed to address \nthese problems.\n  Because it traditionally takes a long time for the credit bureaus to \nrespond and fix credit reports, the bill requires the process to be \ncompleted in 30 days. As I have said, if the information in the report \ncannot be verified by the creditor who submitted it within 30 days, it \nwill be removed from the report. In addition, it cannot be reinserted \nlater unless the consumer is notified.\n  When a consumer goes through the reinvestigation process with the \ncredit bureau and the problem is still not fixed, our bill gives the \nconsumer the right to sue the creditor who will not fix the information \nit submitted to the credit bureau.\n  This bill also contains limited Federal preemption to ensure that \nthere are uniform Federal standards to govern a number of procedural \nissues which are part of credit reporting and which will reduce the \nburdens on the credit industry from having to comply with a variety of \ndifferent State requirements. For example, the bill preempts \nrequirements regarding prescreening, information shared among \naffiliates, reinvestigation timetables, obsolescence time periods and \ncertain disclosure forms.\n  In addition, the civil liability section makes it absolutely clear \nthat there are only private causes of action against a furnisher after \nthat furnisher has had an opportunity to reinvestigate and fix any \nmistakes.\n  I believe that this legislation is a well-balanced bill. All \ninterested parties benefit from this bill. The free flow of accurate \ninformation will help all sides by promoting good economic decisions in \nour free market economy. Consumers get increased disclosure and a 30-\nday reinvestigation time period and the credit industry gets a limited \nFederal preemption, the ability to share information among affiliates, \nand broader prescreening abilities.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I join Senator Bond today in introducing \namendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I want to again express my \nappreciation for the efforts of Senator Bond. I have enjoyed teaming up \nwith him on a number of issues and look forward to continuing this \nfriendship and productive working relationship.\n  As those who follow this issue know, Senator Bond and I came \nextremely close to getting similar legislation enacted into law last \nCongress. Versions of this bill passed the Senate 87 to 10 and passed \nthe House of Representatives on several occasions. Unfortunately \nbecause this came up at the of the session, one Senator was able to \nblock this bill's enactment into law. I am confidant we can get this \nlegislation to the President's desk this year.\n  This legislation is similar to the version that passed the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives last year. Senator Bond and I have made some \nrefinements but the guts of the bill are intact.\n  The heart of this legislation is the investigation process which is \nundertaken when a consumer discovers a mistake on his or her credit \nreport. We all know that mistakes will occur when you are entering \nbillions of pieces of data in computer banks every month. That is \ninevitable.\n  What is not inevitable is the frustration consumers experience \ngetting these mistakes removed from their files. This bill requires \ncredit bureaus and the businesses which supply information to verify it \nwithin 30 days or remove it from a consumer's file. Thereby, the burden \nof proof is transferred from consumers to businesses to verify the \naccuracy of the information in a file.\n  I was struck by the testimony of Nevadans who were forced to jump \nthrough a serious of hoops to prove that the information in their file \nwas faulty. They spent countless hours on the telephone trying to track \ndown information and to explain to credit bureau representatives what \nmistakes have been made. Through no fault of their own, these people \nwere put through the ringer. This legislation should rectify this \nsituation.\n\n  The bill also brings businesses who furnish information into the \nregulatory process. Without such a provision, bad actors can wreak \nhavoc on the credit reporting system and on consumers. I would have \npreferred a higher standard of liability for these businesses but \nbelieve this is a good first step.\n\n  On this point, I must express my total disgust at the behavior of the \nJ.C. Penney Co. In my entire career of public service, I have never \nseen a more disingenuous lobbying effort by any organization, and I \nwill not soon forget it.\n  This legislation tries to craft a delicate balance on the issue of \nState preemption. Senator Bond and I are both former Governors so we \ntake States' rights very seriously. We have tried to only preempt those \nareas of this law which affect the operational efficiencies of \nbusinesses but do not harm consumers. Setting a national uniform \nstandard for disclosure forms or timetables, does not set the consumer \nmovement back, yet should help the business community operate more \nefficiently.\n  I would like to put everyone on notice that I feel very strongly that \nwe should not preempt States' rights in the area of liability--\nparticularly if we set a low-liability standard as we do in this bill. \nCertain members of the business community have and will continue to \npush to preempt this area of State law, but I will fight such efforts \nand will have to reconsider the merits of this bill, should I lose on \nthis issue.\n  I believe the issues in this bill have been compromised and refined \nover several years of consideration and do not need much more \nmassaging. They represent an equitable balance with benefits to both \nthe consumers and businesses. I hope we can move this along swiftly. I \nurge my colleagues support.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 710. A bill to promote interoperability in the evolving \ninformation infrastructure maximum competition, innovation, and \nconsumer choice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                Telecommunications Interoperability Act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, earlier this week I came to the floor of \nthe Senate to discuss my concerns relating to the pending \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, S.652. I \nhave been concerned that this bill does not do enough to promote \ncompetition and consumer choice. As we on Capitol Hill work to revamp \nthe regulatory regimes governing the telephone and cable television \ncompanies of today, a much larger dynamic is taking hold in our \ncountry.\n  The digital age is upon us, and we must try to take this larger \npicture into view if we are to be truly effective in our efforts to \npass telecommunications reform that will serve our country, not only \ntoday, but tomorrow, and for the years to come. We need to take this \nopportunity, not only to address the regulatory issues currently being \ndiscussed, but to think about what kind of world we want this digital \nage to create.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, the Communications \nInteroperability Act of 1995, that I hope will stimulate a vigorous \npublic debate on how we can best achieve a truly ubiquitous National \nInformation Superhighway. I am [[Page S5451]] introducing this bill as \na discussion vehicle, and welcome reactions or comments on this \nlegislation from interested parties.\n  The National Information Superhighway, or National Information \nInfrastructure (NII) as it is called, is evolving as we speak. This new \ndigital age brings with a convergence of technology and vast new \nopportunities for Americans to gather and disseminate information. This \nNII pays no mind to the lines between industry sectors that have \nexisted in the past. The NII is a conglomeration of pieces, including, \nvarious high-speed, interactive, narrow and broadband networks that \nexist today and will emerge tomorrow. It is the satellite, terrestrial, \nand wireless technologies that deliver content to homes, businesses, \nand other public and private institutions. The NII is a term that \nencompasses all the pieces and conveys a vision for a nationwide, \ninvisible, seamless, dynamic web of transmission mechanisms, \ninformation appliances, content and people. This\n ubiquitous network of networks has the potential to improve the \nquality of life for all Americans--regardless of location, age, \neconomic status, or physical handicap. However, this potential will \nonly be realized if we have interoperability in our information \ninfrastructure.\n\n  Interoperability is the ability of two or more systems to interact \nwith one another. Interoperability allows diverse systems made by \ndifferent vendors to communicate with each other so users do not have \nto make major adjustments to account for differences in products and \nservices. Open interfaces at critical points of connection will allow \ninteroperability to occur.\n  Interoperability will allow components of the NII to work together \neasily and transparently. A high school student in Nebraska will be \nable to use research resources located anywhere in the country, and \ndiscuss that research with students at distant schools. It will allow \nteachers in Nebraska to share information about experiences with other \nteachers around the country. If, while on vacation, a person becomes \nill, a doctor in another State will be able to easily reach the family \nphysician in Nebraska to consult and access complete medical records \nonline.\n  Interoperability will make the NII accessible to the broadest number \nof people--both users and vendors. Users will not be limited to a \nparticular vendor's products. Vendors will be able to make their \nservices available to anyone who wants to use them. A small business or \nentrepreneur in Nebraska will be able to fully realize their potential \nbecause from their home office they will have the ability to easily \nreach customers across the Nation and around the world.\n  Interoperability allows all Americans to be both information \nconsumers and information providers. This means that a citizen in \nLincoln, NE, will not only be able to access the vast amount of \ninformation using an information appliance of her choice, at the same \ntime, she will also be able to publish her newsletter on fishing in \nNebraska to interested readers wherever they reside.\n  Interoperability promotes competition among technologies, providers, \nand media, leading to the greatest number of choices, the lowest \nprices,\n and maximum innovation. Interoperability based on open interfaces, \nwill help promote a level playing field for the future of \ncommunications. Rather than attempting to create or adapt regulations \nto ever changing technologies, open interfaces, and interoperability \nwill help ensure access and competition by allowing new entrants into \nthe marketplace.\n\n  Interoperability must be led by industry, but Congress can help by \npromoting the vision of an interoperable information infrastructure. I \nam not suggesting that Government get involved setting standards or \ndictating what technologies the private sector should use. What I am \nsuggesting is that we all have an interest in monitoring the private \nsector process and facilitating the development of a system that will \nbest serve American business, and American citizens.\n  Without interoperability, we will simply have pockets of information \nand services that will not be nearly as valuable because they will not \nbe easily linked to other parts of the infrastructure. Interoperability \nwill allow information to be transmitted between different \ntechnologies, allowing for the most efficient distribution of services. \nIn some areas, wire lines or fiber optic cable may be dominant, while \nin other more rural areas we may need to rely on satellite and wireless \ntechnologies. Unless all these divergent parts of the system are \ninteroperable, the digital age will divide us into information haves \nand have nots. I am concerned about the potential for rural States like \nmine to be left behind as the digital age charges forward.\n  The distinguished Senator from Maine introduced legislation earlier \nthis week to promote competition and consumer choice in consumer \nelectronics used in conjunction with the current cable system. \nCertainly an important piece of the overall infrastructure, but as the \ndistinguished Senator pointed out in his introductory statement, this \nbill is only focused on one particular area of telecommunications. The \nlegislation I am introducing today focuses on the bigger picture, \nproviding a broader, over-arching vision for our digital information \nage.\n  By looking ahead, and providing some policy objectives we can use \nthis opportunity to address not only past and current regulatory \nissues, but\n to project some expectations for the future of communications. \nExpectations which include an information infrastructure that \nstrengthens our educational system, expands commerce, improves the \ndelivery of health care, and enhances participatory democracy.\n\n  I hope we will embrace this opportunity to herald the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Communications \n     Interoperability Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the rapid convergence of communications, computing and \n     video technologies holds the promise of bringing \n     revolutionary improvements in the delivery\n      of a variety of information and other communications \n     services to the American public;\n       (2) interoperability will promote competition among \n     technologies, providers, and media, leading to the greatest \n     choices, lowest prices, highest value, and maximum \n     innovation;\n       (3) interoperability at key interfaces of the developing \n     information infrastructure of the United States will ensure \n     that existing and new components work together easily, \n     quickly, and transparently as the components of today's \n     telephone system;\n       (4) interoperability will help ensure that the information \n     and communications infrastructure of the future will be \n     accessible to the broadest number of people, both users and \n     vendors of products and services;\n       (5) open interfaces at critical connection points are \n     essential to achieving interoperability and the smooth \n     transfer of information throughout the system; and\n       (6) the development of an interoperable information \n     infrastructure based on open interfaces is in the interest of \n     all Americans, and the Federal Government should act as a \n     facilitator to achieve this goal.\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       ``(1) Interoperability.--The term ``interoperability'' \n     means--\n       ``(A) the ability of two or more systems (such as devices, \n     databases, networks, or technologies) to interact in concert \n     with one another, in accordance with a prescribed method, to \n     achieve a predictable result;\n       ``(B) the ability of diverse systems made by different \n     vendors to communicate with each other so that users do not \n     have to make major adjustments to account for differences in \n     products or services; and\n       ``(C) compatibility among systems at specified levels of \n     interaction, including physical compatibility.\n       The compatibility described in subparagraph (C) should be \n     achieved through open interface specifications.\n       ``(2) Interface specifications.--The term ``interface \n     specifications'' means the technical parameters for the \n     manner in which systems, products, and services communicate \n     with each other and may be limited to the information \n     necessary to achieve interoperability, leaving the \n     implementation and remaining product design to the creative \n     abilities of competitive suppliers.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 32. Joint resolution expressing the concern of the Congress \nregarding certain recent remarks that unfairly and inaccurately \nmaligned the integrity of the Nation's law enforcement officers; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution expressing the Nation's gratitude to its law enforcement \nofficers, and ask that it be passed by unanimous consent.\n  Every day, the brave men and women of our Nation's police forces put \ntheir lives on the line as they patrol our streets to keep the rest of \nuse safe. These fine public servants are far too often all that stands \nbetween the rule of law and the tyranny of crime and chaos.\n  The job of a law enforcement officer is increasingly dangerous. \nAcross America, 70 law enforcement officers were murdered in the line \nof duty in 1993. Assaults on officers are commonplace. Yet these men \nand women go out every day and perform their jobs with courage and \nintegrity.\n  Attacks from criminals, however, are not the only assaults out law \nenforcement officers are suffering from today. They are also being \nvictimized by malicious, mean-spirited, and misleading verbal attacks \nfrom those who should know better.\n  Officers daily put their lives in jeopardy to prevent crime, and to \ninvestigate crimes that have been committed, in order to bring the \nguilty to justice. They are expected to act perfectly, with often \nimperfect information, and must ensure both the safety of the community \nand the integrity of the criminal justice process.\n  The Nation's police officers perform these tasks admirably. And On \nthose rare and regrettable occasions when they falter, it is the police \nwho are most aggrieved, seeking to redress the failure to uphold the \npublic's trust. They recognize that without that trust, they cannot \nenforce the laws.\n  So we must never forget the faith with which the police attempt to \ndischarge their duty. Whenever the public is led to believe without \ncause that their law enforcement officers are less than true to their \noaths ``to serve and protect,'' the rule of law is endangered. For any \nsociety in which the law is in disrepute, or its fair enforcement in \ndoubt, is only a shore step away from a society without law.\n  America owes a debt of gratitude to its police officers that it \nreally cannot repay. However, Congress can and should take this \nopportunity to acknowledge that debt, and express the American People's \nthanks for the continuing service of its law enforcement heroes.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \njoint resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I and Senator Hatch are introducing \na joint resolution to express the concern of the Congress regarding \nsome recent remarks that inaccurately malign the integrity of the \nNation's law enforcement officers.\n  It has been my privilege to work closely with our Nation's State and \nlocal police officers throughout my career. And, whether I have been \ndealing with officers who protect citizens in one of Delaware's \nsmallest towns or those who patrol our Nation's largest cities, I have \nbeen impressed by the level of honor, commitment and integrity they \nhave consistently upheld. Indeed, the evidence is that vast majority of \nour Nation's law enforcement officers are conscientious public servants \nwho have a job where they must literally be willing to lay their life \non the line everyday they go to work.\n  Let me be clear, I do not being to claim that there are no ``bad \napples'' among the Nation's 540,000 police officers--as in every \nprofession, there are ``bad apples'' who violate the law. But, this \ndoes not justify any sweeping indictment of the ethics of the entire \npolice profession, any more than a case of malpractice by a doctor \njustifies sweeping criticism of the entire medical profession.\n  Because I believe it is simply unfair to make allegations about a \nwhole profession based on the actions of a tiny minority and because I \nhave enjoyed such a close and, I hope, mutually respectful relationship \nwith our Nation's police officers, I am introducing this legislation so \nthat the Congress is on record as recognizing the integrity of our \nNation's police profession. I am happy to be joined by Senator Hatch on \nthis measure, and I look forward to other Senators joining us in this \neffort.\n  The morale of our Nation's police officers is dependent upon the \nrespect they feel from all of us, such is the case for any profession. \nThis resolution is but one of many chances the Senate will have this \nyear to indicate our confidence in our Nation's police. Later this \nyear, I expect that the Senate will be faced with legislation that will \nnullify the provisions of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 that \nwill add 100,000 more police to our streets. Those who believe that our \nNation's police do not live up to the highest ethical standards may \noppose this effort to add 100,000 officers to their ranks. But, those \nof us who know that the overwhelming majority of our police meet these \nhigh standards, must protect this effort to add 100,000 state and local \npolice to America's neighborhoods.\n  I admit that the resolution I introduce today offers but some small \nmeasure of rhetorical support. The real support for our Nation's police \nwill be shown by continuing our commitment to add 100,000 more officers \nto the ranks of those who protect us all. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5419-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5419-S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n     Sec. 801.

David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: We share your concern regarding the \n     future of the children and families of Arkansas and the \n     nation. Congress is considering sweeping changes to reform \n     the welfare system that will affect families struggling to \n     support their children. An effective child support \n     enforcement program is a essential part of that reform. \n     Regular child support payments must be ensured if single \n     parent families are to have financial security necessary for \n     children to thrive and to be successful citizens and relieve \n     the burden of taxpayers.\n       As child support enforcement professionals, we support the \n     efforts of congress to improve the present program. We \n     realize the importance of our role in empowering individuals \n     to become self-sufficient and we embrace the challenges \n     ahead. Our mission is to provide assistance to children and \n     families in obtaining financial and medical support through \n     locating parents, establishing paternity and support \n     obligations, and enforcing those obligations. Our vision for \n     the future is to put children first by helping parents assume \n     responsibility for the social and economic well-being and \n     health of their children.\n       To accomplish these goals we must have improved and uniform \n     enforcement remedies that reach across state lines. We must \n     also have improved operational support from both the state \n     and federal government and increased funding. While other \n     programs may lend themselves to block grants, nonpayment of \n     child support transcends state lines and requires some \n     uniformity in enforcement. Competing state interests affect \n     state legislation more readily than at the federal level. \n     Many state child support programs welcome federal mandates of \n     proven enforcement and operational remedies to assist them in \n     acquiring effective collection tools. Not all mandates are \n     bad. Much of the progress in child support has come about \n     through federal mandates and the resulting uniformity from \n     state to state has been most beneficial.\n       Child support advocates and professionals agree on much of \n     what is needed to improve the program nationwide. They \n     include the following:\n       1. Central Registry of Child Support Orders--States should \n     be required to develop and implement a central registry of \n     all child support orders. State central registries should be \n     formatted similarly to form a national central registry of \n     child support orders.\n       2. Central Collection Systems--It is difficult to enforce \n     child support orders because of the variety of collection \n     points. To enforce an order, payments made or not made must \n     be accounted for to determine past due support. With child \n     support payments being paid directly to custodial parents, \n     court clerks or local agencies it becomes a time consuming \n     process to collect payment records from different sources in \n     order to determine past due arrears. Central payment \n     processing has proven to be effective and efficient where \n     implemented. Central processing enables IV-D agencies to \n     monitor delinquencies in child support cases and allows \n     [[Page S5420]] for expedited enforcement remedies to be \n     implemented immediately upon delinquency. Many of the IV-D \n     agency's cases have been delinquent for months or years when \n     they enter the caseload. Central monitoring is essential if \n     we as a nation are to have an effective child support \n     program. Collections should not become delinquent. If they do \n     become delinquent, immediate enforcement actions must be \n     taken.\n       3. New Hire Reporting--New hire reporting has proven \n     effective in fifteen states. It is an effective tool to \n     locate job hoppers. Employers report new hires to the state \n     IV-D agency or in cooperation with state employment security \n     agencies when a new employee is hired. At present, there is \n     no good way to locate a job hopper for at least one quarter \n     of the year when withholding is first reported. Custodial \n     parents cannot wait that long to feed and clothe their \n     children. There are those who feel that this is too heavy a \n     burden upon employers. It need not be. It cold be as simple \n     as forwarding a copy of a W-4 form. We have found employers \n     to be responsive and concerned about child support issues. \n     When new hire reporting was erroneously reported as having \n     passed our legislature, employers called wanting to know how \n     to report new hires. There was no opposition in the employer \n     community but certain business interests presented strong \n     opposition to the measure. It is difficult to win approval \n     for such a measure on the local level and to do so requires \n     federal leadership.\n       4. License Revocation--License suspension or revocation is \n     a proven and effective administrative procedure to compel\n      payment of past due arrears. It is somewhat controversial \n     because of vested interest and licensing agencies \n     reluctance to participate, but it has proven to be \n     effective in Maine, California and Arkansas. Nineteen \n     states have adopted some form of license suspension or \n     revocation. To be an effective remedy all states need to \n     have access to licensing revocation and suspension. For \n     interstate enforcement a request to suspend a license in \n     another state would be most beneficial and would be a \n     deterrent to nonpayers to flee from one state to another \n     to avoid paying child support.\n       In addition to new enforcement techniques, support from the \n     federal government not just in dollars and cents but in \n     cooperation is paramount if we are to solve the national \n     nonsupport problem. Federal government agencies have \n     information we need to locate nonpaying noncustodial parents \n     and their assets. Yet, it is difficult to obtain that \n     information, it is outdated or; if provided, cannot be used \n     without additional verification.\n       1. Social Security Administration--We recommend that \n     Congress pass laws that would require the Social Security \n     Administration (SSA) to provide information to the child \n     support agencies for the purpose of determining the location \n     and the ability of the noncustodial parent to pay support. \n     Currently, information from SSA is available through the \n     Federal Parent Locator Service. However, the information that \n     we receive is minimal and outdated. We need to know if a \n     noncustodial parent has filed a claim for benefits, the \n     amount of benefits paid to the noncustodial parent and the \n     children, the amount of any lump sum payment to the \n     noncustodial parent or the custodial parent. This information \n     is vital in determining support obligations and arrearage.\n       2. IRS Locate and Asset Information--The IRS provides a \n     valuable service in the form of the Federal Tax Offset \n     program. Information on income is available from 1099 files. \n     However, The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has some concerns \n     with regard to safeguarding the information it shares with \n     state child support agencies and does not want the \n     information shared with anyone who is not a state employee. \n     Many states have contracted with local jurisdictions or \n     private entities, since 1975 in some states, to provide child \n     support services in their areas. After 20 years, the IRS has \n     suddenly raised issues of safeguarding confidentiality. These \n     contractors are agents or designees of the state and are \n     entitled to the same level of information as state employees \n     performing the same functions. Confidentiality is a high \n     priority\n      for all child support professionals and the information we \n     gather is used solely to establish or enforce child \n     support obligations. The Department of Defense has \n     contractors that have access to secure information that \n     could affect national security, certainly child support \n     contractors should have access to all information needed \n     to pursue a case. Something is very wrong when an agency \n     of the federal government can throw up road blocks to \n     obtaining information on delinquent noncustodial parents \n     affecting the ability of a child to receive the support he \n     deserves.\n       3. IRS Full Collection--The IRS full collection process \n     could be a valuable enforcement tool. However, our experience \n     has been that child support cases receive a low priority when \n     referred to the IRS field office. We suggest that Congress \n     provide funding for staff and resources to enhance the full \n     collection process and require that child support cases \n     receive priority over all other collection cases.\n       4. Automated Systems--The new child support data systems \n     being developed nationwide are sorely needed to manage the \n     growing number of delinquent child support cases. These \n     systems will assist child support workers who have caseloads \n     of 500 to 1000 cases to be more productive and enhance their \n     ability to make child support collections. However, the \n     resources of both the private vendors and states have been \n     exhausted in their attempt to make fifty statewide systems \n     operational by the deadline date. Few states will be up and \n     running by October 1, 1995 and the rush to get ``something \n     up'' by October 1 will produce inferior systems. There are \n     numerous reasons why these projects are in trouble. One of \n     the chief reasons for delay in implementation was that the \n     final federal regulations were not issued until October 1992 \n     and the certification requirements were not issued until June \n     1993. Both the state and the federal government have enormous \n     sums of money invested. We should get our moneys worth. By \n     extending the deadline for one more year to October 1, 1996 \n     without approving any additional funds for furthering the \n     project, state administrators will be allowed the opportunity \n     to make these projects successful. If there is no extension, \n     there is going to be mass confusion on or about October 1, \n     when all states try to bring up these new systems nationwide. \n     It does not make good sense to allow this to occur. We, \n     therefore, recommend an extension to October 1, 1996 at\n      the 90% FFP rate with no additional funding allowed other \n     than those funds previously approved in the state's \n     Advance Planning Documents.\n       The 1993 Amendments to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act (OBRA) required states to establish programs that provide \n     a simple civil process for unmarried parents to voluntarily \n     acknowledge paternity for their children. In Arkansas, all 56 \n     birthing centers are assisting parents by providing \n     information on establishing paternity and completing the \n     necessary forms. Since the program implementation date of \n     January 25, 1994, over 4,500 acknowledgements have been \n     signed. The acknowledgements are matched to the existing IV-D \n     caseload on a continual basis. To date, twenty-five percent \n     (25%) of the signed acknowledgements have been identified as \n     IV-D cases. To be truly successful, the program should be \n     extended to encompass postnatal follow-up to provide yet \n     another opportunity for parents to acknowledge the paternity \n     of their children. The IV-D agencies will follow-up with \n     families that receive child support services. However, the \n     Public Health agencies have an opportunity through public \n     education, nutrition, immunization and home health services \n     to reach the parents that are not served by the IV-D program. \n     We suggest that Congress provide a funding mechanism for the \n     public health agencies, Headstart and any other agencies \n     concerned with the welfare of children and families, to \n     provide paternity acknowledgement services to their clients.\n       Federal regulations require states to periodically review \n     and adjust child support orders utilizing state guidelines. \n     We agree that periodic review is essential to ensure that the \n     children receive the support they deserve and that parents \n     are ordered to pay a fair and reasonable amount. The process \n     by which review and adjustment is accomplished is restrictive \n     and incompatible with states' Rules of Civil Procedure. \n     States should have more flexibility to determine the process \n     by which review and adjustment is accomplished. One \n     alternative might be the award of Cost of Living Allowances \n     (COLA). This method could be automated and more evenly \n     applied.\n       Arkansas has implemented an administrative process to \n     revoke or suspend Commercial Driver's License of noncustodial \n     parents who are six (6) months behind in their child support \n     obligations. In less than six months of operation, we have \n     collected over $106,000. A total of 107 commercial driver's \n     licenses have been suspended, 12 licenses have been \n     reinstated and 70 noncustodial parents have signed agreements \n     to pay the delinquent accounts and avoid suspension of their \n     licenses. One of the most difficult case for us to collect is \n     the independent truck driver. With this program, drivers are \n     detained in weigh stations throughout the nation or at their \n     terminals until the child support issues are resolved. \n     Arkansas has recently extended the license suspension for\n      nonpayment of child support to all business and professional \n     licenses, hunting and fishing licenses and permanent \n     license plates. We recommend that all states be required \n     to suspend licenses to include all professional/business \n     licenses, regular drivers' licenses and personal vehicles, \n     trucks, boats and airplanes registered in the state. \n     States have found that the most successful programs are \n     administrative and automated. Congress should consider \n     requiring state IV-D agencies to implement such \n     administrative programs and provide funding for licensing \n     boards to become automated with electronic links to the \n     IV-D agencies.\n       No one wants to discuss funding in today's environment. \n     However, there is a direct relationship between the amount of \n     child support collected and the ratio of child support \n     workers per case. The more workers, the more child support is \n     collected. At some point there would be diminishing returns, \n     but this is not likely in the foreseeable future. Originally, \n     states received 75% FFP plus incentives on collections. Only \n     AFDC cases were mandated. Over the years since the program \n     began, FFP has decreased to 66% plus 6-10% incentives on AFDC \n     cases and 6-10% on non-AFDC cases. Incentives on non-AFDC \n     collections are capped at 115% of AFDC collections, creating \n     somewhat of a disincentive to work non-AFDC cases. During the \n     same time period that federal financial participation was \n     decreasing, Congress mandated services to non-AFDC clients \n     and Medicaid recipients, increasing caseloads \n     [[Page S5421]] dramatically. Caseloads, nationally, have \n     increased by 128% with collections increasing by 345% during \n     the same period, FFP has decreased by 5.7%. States are \n     continually asked to do more with less funding, which has \n     contributed to the growing problem of uncollected child \n     support.\n       While the intent of the current proposal being considered \n     is to provide some relief and to redistribute federal dollars \n     among states, it is important to understand the effect of the \n     proposed funding scheme. Under the proposed distribution \n     rules, states will lose dollars in the form of retained AFDC \n     collections which provide match dollars for half of the \n     states. Currently, states can earn more than 100% funding. \n     Some make a profit. Under the new scheme, the best a state \n     can do is 90% FFP. Since many states pass incentives on to \n     the contractors providing services in some local \n     jurisdictions, many local offices will be asked to enter into \n     contracts knowing that they will experience at least a 10% \n     loss each year or state cost will increase. Once again, as \n     Congress attempts to improve the nation's child support \n     problem, a funding cut is proposed. We know that more dollars \n     must be invested in caseworkers and automation if we are to \n     work more cases and collect more child support. Why then \n     reduce funding to state programs by at least 10% when you \n     want them to do more? If we are to remove custodial parents \n     from welfare and make parents financially responsible for \n     their children, a strong child support program is essential. \n     A return to the 75% FFP plus incentives would be helpful and \n     we recommend that incentives by sufficient to allow for a \n     100% reimbursement. Any funds over 100% should be returned to \n     the federal government.\n       We greatly appreciate your interest in child support \n     enforcement. Thank you for the opportunity to express our \n     views on these very important issues. We join in your \n     commitment to assist the children and families of Arkansas \n     and the nation to realize their full potential.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Judy Jones Jordan,\n                                                    Administrator.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 688. A bill to provide for the minting and circulation of $1 \nsilver coins; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                The U.S. Silver Dollar Coin Act of 1995\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would permit the minting of a $1 silver-plated coin \nwith a likeness of President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the front and a \nrendering of the Iwo Jima monument on the reverse side of the coin. I \nam pleased that Senator Grassley is joining in this effort that will \nprovide a boost to our domestic silver mining industry and could serve \nto reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Our currency system has not been significantly altered over the past \ncentury even though the economy has fundamentally changed. Not long \nago, an individual could use one coin--a nickel, dime, or quarter--to \npurchase a coke from a vending machine or ride a bus. Today, that's \njust not possible. Vending machines require two, three, or four coins, \nor, even worse, a dollar bill. And you know how frustrating those \ndollar bill readers can be on vending machines and Metro fare machines. \nTo make matters worse, a dollar bill reader on a vending machine costs \n$400 to $500--an utterly unnecessary cost if a dollar coin were \navailable.\n  According to the Coin Coalition, processing dollar coins instead of \ndollar bills would save the mass transit industry alone more than $124 \nmillion a year. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation \nAuthority would save $3.5 million a year if it did not have to expend \nthe time and labor in processing--unwrinkling dollar bills. Those \nsavings could be used too buy 24 new buses to move people instead of \npaper. The Chicago Transit Authority does its own bill-unfolding, at a \ncost of $22 per thousand. Processing coins costs just $1.64 per \nthousand.\n  In addition, many economists project that a dollar coin could save \nthe Federal Government several million dollars. Although coins cost \nmore to mint than dollar bills to print, coins last far longer. A bill \nwears out in an average of about 17 months while coins can last 30 \nyears.\n  Since this is the 50th anniversary of the allied victory in World War \nII, I believe it is appropriate that the new coin present a likeness of \nPresident Eisenhower who also served as the Supreme Commander in \nEurope. The rendition of the raising of the flag on Mount Surabachi on \nIwo Jima has become a symbol of the dedication and valor of our Armed \nForces in restoring freedom in the Pacific.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in getting this coin modernization \nenacted into law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 688\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Silver Dollar \n     Coin Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ONE-DOLLAR COINS.\n       (a) Color and Content.--Section 5112(b) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The dollar,'' and \n     inserting ``The''; and\n       (2) by inserting after the fourth sentence the following: \n     ``The dollar coin authorized under subsection (a)(1) shall be \n     silver in color, shall have a distinctive edge and have \n     tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the \n     coin readily discernible, shall be minted and fabricated in \n     the United States, and shall have metallic and anti-counter-\n     feiting properties similar to those of United States clad \n     coinage, except that the dollar coin shall be a clad coin \n     with 3 layers of metal, including 2 outer layers of silver. \n     The dollar coin authorized under subsection (a)(1) shall \n     contain not less than 1 gram of newly mined fine silver.''.\n       (b) Adjustments to Silver Content.--Section 5112(c) of \n     title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following: ``Notwithstanding subsection (b), the \n     Secretary may prescribe the weight of silver in the dollar \n     coin if the Secretary determines that such action is \n     necessary to ensure an adequate supply of dollar coins to \n     meet the needs of the United States.''.\n       (c) Design.--Section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the fourth sentence, by striking ``the dollar, half \n     dollar,'' and inserting ``the half dollar''; and\n       (2) by striking the fifth and sixth sentences and inserting \n     the following: ``The obverse side of the dollar coin shall \n     bear a likeness of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the \n     reverse side shall bear a rendering of the Iwo Jima \n     Memorial.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Not later than 30 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall place into circulation the one-dollar coins authorized \n     by section 5112(a)(1) of title 31, United States Code, in \n     accordance with the amendments made by subsections (a), (b), \n     and (c).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 689. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act regarding the \nuse of organic sorbents in landfills, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            THE LANDFILL TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing today the \nLandfill Technical Improvement Act of 1995. This legislation will allow \nus to maximize technical advances of the last decade in carrying out \nour Nation's environmental protection strategy. It will also promote \nsmall business and entrepreneurship and help our Nation complete in the \nglobal market for new, environment driven technologies.\n  By passing the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste amendments, Congress \nrequired the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to issue regulations \nrestricting the disposal of organic absorbents in hazardous waste \nlandfills. In the past decade, however, developments in natural \nabsorbent technologies show more efficiency than traditional sorbents \nproduced for fossil fuels.\n  For example, a company in Bellingham, WA, manufactures organic \nsorbents from a local paper mill's sludge. Sludge recycled into \nproductive use is kept out of landfills. This small company employs 20 \nto 30 Washingtonians and, with other similar companies across the \ncountry, seeks to expand in the marketplace with this new, recycled \nproduct.\n  Normal landfill conditions are anaerobic, and studies have shown that \nno biodegradtion takes place in the anaerobic environment of landfills. \nThus, in this anaerobic environment of RCRA landfills, these sorbents \nwill not degrade. These organic absorbents, made totally from reclaimed \nmaterials, may actually outperform current chemical absorbents. \nHowever, because of the 1984 amendments and subsequent EPA regulations, \nthese absorbents have been effectively shut out from disposition in \nlandfills.\n  This disposition issue threatens to undermine the existence of these \nnew technologies, since that which cannot be disposed economically will \nnot be [[Page S5422]] used. Moreover, innovative and environmentally \nconscious technologies, such as those developed by this small company \nin my State, are discriminated against.\n  The administration has clearly stated its preference for such \nrecycled/reclaimed materials, but this flawed regulation has prejudiced \nthe widespread availability and use of these products. This is to the \ndetriment of our national environmental goals.\n  This bill remedies this situation, allowing the fullest use of \nenvironmentally sound landfill technologies.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 690. A bill to amend the Federal Noxious Week Act of 1974 and the \nTerminal Inspection Act to improve the exclusion, eradication, and \ncontrol of noxious weeds and plants, plant products, plant pests, \nanimals, and other organisms within and into the United States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n        THE FEDERAL NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. AKAKA.\n Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Noxious Weed Control \nImprovement Act of 1995. Senators Campbell and Dorgan have joined me as \ncosponsors of this bill. The objective of this legislation is to curb \nthe wave of noxious weeds that is sweeping over productive rangeland, \nagricultural land, and native ecosystems across America.\n\n  I hope my colleagues saw the article on invasive alien species that \nappeared in the New York Times magazine last November. It vividly \ndescribed the threats to the tropical ecosystems of Hawaii posed by \nnonindigenous species. In Hawaii, gorse, ivy gourd, and the banana poka \nvine are ravaging native forest and rangeland. But Hawaii is not alone \nin facing this threat. Nearly 200 species of troublesome imported weeds \ninfest the continental United States.\n  We see evidence of this problem within a few miles of the Capitol. \nDrive to the edge of the Potomac or through Rock Creek Park and you \nwill see impenetrable mats of hydrilla and honeysuckle. Another weed, \nkudzu, topples grown trees and smothers shrubs and plants. In New \nEngland, Oriental bittersweet and porcelain berry vine cause similar \ndamage. Purple loosestrife has decimated wetlands across the country \nfrom Maine to Washington.\n  Leafy spurge, spotted knapweed, cheatgrass, thistle, salt cedar, and \nMedusa-head cover millions of acres of grasslands in Montana, Idaho, \nOregon, and Washington. All of these weeds are foreign to the United \nStates. Some are toxic to livestock. Others are heavy consumers of \nwater, or fuel forest and rangeland fires. These weeds ruin the \ngrasslands for birds, elk, and grizzly bears. In Montana alone, \ncattlemen suffer millions of dollars of forage losses due to spotted \nknapweed. At its current rate of spread, Montana's projected losses due \nto spotted knapweed could exceed $100 million by the year 2000. Another \nweed, leafy spurge, occupies over 2.5 million acres in 30 States. \nNationwide, $100 million in direct and indirect losses to livestock are \nattributable to leafy spurge.\n  The cost of weed control and losses due to weed infestation are \nestimated at over $20 billion per year, more than the combined losses \nfor all other pests.\n  Nearly 16 million acres of Federal land are infested with noxious \nweeds. On Bureau of Land Management lands, weed infestation expands at \na rate of 2,000 acres per day. If current trends continue, a quarter of \nBLM lands in the continental United States could be overrun with weeds \nby the turn of the century.\n  At least one hundred of our national parks face serious harm to their \nnatural resources as a result of invasive foreign plants. Everglades \nNational Park and Big Cypress National Preserve are overrun by the \nAustralian melaleuca tree. More than 400,000 acres of the everglades \nare infested by this tree, and 50 additional acres are consumed each \nday. Wildlife habitat and water supplies are also threatened by \nmaleleuca in the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Another tree, \nthe Brazilian pepper, is crowding out the mangroves along Florida's \nsouthwestern coast. Both of these alien trees make habitat unsuitable \nfor native water birds.\n  Competition from 25 exotic plants threatens the habitat of rare \nplants in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Among the damaging \nspecies are stink tree, multi-flora rose, and an imported grass with a \nscientific name I won't even attempt to pronounce.\n  River margins and rare desert springs in the beautiful slickrock \nparks of Utah, including Canyonlands and Zion National Parks, as well \nas in Death Valley National Park, have become overgrown with tamarisk, \na tree which literally sucks the water out of the ground, depriving \nwildlife and native plants of precious water supplies.\n  Efforts to safeguard private and public land from these threats are \ngrossly inadequate. In 1993, the Congressional Office of Technology \nAssessment called U.S. efforts to counter the effects of invasive \nexotic species ``a largely uncoordinated patchwork of laws, \nregulations, policies, and programs.''\n  The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for preventing noxious \nweeds from entering the country either accidentally or as intentional \nimports, as well as for spearheading\n control efforts for those noxious weeds that have already become \nestablished. However, the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 has not been \nan effective tool to address this problem.\n\n  Under current law, the Secretary of Agriculture must wait until a \nweed is an established, documented nuisance before action can be taken. \nThat's like waiting until the cows have run away before you close the \nbarn door.\n  For example, tropical soda apple, a plant in the nightshade family, \nwas introduced from Brazil into pastures in Florida. It was first \nobserved in 1987 and now occupies more than 400,000 acres in Florida. \nAlthough cattle cannot eat the plant because of its sharp spines, seeds \nfrom this invasive weed easily contaminate hay and other forages. \nTropical soda apple presents a particularly difficult control problem \nbecause seeds are passed through cattle manure. In Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Georgia, more than 20 outbreaks have been linked to cattle \npurchased in Florida. Tropical soda apple can also be transported in \ncommercially packaged manure used for gardening. Despite the danger and \nthe relative ease of dealing with the original infestation, it took the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture 8 years to declare it a noxious weed. \nDuring that time, the problem has become so widespread that containment \nmay be beyond hope.\n  To correct weaknesses in the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974, my \nbill would grant emergency authority to prohibit the entry of foreign \nweeds that have not been formally added to the Federal noxious weed \nlist. Weeds could also be added to the list through a petition process. \nAlso, the bill would prohibit the international movement of Federal \nnoxious weeds across State lines except under permit. Finally, this \nlegislation would establish a Noxious Weed Technical Advisory Group to \nevaluate weed species, develop appropriate classification criteria for \nnoxious weeds, and make recommendations to implement the act.\n  As the hearings that I chaired during the 103d Congress clearly \ndemonstrated, the lack of coordination between Federal agencies that \nare responsible for the control of alien weeds is a serious problem. \nTwenty-four Federal agencies located in 8 different Cabinet departments \nhave responsibility for pest control. They enforce more than an dozen \nmajor laws, and a host of minor ones.\n  With so many statutes and so many agencies, Federal policy resembles \na piece of swiss cheese, and noxious, foreign pests are streaming \nthrough the holes in policy and enforcement. Hawaii and other States \nsuffer the consequences of piecemeal Federal enforcement.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the prompt passage of this bill. I \nhope that we can consider this legislation as part of the 1995 farm \nbill. All of our constituents will benefit from a stronger and more \nsecure foundation for agriculture and conservation of our natural \nresources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Federal Noxious Weed \nControl Improvement Act of 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of early detection of prostate cancer and certain \ndrug treatment services under part B of the medicare program, to amend \nchapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, to provide for coverage of \nsuch early detection and treatment services under the programs of the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs, and to expand research and education \nprograms of the National Institutes of Health and the Public Health \nService relating to prostate cancer; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Prostate Cancer \nDiagnosis and Treatment Act of 1995. Prostate cancer is the leading \ncancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among American men. \nOver 215,000 Americans will be diagnosed with the disease this year and \nover 40,000 men will die from it.\n  Despite recent advances in the early detection and treatment of \nprostate cancer, the number of cases and the number of deaths continue \nto rise. Prostate cancer is as common today in men as breast cancer is \nin women, and the death rates for the two diseases are similar as well. \nOver this decade, prostate cancer cases and deaths are expected to \ncontinue their rapid rise--with cases increasing by 37 percent and \ndeaths by 90 percent between 1985 and 2000.\n  Early detection has been greatly improved with the development of the \nprostate specific antigen [PSA] test--a simple and inexpensive blood \ntest for the presence of prostate cancer. As a result, the American \nUrological Association and the American Cancer Society now recommend \nthat men ago 50 and over get an annual screening with the PSA test. \nTreatment has been improved through new surgical techniques that remove \nthe cancer without disastrous side effects, and through new drug \ntherapy that can extend life expectancy and improve patient comfort for \npatients with advanced stage cancer.\n  These improvements have meant the difference between life and death \nfor many men. The ability to detect prostate cancer in the first stage \nof the disease has made it possible to surgically remove the cancer \nwhen it is still confined to the prostate. Over 70 percent of patients \ntreated in this way never have a recurrence of the disease. Waiting \nuntil the second stage or later, which was necessary under previous \ntechniques, greatly increases the risk that the cancer has spread, with \nsmall hope for a cure.\n  I know how important it is to get screening and early treatment for \nprostate cancer--I am a prostate cancer survivor. I had a PSA test--I \nhad a positive score--I had my prostate removed--and I am here to tell \nabout it as a result. A number of my colleagues in this Chamber--\nSenator Dole, Senator Stevens, among them--are here with us today \nbecause their prostate cancer was spotted early and treated \neffectively. General Schwarzkopf, the hero of the gulf war, is another \nman nearly felled by prostate cancer, but saved through screening and \nsurgery. General Schwarzkopf has become a national spokesman for \nprostate cancer detection. General Schwarzkopf and all of us in \nCongress are lucky to have the kind of insurance coverage we do through \nthe Military and Federal Employees Health Benefit plans and the access \nwe have to the finest medical facilities and doctors at Walter Reed \nHospital among other places.\n  We can all be sure we get our annual PSA test and any treatment we \nmay need.\n  The tragedy is that 13 million American men who are at the highest \nrisk for this disease do not have health insurance coverage for the \nbest early detection methods and drug therapies. They do not have it \nbecause we, the Congress, have not seen fit to provide it for them \nthrough the Medicare and Veterans Health programs. Medicare covers the \nold diagnostic test but does not provide for an annual PSA test. The \nVeterans Health services could provide annual tests for their resident \nand in-patient populations, but rarely do the tests or the follow-on \nsurgery. Both of these programs cover part of the hormonal drug therapy \nfor treatment of advanced prostate cancer, but leave out the oral drug \nwhich is particularly effective when given in combination therapy. \nThese omissions are particularly troubling because these programs cover \nthe overwhelming majority of men who have the disease.\n  Finally, it is remarkable that we have had these breakthroughs in \ndetection and treatment given that we have so completely neglected \nfunding for prostate cancer research. Prostate cancer is a disease that \nhas a similar incidence and death rate to breast cancer \n[[Page S5427]] yet receives one-fourth as much research money. This is \na serious oversight that we should correct to increase the pace of \nresearch and develop conclusive evidence on what really works and does \nnot work in treating prostate cancer.\n  The Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 1995 would take \nthree important steps to halt the progression of this disease. First, \nit would nearly double spending on research to develop more effective \ntreatments of the disease. Second, it would make PSA tests available \nunder the Medicare and Veterans Health programs. Third, it would extend \nMedicare and Veterans Health coverage for prostate cancer drugs to \ncover the advanced combination therapy including oral drugs that can \nsignificantly extend and improve the lives of prostate cancer victims.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we increase our efforts to combat \nthis deadly form of cancer and address these deficiencies in our \nFederal health coverage and research programs. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in sponsoring the legislation that could make a difference for \nthousands of men who might otherwise have suffered greatly or died an \nuntimely death from prostate cancer.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 694.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsummary of the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Rights Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nProvisions of the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim's Rights Act of \n                                  1995\n\n\n                 title i--equal protection for victims\n\n       Sec. 101.

Right of the victim to an impartial jury.\n       Protects the right of victims to an impartial jury by \n     equalizing the number of peremptory challenges afforded to \n     the defense and the prosecution in jury selection. (Current \n     law affords defendants 10 peremptory challenges, but affords \n     the prosecution only 6, in felony cases.)\n       Sec. 103. Right of the victim to fair treatment in legal \n     proceedings.\n       Establishes higher standards of professional conduct for \n     lawyers in federal cases to protect victims and other \n     witnesses from abuse, and to promote the effective search for \n     truth. Specific measures include prohibition of: harassing or \n     dilatory tactics, knowingly presenting false evidence or \n     discrediting truthful evidence, willful ignorance of matters \n     that could be learned from the client, and concealment of \n     information necessary to prevent violent or sexual abuse \n     crimes.\n       Sec. 104. Rebuttal of attacks on the victim's character.\n       Provides that if a defendant presents negative character \n     evidence concerning the victim, the government's rebuttal can \n     include negative character evidence concerning the defendant.\n       Sec. 105. Use of notice concerning release of offender.\n       Repeals provision that notices to state and local law \n     enforcement concerning the release of federal violent and \n     drug trafficking offenders can only be used for law \n     enforcement purposes.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the Tallgrass \nPrairie National Preserve in Kansas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the tallgrass prairie national preserve act\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nKansas, Senator Dole, to introduce legislation to create a tallgrass \nprairie preserve in the Flint Hills of Kansas.\n  At a time when some in Congress are asking hard questions about the \ncost and role of some units in the national park system, one may wonder \nwhy I am proposing the addition of another preserve to an already \noverburdened system. I am aware and sympathetic to those who complain \nthat some members of Congress have taken a parochial interest in the \npark system, passing bills to create parks and historical sites more \nfor their economic benefits to neighboring communities than because the \narea is nationally significant, either naturally or historically.\n  James Ridenour, former director of the National Park Service under \nPresident Bush, calls this the ``thinning of the blood'' of park system \nand points out that we are spreading limited personnel and scarce funds \ntoo thin. As a consequence, we have been spending an increasing \npercentage of Federal dollars on sites with questionable significance \nand devoting less to protecting our Nation's naturally significant \nresources. However, Mr. Ridenour strongly supports the bill being \nintroduced today as a unique solution to the creation of an important \naddition to the park system.\n  This legislation was crafted in response to these concerns. It \ncreates for the first time a private-public partnership, where capital \nfrom a private conservation organization is combined with limited funds \nfrom the Federal Government to create a national preserve open to the \nAmerican public. We will be doing this at a fraction of the cost that \nthe Federal Government would otherwise spend if it were to purchase the \nproperty for preservation. By taking this approach, we will be \npreserving for the first time an ecosystem that is found nowhere in the \npark service system. The approach taken in this bill is the kind of new \nthinking we in Congress must explore if we are to wisely spend scarce \nFederal dollars to protect important natural and historic areas in the \nfuture.\n  For those who have never been to the Flint Hills of Kansas, let me \nexplain why this area is so unique and special. From Nebraska to \nOklahoma there remains a narrow swath of tallgrass prairie--the \nremnants of a once vast tallgrass prairie ecosystem that covered \n400,000 square miles from Ohio to the Rocky Mountains, from Canada to \nTexas. Today, less than 1 percent of this ecosystem remains, much of it \nin the Flint Hills, which are too steep and too rocky to farm.\n  There is no better example of this tallgrass prairie ecosystem in the \nFlint Hills than the 10,894-acre Spring Hill Ranch in Chase County. \nHundreds of species of native plants and grasses grow on the ranch. \nNearly 200 kinds of [[Page S5428]] birds, 29 species of reptiles and \namphibians, and 31 species of mammals can be found on the property. The \nNational Park Service, after an extensive survey of the property in \n1991, concluded the property was\n nationally significant became of its natural resources and said it \ndeserved conservation as a unit of the national park system.\n  Beyond the natural splendor of the ranch, the property includes a \nhouse, barn, and several outbuildings listed on the National Register \nof Historic Places because of their unique second empire architectural \nstyle. Each of these buildings was built in the 1880s from hand-cut \ncottonwood limestone quarried in the area. They illustrate the elegance \nand style of the ranch's first owner, a local cattle baron. A mile way \nfrom the house, over a rise in the land, also sets a one-room prairie \nschool built in 1882.\n  For the past 4 years, I have been involved in efforts to preserve \nthis ranch and open it to the public. Last year, the National Park \nTrust, a private conservation organization, purchased the ranch and has \nbeen working with members of the Kansas congressional delegation and \nofficials with the Department of the Interior to develop legislation to \npreserve the ranch through a private-public partnership. The results, \nwhich have come only after painstaking negotiations with the Trust, \nInterior officials, and representatives of Kansas' agricultural and \nconservation groups, is reflected in the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n  The Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Act will allow the National \nPark Service to purchase or accept donations of up to 180 acres, or \nless than 2 percent of the ranch. In meetings I have had with Secretary \nof the Interior Bruce Babbitt, he has stated that he would like to see \nthe National Park Service own, maintain, and operate this historic core \narea, which includes the house, barn, and outbuildings.\n  The rest of the ranch will continue in private ownership, but the \nSecretary of the Interior is given the authority in this bill to enter \ninto a cooperative agreement with the National Park Trust to provide \ninterpretative and resource management assistance for the rest of the \nranch, as well as police and emergency services.\n  What is different about this proposal and why it makes such sense \nfrom the standpoint of the Federal Government is that the American \npeople will have access to and use of the 10,894-acre ranch for the \ncost of operating a 180-acre site. The National Park Trust, in a letter \nthat I will ask be printed in the Record following my statement, has \ncommitted to donating to the Federal Government at no cost up to the \n180 acres of the ranch's historic core. This donation, estimated by the \ntrust to exceed $2 million in value, was one of the elements we \nnegotiated to make this bill a true private-public partnership.\n  Mr. President, as Congress looks for innovative ways to make \nGovernment work better, I believe the approach taken in this bill \nsignals departure from the way the Federal Government has protected \nimportant natural and historic areas in the past. I am pleased\n officials with the Department of the Interior have been so willing to \nwork with me to explore this partnership. They have gone to great \nlengths to ensure the quality of this Park Service unit will not be \ncompromised, while remaining open to suggestions to new ways of \napproaching issues. As former Director Ridenour says in a letter \nendorsing the legislation, this bill ``represents the kind of creative \nthinking that will have to take place to guarantee that we take care of \nour great parks in the future.''\n\n  In addition to the care that was taken to draft this private-public \npartnership, equal care was given to address the legitimate concerns of \narea ranchers. In this bill, National Park Service ownership is limited \nto 180 acres, and no further expansion is permitted. Language was \nincorporated into the bill to address concerns regarding fence \nmaintenance and to require compliance with State noxious weed, \npesticide, animal health, and water laws. The bill establishes an \nadvisory committee consisting of conservationists, landowners, local \ncommunity officials, and range management specialists to help determine \nhow the ranch should be managed. The bill also incorporates language \nthat requires the Federal Government to be a good partner with \nneighboring communities and work cooperatively to deliver emergency and \nother services.\n  Mr. President, we have a wonderful opportunity to protect for future \ngenerations a portion of the tallgrass prairie--the only ecosystem not \ncurrently represented in the National Park System. Passage of this bill \nwill give the American public an opportunity to enjoy and explore this \nbeautiful area and grow to appreciate its history and importance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Park Trust \nand a letter from James Ridenour be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nother material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senator Kassebaum,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: It is a privilege for the National \n     Park Trust to endorse the legislation you are introducing to \n     establish a Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas. We \n     commend you for your leadership in recognizing the importance \n     of America's tallgrass prairie, which once covered more than \n     140 million acres across our nation's heartland, but today \n     only survives in remnant swatches.\n       The Spring Hill/Z Bar Ranch encompasses a magnificent \n     unspoiled swath of the Flint Hills. Its rolling, nearly \n     treeless landscape with grasses, sometimes reaching ten feet \n     in height, sustains the biological riches of a vanishing \n     American landscape. Nearly 200 kinds of birds, 29 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and 31 species of mammals can be \n     found on the property. Its distinctive century-old limestone \n     buildings, looming large amid ocean-like waves of prairie, \n     give enduring voice to local traditions and can serve as an \n     appropriate setting to tell the story of Native Americans and \n     pioneers and our nation's westward expansion. Because of its \n     outstanding natural and cultural resources, the National Park \n     Service's 1991 special resource study concluded that the \n     property met the standards as a unit of the National Park \n     System.\n       The National Park Trust acquired the Spring Hill/Z Bar \n     Ranch last June as a first important step toward ensuring \n     that this country's tallgrass heritage is preserved and \n     interpreted for all Americans. The Trust is a 501(c)(3) non-\n     profit educational and charitable corporation which is \n     celebrating more than ten years as the land conservancy of \n     the national parks. Its mission is to assist the National \n     Park Service in the acquisition of inholdings from willing \n     sellers, and to acquire and protect properties, such as the \n     Spring Hill/Z Bar Ranch, that merit protection as units of \n     the National Park System.\n       Now more than ever, the acquisition of properties for \n     inclusion in the National Park System is limited by shrinking \n     federal funds. In view of the condition of the federal budget \n     and because inclusion of a tallgrass prairie unit is believed \n     by many to be the highest priority for the National Park \n     System, the Trust will consider as its May meeting a proposal \n     to donate up to 180 acres of the historic core area of the \n     ranch, with a value of more than $2 million, to the national \n     Park Service. The property would be donated once the federal \n     designation has occurred and the National Park Service has \n     completed its study to determine the amount of acreage that \n     is needed. It is our hope that this potential donation \n     indicates the strength of our conviction that the Spring \n     Hill/Z Bar Ranch is of great national significance and \n     deserves to be part of the National Park System.\n       We also continue our pledge to manage the remainder of the \n     property not under the direct control of the National Park \n     Service in a manner that is compatible with the preserve's \n     general management plan--a plan that will be developed by the \n     National Park Service in cooperation with a citizen advisory \n     committee.\n       We welcome this opportunity to support this legislation and \n     look forward to its completion so that this deserving \n     resource can be part of the National Park System.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               J. Paul Duffendack,\n        Chairman, Tallgrass Prairie Interim Management Committee, \n     Member, National Park Trust Board of Trustees.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Indiana University,\n\n                                   Bloomington, IN, April 3, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: This is a letter in support of your \n     efforts to set aside a tall grass prairie in Kansas. You may \n     recall that I was Director of the National Park Service in \n     the Bush Administration.\n       In lectures I have been giving around the country, I have \n     been saying that the last great natural park to be purchased \n     is a tall grass prairie park. We may have some trades between \n     various federal agencies from time to time, but the tall \n     grass park is one in which private ownership will be \n     involved.\n       You have reached a unique solution to creating the park. \n     Private ownership has been recognized and respected while the \n     core area of 180 acres would become the management \n     responsibility of the NPS. This represents the kind of \n     creative thinking that will have to take place to guarantee \n     that we take care of our great parks in the future.\n       A tall grass prairie is a missing link in our system. This \n     statement comes from a former director who in leery of \n     creating additional parks. In my book, National Parks \n     Compromised, I talk of the concern I have with ``thinning the \n     blood'' of our system with parks with little or no national \n     significance. A tall grass addition to the system would not \n     be a ``Thinning of the blood'', especially in the creative \n     manner you are bringing it into the system.\n       Good luck and thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            James M. Ridenour,\n\n                                        Director, Eppley Institute\n                                       for Parks and Public Lands.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, for several years there have been attempts \nto create a national tall grass prairie preserve on nearly 11,000 acres \nin Kansas, known as the Z-Bar Ranch. Proposals for this preserve have \nfaced valid opposition from concerned citizens and landowners in the \narea. Today, Senator Kassebaum is introducing legislation which I \nexpect will establish a successful public/private partnership.\n  I commend Senator Kassebaum's leadership efforts to establish a \nprairie park in Kansas. In January 1992, she organized the Spring Hill/\nZ-Bar Ranch Foundation to raise money for the purchase of the ranch. \nThis private foundation also addressed many of the concerns of local \nresidents and landowners.\n  Last summer, the Z-Bar Ranch was sold to a private trust. But \nestablishing Z-Bar as a national preserve requires legislation. Senator \nKassebaum has worked diligently to strike a balance which is acceptable \nto all parties. This bill authorizes the Federal Government to purchase \nor to accept a donation of up to 180 acres of the Z-Bar Ranch.\n  I have always supported Senator Kassebaum's efforts to encourage \nprivate participation in the establishment of a national prairie \npreserve. With a private/public partnership, we can officially \nrecognize the tall grass prairie while limiting the involvement of the \nFederal Government.\n  This year, the National Park Trust, who currently owns the ranch, \noffered to donate the core area of land to the Federal Government. This \nwill minimize the cost of establishing the preserve. In my view, a \ncompromise which includes minimal Federal ownership and continued local \ninput sets this proposal apart from other efforts.\n  The tall grass prairie is a vital part of the natural environment and \nheritage of the high plains. We must protect and preserve it. Anyone \nwho has driven through the Flint Hills of Kansas appreciates the beauty \nof this prairie. I am pleased to join Senator Kassebaum today in \ncosponsoring this legislation. Her success in creating a partnership \nbetween public and private efforts will help preserve the history of \nthe Midwest.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 696. A bill to assist States and secondary and postsecondary \nschools to develop, implement, and improve school-to-work opportunities \nsystems so that all students have an opportunity to acquire the \nknowledge and skills needed to meet challenging State academic \nstandards and industry-based skill standards and to prepare for \npostsecondary education, further learning, and a wide range of \nopportunities in high-skill, high-wage careers, and for \n[[Page S5431]] other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n              THE CAREER PREPARATION EDUCATION REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege, on behalf of the \nClinton administration, to introduce the Career Preparation Education \nReform Act. This measure will reform vocational education and \ncontribute to the development of school-to-work opportunities. This \nlegislation represents major change. It consolidates more than 20 \ncurrent Perkins Act programs and gives states an increased role and \nincreased flexibility.\n  The legislation ensures that funds for in-school youth are \nadministered at the local level by local schools, and that federal \nfunds are allocated by a more effective needs-based formula.\n  This legislation adopts a new approach. It stresses high performance \nfor all students. It places greater emphasis on outcomes and the \nreporting of results. It links outcomes with corrective actions, \nincluding sanctions and rewards. It requires each State's plan to \ndescribe how the state will serve at-risk students. And it uses a local \nallocation formula which targets funds to the neediest communities.\n  The report of the National Assessment of Vocational Education found \nthat at-risk and special education students are too often concentrated \nin programs that do not adequately prepare them for careers or higher \neducation. By raising performance for all students and ensuring that \nplanning, reporting and evaluation reflect this priority, these \nstudents will be better served.\n  At-risk students should have a greater opportunity to receive the \nquality services and assistance they need to be successful. We intend \nto pay close attention to this issue as this legislation moves through \nCongress.\n  This bill encourages States to use their vocational education, \nelementary and secondary education, and second-chance programs to \ndevelop comprehensive, integrated, and effective school-to-work \nsystems.\n  It proposes two funding streams--a State grant and a national program \nauthority. It increase the amount of the state grant distributed to \nschools and colleges under the formula.\n  It calls on vocational education to support development of the in-\nschool part of school-to-work systems.\n  It takes a new approach to meeting the needs of special populations \nby emphasizing quality for all students.\n  It no longer requires separate State Boards for Vocational Education \nor separate State Advisory Councils.\n  It gives States the waivers necessary to develop comprehensive \neducation systems.\n  It proposes a performance partnership with the states in cooperation \nwith the Secretary of Labor, in order to develop a system to measure \nperformance, that ensures accountability and provides information on \nprogram success.\n  This legislation closely parallels other education reform initiatives \non education reform and career preparation. I look forward to working \nclosely with other Senators to achieve the bipartisan support we need \nin order to do a better job of preparing students for the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Career Preparation Education Reform \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n                        Organization of the Act\n\n       Sec. 2.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe training of health professions students with respect to the \nidentification and referral of victims of domestic violence, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduce the Domestic Violence \nIdentification and Referral Act with my colleagues Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Murray, Senator Moseley-Braun, and Senator Bradley. \nRepresentative Wyden and Representative Morella are introducing \nidentical legislation in the House.\n  Spouse abuse, child abuse, and elder abuse injures millions of \nAmericans each year, and is growing at an alarming rate. An estimated 2 \nto 4 million women are beaten by their spouses or former spouses each \nyear. In 1992, 2.9 million children were reported abused or neglected, \nabout triple the number reported in 1980. Studies also show that spouse \nabuse and child abuse often go hand-in-hand.\n  Doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals are on the front \nlines of this abuse, but they cannot stop what they have not been \ntrained to see or talk about. The Domestic Violence Identification and \nReferral Act addresses this need by encouraging medical schools to \nincorporate training on domestic violence into their curriculums.\n  There is a need for this legislation. While many medical specialties, \nhospitals and other organizations have made education about domestic \nviolence a priority, this instruction typically occurs on the job or as \npart of a continuing medical education program. A 1994 survey by the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges [AAMC] found that 60 percent \nof medical school graduates rated the time devoted to instruction in \ndomestic violence as inadequate.\n  The bill I am introducing today would give preference in Federal \nfunding to those medical and other health professional schools which \nprovide significant training in domestic violence. It defines \nsignificant training to include identifying victims of domestic \nviolence and maintaining complete medical records, providing medical \nadvice regarding the dynamics and nature of domestic violence, and \nreferring victims to appropriate public and nonprofit entities for \nassistance.\n  The bill also defines domestic violence in the broadest terms, to \ninclude battering, child abuse, and elder abuse.\n  I hope my colleagues agree that this legislation is a critical next \nstep in the fight to bring the brutality of domestic violence out in \nthe open. It mobilizes our Nation's health care providers to recognize \nand treat its victims--and will ultimately save lives by helping to \nbreak the cycle of violence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 S. 697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building at 33 College Avenue \nin Waterville, Maine as the ``George J. Mitchell Federal Building'', \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n          THE GEORGE J. MITCHELL FEDERAL BUILDING ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, at the request of the City of \nWaterville, Maine, I am introducing S. 698, legislation to name a \nfederal building in Waterville the ``George J. Mitchell Federal \nBuilding.''\n  As most of you know, George Mitchell and I shared more than the \nposition of Senator from Maine. We both grew up in similar \ncircumstances with very similar backgrounds. George Mitchell is half \nIrish and half Lebanese. I am half Irish and half Jewish. Both of us \ngraduated from Bowdoin College and both became lawyers before entering \npublic service. We worked together over the years on many issues of \nconcern to Maine people and wrote a book together on the Iran-Contra \nAffair.\n  From a quiet young lawyer in Waterville, Maine, came a great leader \nwho has done his country and his State proud. George Mitchell was born \nin Waterville in 1933. Waterville is located 18 miles north of the \nState capitol on the west bank of the Kennebec River. It was settled in \n1764 and became Maine's 137th town in 1802. Waterville is home to Colby \nCollege, Hathaway Shirt Company, and the Redington Museum which \nexhibits a number of 18th and 19th century artifacts from the region \nincluding the revolver used by Lieutenant Charles Shorey, of \nWaterville, at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n  George attended St. Joseph's grammar school and graduated from \nWaterville High School in 1950. He graduated from Bowdoin in 1954; \nserved in the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps in Berlin, Germany, \nfrom 1954-56; and then went on to Georgetown University to get his law \ndegree.\n  George Mitchell's litany of accomplishments are many: lawyer, trial \nattorney in the Antitrust Division in the U.S. Department of Justice in \nWashington, D.C.; executive assistant to U.S. Senator Ed Muskie; U.S. \nAttorney for Maine; and U.S. District Judge for Maine.\n  In 1980, he was appointed by Governor Brennan to fill the unexpired \nterm of Senator Muskie who was appointed by President Carter to be \nSecretary of State. There is a Chinese proverb that says ``when \ndrinking the water, it is important to remember those who dug the \nwell.'' To really understand George's success, one need look no further \nthan to the fact that Ed Muskie was his mentor. Ed, like George, began \nhis political career in Waterville as a young lawyer and state \nlegislator. Ed provided George with the basic principles of public \nservice which have guided him over the years. It was no surprise that \nGeorge Mitchell demonstrated many of the qualities which typify Senator \nMuskie and Maine: intelligence, integrity, and independence. Senator \nMitchell was elected Senate Majority Leader in 1988 and served his \ncolleagues and the institution with distinction.\n  George Mitchell was a gifted public servant. His voice reminds us \nthat public service is a noble calling. It was both a pleasure and an \nhonor to have served with him. I hope my colleagues will work with me \nin passing this legislation as a means of paying tribute to the many \nyears of outstanding service Senator Mitchell has given to the State of \nMaine and the country.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to offer my \nstrong support for legislation to honor our colleague and my \npredecessor, former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell. This \nlegislation, which I am proud to cosponsor with my colleague, the \nsenior senator from Maine, would designate the Federal building at 33 \nCollege Avenue in Waterville, Maine, as the ``George J. Mitchell \nFederal Building.''\n  There is perhaps no more fitting tribute to George Mitchell than \nnaming the federal building in his home town--Waterville, Maine--in his \nhonor. George Mitchell is a man who dedicated himself to government. \nFollowing his graduation from Georgetown Law School in Washington, \nGeorge Mitchell devoted himself to public service: at the U.S. Justice \nDepartment; as the leader of his party in the State of Maine; as one of \nMaine's gubernatorial candidates; as a federal, U.S. District judge; \nand, for the past fourteen years, as Maine's junior senator. George \nMitchell devoted himself to government because he believed in \ngovernment, and it is appropriate today that we name the seat of our \nfederal government in his hometown in his honor.\n  George Mitchell's story is well known in Waterville, Maine. His \nmother was a first-generation Lebanese immigrant; his father, an \norphan, was a janitor at Colby College. They instilled strong values in \ntheir son. George Mitchell dedicated himself to learning, to knowledge \nand justice, and throughout his youth he surpassed the arbitrary \nceilings our society so often builds. He graduated from Bowdoin \nCollege, served in the Army, and then went on to law school. He \ntypified the Maine work ethic, and that ethic served him well as an \nattorney, a judge, and as a United States Senator.\n  George Mitchell came to the U.S. Senate when another distinguished \nMainer, Senator Edmund Muskie, resigned his seat to become Secretary of \nState. Immediately, Senator Mitchell put a lifetime of experience to \nwork. He became one of the earliest advocates--and chief sponsors--of \nthe landmark Clean Air legislation that passed a decade later, in 1990. \nHe recognized the importance of standing up for [[Page S5442]] Maine--\nand also made his mark on our nation's political system. Because of his \ndedication to his party's ideals, he was chosen as this body's Majority \nLeader in 1988, and served in that important and prestigious position \nuntil his retirement from the Senate.\n  Always, during his tenure, George Mitchell remembered the people who \nsent him to Washington. As Maine's Second District Representative, I \nwas honored to serve alongside George Mitchell throughout his tenure in \nthe United States Senate. We worked together on a bipartisan basis to \nensure that the men and women of Maine were treated fairly, and had \nopportunities extended to other Americans.\n  With this legislation, we make an appropriate acknowledgement of \nGeorge Mitchell's years of leadership in the public arena. This is but \na small token of our appreciation: a fitting gesture which the City of \nWaterville has requested.\n  So in closing, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation and to extend to George Mitchell the hometown honor he \nso deeply deserves.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 699. A bill to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, to \nextend the authorization of appropriations for the Office of Government \nEthics for 7 years, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n      the office of government ethics reauthorization act of 1995\n\n Mr. COHEN.\n Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 699, legislation on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Levin to reauthorize the Office of Government Ethics \n(OGE).\n\n  To quote American statesman John C. Calhoun: ``The very essence of a \nfree government consists in considering offices as public trusts, \nbestowed for the good of the country, and not for the benefit of an \nindividual or party.''\n  This sums up the way we expect our government officials to conduct \nthemselves. Government service is a privilege that carries with it \ntremendous responsibilities. Public servants in all three branches of \ngovernment have an important obligation to the citizens who have put \ntheir faith and trust in them. Government officials should abide by a \ncertain code of conduct and adhere to high ethical standards so that \nour citizens may have confidence in the integrity of their government.\n  Unfortunately, however, many Americans are disenchanted with their \npublic officials. As a result, the need for strict ethical standards, \nand vigilant oversight of compliance with our ethics laws, is as great \nas ever. Almost daily headlines purport allegations of ``unethical'' or \n``inappropriate'' conduct by government officials in one form or \nanother. These stories only further erode the public's confidence in \nthe integrity of their government officials which is already at one of \nthe lowest points in our recent history.\n  Senator Levin and I have long been proponents of strong ethics laws. \nWe serve as the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member on the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management which has \njurisdiction over ethics matters within the Executive Branch. Senator \nLevin and I have made many changes to strengthen the ethics laws since \nthe Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which created OGE, was passed. We \nauthored the Independent Counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government \nAct which provides for the appointment of an independent counsel to \ninvestigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing by top level Executive \nBranch officials, and we worked together to strengthen the revolving \ndoor laws. Moreover, Senator Levin and I have consistently sought to \naid OGE in its mission of providing overall direction to the Executive \nBranch in developing policies to prevent conflicts of interest and \nensure ethical conduct by Executive Branch officers and employees.\n  The reauthorization bill Senator Levin and I are introducing today is \nnearly identical to the legislation we introduced last Congress which \nwas passed by the Senate in October. Unfortunately, however, no action \nwas taken by the House of Representatives prior to Congress' \nadjournment.\n  OGE's authorization expired on September 30 of last year. It is very \nimportant, therefore, that the Congress move as quickly as possible to \nreauthorize the agency. The bill will reauthorize OGE for seven years. \nThis is a slightly longer reauthorization than we have sought in \nprevious years. As in the past, we want to avoid the need to \nreauthorize OGE during the firs year of a Presidential term when a \nlarge portion of OGE's resources are devoted to the nominee clearance \nprocess.\n  The bill would also, for the first time, grant OGE gift acceptance \nauthority to address the problem that arises when federal government \nfacilities are not adequate either in terms of size or equipment \nresources to accommodate OGE's ethics education and training programs \nwhich are held around the country. This authority is intended to enable \nOGE to accept the use of certain non-federal facilities, such as an \nauditorium that might be offered by a State or local government or a \nuniversity, which may be better suited for OGE's needs.\n  As I have often noted in the past, the Office of Government Ethics is \na small office with large responsibilities. Over the years, we have \nimposed more responsibilities on OGE and we haven't always provided the \nnecessary staff or resources to carry out those responsibilities. \nSpecifically, I would note the additional functions OGE had to perform \nwhen it became an independent agency in 1989 and in complying with the \nEthics Reform Act of 1989. Congress moved to make OGE a separate agency \nbecause it was believed that OGE was not independent enough. In \naddition, Congress wanted to enhance the agency's prestige and \nauthority within the Executive Branch given its important and sensitive \nresponsibilities.\n  While OGE's budget has increased rather significantly since we last \nreauthorized the agency in 1988, OGE still has a lean budget with which \nto operate when you consider the critically important responsibilities \nof the agency. That said, in light of looming budget deficits, OGE, \nlike all agencies will be called upon to meet its responsibilities in \nthe most cost-effective manner possible. The bill also contains a \nnumber of technical changes to the ethics laws.\n  OGE's mission is critically important in ensuring strict ethical \nstandards in government. I hope my colleagues will move expeditiously \nto pass this legislation and reauthorize this important agency.\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Cohen and I, in our \ncapacities as the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, are introducing a \nbill to Reauthorize the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). \nReauthorization of the OGE is essential so that the agency can continue \nto perform its mission to provide overall direction of executive branch \npolicies related to preventing conflicts of interest on the part of \nofficers and employees of any executive agency. The OGE's previous \nauthorization expired on September 30, 1994.\n  Senator Cohen and I first introduced this bill bank in August of \n1993. The Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on the reauthorization \nin April of 1994, with the Director of the OGE, Stepehn Potts, as a \nwitness. The reauthorization bill was reported out of the Oversight \nSubcommittee and the Governmental Affairs Committee with strong \nbipartisan support and was approved by the Senate. The bill \nsubsequently died when the House of Representatives failed to act upon \nthe reauthorization in the last Congress. Therefore, Senator Cohen and \nI seek to reauthorize the OGE, so that the agency can carry on its very \nimportant responsibilities.\n  OGE was created in 1978 as part of the Office of Personnel \nManagement. Over the years, Congress has given more authority and \nautonomy to the OGE, making it a separate agency as of October 1, 1989. \nThis was an important step in recognizing the significance of OGE's \nrole and its need for independence. In addition, through Executive \nOrder, President Bush and President Clinton have given the OGE new \nresponsibilities for guiding and implementing an effective ethics \nprogram throughout the Executive Branch. The responsibilities of the \nOGE range from teaching to enforcement; from issuing regulations to \nproviding guidance and [[Page S5443]] interpretation; from reviewing \nfinancial disclosure forms to auditing agency ethics programs.\n  In the process of developing this bill, the Oversight Subcommittee \nreviewed OGE's budget, its personnel, and its accomplishments. Based on \nthat effort, I am satisfied that the OGE has improved in areas where \nweaknesses were identified in the past and that the agency is currently \non track in performing its duties in an effective, professional matter.\n  In addition to reauthorizing OGE, this bill would give OGE authority \nto accept donations or gifts that would facilitate the agency's work. A \nfederal agency can't accept gifts unless it has specific statutory \nauthority to do so. Many agencies have such authority but, up until \nnow, the OGE has not been one of those agencies. The reason OGE seeks \nthis authority is in connection with it's training mission. OGE \nconducts multiagency ethics training sessions around the country, and \nsometimes there is no nearby Federal facility that is appropriate in \nterms of size and services. This gift acceptance authority would allow \nthe OGE to accept the use of non-Federal facilities--for example, an \nauditorium and related services such as might be offered by a State or \nlocal government or a university.\n  I hope that the Senate will act quickly in reauthorizing this \nimportant agency.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n        Graham):\n  S. 700. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to revise \nthe tax rules on expiration, to modify the basis rules for nonresident \naliens becoming citizens or residents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                            Tax Legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to address a problem that has come to light recently \nconcerning the ability of U.S. citizens to avoid taxes by abandoning \ntheir citizenship. We should not countenance the evasion of taxes by \nthose who renounce their citizenship. The Senate should act to address \nthis problem expeditiously, and the bill that I introduce today will, I \nhope, represent significant progress towards that end. It is a revision \nof provision passed by the Senate Finance Committee recently, and \nresponds to some of the criticisms that have been raised concerning the \noriginal proposal.\n  A genuine abuse exists in this area. Although the current tax code \ncontains provisions, dating back to 1966, designed to address tax-\nmotivated relinquishment of citizenship, these provisions have proven \ndifficult to enforce and are easily evaded. One international tax \nexpert described avoiding them as child's play. Individuals with \nsubstantial wealth can, by renouncing U.S. citizenship, avoid paying \ntaxes on gains that accrued during the period that they acquired their \nwealth and were afforded the myriad advantages of U.S. citizenship. \nMoreover, even after renunciation, these individuals can maintain \nsubstantial connections with the United States, such as keeping a \nresidence and residing in the United States for up to 120 days a year \nwithout incurring U.S. tax obligations. Indeed, reports indicate that \ncertain wealthy individuals have renounced their U.S. citizenship and \navoided their tax obligations while still maintaining their families \nand homes in the United States, being careful merely to avoid being \npresent in this country for more than 120 days each year.\n  Meanwhile, the rest of Americans who remain citizens pay taxes on \ntheir gains when assets are sold or when an estate tax becomes due at \ndeath.\n  It was this Senator who made the first proposal in the Senate to deal \nwith the expatriation tax abuse. On February 6, the President announced \na proposal to address the problem in his fiscal year 1996 budget \nsubmission. Three weeks ago, on March 15, during Finance Committee \nconsideration of the bill to restore the health insurance deduction for \nthe self-employed, I offered a modified version of the administration's \nexpatriation tax provisions as an amendment to the bill. My amendment \nwould have substituted the expatriation proposal for the repeal of \nminority broadcast tax preferences as a funding source for the bill. \nThe amendment failed when every Republican member of the Committee \nvoted against it. Subsequently, Senator Bradley offered the \nexpatriation provision as a free-standing amendment, with the\n $3.6 billion in revenue that it raised to be dedicated to deficit \nreduction. Senator Bradley's amendment passed by voice vote. That is \nhow the expatriation tax provision was added to the bill that came \nbefore the Senate.\n\n  After the Finance Committee reported the bill, but before full Senate \naction and conference with the House, the Finance Committee held a \nhearing to further review the issues raised by the expatiation \nprovision. Tax legislation routinely gets polished in its technical \naspects as it moves through floor action and conference. At the Finance \nhearing, we heard criticisms of some technical aspects in the operation \nof the provision, as well as testimony raising the issue of whether the \nprovision comported with article 12 of the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, which the United States ratified in 1992. \nSection 2 of article 12 states: ``Everyone shall be free to leave any \ncountry, including his own.'' Robert F. Turner, a professor of \ninternational law at the U.S. Naval War College, argued that the \nexpatriation provision was problematic under the Covenant. The State \nDepartment's legal experts disagreed, as did two other outside experts \nwhose letters were before the Committee. I refer to Professor Paul B. \nStephan III, a specialist in both international law and tax law at the \nUniversity of Virginia School of Law; and Mr. Stephen E. Shay, who \nserved as International Tax Counsel at Treasury under the Reagan \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the day when I addressed this matter I \nasked that the materials to which I am presently referring be inserted \nin the record following my remarks. These materials, and others \nmentioned in this statement, can be found there.\n  Although there was considerable support for the legality of the \nprovision, I thought it best to proceed with caution in these \ncircumstances. These are matters of human rights under international \nlaw, on which we have rightly lectured others, and involve out solemn \nobligations under treaties. I sought the views of other experts. \nLetters concluding that the expatriation provision did not raise any \nproblems under international law were received from Prof. Detlev Vagts \nof Harvard Law School and Prof. Andreas F. Lowenfeld of New York \nUniversity School of Law. The State Department issued a lengthier \nanalysis upholding the legality of the provision, and the American Law \nDivision of the Congressional Research Service reached a like \nconclusion. However, there were dissenting views, most notably Prof. \nHurst Hannum of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts \nUniversity, who first wrote to me on March 24.\n  This is where things stood when the House-Senate conference met on \nMarch 28. The weight of authority appeared to be on the side of \nlegality under international law, but there was some question, and the \nbill had to move at great speed. As my colleagues well know, the \nlegislation restoring the self-employeds' health insurance deduction \nfor calendar year 1994 needed to be passed and signed into law well in \nadvance of this year's April 17 tax filing deadline, so that the self-\nemployed would have time to prepare and file their 1994 tax returns. \nThe decision regarding the expatriation provision had to be made \nwithout further opportunity of deliberation. I opted not to risk making \nthe wrong decision with respect to international law and human rights.\n  The decision to drop the expatriation tax provision from the final \nconference version of the bill has been the subject of much debate over \nthe last week. I certainly don't presume to speak for the other \nconferees. But for myself I repeat as I have said on two occasions on \nthis floor over the past week: we should proceed with care when we are \ndealing with human rights issues, particularly when the group involved \nis a despised group--that is, millionaires who renounce their \ncitizenship for money.\n  As the Senator who first proposed the expatriation tax provision, I \nwill see this matter through to a conclusion. We are getting more \nclarity on the human rights issue, and it appears that a consensus is \ndeveloping to the [[Page S5444]] effect that the provision does not \nconflict with our obligations under international law. In particular. \nit is worth noting that Professor Hannum, who first wrote me on March \n24 expressing his concern that that expatriation provision was a \nproblem under international law, has, after receiving additional and \nmore\n specific information about the expatriation tax, now written a second \nletter of March 31 stating that he is convinced that neither its \nintention nor its effect would violate present U.S. obligations under \ninternational law. This is the growing consensus, although it is not \nunanimous.\n\n  As for criticisms of the technical difficulties of the original \nproposal, I believe they can be satisfied. Indeed, I would venture that \nif some of those criticizing the provision's technical aspects had put \neven half as much effort into devising solutions as in highlighting \nshortcomings, we would already be much further along toward a \nsatisfactory statute.\n  One final point of utmost importance. As we take the time to write \nthis law carefully, billionaires are not slipping through some loophole \nand escaping tax by renouncing their citizenship. The President \nannounced the original proposal on February 6, and made it effective \nfor taxpayers who initiate a renunciation of citizenship on or after \nthat date. This was an entirely appropriate way to put an end to an \nabusive practice under current law. Both the proposal that I initiated, \nand the one that was ultimately adopted by the Finance Committee, also \nused February 6, 1995, as the effective date of the new provision \npreventing tax evasion through expatriation. The House conferees had \nproposed slipping the effective date to March 15, 1995--the date of \nSenate Finance Committee action on the provision. The two chairmen of \nthe tax-writing committees ultimately--and wisely--resisted that \noverture, and have issued a joint statement giving notice that February \n6 may be the effective date of any legislation affecting the tax \ntreatment of those who relinquish citizenship. Given the potential for \nabuse under current law, I believe that February 6 must be the \neffective date for a new rule. In any event, given the President's \nannouncement in the budget, the Finance Committee action, and the joint \nstatement of the two chairmen of the tax-writing committees, \nindividuals who are contemplating renunciation of their U.S. \ncitizenship are on fair notice of the February 6, 1995, effective date.\n  To repeat, as the Senator who first offered the proposal to end the \nexpatriation tax abuse, I will do everything I can to see that this \nmatter gets resolved. We will do it this session. Fundamental justice \nto all taxpaying Americans requires no less.\n  In an effort to advance that goal, I am today introducing legislation \nembodying a revised expatriation tax proposal. I do so in the interest \nof ensuring that the issues that have been raised are addressed \nsatisfactorily, and in a timely manner. This bill represents a serious \neffort to address the criticisms that have been raised, and I believe \nit represents a major step forward. It will provide an opportunity for \ncomment and further review. In addition, I anticipate that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation will include an analysis of this bill in its \ncomprehensive study of the subject of expatriation that the Committee \nstaff has been directed to present to the chairmen of the tax-writing \ncommittees.\n  Mr. President, we will end this abuse, and promptly, but in a careful \nand orderly way, as we should do in matters of this importance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A long-term resident would be an individual who \n     has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States \n     (i.e., a green card holder) in at least 8 of the prior 15 \n     taxable years. For purposes of satisfying the 8-year \n     threshold, taxable years for which such individual was a \n     resident of another country under a treaty tie-breaker rule \n     would be disregarded. The tax on expatriation would apply to \n     a long-term resident when (a) the individual is no longer \n     treated as a lawful permanent resident of the United States \n     as that term is defined in section 7701(b)(6), or (b) the \n     individual is treated as a resident of another country under \n     the tie-breaking provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty (and \n     the individual does not elect to waive treaty benefits). \n     Long-term residents would be considered domiciled in the \n     United States for purposes of calculating the tax on \n     expatriation.\n\n\n                 2. fair market value basis adjustment.\n\n       An individual who has been a nonresident alien would be \n     considered to have a fair market value basis in property \n     owned by the individual as of the earlier of: (1) the date \n     the individual first became a U.S. citizen or resident, or \n     (2) the date the property first became subject to U.S. tax \n     because it was used in a U.S. trade or business or it was a \n     U.S. real property interest. The fair market value basis \n     would apply for all purposes of computing gain or loss on \n     actual or deemed dispositions (not just the tax on \n     expatriation), but would not apply for purposes of computing \n     depreciation.\n       Under this provision, the taxpayer would have the burden of \n     proving fair market value. However, in determining whether \n     the individual has satisfied his burden of proof, the \n     Secretary will take into account the difficulty of \n     establishing fair market value (especially for years prior to \n     the enactment of this rule). If adequate evidence regarding \n     the fair market value of a piece of property is not \n     available, a taxpayer may elect to use historical cost to \n     determine any gain on the disposition of the property; the \n     historical cost election would not be available to claim a \n     loss on the disposition of the property. No fair market value \n     basis would be given to the assets of a foreign trust that \n     becomes a domestic trust. This provision would be effective \n     to calculate the tax under section 877A for expatriations \n     occurring on or after February 6, 1995, or for any other \n     dispositions after the enactment date.\n\n\n              3. election to be treated as a u.s. citizen\n\n       Each taxpayer would be allowed to irrevocably elect, on an \n     asset-by-asset basis, to continue to be taxed as a U.S. \n     citizen with respect to assets designated by the taxpayer. \n     The taxpayer would therefore continue to pay U.S. income \n     taxes following expatriation on any income generated by a \n     designated asset and on any gain from the disposition of the \n     asset, as well as any excise tax imposed with respect to the \n     asset (see e.g., section 1491). In addition, the asset would \n     continue to be subject to gift, estate, and generation-\n     skipping transfer taxes.\n       However, the amount of any transfer tax so imposed would be \n     limited to the amount of income tax that would be due if the \n     property were sold for its fair market value immediately \n     before the transfer or death, taking into account any \n     remaining portion of the expatriate's $600,000 exclusion. To \n     make this election, the taxpayer would be required to waive \n     treaty benefits with respect to designated assets. An \n     expatriating individual would be required to provide security \n     to ensure payment of the tax under this election in such \n     form, manner, and amount as the Secretary may require.\n\n\n                4. Administration of Tax on Expatriation\n\n       The current ``sailing permit'' requirement of section \n     6851(d) would be replaced with a new requirement to file a \n     tax return and pay a tentative tax for the portion of the tax \n     year through the date of expatriation. Section 6851(d) and \n     the regulations thereunder currently require any alien who \n     physically leaves the country--regardless of the duration of \n     the trip--to obtain a certificate from the IRS District \n     Director that he has complied with all U.S. income tax \n     obligations. This provision would be modified to require any \n     citizen or resident alien of the United States who becomes a \n     nonresident to file a tax return within 90 days of the date \n     that he ceases to be a U.S. citizen or resident, and pay the \n     relevant tentative tax. No tax return would be required of a \n     departing alien who intends to maintain U.S. residence.\n\n\n                        5. Technical Corrections\n\n     A. Allow deferral of tax on expatriation where estate taxes \n         would be deferred\n       Payment of the tax on expatriation should be extended in \n     circumstances that are similar to situations in which payment \n     of estate taxes may be extended under current law. Therefore, \n     the time for the payment of the tax on expatriation could be \n     extended for any period at the request of the taxpayer, as \n     provided by section 6161 (without regard to the ten-year \n     limitation of that section). In addition, the tax on \n     expatriation could be deferred on interests in closely-held \n     businesses as provided in section 6166. The tax on \n     expatriation could also be extended for reversionary or \n     remainder interests in property as provided in section 6163. \n     Payment of tax liabilities could also be extended under \n     section 6159 to facilitate the collection of tax liabilities.\n     B. Method of providing security\n       If a taxpayer is required to provide security under this \n     section, it is anticipated that in many cases adequate \n     security could be provided by contributing assets to a trust \n     with a responsible U.S. trustee (see section 2056A). Other \n     mechanisms determined to be effective by the Secretary could \n     be used, such as providing a bond or letter of credit. If an \n     expatriating individual is a beneficiary of a trust, and the \n     beneficiary elects to defer payment of the tax on \n     expatriation with respect to the trust interest, a U.S. \n     trustee of that trust will be required to provide security if \n     the beneficiary provides actual notice of such requirement to \n     the domestic trustee.\n     [[Page S5447]]\n     \n     C. Exceptions for relinquishment of citizenship by certain \n         minors\n       The tax on expatriation would not apply to an individual \n     who resided in the United States under the substantial \n     presence test of section 7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) for less than five \n     years and relinquishes U.S. citizenship by the age of 18 \n     years and 6 months.\n     D. Ownership of interests in trusts\n       The ownership of any interest in a trust which is not \n     determined under the general facts and circumstances rule of \n     section 877A(f)(1)(A) will be allocated to the grantor if the \n     grantor is a beneficiary of the trust. Otherwise, the \n     ownership of the trust interest will be based on the rules of \n     intestate succession. Unless otherwise prescribed by the \n     Secretary, the applicable rules of intestate succession will \n     be the rules under the Uniform Probate Code as promulgated by \n     the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel.\n     E. Coordination with estate and gift tax rules\n       The tax on expatriation would be allowed as a credit \n     against U.S. estate or gift taxes to the extent that the \n     property subject to the tax on expatriation is subsequently \n     subject to additional U.S. estate or gift taxes solely by \n     reason of the estate or gift tax expatriation rules (sections \n     2107 and 2501(a)(3)).\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to introduce, along \nwith Senator Moynihan, a bill that a would close a tax loophole that \nallows wealthy citizens who renounce their American citizenships to \navoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes. As a member of the Finance \nCommittee, I offered a similar amendment to H.R. 831 that would have \nclosed this loophole. My amendment would have dedicated all of the \nsavings from closing this loophole to deficit reduction. According to \nestimates of the Joint Committee on Taxation, my amendment would have \nreduced the deficit by approximately $3.6 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Unfortunately, although the Finance Committee adopted this amendment \non an undivided voice vote and the Senate approved it as part of H.R. \n831, the joint House-Senate conference committee re-opened this \nloophole. The bill that we are introducing today would close this \nloophole once and for all.\n  Mr. President, this bill is fundamentally about fairness. Not only is \nit fair to those who enjoyed the benefits of U.S. citizenship to make \nbillions and are now attempting to avoid paying tax on such gain, it is \nalso fair to those Americans who stay behind to shoulder the burdens of \ncitizenship. All this bill would do is treat those who renounce their \ncitizenship on par with Americans who stay and pay their share of the \ntax burden.\n  While U.S. citizenship confers tremendous benefit, it also requires \nresponsibility. Although we may not always be happy about the amount, \nmost of us willingly pay our fair share of the tax burden. However, for \nmany Americans it becomes just too much when they have to pay not only \ntheir share of taxes, but also an additional share for those few, \nwealthy individuals who made their money in this country, but are now \ntrying to skip town without paying their portion of the tab.\n  Significantly, this bill would exclude pension income, real estate \nassets, and the first $600,000 in gain. As a result, of the roughly 850 \nU.S. citizens who renounced their citizenships in 1994, only a handful \nwould be effected by the elimination of this loophole. In fact, \nrepresentatives from the Treasury Department testified that provisions \nsimilar to those contained in this bill would affect only 24 Americans \neach year.\n  Mr. President, significant deficit reduction will be necessary to put \nour country back on the right track. However, until we close these \nspecial-interest tax loopholes for the few, we cannot ask for the \nshared sacrifice from the many that will be necessary to reduce the \ndeficit.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 701. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to limit \nthe interest deduction allowed corporations and to allow a deduction \nfor dividends paid by corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    the equity incentive act of 1995\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code to limit the interest deduction allowed \ncorporations and to allow a deduction for dividends paid by \ncorporations.\n  Our current system of taxation encourages American businesses to use \ndebt, rather than equity, to provide needed financing. My bill would \nencourage firms to shift from greater debt financing to more equity \nfinancing by limiting the interest deduction allowed corporations and \nallowing a deduction for dividends paid by corporations.\n  My proposal would be revenue neutral, although in the long run it \nshould add to revenue because it would help the economy.\n  I propose that, while 80 percent of interest payments remain \ndeductible, 20 percent of the interest payments of all but the smallest \ncorporations (including farm corporations) should be disallowed. And 50 \npercent of dividends should be deductible.\n  If a corporation borrows money to acquire another company or to buy \nequipment or for any other purpose, the interest on that debt is \ndeductible, even though the debt can--and often does--put the \ncorporation in a precarious position. But if the same corporation \nissues stock, and then pays dividends, there is no deduction. The tax \nlaws favor debt.\n  That same corporation, if it cannot meet the payments of principal \nand interest, will have to sell itself or go bankrupt, neither of which \nare desirable goals. But if that corporation issues stock, and there is \na downsizing in the economy, the only penalty the corporation must pay \nis that it cannot issue dividends. It can continue to thrive, employ \npeople, and be a productive part of our society.\n  Our tax laws have encouraged corporations and banks and law firms to \nmake ``the fast buck'', rather than take the slow, constructive steps \nthat are necessary to build their businesses and the economy of this \nNation. I favor tax laws that give corporations deductions for \nresearch, for creating jobs, for adding to the productivity of the \nNation.\n  My proposal would provide the incentive corporations need. It would \nencourage investment and help the growth of productivity. It would also \nhelp eliminate the excessive debt our country has accumulated, and it \nwould go a long way toward strengthening the economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, Mr. President. It \nmay need to be refined, but the idea is sound. I hope we can make it a \npart of the Tax Code.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 704. A bill to establish the Gambling Impact Study Commission; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               THE NATIONAL GAMBLING STUDY COMMISSION ACT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would establish an 18 month commission to review the impact \ngambling has had on State and local governments, and native American \ntribes. As these entities find themselves strapped for financial \nresources, many public officials and residents believe gambling can be \nan economic panacea.\n  Gambling is now one of the largest growth industries in the country. \nLegal wagering now totals almost $400 billion compared to $17.3 billion \nin 1974, according to the last--and only--national gambling study \nreleased in 1976 by the Commission on the Review of the National Policy \nToward Gambling.\n  Federal policy on gaming should not be a moral one, rather it should \nbe a practical one. Gambling is a matter of personal choice, and I have \nno problem with individuals who enjoy and are able to play the lottery \nor the slots. But I am concerned with the substantial costs to \nindividuals, families, and society. Legalized gambling can lead to \nproblem and pathological gambling, deterioration of family \nrelationships, lost work productivity, unpaid taxes, bankruptcies, \nhigher crime rates, and increased costs to the criminal justice system.\n  On the other hand, legalized gambling offers the promise of economic \ndevelopment, tourism, increased jobs and tax revenues, which is \nextremely appealing to State, local and tribal governments that compete \nwith one another for financial resources.\n  While State governments have primary responsibility for regulating \ngambling, the scope of gaming has broadened to a national level in \nrecent years. I am introducing the Gambling [[Page S5448]] Impact Study \nCommission Act to address these issues of national concern, so State, \nlocal and tribal governments can make fully informed decisions about \nfuture economic development investments.\n                                 ______\n\n\n             By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself and Mr. Brown):\n\n  S. 707. A bill to shift financial responsibility for providing \nwelfare assistance and medical care to welfare-related medicaid \nindividuals to the States in exchange for the Federal Government \nassuming financial responsibility for providing certain elderly low-\nincome individuals and nonelderly low-income disabled individuals with \nbenefits under the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act and long-term care benefits under a new Federal program \nestablished under title XIX of such act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the welfare and medicaid responsibility exchange act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a revision \nof the ``Welfare and Medicaid Responsibility Exchange Act of 1995'' \nwith my colleague Senator Brown. This legislation incorporates the \nchanges which I indicated would be forthcoming when we introduced the \n``swap'' legislation earlier this year.\n  The basic principle embodied in both this and the earlier proposal is \nthat true reform will occur only when there is a clear delineation of \nresponsibilities between the federal and state governments.\n  The legislation we are introducing today shifts to the states \nresponsibility for the nation's largest welfare programs--Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Food Program for \nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC), Food Stamps, and the AFDC portion of \nMedicaid. In exchange, the Federal Government will assume \nresponsibility for that portion of the Medicaid program designed to \nprovide acute care and long-term care to elderly and disabled \nAmericans.\n  Currently, the overlapping regulation and dual administration of the \nAFDC and Medicaid programs, in particular, has resulted in a \nsignificant lack of accountability. In contrast, this legislation makes \na clear-cut decision about who will run the welfare programs, who will \nfinance them, who will make key decisions, and who will be responsible \nfor the outcomes.\n  This legislation will allow both the States and the Federal \nGovernment to build a more cohesive safety net for the populations each \nsector is serving. At the end of a five-year transition period during \nwhich the States will be freed from the vast majority of restrictive \nFederal regulations, the States will have complete autonomy for \ndesigning welfare and medical programs for low-income individuals--\nwithout Federal mandates, but with their own money at stake.\n  The Federal Government will be able to improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Medicaid \nprogram--a program which now consumes 70 percent of Medicaid costs yet \nserves only 30 percent of the Medicaid population--by better \ncoordinating choronic care services for elderly and disabled Medicaid \nrecipients, by promoting competition, and by allowing these individuals \nto have a broader choice of private health plans. To reduce the \nreliance on Medicaid, the revised legislation also includes tax \nincentives for the purchase of private long-term-care insurance and \nlong-term care services, and standards for long-term care insurance. \nThese provisions are similar to those contained in legislation which \nwas introduced earlier this year by Senator Cohen.\n  I would like to highlight some of the other key components of this \nrevised swap legislation:\n  State responsibilities: As in the earlier swap legislation (S. 140), \nthe states will assume full costs for the AFDC, WIC, and Food Stamp \nprograms. In addition, however, the states also will assume \nresponsibility for providing health care for ``AFDC-related'' Medicaid \nrecipients (non-elderly and non-disabled individuals). This population \nrepresents about 30 percent of current Medicaid expenditures.\n  Federal responsibilities: Instead of assuming the full costs of the \nMedicaid program, under the revised legislation the federal government \nwill assume financial responsibility for the ``SSI-related Medicaid'' \nprogram (elderly and disabled individuals). This group represents the \nremaining 70 percent of Medicaid costs.\n  Five-year transition period: The revised legislation still contains a \nfive-year transition period during which states will have freedom to \ndesign low-income assistance programs and time to build the \ninfrastructure to support these programs. During this period, an \nindependent Commission will work with Congress to develop the specific \nprovisions of the federal Medicaid program for elderly and disabled \nindividuals. Also, the federal government will continue to provide \nfunding to states during this period so that no state will suffer \nsignificant losses of funding.\n  State maintenance-of-effort: During the transition period, the states \nmust spend the funds made available by the swap and any money \npreviously used as a state match for AFDC, food stamps, WIC, and AFDC-\nrelated Medicaid, to provide cash and non-cash assistance to low-income \nindividuals and families. Unlike S. 140, however, the states may direct \nup to 15 percent of these funds annually to savings or other uses.\n  Medicaid during the transition: Under the revised legislation, \nfederal Medicaid benefit and coverage requirements for children will be \nfrozen at 1995 levels during the transition. Beyond that, however, the \nstates will be given significant freedom to redesign the AFDC-related \nMedicaid program without applying for federal waivers.\n  At the end of the transition period: Under the revised legislation, \nCongress must determine at the end of five years whether to continue \nthis arrangement or, instead, to grant the states complete autonomy to \ndesign welfare and low-income medical care programs. If this complete \nswap goes into effect, states that experience a significant loss of \nfederal funds and have the greatest need for public services will be \neligible for a targeted grant program.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about returning substantial \nauthority, autonomy, and responsibility to state and local governments; \nif we are serious about rejecting the ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to \nincome support programs which has frustrated those who have sought \ninnovative solutions; and if we are serious about breaking the cycle of \ndependence that has frayed the current social welfare system; then I \nbelieve we must make systemic changes that will have a profound and \nlong-lasting impact on the way services are delivered to needy \nAmericans. We must cross the threshold from a Washington that simply \nshares power with the states to a Washington that actually surrenders \npower.\n  This legislation goes a long way toward achieving that goal. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in working toward its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 708. A bill to repeal section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the electric utility ratepayer act\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to repeal \nsection 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 \n(``PURPA'').\n  Section 210 of PURPA is no longer in the public interest. It is \ncosting consumers billions of dollars in higher electric bills. It is \ninterfering with the increasingly competitive wholesale market for \nelectricity. It has been overtaken by changes in energy policy, \nparticularly the transmission access and PUHCA reform provisions of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992. It is no longer needed to promote a once-\nfledgling independent power industry. In short, it is time to repeal \nsection 210 of PURPA.\n  Enacted in 1978, PURPA was one of several laws created by President \nCarter to address the energy crisis. All involved heavy government \ninterference in the marketplace; all but PURPA have since been \nrepealed.\n  PURPA was created to stimulate the construction of non-conventional \nelectric powerplants, referred to by PURPA as a qualifying facility \n[QF]. A QF can be a cogeneration powerplant of unlimited size, or a \nsmall power production facility of less than 80 megawatts. A \ncogeneration powerplant is a facility which produces heat along \n[[Page S5449]] with electric power. A small power production facility \nis as a renewable driven electric power generator, such as a windmill, \na biomass or waste-fueled powerplant, a geothermal generator, a solar \npower facility, or a hydroelectric dam.\n  Section 210 of PURPA encourages QFs in two ways. First it requires \nelectric utilities to purchase the power they produce--whether or not \nit is needed. Second, it requires electric utilities to pay an avoided \ncost price for the electricity purchased from the QF--which may or may \nnot bear any relationship to actual market price.\n  When PURPA was enacted, everyone thought that it would benefit \nprimarily unconventional power generating facilities, such as solar, \ngeothermal, wind, and waste. These were unproven technologies at the \ntime, and even with the host of benefits provided by PURPA plus tax \nincentives, it was not clear that they could ever be profitable. \nInstead, PURPA has primarily benefitted the more traditional turbine-\npowered cogenerators. According to data provided by the Edison Electric \nInstitute, more than three-fourths of installed QF generation capacity \nare cogenerators. Small power producers--solar, geothermal, wind and \nwaste--account for less than one-forth of installed QF generation \ncapacity.\n  PURPA was also enacted on the assumption that it would not increase \nthe price of electricity to consumers. Congress thought that it had \nguarded against this by limiting the price of QF electricity to the \navoided cost--the price that the electric utility would have incurred \nhad it generated the electricity itself or had it purchased it from \nsomeone else. But it did not work out that way. The Edison Electric \nInstitute estimates that nationwide PURPA will add $38 billion to the \nfuture price of electricity, calculated in net\n present value. This continues to occur for several reasons.\n\n  First, in many instances PURPA's avoided cost rate is being based on \nfuel price projections which often prove to be wildly wrong. Second, \nseveral States are setting the avoided cost rate above true avoided \ncost in order to encourage QFs. QFs are viewed as being socially \ndesirable, even if not the cheapest source of power. The FERC has \nrecently acknowledged that over the years it has given State public \nutility commissions wide latitude in implementing PURPA in order to \nmaximize the development of QFs. Third, environmental adders continue \nto be included in the avoided cost rate to promote certain types of QF \nfacilities. This further increases the price of QF power above true \navoided cost. Fourth, because PURPA requires QF power to be purchased \nwhether or not it is needed, utility-owned generation will continue to \nbe idled, which someone has to pay for. Thus, unless we repeal PURPA \nsection 210, this will continue for new QF contracts.\n  Mr. President, some will argue that section 210 ought to be retained \nbecause it fosters competition in the wholesale power marketplace, but \nthat is not true. The essence of competition is allowing choice, not \nmandating what must be purchased. Moreover, there are other key reasons \nwhy the wholesale electric power market has become competitive. They \ninclude the following: First, state public utility commissions have \nrequired their utilities to become more competitive. Second, Congress \nopened the wholesale market to all electric generators through \ntransmission access and PUHCA reform. Third, and most importantly, the \nmarket itself denies everyone the luxury of avoiding competition. Thus, \nthe repeal of PURPA section 210 will not adversely affect competition.\n  Mr. President, while everyone agrees that renewable energy can and \nshould play a role in the future energy mix, that should not be \naccomplished through PURPA's mandated purchase requirement. In this \nconnection, I might note that there are other programs on the books to \npromote renewables. For example, section 1212 of the Energy Policy Act \nof 1992 provides a renewable energy production incentive of 1.5 cents \nper kilowatt hour, subject to appropriations, for solar, wind, biomass, \nand geothermal powerplants. Section 1914 provides a tax credit of 1.5 \ncents per kilowatt hour for wind and closed-loop biomass. This is not \nsubject to appropriations. Section 1916 provides a permanent extension \nof the energy investment credit for solar and geothermal properties.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong believer in contract sanctity. The bill \nI am introducing does not abrogate existing contracts; they will \ncontinue to operate by their own terms. Section 4 of the bill \nspecifically states that ``Nothing in this Act abrogates any existing \ncontract.''\n  Mr. President, it is clear the time has come to repeal section 210 of \nPURPA. It is distorting competition and it is hurting consumers. It is \ntime to substitute the discipline of the marketplace for the judgment \nof regulators. In short, it is time for PURPA section 210 to go. I urge \nmay colleagues to join me in my efforts to update our energy policy to \nbenefit consumers and our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``The Electric Utility Ratepayer \n     Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress findings that--\n       (1) implementation of section 210 of the Public Utility \n     Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 results in many consumers \n     paying excessive rates for electricity;\n       (2) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 gives producers of \n     electricity additional access to the wholesale electric \n     market through transmission access and exemption from the \n     Public Utility Holding Company Act; and\n       (3) in light of the increasingly competitive wholesale \n     electric marketplace being brought about by the Energy Policy \n     Act of 1992, there no longer is any justification for section \n     210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL.\n\n       Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \n     of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3) is hereby repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRANSITION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act abrogates any existing contract.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this act are effective April 7, \n     1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 709.

Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Bryan, in \nintroducing the Consumer Reporting Reform Act of 1995. We have spent \nseveral sessions of Congress in perfecting this legislation, and I \nexpect this bill to enjoy wide bipartisan support. In particular, this \nlegislation balances the needs of the consumer to have accurate credit \ninformation, while ensuring that the credit industry provides such \ninformation without the imposition of unreasonable regulatory burdens.\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act is overdue for revision and reform. I \nknow that we have all heard too many horror stories about inaccurate \ncredit information and the inability of consumers to get the \ninformation corrected. The Fair Credit Reporting Act was written long \nbefore computer technology was as sophisticated as it is today. These \ntechnological advances have meant a drastic increase in the amount of \ninformation that can be kept and is kept on individuals. Current law \nsimply does not adequately protect consumers.\n  For example, currently the law only requires that credit bureaus \nreinvestigate within a reasonable period of time. It was not uncommon \nfor it to take months, even years, to get a credit report corrected and \ncleaned up. And even in cases where a consumer does succeed in getting \nthe incorrect information removed or corrected, there is nothing to \nprevent the incorrect information from being put back on the credit \nreport.\n  I believe that the single most important consumer protection \nprovision in this legislation is the 30-day limit on the \nreinvestigation procedure. If the disputed information cannot be \nverified or is found to be inaccurate within 30 days, then it is \ncorrected or removed from the credit report and cannot be reinserted \nwithout a notice to the consumer. [[Page S5450]] \n  This is the cornerstone of the legislation--the most significant \nimprovement over current law.\n  In addition, I realize that the credit bureaus have voluntarily \ninstituted a 30-day standard in recent years, but there is no force of \nlaw behind it to hold them to it. I congratulate the credit bureaus for \ntaking steps to make the system more accurate, but I feel that \nlegislation is still needed. It was the threat of this legislation that \nhas cleaned up the system, and I think we have an obligation to finish \nthe job. This legislation, in particular, will address concerns about \naccuracy in the system and the need for consumer privacy.\n  I emphasize that I have met with many of my constituents to listen to \ntheir horror stories of trying to fix mistakes on their credit reports. \nThey have met with many of the same obstacles that millions of other \nconsumers have faced--months of waiting for their credit reports to be \nfixed, credit grantors who are unresponsive, and no one to talk to who \nwill listen to their complaints. As you know, these problems are not \nnew. I have been hearing about these problems for years and trying to \nfind a way to address them. This legislation is designed to address \nthese problems.\n  Because it traditionally takes a long time for the credit bureaus to \nrespond and fix credit reports, the bill requires the process to be \ncompleted in 30 days. As I have said, if the information in the report \ncannot be verified by the creditor who submitted it within 30 days, it \nwill be removed from the report. In addition, it cannot be reinserted \nlater unless the consumer is notified.\n  When a consumer goes through the reinvestigation process with the \ncredit bureau and the problem is still not fixed, our bill gives the \nconsumer the right to sue the creditor who will not fix the information \nit submitted to the credit bureau.\n  This bill also contains limited Federal preemption to ensure that \nthere are uniform Federal standards to govern a number of procedural \nissues which are part of credit reporting and which will reduce the \nburdens on the credit industry from having to comply with a variety of \ndifferent State requirements. For example, the bill preempts \nrequirements regarding prescreening, information shared among \naffiliates, reinvestigation timetables, obsolescence time periods and \ncertain disclosure forms.\n  In addition, the civil liability section makes it absolutely clear \nthat there are only private causes of action against a furnisher after \nthat furnisher has had an opportunity to reinvestigate and fix any \nmistakes.\n  I believe that this legislation is a well-balanced bill. All \ninterested parties benefit from this bill. The free flow of accurate \ninformation will help all sides by promoting good economic decisions in \nour free market economy. Consumers get increased disclosure and a 30-\nday reinvestigation time period and the credit industry gets a limited \nFederal preemption, the ability to share information among affiliates, \nand broader prescreening abilities.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I join Senator Bond today in introducing \namendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I want to again express my \nappreciation for the efforts of Senator Bond. I have enjoyed teaming up \nwith him on a number of issues and look forward to continuing this \nfriendship and productive working relationship.\n  As those who follow this issue know, Senator Bond and I came \nextremely close to getting similar legislation enacted into law last \nCongress. Versions of this bill passed the Senate 87 to 10 and passed \nthe House of Representatives on several occasions. Unfortunately \nbecause this came up at the of the session, one Senator was able to \nblock this bill's enactment into law. I am confidant we can get this \nlegislation to the President's desk this year.\n  This legislation is similar to the version that passed the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives last year. Senator Bond and I have made some \nrefinements but the guts of the bill are intact.\n  The heart of this legislation is the investigation process which is \nundertaken when a consumer discovers a mistake on his or her credit \nreport. We all know that mistakes will occur when you are entering \nbillions of pieces of data in computer banks every month. That is \ninevitable.\n  What is not inevitable is the frustration consumers experience \ngetting these mistakes removed from their files. This bill requires \ncredit bureaus and the businesses which supply information to verify it \nwithin 30 days or remove it from a consumer's file. Thereby, the burden \nof proof is transferred from consumers to businesses to verify the \naccuracy of the information in a file.\n  I was struck by the testimony of Nevadans who were forced to jump \nthrough a serious of hoops to prove that the information in their file \nwas faulty. They spent countless hours on the telephone trying to track \ndown information and to explain to credit bureau representatives what \nmistakes have been made. Through no fault of their own, these people \nwere put through the ringer. This legislation should rectify this \nsituation.\n\n  The bill also brings businesses who furnish information into the \nregulatory process. Without such a provision, bad actors can wreak \nhavoc on the credit reporting system and on consumers. I would have \npreferred a higher standard of liability for these businesses but \nbelieve this is a good first step.\n\n  On this point, I must express my total disgust at the behavior of the \nJ.C. Penney Co. In my entire career of public service, I have never \nseen a more disingenuous lobbying effort by any organization, and I \nwill not soon forget it.\n  This legislation tries to craft a delicate balance on the issue of \nState preemption. Senator Bond and I are both former Governors so we \ntake States' rights very seriously. We have tried to only preempt those \nareas of this law which affect the operational efficiencies of \nbusinesses but do not harm consumers. Setting a national uniform \nstandard for disclosure forms or timetables, does not set the consumer \nmovement back, yet should help the business community operate more \nefficiently.\n  I would like to put everyone on notice that I feel very strongly that \nwe should not preempt States' rights in the area of liability--\nparticularly if we set a low-liability standard as we do in this bill. \nCertain members of the business community have and will continue to \npush to preempt this area of State law, but I will fight such efforts \nand will have to reconsider the merits of this bill, should I lose on \nthis issue.\n  I believe the issues in this bill have been compromised and refined \nover several years of consideration and do not need much more \nmassaging. They represent an equitable balance with benefits to both \nthe consumers and businesses. I hope we can move this along swiftly. I \nurge my colleagues support.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 710. A bill to promote interoperability in the evolving \ninformation infrastructure maximum competition, innovation, and \nconsumer choice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                Telecommunications Interoperability Act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, earlier this week I came to the floor of \nthe Senate to discuss my concerns relating to the pending \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, S.652. I \nhave been concerned that this bill does not do enough to promote \ncompetition and consumer choice. As we on Capitol Hill work to revamp \nthe regulatory regimes governing the telephone and cable television \ncompanies of today, a much larger dynamic is taking hold in our \ncountry.\n  The digital age is upon us, and we must try to take this larger \npicture into view if we are to be truly effective in our efforts to \npass telecommunications reform that will serve our country, not only \ntoday, but tomorrow, and for the years to come. We need to take this \nopportunity, not only to address the regulatory issues currently being \ndiscussed, but to think about what kind of world we want this digital \nage to create.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, the Communications \nInteroperability Act of 1995, that I hope will stimulate a vigorous \npublic debate on how we can best achieve a truly ubiquitous National \nInformation Superhighway. I am [[Page S5451]] introducing this bill as \na discussion vehicle, and welcome reactions or comments on this \nlegislation from interested parties.\n  The National Information Superhighway, or National Information \nInfrastructure (NII) as it is called, is evolving as we speak. This new \ndigital age brings with a convergence of technology and vast new \nopportunities for Americans to gather and disseminate information. This \nNII pays no mind to the lines between industry sectors that have \nexisted in the past. The NII is a conglomeration of pieces, including, \nvarious high-speed, interactive, narrow and broadband networks that \nexist today and will emerge tomorrow. It is the satellite, terrestrial, \nand wireless technologies that deliver content to homes, businesses, \nand other public and private institutions. The NII is a term that \nencompasses all the pieces and conveys a vision for a nationwide, \ninvisible, seamless, dynamic web of transmission mechanisms, \ninformation appliances, content and people. This\n ubiquitous network of networks has the potential to improve the \nquality of life for all Americans--regardless of location, age, \neconomic status, or physical handicap. However, this potential will \nonly be realized if we have interoperability in our information \ninfrastructure.\n\n  Interoperability is the ability of two or more systems to interact \nwith one another. Interoperability allows diverse systems made by \ndifferent vendors to communicate with each other so users do not have \nto make major adjustments to account for differences in products and \nservices. Open interfaces at critical points of connection will allow \ninteroperability to occur.\n  Interoperability will allow components of the NII to work together \neasily and transparently. A high school student in Nebraska will be \nable to use research resources located anywhere in the country, and \ndiscuss that research with students at distant schools. It will allow \nteachers in Nebraska to share information about experiences with other \nteachers around the country. If, while on vacation, a person becomes \nill, a doctor in another State will be able to easily reach the family \nphysician in Nebraska to consult and access complete medical records \nonline.\n  Interoperability will make the NII accessible to the broadest number \nof people--both users and vendors. Users will not be limited to a \nparticular vendor's products. Vendors will be able to make their \nservices available to anyone who wants to use them. A small business or \nentrepreneur in Nebraska will be able to fully realize their potential \nbecause from their home office they will have the ability to easily \nreach customers across the Nation and around the world.\n  Interoperability allows all Americans to be both information \nconsumers and information providers. This means that a citizen in \nLincoln, NE, will not only be able to access the vast amount of \ninformation using an information appliance of her choice, at the same \ntime, she will also be able to publish her newsletter on fishing in \nNebraska to interested readers wherever they reside.\n  Interoperability promotes competition among technologies, providers, \nand media, leading to the greatest number of choices, the lowest \nprices,\n and maximum innovation. Interoperability based on open interfaces, \nwill help promote a level playing field for the future of \ncommunications. Rather than attempting to create or adapt regulations \nto ever changing technologies, open interfaces, and interoperability \nwill help ensure access and competition by allowing new entrants into \nthe marketplace.\n\n  Interoperability must be led by industry, but Congress can help by \npromoting the vision of an interoperable information infrastructure. I \nam not suggesting that Government get involved setting standards or \ndictating what technologies the private sector should use. What I am \nsuggesting is that we all have an interest in monitoring the private \nsector process and facilitating the development of a system that will \nbest serve American business, and American citizens.\n  Without interoperability, we will simply have pockets of information \nand services that will not be nearly as valuable because they will not \nbe easily linked to other parts of the infrastructure. Interoperability \nwill allow information to be transmitted between different \ntechnologies, allowing for the most efficient distribution of services. \nIn some areas, wire lines or fiber optic cable may be dominant, while \nin other more rural areas we may need to rely on satellite and wireless \ntechnologies. Unless all these divergent parts of the system are \ninteroperable, the digital age will divide us into information haves \nand have nots. I am concerned about the potential for rural States like \nmine to be left behind as the digital age charges forward.\n  The distinguished Senator from Maine introduced legislation earlier \nthis week to promote competition and consumer choice in consumer \nelectronics used in conjunction with the current cable system. \nCertainly an important piece of the overall infrastructure, but as the \ndistinguished Senator pointed out in his introductory statement, this \nbill is only focused on one particular area of telecommunications. The \nlegislation I am introducing today focuses on the bigger picture, \nproviding a broader, over-arching vision for our digital information \nage.\n  By looking ahead, and providing some policy objectives we can use \nthis opportunity to address not only past and current regulatory \nissues, but\n to project some expectations for the future of communications. \nExpectations which include an information infrastructure that \nstrengthens our educational system, expands commerce, improves the \ndelivery of health care, and enhances participatory democracy.\n\n  I hope we will embrace this opportunity to herald the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Communications \n     Interoperability Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the rapid convergence of communications, computing and \n     video technologies holds the promise of bringing \n     revolutionary improvements in the delivery\n      of a variety of information and other communications \n     services to the American public;\n       (2) interoperability will promote competition among \n     technologies, providers, and media, leading to the greatest \n     choices, lowest prices, highest value, and maximum \n     innovation;\n       (3) interoperability at key interfaces of the developing \n     information infrastructure of the United States will ensure \n     that existing and new components work together easily, \n     quickly, and transparently as the components of today's \n     telephone system;\n       (4) interoperability will help ensure that the information \n     and communications infrastructure of the future will be \n     accessible to the broadest number of people, both users and \n     vendors of products and services;\n       (5) open interfaces at critical connection points are \n     essential to achieving interoperability and the smooth \n     transfer of information throughout the system; and\n       (6) the development of an interoperable information \n     infrastructure based on open interfaces is in the interest of \n     all Americans, and the Federal Government should act as a \n     facilitator to achieve this goal.\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       ``(1) Interoperability.--The term ``interoperability'' \n     means--\n       ``(A) the ability of two or more systems (such as devices, \n     databases, networks, or technologies) to interact in concert \n     with one another, in accordance with a prescribed method, to \n     achieve a predictable result;\n       ``(B) the ability of diverse systems made by different \n     vendors to communicate with each other so that users do not \n     have to make major adjustments to account for differences in \n     products or services; and\n       ``(C) compatibility among systems at specified levels of \n     interaction, including physical compatibility.\n       The compatibility described in subparagraph (C) should be \n     achieved through open interface specifications.\n       ``(2) Interface specifications.--The term ``interface \n     specifications'' means the technical parameters for the \n     manner in which systems, products, and services communicate \n     with each other and may be limited to the information \n     necessary to achieve interoperability, leaving the \n     implementation and remaining product design to the creative \n     abilities of competitive suppliers.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 32. Joint resolution expressing the concern of the Congress \nregarding certain recent remarks that unfairly and inaccurately \nmaligned the integrity of the Nation's law enforcement officers; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution expressing the Nation's gratitude to its law enforcement \nofficers, and ask that it be passed by unanimous consent.\n  Every day, the brave men and women of our Nation's police forces put \ntheir lives on the line as they patrol our streets to keep the rest of \nuse safe. These fine public servants are far too often all that stands \nbetween the rule of law and the tyranny of crime and chaos.\n  The job of a law enforcement officer is increasingly dangerous. \nAcross America, 70 law enforcement officers were murdered in the line \nof duty in 1993. Assaults on officers are commonplace. Yet these men \nand women go out every day and perform their jobs with courage and \nintegrity.\n  Attacks from criminals, however, are not the only assaults out law \nenforcement officers are suffering from today. They are also being \nvictimized by malicious, mean-spirited, and misleading verbal attacks \nfrom those who should know better.\n  Officers daily put their lives in jeopardy to prevent crime, and to \ninvestigate crimes that have been committed, in order to bring the \nguilty to justice. They are expected to act perfectly, with often \nimperfect information, and must ensure both the safety of the community \nand the integrity of the criminal justice process.\n  The Nation's police officers perform these tasks admirably. And On \nthose rare and regrettable occasions when they falter, it is the police \nwho are most aggrieved, seeking to redress the failure to uphold the \npublic's trust. They recognize that without that trust, they cannot \nenforce the laws.\n  So we must never forget the faith with which the police attempt to \ndischarge their duty. Whenever the public is led to believe without \ncause that their law enforcement officers are less than true to their \noaths ``to serve and protect,'' the rule of law is endangered. For any \nsociety in which the law is in disrepute, or its fair enforcement in \ndoubt, is only a shore step away from a society without law.\n  America owes a debt of gratitude to its police officers that it \nreally cannot repay. However, Congress can and should take this \nopportunity to acknowledge that debt, and express the American People's \nthanks for the continuing service of its law enforcement heroes.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \njoint resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I and Senator Hatch are introducing \na joint resolution to express the concern of the Congress regarding \nsome recent remarks that inaccurately malign the integrity of the \nNation's law enforcement officers.\n  It has been my privilege to work closely with our Nation's State and \nlocal police officers throughout my career. And, whether I have been \ndealing with officers who protect citizens in one of Delaware's \nsmallest towns or those who patrol our Nation's largest cities, I have \nbeen impressed by the level of honor, commitment and integrity they \nhave consistently upheld. Indeed, the evidence is that vast majority of \nour Nation's law enforcement officers are conscientious public servants \nwho have a job where they must literally be willing to lay their life \non the line everyday they go to work.\n  Let me be clear, I do not being to claim that there are no ``bad \napples'' among the Nation's 540,000 police officers--as in every \nprofession, there are ``bad apples'' who violate the law. But, this \ndoes not justify any sweeping indictment of the ethics of the entire \npolice profession, any more than a case of malpractice by a doctor \njustifies sweeping criticism of the entire medical profession.\n  Because I believe it is simply unfair to make allegations about a \nwhole profession based on the actions of a tiny minority and because I \nhave enjoyed such a close and, I hope, mutually respectful relationship \nwith our Nation's police officers, I am introducing this legislation so \nthat the Congress is on record as recognizing the integrity of our \nNation's police profession. I am happy to be joined by Senator Hatch on \nthis measure, and I look forward to other Senators joining us in this \neffort.\n  The morale of our Nation's police officers is dependent upon the \nrespect they feel from all of us, such is the case for any profession. \nThis resolution is but one of many chances the Senate will have this \nyear to indicate our confidence in our Nation's police. Later this \nyear, I expect that the Senate will be faced with legislation that will \nnullify the provisions of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 that \nwill add 100,000 more police to our streets. Those who believe that our \nNation's police do not live up to the highest ethical standards may \noppose this effort to add 100,000 officers to their ranks. But, those \nof us who know that the overwhelming majority of our police meet these \nhigh standards, must protect this effort to add 100,000 state and local \npolice to America's neighborhoods.\n  I admit that the resolution I introduce today offers but some small \nmeasure of rhetorical support. The real support for our Nation's police \nwill be shown by continuing our commitment to add 100,000 more officers \nto the ranks of those who protect us all. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

$45,000,000,000 during the \n     last 10 years in disaster assistance; and\n       (B) studies estimate that the cost for just 1 major future \n     natural disaster could run as high as $50,000,000,000 to \n     $80,000,000,000; and\n       (5) the Federal Government must reform the current method \n     of Federal financing costs associated with natural disaster \n     relief and develop and implement a financing mechanism that \n     does not add to the deficit or rescind funds that have \n     already been committed to other purposes.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should--\n       (1) establish a disaster relief fund financed through a \n     dedicated revenue source that provides\n      sufficient reserves to respond adequately to extraordinary \n     and catastrophic disasters;\n       (2) encourage sensible, cost-effective mitigation programs \n     to prevent disaster losses before the losses occur;\n       (3) strengthen efforts to encourage persons living in areas \n     at high risk of natural disaster to purchase private \n     insurance; and\n       (4) encourage the insurance industry to establish privately \n     funded pool to spread the risk of natural disasters and \n     minimize the [[Page S5479]] involvement of, and costs to, the \n     Federal taxpayer.\n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Mexican Debt Disclosure \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Mexico is an important neighbor and trading partner of \n     the United States;\n       (2) on January 31, 1995, the President approved a program \n     of assistance to Mexico, in the form of swap facilities and \n     securities guarantees in the amount of $20,000,000,000, using \n     the exchange stabilization fund;\n       (3) the program of assistance involves the participation of \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the \n     International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International \n     Settlements, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank of \n     Canada, and several Latin American countries;\n       (4) the involvement of the exchange stabilization fund and \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System means \n     that United States taxpayer funds will be used in the \n     assistance effort to Mexico;\n       (5) assistance provided by the International Monetary Fund, \n     the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \n     and the Inter-American Development Bank may require \n     additional United States contributions of taxpayer funds to \n     those entities;\n       (6) the immediate use of taxpayer funds and the potential \n     requirement for additional future United States contributions \n     of taxpayer funds necessitates congressional oversight of the \n     disbursement of funds; and\n       (7) the efficacy of the assistance to Mexico is contingent \n     on the pursuit of sound economic policy by the Government of \n     Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 403.

POLICY ON DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF THEATER \n                   MISSILE DEFENSES.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that advanced theater \n     missile defenses should be developed and deployed as soon as \n     possible in order to provide protection for United States \n     military forces stationed or deployed in foreign theaters of \n     operation and for allied forces participating in operations \n     with those United States military forces.\n\n     SEC. 203. POLICY ON USE OF FUNDS TO LIMIT THEATER MISSILE \n                   DEFENSES UNDER THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that a missile defense \n     system, system upgrade, or system component capable of \n     countering modern theater ballistic missiles has not been \n     tested in an ABM mode nor been given capabilities to counter \n     strategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, is not subject \n     to any application, limitation, or obligation under the ABM \n     Treaty unless and until such missile defense system, system \n     upgrade, or system component has been field tested against a \n     ballistic missile which, in that field test, exceeded (1) a \n     range of 3,500 kilometers, or (2) a velocity of 5 kilometers \n     per second.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Appropriated funds may not be obligated \n     or expended by any official of the Federal Government for the \n     purpose of--\n       (1) prescribing, enforcing, or implementing any executive \n     order, regulation, or policy that would apply the ABM Treaty, \n     or any limitation or obligation under such treaty, to \n     research, development, testing, or deployment of a theater \n     missile defense system, a theater missile defense system \n     upgrade, or a theater missile defense system component; or\n       (2) taking any other action to provide for the ABM Treaty, \n     or any limitation or obligation under such treaty, to be \n     applied to research, development, testing, or deployment of a \n     theater missile defense system, a theater missile defense \n     system upgrade, or a theater missile defense system \n     component.\n       (c) Covered Theater Missile Defenses.--(1) Except as \n     provided in paragraph (2), subsection (b) applies with \n     respect to each missile defense system, missile defense \n     system upgrade, and missile defense system component that is \n     capable of countering modern theater ballistic missiles.\n       (2) Subsection (b) ceases to apply with respect to a \n     missile defense system, missile defense system upgrade, or \n     missile defense system component when such system, system \n     upgrade, or system component has been field tested against a \n     ballistic missile which, in that test, exceeded (A) a range \n     of 3,500 kilometers, or (B) a velocity of 5 kilometers per \n     second.\n       (d) ABM Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term ``ABM \n     Treaty'' means the Treaty Between the United States and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, signed at Moscow on May 26, \n     1972, and includes to Protocol to that treaty, signed at \n     Moscow on July 3, 1974.\n\n     SEC. 204. ADDITIONAL COMMITMENT.\n\n       While the other provisions of this title specifically \n     address defenses to counter the growing threat of theater \n     ballistic missiles, Congress also hereby affirms its \n     commitment to ultimately provide the United States with the \n     capability to defend the people and territory of the United \n     States from attack by ballistic missiles.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today, in continuation of my long-\nstanding efforts--working with many others--in support of missile \ndefenses, to introduce the Theater Missile Defense Act of 1995. I am \nplease to have as original cosponsors of this legislation Senator Dole, \nSenator Thurmond, Senator Lott, Senator Cohen, Senator Nickles, Senator \nKyl, Senator Stevens, Senator Cochran, and Senator Smith.\n  Mr. President, few would argue with the compelling need we are facing \nfor defenses against the growing threat of attack from theater \nballistic missiles. Indeed, poll after poll has shown that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans believe that we already possess a \nhighly effective capability to defend forward-deployed troops--and \nindeed the United States--from ballistic missile attack today are only \nslightly better than they were during the gulf war.\n  Iraqi SCUD missile attacks during Desert Storm brought home to all \nAmericans the vulnerability of United States forward-deployed troops to \nshort-range--theater--ballistic missile attacks from third world \nnations. Although the Iraqi SCUD's were rudimentary, comparatively \ninexpensive, weapons which were not considered ``militarily \nsignificant,'' they wrought havoc on allied operations, alerts \ndisrupted the front lines as well as the rear echelons. And on February \n25, 1991, an Iraqi SCUD missile attack that struck a United States \nmilitary barracks in Saudi Arabia represented the largest single cause \nof American casualties during Desert Storm.\n  Currently, over 30 nations have short-range ballistic missiles. And \n77 nations have cruise missiles in their inventories. The defenses \nbeing developed to counter theater ballistic missiles will also \nincorporate some capabilities to counter cruise missiles. In addition, \nthe Department of Defense is actively pursuing a dedicated effort to \ndevelop defenses which are focused specifically on the growing curse \nmissile threat.\n  As the gulf war demonstrated, the threat such missiles pose to the \nmen and women of the U.S. Armed Forces is real, immediate, and growing. \nWe must accelerate the development and deployment of highly effective \ntheater missile defense systems to protect our troops. We owe it to the \nbrave men and women who serve in uniform to provide them with the most \nadvanced defense systems which we are technically and financially \ncapable of producing. Work on such defenses should not in any way be \nconstrained by restrictive and erroneous interpretations of the ABM \nTreaty--a 23-year-old treaty with the former Soviet Union. I would also \nlike to point out to my colleagues that the restrictions of the treaty \ncurrently hamper the defense efforts of only two countries--the United \nStates and Russia. To the extent we allow the U.S. to be ``handcuffed'' \nby the limits of this Treaty, the U.S. fails to utilize its full \nscientific potential while other nations are free to pursue their \ndefenses against ballistic missile attack unrestricted by this treaty.\n  Mr. President, the ABM Treaty was never intended to limit or restrict \ntheater missile defense systems. The administration concedes this \npoint. In addition, I have had the opportunity to discuss this issue \nrecently with two individuals who were intimately involved in the ABM \nTreaty negotiations, John Foster and former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger. They both agreed that defenses against theater missiles were \nnever contemplated during the ABM Treaty negotiations. According to \nSecretary Kissinger, the focus of the negotiations was on defenses \nagainst intercontinental ballistic missiles because, ``Those were the \nonly systems that were in existence.''\n  But, unfortunately, this administration is pursuing a policy--and is \nin the process of negotiating some type of legal obligation, or \n``demarcation agreement,'' with the Russians--that would allow ABM \nTreaty limitations to restrict our theater missile defense efforts. \nIndeed, an administration delegation headed by Deputy Secretary of \nState Strobe Talbott left last evening for Moscow to discuss a number \nof issues, possibly including the demarcation talks. I note that Deputy \nsecretary of Defense Deutch dropped off of this trip, in part because \nof concerns expressed by a number of Members of Congress that he \nintended to conclude a demarcation agreement wit the Russians while in \nMoscow.\n  I hope that the submission of this legislation today will send a \nclear and unequivocal signal to the administration, and particularly to \nthat delegation headed to Moscow, that the Senate will not sit idly by \nand allow the administration to sacrifice our theater missile defense \ncapabilities in the interest of concluding a deal with the Russians. I \nhope the Russians will come to the realization that they need \neffective, advanced theater missile defenses even more desperately than \nwe do. They are facing hostile nations on their borders which posses \nthese short-range ballistic missile systems. [[Page S5495]] \n  Mr. President, in the Missile Defense Act of 1991, the Congress urged \nthe President to pursue discussions with the parties to the ABM Treaty \nto clarify the demarcation line between theater missile defenses and \nantiballistic missile defenses for the purposes of the ABM Treaty. \nThose negotiations should have been undertaken for the sole purpose of \nmaking clear that theater missile defense systems were not limited by \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  Unfortunately, those negotiations are seriously off-track. Recently, \nI joined with a number of Senators in sending two letters to President \nClinton expressing our concern that the administration had indicated a \nwillingness to accept significant performance limitations on our \ntheater missile defense systems, and urging a suspension of those \nnegotiations. Despite these clear expressions of congressional concern, \nsubsequent meetings that I and other Republican Senators have had with \nhigh level administration officials in recent weeks have confirmed that \nthe administration is intent on concluding an agreement with the \nRussians that would limit the great technological potential of the \nUnited States to develop and deploy the most effective theater missile \ndefense system we can build. Who is willing to stand up and say we owe \nless to our armed forces?\n  In addition, it has become clear to be that the administration does \nnot contemplate submitting any such ``demarcation agreement'' to the \nSenate for advice and consent, as required by legislation which I \nsponsored to last year's Defense authorization bill. I am troubled that \nthe Senate will not be allowed a role in an international agreement \nthat will impose major new limitations and obligations on the United \nStates.\n  It is time for the Congress to act to ensure the development of the \nmost capable, cost-effective theater missile defense architecture to \nprotect our forward-deployed forces.\n  Therefore, I am submitting this amendment today, together with my \ncosponsors, to prohibit the obligation or expenditure of any funds by \nany official of the Federal Government for the purpose of applying the \nABM Treaty, or any limitation or obligation under that Treaty, to the \nresearch, development, testing or deployment of a theater missile \ndefense system, upgrade or component. The standard which we have used \nin this legislation to defined the demarcation between antiballistic \nmissile defenses which are limited by the ABM Treaty, and theater \nmissile defenses which are limited by the ABM Treaty, and theater \nmissile defenses which are not, is similar to the one used by the \nadministration at the beginning of the demarcation negotiations--that \nis, a missile defense system which is covered by the ABM Treaty is \ndefined as a missile defense system which has been field-tested against \na ballistic missile which, in that test, exceeded: First, a range of \nmore than 3,500 kilometers, or second a maximum velocity of more than 5 \nkilometers per second. Put simply, if a missile defense system has not \nfield-tested in an ABM mode--and therefore has not demonstrated a \nfield-tested capability to counter intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles--it should not be limited in any by the ABM Treaty.\n  In addition, this amendment declares that it is the policy of the \nUnited States that ``advanced theater missile defenses should be \ndeveloped and deployed as soon as possible in order to provide \nprotection for United States military forces deployed in foreign \ntheaters of operation and for allied forces participating in operations \nwith those United States forces.''\n  I don't know of anyone who would disagree with that goal. We should \nproceed expeditiously with this important mission, and remove the \n``handcuffs''' from our theater missile defense efforts. We should not \npermit the Russians to hold a veto over theater missile defense systems \nwhich are vitally needed by our armed forces.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear that this amendment, narrowly \ndrawn to the immediate issue of theater missile defenses, should in no \nway be interpreted as implying any lessening of the commitment of the \nco-sponsors to a national missile defense. Indeed, section 4 of the \namendment states that,\n\n       Congress also hereby affirms its commitment to ultimately \n     provide the United States with the capability to defend the \n     people and territory of the United States from attack by \n     ballistic missiles.\n\n  In this amendment we have dealt in more detail with theater missile \ndefense systems because it is those systems which are in a more \nadvanced stage of development, and which are currently being \njeopardized by limitations which the administration may soon sign up to \nwith the Russians.\n  We are also not attempting with this legislation to either reaffirm \nor reject the ABM Treaty.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit an amendment to \nS. 570 to create a defense export loan guarantee program at the \nDepartment of Defense. I am pleased that I am joined in this effort by \nthe distinguished Senator from Colorado, my friend, Hank Brown, and \nsenior and junior Senators from Connecticut, Senators Dodd and \nLieberman.\n  As many of my colleagues know, defense exports are currently \nprohibited from participating in Government financing systems available \nfor the exports of other nondefense products. My amendment would \neliminate this discriminatory treatment of legitimate defense exports \nwhile preserving all existing export controls. I want to be clear that \nmy colleagues understand this last point: My amendment deals only with \nlegitimate sales that are consistent with every existing export control \nand license requirement. My amendment also does not propose to sell \ndestabilizing weapons to dangerous [[Page S5497]] countries, but would \nonly support sales of defense articles to a select number of countries. \nIt would allow American defense companies and workers to compete on a \nlevel playing field for legitimate defense sales that promote our \nNational interests.\n  Since the height of the Reagan build up in 1985, the defense budget \nhas been declining every year. In particular, the Department of Defense \nhas reduced the procurement of weapons systems that our military \npersonnel use to defend our Nation's interests. As a result of these \ncuts in procurement, large parts of our defense industrial base are \nclosing their doors. Today, we have concerns about the ammunition \nindustrial base, the small arms industrial base, the shipbuilding \nindustrial base, the tank industrial base, and the helicopter \nindustrial base. As the defense committees look at the defense \nindustrial base, we know that we will need these manufacturing \ncapabilities in the future as we struggle to find ways to preserve \nthese assets.\n  One way we can help preserve this important industrial base is to \nallow defense companies to use export financing similar to that \navailable to every other exporter in the United States. And that is \nwhat my amendment would do.\n  The United States currently dominates the international arms market. \nIn my mind, our dominance in this market is a result of the superiority \nof our weapons, as demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm, and the \nsharp reduction in arms exports from the former Soviet Union. But we \nstill have strong competition in the international arms market. Today, \nAmerican defense exporters face stiff and increasing challenges from \nmany of our European allies who have access to Government-supported \nexport financing. American companies do not compete on a level playing \nfield and this may erode U.S. marketshare at precisely a time when our \nown modernization program is in budgetary jeopardy. This situation is \nwhat my amendment seeks to address.\n\n  My amendment would give the Secretary of Defense the discretion to \ncreate a self-financing program to extend Government-backed loan \nguarantees for the export of defense articles and services. The buyer \nor the seller would pay fee which would cover the Federal Government's \nexposure cost of the loans. The list of eligible countries would be \nlimited to NATO allies, major non-NATO allies, the emerging democratic \nstates in Central Europe and members of the Asian Pacific Economic \nCooperation [APEC]. Two years after enactment, my amendment calls for \nthe President to issue a report that assesses the costs and benefits of \nthe program and that recommends modifications.\n  Mr. President, my amendment has strong bipartisan support but I know \nsome Members of the Senate oppose this type of program. I am open to \nany suggestion for improving this amendment, but this amendment \nrepresents a solid start for addressing this issue. The important point \nis that our defense companies and workers, the men and women who won \nthe cold war for the United States, need our help to compete \neffectively on the international market. No one argues that defense \nexports alone will not make up for the effects of a 70-percent \nreduction in the defense procurement budget over the last 10 years. By \nproviding this exports loan guarantee authority, however, we have a \nchance to help preserve at least some of the most important segments of \nthe industrial base that our country will surely need in the future.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. \n1240, the Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995. H.R. \n1240 seeks to enhance prison time as well as fines for child \npornographers who use computers to trade in child pornography. I \nbelieve that this penalty enhancement is an important measure and the \nGrassley-Hatch-Thurmond amendment merely clarifies what the House \nintended to do in order to remove any possible confusion in the future.\n  Computers are now the preferred business forum for child \npornographers. Due to modern technology, predatory pedophiles sell, \npurchase and swap the most vile depictions of children engaged in the \nmost outrageous types of sexual conduct.\n  Simply put, child pornography on computers is dangerous and must be \nstopped. In the past, whenever, State or Federal law enforcement agents \narrested a child pornographer, or ring of child pornographers, they \nseized and then destroyed the child pornography. This kept child \npornography out of the hands of child molesters and preserved the \nprivacy of the children who had been so callously exploited. But now, \nbecause of digital computer technology, it is nearly impossible to \nactually destroy child pornography. That means there will be more child \npornography for child molesters and less privacy for abused children. \nWe in Congress must do something.\n  H.R. 1240 and the Grassley-Hatch-Thurmond amendment would discourage \nchild pornographers from using computers to trade in child pornography. \nAnd when the U.S. Sentencing Commission reports to us this fall on how \ncomputer child pornographers are being punished, I will take a close \nlook to see if there is anything the Senate can do to provide even more \nprotection to children.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Grassley \nand Thurmond in offering the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act \nof 1995.\n  Obsecenity is a plague upon the moral fabric of this great Nation. It \npoisons the minds and spirits of our youth and fuels the growth of \norganized crime. Child pornography, a particularly pernicious evil, is \nsomething that no civilized society can tolerate.\n  To this end, I am introducing legislation to increase the penalties \nimposed under sections 2251 and 2252 of title 18 of the United States \nCode, upon those who exploit and degrade the weakest and most helpless \nmembers of our society, our children. Those persons who choose to \nengage in sexual exploitation of children, whether to satisfy prurient \ndesire or to gain filthy lucre, must be made to feel the full weight of \nthe law and suffer a punishment commensurate with the seriousness of \ntheir offense.\n  In addition to increasing the penalties for distributing child \npornography or otherwise sexually exploiting children, I am pleased to \nnote that this legislation helps our law enforcement efforts in this \narea keep pace with changing technology by increasing the penalties for \nthe use of computers in connection with the distribution of \n[[Page S5510]] child pornography. As an ever-increasing percentage of \nAmericans, and especially our young people, enter the information \nsuperhighway, it is critical that we act to ensure that this highway is \nnot littered with the debris of child pornography.\n  The bill also directs the Sentencing Commission to assess the impact \nof these increased penalties and to report to Congress any necessary \nmodifications in the law. The Sentencing Commission will also be \nrequired to survey the recidivism rates for those who commit sex crimes \nagainst children and analyze the effect of treatment for those \noffenders.\n  I commend my colleagues from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and South \nCarolina, Senator Thurmond, for joining me in introducing this bill. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5509-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n           Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, one of the more thoughtful observers \nof the political scene through the years has been Melvin Brooks, now \nretired as a professor at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.\n  Recently, he had an op ed piece in the Southern Illinoisan, a \nnewspaper published in Carbondale, IL.\n  He discusses the practical obstacles to balancing the budget and why \nit is important to the future of our country.\n  His concluding paragraph says it all: ``Failure to balance Federal \nbudgets without such an amendment appear almost certain and dreadful \nconsequences of failure to pay as we go are virtually certain. Few \npeople seem to realize how many shattering consequences are almost \ninevitable.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Melvin Brooks op ed piece be reprinted \nin the Record.\n  The piece follows:\n\n                     [From the Southern Illinoisan]\n\n                 Many Obstacles to Balancing of Budget\n\n                           (By Melvin Brooks)\n\n       The obstacles to balancing the federal budget are indeed \n     formidable, some believe too formidable to overcome.\n       One key obstacle is the behavior of members of Congress, \n     presidents, other politicians, and special interests seeking \n     to influence national policies. Most members of Congress want \n     to be re-elected, have good mental ability and are \n     politically knowledgeable. They know (or at least think they \n     know) how to obtain enough votes to get re-elected.\n       One way is to tell voters what they like to hear regardless \n     of logical inconsistency, and by all means avoid disagreeing \n     with the favorite prejudices of their constituents. This they \n     do.\n       It seems like increasing majorities of candidates for \n     Congress criticize big government and promise to make large \n     reductions in government, reduce taxes, balance the federal \n     budget, yet prevent any reductions in Social Security or in \n     military expenditures in order to keep the United States \n     strong.\n       This is, of course, an impossible combination and they know \n     it. Yet they also know that if they omit some of these \n     promises, opponents who make all of them are likely to obtain \n     more votes.\n       They also know that if they support the policies desired by \n     special interests, especially those strong in their districts \n     or states, they are likely to receive campaign contributions \n     which otherwise would probably be given to an \n     opponent. [[Page S5511]] \n       And the more money a candidate has the more he can spend on \n     television and thus increase his chances of winning. The \n     temptation to play along with special interest groups is \n     great, even though it will tend to increase national \n     deficits.\n       The other huge obstacle to reducing federal deficits is the \n     apparently high percentage of the public that is not well-\n     informed about federal financial problems and/or are easily \n     influenced by political propaganda. That includes people who \n     pay little attention to what elected officials do from day to \n     day until near election dates and then do their duty by \n     listening to an occasional campaign speech and short (but \n     expensive) political commercials.\n       They do not realize that the records of politicians are a \n     far more reliable indication of what a politician will do in \n     the future than are sounding promises. And people who fail to \n     vote because ``all politicians are dishonest'' or ``my vote \n     won't make any difference'' make it easier for the candidate \n     with the most to spend to get elected.\n       Of course the special interest groups which spend large \n     sums on campaign contributions (in effect a form of bribery) \n     and seek costly special privileges from the government, are a \n     very important cause of our inability to eliminate deficits. \n     As long as they can prevent passage of comprehensive campaign \n     finance reforms such as those narrowly defeated by the \n     Republicans and some moderate Democrats a year or two ago, \n     expect little change.\n       Other causes of budget deficits are the failure of our \n     educational system and the mass media to educate the public \n     better concerning basic political functioning.\n       Can politicians who get elected to high office really be \n     blamed for our dangerously high and still growing national \n     debt of nearly five trillion dollars? After all, every one of \n     them was elected by more votes than those who were defeated.\n       My answer is yes. Either most or many of them at times put \n     their personal interests, the interests of their party and/or \n     the interests of their key supporters ahead of the long-run \n     best interests of the United States.\n       Let me illustrate with the issue of the extremely narrow \n     defeat of the proposed balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       Leading Democrats charge that Congress can balance the \n     budget any time there is the will to do it. They claim that \n     whenever the Republicans present a concrete plan showing the \n     cuts they propose to achieve a balanced budget, then the \n     Democrats will negotiate with them to achieve a balanced \n     budget.\n       The Democrats know that the Republicans will not, probably \n     cannot, do this. The president is still smarting over the way \n     Republicans and Mountain State Democrats defeated his \n     proposal to charge reasonable prices for logging, mining and \n     grazing rights on federal forest land.\n       Many liberal Democrats feared that if the amendment were \n     adopted, Republicans might succeed in raiding Social Security \n     funds so extensively that the system would be bankrupted when \n     the baby boom generation retired. There are very good \n     arguments against both of these extreme positions.\n       A reasonable compromise would be an excellent solution but \n     was not seriously considered by either side. Apparently many \n     Republicans and Democrats alike feared that the amendment \n     could force them to make very difficult decisions which might \n     jeopardize retaining their positions in Congress.\n       Right-wing Republicans favor policies which could easily \n     result in a bigger gap between the rich and the poor and even \n     larger deficits as happened between 1981 and 1994.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nman and a great head coach: Jud Heathcote of the Michigan State \nSpartans. After this season ends, players and fans of college \nbasketball at Michigan State will have to learn to live without the \ninstitution that is Jud Heathcote. He will be sorely missed.\n  Jud Heathcote's 340 wins in 19 seasons at MSU make him State's all-\ntime winningest coach. Jud passed the previous mark of 232 in February \n1990. His teams hold the first through seventh-highest victory totals \non MSU's all-time single-season list. To top it off, Coach Heathcote's \nSpartans won the NCAA championship in 1979 and won the Big Ten in 1978, \n1979, and 1990.\n  As he retires, Jud, his wife Beverly, and their children Jerry, \nCarla, and Barbara can look back on a long-running, successful career. \nJud capped off a very successful tenure as Head Coach at the University \nof Montana by serving as assistant coach of the U.S. Pan American team \nin 1975--a team which brought back the Gold Medal. Beginning at MSU in \n1976, Coach Heathcote became Big Ten Coach of the Year by the 1977-78 \nseason. He repeated this performance in 1985-85 and went on to become \nthe National Association of Basketball Coaches [NABC] Coach of the Year \nin 1989-90 and College Sports Magazines's Coach of the Year in 1994-95.\n  Noted for his special expertise in coaching defense, Jud also \nproduced at MSU a team that this year led the Big Ten in field goal \npercentage, and was ranked seventh nationally. His dedication to the \ngame, his concern with the well-being of the players and the integrity \nof the MSU program and his personal warmth and decency all make him a \ncoach for all seasons.\n  We will miss Coach Heathcote, but are grateful for his many \ncontributions to basketball, MSU and Michigan, and wish him all the \nbest in his retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5511-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, on April 22, 1995, many special \nguests from the Netherlands and this Nation will gather at the Wang \nCenter in Boston to celebrate the permanent endowment of Young at Arts, \nthe Wang Center's educational outreach program, with special \nrecognition to Dr. Maurice Vanderpol for his enthusiasm and outstanding \nleadership in this effort.\n  In 1989 Dr. Vanderpol established the Walter Suskind Memorial Fund in \nmemory of Water Suskind, whose courage saved the lives of hundreds of \nchildren from Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. The \nfund was established as a permanent endowment for Young at Arts. This \nprogram teaches a curriculum in the arts to young children around \nBoston--possibly some of whom are the grandchildren of those Walter \nSuskind saved 60 years ago.\n  Due to Dr. Vanderpol's tireless effort over the past 6 years, the \ncampaign to raise $1 million for the endowment was successful. This \nsuccess, along with Dr. Vanderpol's exemplary leadership and \nextraordinary support in keeping alive the memories and the dreams of a \npeople brutalized by the horrors of war, is why I wish to recognize Dr. \nMaurice Vanderpol on this day.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5511-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5511-S5512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  FAREWELL TO BISHOP LOUIS HENRY FORD\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, Bishop Louis Henry Ford died \nlast Friday, after many years of service to his church, and to the \npeople of Chicago.\n  Bishop Ford was the presiding International Bishop of the Church of \nGod in Christ, and the spiritual leader to over eight million people, \nas well as the founder and pastor of the St. Paul Church of God in \nChrist in Chicago.\n  Louis Henry Ford arrived in Chicago in 1933, after graduating from \nSaints College in Mississippi, and was soon ordained an Elder in the \nChurch of God in Christ. Three years later he founded St. Pauls and \nembarked on his long career of saving souls and strengthening the \ncommunity around him through religion. It is through his efforts that \nthe membership of Church of God in Christ has risen to 8.7 million \nparishioners in 52 different countries, and is now the largest \nPentecostal Church in the United States.\n  Indeed, Bishop Ford's involvement in the community was much more than \njust religious. He served many years on the Cook County Board of \nCorrections and often was called upon to consult with the city \ngovernment, especially on Chicago schools and race relations issues. He \nwas respected as a leader in the civil rights movement, and he \ncontinued that tradition as he rose to leadership in the Church of God \nin Christ. Throughout the years Bishop Ford has been given numerous \nhonors and awards, including the declaration of October 25th, 1990, as \nLouis Henry Ford Day in Chicago. Indeed, his work was recognized by \nPresident Clinton in 1993, when he addressed the 86th Annual Holy \nConvocation.\n  Bishop Louis Henry Ford was a well-loved and important member of our \ncommunity. he spent his life helping [[Page S5512]] people through the \nchurch. My greatest sympathy is with his wife Mother Margaret Ford, and \nhis children Charles H.M. Ford and Janet Oliver Hill, and all his \nfamily members.\n  It is clear that Bishop Ford's legacy in the church will continue to \nhelp inspire people, and strengthen the community he loved long into \nthe future. Bishop Ford will be greatly missed, but never \nforgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5511-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    BISHOP'S VIEWS ON WELFARE REFORM\n\n Mr MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Howard J. Hubbard, Bishop of \nAlbany, recently presented his views on welfare reform in the diocesan \nnewspaper, the Evangelist. The bishop served for 4 years as chaplain at \nCommunity Maternity Services, a diocesan program for pregnant teens and \ntheir children, so his statement is based on practical experience. \nHaving worked with many welfare mothers at CMS, he refers to a number \nof them by name in his reflections. Bishop Hubbard has been in the \ntrenches, as they say, so I believe my colleagues would do well to \nexamine his views on the subject.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Bishop Hubbard's column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The column follows:\n\n          His Experiences Give Bishop Ideas on Welfare Reform\n\n                     (By Bishop Howard J. Hubbard)\n\n       The present debate over welfare reform is very complex. \n     Most everyone agrees that the current system isn't working. \n     There seems to be a consensus as well that a major focus of \n     attention must be the growing number of women, especially \n     teenagers, having children out of wedlock.\n       Teenage pregnancy is a national crisis. Teens and their \n     children are in danger of failing to develop to their full \n     potential; and too often, they become dependent, rather than \n     contributing, members of society. Adolescents who have \n     children are still children themselves.\n       In the past decade, teen pregnancy in particular and child \n     care in general have become key elements of our national \n     agenda. Teenage sexual activity and childbearing have \n     increased in recent years, and a growing proportion of births \n     to teenagers takes place outside of marriage:\n       In 1989, more than one million U.S. babies were born to \n     unwed women;\n       Almost 350,000 of those babies were born to women under the \n     age of 20;\n       Nearly three-fourths of American children growing up in \n     single-parent families experience poverty for some period \n     during their first ten years;\n       Becoming a parent as a teenager increases the chances that \n     a mother will not complete high school, that she will fare \n     poorly in the job market, and that she and her children will \n     live in poverty.\n                          thought and emotions\n\n       On the rational level, policymakers are seeking to address \n     the aspects of the welfare system which foster dependency and \n     contribute to a permanent underclass where lack of family \n     stability, child abuse, drug usage and inferior education \n     perpetuate the vicious cycle of poverty.\n       On the emotional level, however, there is the cry of \n     frustrated citizens who feel that they are bearing the brunt \n     of a system out of control.\n       That mentality--which is so often heard on the talk shows \n     or reflected in letters to the editor--was captured in \n     caricature form by Saundra Smokes in her Jan. 29 column in \n     the Albany Times Union: ``Get those baby-making, lazy welfare \n     mothers out of here and let them take their school-lunch-\n     eating, government-dependent children with them. Put them in \n     orphanages, put them anywhere, just get them out of here.''\n\n\n                           meeting the women\n\n       As one who served as chaplain for four years at Community \n     Maternity Services (CMS), our diocesan program for pregnant \n     teens and their newborn children, I think it is important to \n     get beyond the stereotypes. Then we can reflect carefully \n     upon who these women are and what motivates their behavior \n     before arriving at solutions. Let me share a few snapshots of \n     the young women I came to know at CMS:\n       Sharelle was in a series of foster homes (her mother was 15 \n     when she had Sharelle) and is now living on her own with her \n     infant son. She dropped out of school, and her only hope is \n     to meet someone who will support them.\n       Gail represents the young girls who had abortions in the \n     past year. She made no plans for future sexual overtures and \n     carried within her a gnawing need to bring the baby back. \n     Pregnant again a year later, she thought maybe this was God's \n     way of letting her repent. She thought her penance was to be \n     a perfect mother to this child.\n       Tammi was an unpopular and unattractive teen who was \n     unhappy with herself. She would respond to any attention from \n     any of the young men of her acquaintance. She felt terribly \n     lonely the morning after.\n       Amy, almost 16, has been dating Joe, 18, for a year Amy's \n     parents have not talked to her about sexuality; much of what \n     she has learned has come from afternoon soaps. By the time \n     Amy and Joe had promised each other it wouldn't happen again, \n     she was pregnant.\n       Cheryl was active in CYO, played her guitar at Mass and was \n     the pride of her family. She fell madly in love with Tom. \n     They occasionally agreed to intercourse because ``love gives \n     all'' and because ``maybe virginity is selfish.'' She prayed \n     that soon she would be able to talk her boyfriend out of \n     this; but before she could, she was pregnant.\n       While those young women come from a variety of economic and \n     social backgrounds, they all show the same characteristics: \n     lack of self-esteem, poor and no communication with parents, \n     and a desire to escape their present situation by pursuing \n     the type of happiness and fulfillment that MTV or the soaps \n     promise.\n\n\n                               solutions\n\n       There is no simple or single solution to their situations. \n     Each woman differs in terms of specific barriers she faces \n     and resources she should have available to promote her self-\n     sufficiency and to guide her to social and economic \n     independence.\n       But, based upon my years of experience with these young \n     women and so many others in similar straits, as well as \n     documented research, I believe that any program of welfare \n     reform designed to address their needs constructively must \n     take into account several factors:\n       1. Welfare programs are not among the primary reasons for \n     the rising number of out-of-wedlock births.\n       Greg Duncan and Jean Yeung, in a comprehensive report \n     titled ``The Extent and Consequence of Welfare Dependents,'' \n     conclude that ``most research examining the effects of higher \n     welfare benefit levels on out-of-wedlock childbearing finds \n     that benefit levels have no significant effect on the \n     likelihood that black women and girls will have children \n     outside of marriage, and no significant effect, or only a \n     small effect, on the likelihood that whites will have such \n     births. We strongly urge the rejection of any proposal that \n     would eliminate the safety net for poor children born outside \n     of marriage. Such policies do more harm than good.''\n       In the short term, that means that more, not less, in \n     assistance may be the appropriate and most effective approach \n     in dealing with these women.\n       2. Policies and programs of intervention with mothers and \n     their children must be cognizant of and sensitive to the \n     unique circumstance and diverse needs each faces.\n       For example, there is a difference between the 19-year-old \n     who has two years of college credits and needs some \n     assistance in caring for her one-year-old son as she seeks \n     employment or job training, and the 17-year-old who is a high \n     school dropout and who has a learning disability as does her \n     two-year-old child.\n       Therefore, public policies and programs to assist single-\n     parent mothers must be tailored to fit specific needs, and \n     will require appropriate goals and realistic individualized \n     time frames for achieving such.\n       3. The major goal in working with pregnant women, \n     especially adolescents, is to educate for the purpose of \n     reducing teen pregnancies, and to facilitate movement to \n     maturity, independence and non-repetitive behavior (which \n     would include personal support, daycare and adoption options, \n     etc.).\n       Those goals can best be accomplished, through building \n     parenting skills, connecting families with resources in the \n     communities where they live, and promoting a partnership with \n     parents for the full and healthy development of their \n     children.\n       4. Quality, affordable and accessible daycare and health \n     care as well as ongoing education or job training are \n     prerequisites for success.\n       5. There must be a strong moral component in any program \n     for single mothers as well as a values-laden dimension which \n     promotes marriage, family life, caring, truth-telling, the \n     goodness of sexuality, and the importance of its discipline \n     and the value of schooling and work.\n       6. There must be a pragmatic component which addresses \n     handling finances, child care, house management, cooking, \n     shopping, responsible decision-making and personal \n     relationships.\n       7. Where possible, birth fathers must be part of the \n     program, which should include a focus on their rights and \n     responsibilities, especially their responsibility for \n     supporting their child, at a minimum financially.\n\n\n                             church's role\n\n       For all this is work, there cannot be hidden agendas on the \n     part of government, families, social agencies and the \n     teenagers involved. Rather, there must be a forthright \n     presentation of issues and interactive responses that are \n     proactive.\n       The Church--through the efforts of Catholic Charities--\n     stands ready to participate in such a program of welfare \n     reform. To do less is to try to address a complex and multi-\n     casusal problem by settling for a massive and unwieldy system \n     that, in the long run, falls painfully short of its \n     goals.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5512-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5512-S5513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nFrank AuCoin, South Carolina's small-business person of the year for \n1995. He is owner and president of Sign It Quick, a computerized sign-\nmaking company based in Charleston.\n  Success has not simply knocked on the door for Frank. He has done it \nthe old fashion way--by working hard. He is a self-made businessman \nwhose sign-making chain now boasts nine franchises in South Carolina, \nFlorida, and Tennessee. The chain generated nearly $4 million in sales \njust last year.\n  While Frank and his wife, Teresa, were operating a chain of \nbookstores in South Carolina and Georgia in the early 1970's, they \nrealized the potential of the sign-making business when they could not \nget their signs made quickly enough. So they started making their own. \nBy the late 1980's when the technology became available to generate \ncomputer-aided signs, Frank realized that he could start a business to \ncreate and mass-produce signs easily. In 1987, Frank and his wife \ninvested their life savings into the concept of a computer-generated \nsign-making company and Sign It Quick was born.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Frank AuCoin's many \nsuccesses as a small businessman. When he opened his first store he \ncreated the world's largest sign--one that was the length of five \nfootball fields. Since then, he has created signs for two Super Bowls, \nthe Hard Rock Cafe chain, Euro-Disney, and Donald Trump.\n  Recently, the Post and Courier in my hometown of Charleston, reported \nthat Frank was South Carolina's small-business person of the year. Now \nhe is competing for the national honor from the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration this month.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues as a cosponsor of this amendment to S. 570, to create a \ndefense export loan guarantee program. I believe the loan guarantee \nprogram will be critical to preserving our defense industrial base and \nis, therefore, an investment in America's long-term security.\n  In the post-cold war period, the United States has rightly reduced \nits procurement of expensive weapons systems. This has resulted in cost \nsavings to the U.S. Treasury, but it has undermined the financial \nsecurity of many of the manufacturers. We have encouraged conversion of \nsome of the defense industry into production of other products. \nHowever, in the long run, we cannot afford to have all defense \nmanufacturers convert to nondefense production. Even if the world's \ncurrent trouble spots do not erupt into conflict, prompting another \nround of rearmament, the U.S. military must maintain an up-to-date \ninventory of the world's most capable equipment. To do that, we must \npreserve a minimum threshold of defense production, lest we face either \nastronomical startup costs or the disappearance of one or more critical \ndefense producers altogether. Current U.S. defense procurement is not \nsufficient to keep some of these industries going; we must help them in \ntheir own efforts to export abroad.\n  I commend the administration for its recent review of arms export \npolicy. That review concluded with the President's decision to preserve \nthe current policy to discourage arms proliferation but to take into \naccount as well U.S. domestic economic considerations in reaching a \ndecision on applications for arms export licenses. I do not propose to \nchange that policy in any respect.\n  While we do not want to make arms export licenses any more freely \navailable than they are under current policy, I believe we should do \nmore to level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers once an export \nlicense has been approved. U.S. defense industries face extremely tough \ncompetition for arms exports in the current international environment. \nNot only the United States, but also most of Western Europe have cut \ndefense spending and military procurement budgets. In this shrinking \nmarket, U.S. defense manufacturers must compete against European and \nCanadian manufacturers who benefit from the extensive support--in some \ncases, including subsidies--of their governments.\n  Buyers have the advantage in the current, competitive international \narms market. Having the best product, track record\n and support network is often not enough to win a competition. In many \ncases, one must also provide financing for the sale. At present, the \nonly source of financing for U.S. weapons systems exports are \ncommercial banks, whose loan rates often make the price for U.S. \nweapons exports uncompetitive. French, German, British, Italian and \nCanadian defense manufacturers can get government-subsidized or \nguaranteed loans for weapons exports. These governments are prepared to \npay [[Page S5514]] a high price to preserve their defense industries \nand keep jobs at home.\n\n  In my own State of Connecticut, Norden, a corporation which produces \nadvanced electronic systems for military vehicles, was forced to move \nsome of its production to Canada in order to qualify for the Canadian \nexport loan program essential to Norden's winning a contract for an \nexport sale. Seventy-two Norden workers in Connecticut lost their jobs, \ngood, skilled jobs, as a result. And they are not alone; defense \nindustry workers in Rhode Island, Colorado and elsewhere have had their \njobs exported for similar reasons.\n  In the current tight budgetary environment, we cannot afford a new \nsubsidy for the defense industry, but neither can we afford to export \nhighly-skilled, good-paying jobs abroad in order to keep our defense \nindustries alive. This draft legislation fits within those constraints. \nIn many ways, it could serve as a model for the 104th Congress. It is \nnot foreign aid and does not require appropriated funds, yet it \nleverages the credit of the United States to help a sector of America's \nmanufacturing and high-technology industry compete in the world market. \nThis program is entirely self-financing; exporters and buyers together \nwould provide money to cover the exposure fees and administrative costs \nassociated with each loan. Furthermore, this program could not be used \nby poor countries to purchase arms they can ill afford; it would only \nbe available to NATO allies, Central European countries moving toward \ndemocracy and members of the organization for Asia Pacific Economic \nCooperation. Although limited in scope and requiring financial \ncontributions from participating corporations, this program would be \nsignificant for U.S. defense manufacturers. A similar program operated \nby the State of California since 1985 has produced a steadily growing \nbusiness in exports of defense equipment to Germany, the Netherlands, \nSpain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand at a consistent 1-percent \ndefault rate. By supporting economic competitiveness at very modest \ncost to the U.S. Treasury, this program could be a model for the 104th \nCongress.\n  Although I am persuaded that this program will make a significant \ncontribution to U.S. defense manufacturers' competitiveness, I would \nlike to see proof. That is why we have included in the legislation the \nrequirement for a report from the administration on the program's \nimpact after 2 years. It if does not prove to be constructive \ncontribution to the viability of the defense industry that I expect it \nto be, it should be ended. However, I expect the administration will \nreport that this program has made a big difference in keeping these \nindustries in production and keeping good jobs at home. I invite my \ncolleagues to join us in working for adoption of this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5513-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5514-S5516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      URUGUAY ROUND AGREEMENTS ACT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, following the approval of the \nUruguay Round implementing legislation, statements have been placed in \nthe Congressional Record providing individual interpretations of the \nantidumping and countervailing duty provisions contained in title II of \nthat Act. As one who was also deeply involved in the development and \npassage of that legislation, I, of course, respect the right to make \nthose statements, but I would like to offer some further clarification.\n  Initially, it is important to emphasize that it is the statutory \nlanguage that Congress enacted which must guide the implementation and \ninterpretation of this legislation by the International Trade \nCommission, the Department of Commerce and their reviewing courts. To \nthe extent that the statutory language is considered ambiguous, it is \nthe Statement of Administrative Action, as well as the Senate and House \ncommittee reports--not the statements of individual Senators--which \nprovide the primary sources of interpretation of H.R. 5110.\n  Given the representations that have been made, I also believe that it \nis important to provide the following clarification with respect to \nspecific aspects of the antidumping and countervailing duty provisions \ncontained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act H.R. 5110.\n  International Trade Commission's determination of injury and threat. \nSeveral statements have addressed the Commission's implementation of \nH.R. 5110: Captive Production. I am the author of the Senate provision \ndealing with situations in which a captive production consideration \nshould be used. Section 222 of H.R. 5110 was adopted to make clear to \nthe Commission that, in certain captive production situations, it \nshould consider primarily the data relating to competition in the \nmerchant market, rather than data for the industry as a whole. Despite \nthis language and clearly expressed legislative intent, it has been \nsuggested that the Commission should continue to base its conclusions \non an analysis of the industry as a whole, rather than of the merchant \nmarket. This suggestion is clearly contrary to the explicit language of \nsection 222, as well as the intent expressed in the Statement of \nAdministrative Action and the House and Senate committee reports.\n  Statements have also been made indicating that the Commission should \napply the same criteria used in evaluating the domestic like product to \nevaluate whether it is appropriate to focus on noncaptive imports. \nThese statements are also inconsistent with the plain language of \nsection 222, which contains no restriction or direction as to how the \nCommission should analyze imports, whether captive or not. While there \nmay be circumstances under which captive imports should be analyzed in \na similar manner as captive domestic production, this should only be \ndone after the Commission determines that captive imports do not \ncompete with the relevant domestic like product--as was made explicitly \nclear in the implementing legislation that I authored.\n  Negligible Imports. It also has been suggested that the Commission \nmust terminate an investigation unless import levels are found to be \nvery close to the statutory negligibility threshold at the time of the \npreliminary determination and above that threshold at the time of the \nfinal determination. This suggestion is contrary to the unambiguous \nstatutory language, which provides that the Commission may treat such \nimports as non-negligible in the threat context whenever it determines \nthat there is a potential for such imports to increase to non-\nnegligible levels. Thus, the Commission is under no obligation, and \nindeed would be acting contrary to the statute, to automatically \nterminate an investigation merely because imports are below the \nstatutory negligibility threshold at the time of either the preliminary \nor final investigations. This is particularly true given that, as the \nCommission's practice and section 222 recognize, the filing of a \npetition may itself have a dampening effect on import levels. As a \nresult, it is expected that the Commission will consider the \nnegligibility provision carefully and that it will only find imports to \nbe negligible in the context of threat where there is no potential for \nan imminent increase in imports.\n\n\n                           anticircumvention\n\n  Statements have been made suggesting that section 230 of H.R. 5110 \nshould be interpreted to limit Commerce's ability to apply the \nanticircumvention provisions and that, before Commerce enlarges the \nscope of an order, the Commission may be required to make an additional \ninjury finding regarding that enlarged scope.\n  These statements, however, are contrary to the statute and the \nStatement of Administrative Action. As explained in the Statement of \nAdministrative Action, this amendment was adopted because the former \nstatute failed to provide a full or adequate remedy for the \ncircumvention occurring in the marketplace. As a result, section 230 \nclearly provides Commerce with broad discretion in its application of \nthe anticircumvention provisions, so that it can address the different \ntypes of\n circumvention encountered. Further, neither the statute nor the \nStatement of Administration Action require the Commission to issue a \nnew injury determination before Commerce enlarges the scope of an \norder, although the two agencies will engage in consultations before \nCommerce makes its final determination.\n\n\n                             SUNSET REVIEWS\n\n  Several statements have been made with respect to different aspects \nof Commerce's and the Commission's application of the new sunset \nprovisions, [[Page S5515]] particularly with respect to short supply, \nthe extension of orders and duty absorption.\n  Short Supply. Both the House Committee on Ways and Means and the \nSenate Committee on Finance affirmatively rejected so-called short \nsupply proposals during consideration of the Uruguay Round implementing \nlegislation. Statements have been made, however, suggesting that the \nCommission and Commerce should use their authority under the sunset \nprovisions to revoke orders where merchandise is not available from \ndomestic sources. Further, it has been suggested that the Commission \nshould find no adverse impact from imports where petitioning companies \nare not producing a competing product.\n  The newly adopted sunset provisions require both Commerce and the \nCommission to consider a multitude of factors in determining whether \norders will be revoked. Consequently, it is expected that the \nCommission will continue to consider all aspects of this issue in \nreaching a final determination. Given that the lack of current domestic \nproduction may oftentimes be a symptom of the injury sought to be \nremedied, that factor in particular does not alone warrant revocation, \neven with respect to the product for which there is a lack of \nproduction. Finally, the Commission is expected to continue to consider \nall domestic production in its analysis, not just the production of the \npetitioning companies alone.\n  Extension of Orders. It also has been suggested that the sunset \nreview provisions create a presumption against the extension of orders. \nThis is, however, inconsistent with both the statute and the Statement \nof Administrative Action, which create no such presumption. Nor, as \nsome statements have suggested, is the substantial evidence standard \nappropriate for all sunset reviews; where responses have not been filed \nor are inadequate, Commerce's and the Commission's final determinations \nare, by the express terms of the implementing legislation, reviewable \nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard, and not the substantial \nevidence standard.\n  Duty Absorption. Pursuant to section 221 of the Uruguay Round \nlegislation, Commerce and the Commission are authorized to consider the \nissue of duty absorption in the course of their sunset reviews. Some \nstatements have suggested incorrectly, however, that (1) Commerce may \nnot quantify the level of duty absorption or initiate a duty absorption \ninvestigation without evidence that duty absorption is occurring, and \n(2) the Commission must give less weight to duty absorption findings \nbased on best information available.\n  None of these issues are addressed by the statute. While Commerce is \nnot expressly required to quantify the level of duty absorption, it \nobviously retains the authority to do so and it is expected that \nCommerce will quantify duty absorption where circumstances so warrant. \nGiven the difficulty in obtaining information on duty absorption, the \nStatement of Administrative Action makes it clear that Commerce must \ninitiate a duty absorption review whenever it is requested to do so; \nthus, there is no additional evidentiary hurdle prior to initiation. \nFinally, the Commission is required to consider the issue of duty \nabsorption whenever Commerce has made a duty absorption finding. It is \nwithin the Commission's discretion, however, to determine the weight to \nbe given to this issue, including the significance of a respondent's \nfailure to cooperate with Commerce's investigation and Commerce's use \nof best information available. There is simply no basis for the \nsuggestion that less weight be given to Commerce's findings when they \nare based on best information available. In fact, such a requirement \nwould create a significant incentive for foreign companies not to \ncooperate with Commerce so that best information available would be \nused and the Commission would give less weight to the issue of duty \nabsorption. Clearly this is not what Congress or the statute intended.\n\n\n                   CALCULATION OF ANTIDUMPING DUTIES\n\n  Several statements have also been made regarding specific aspects of \nCommerce's calculation of antidumping duties, as addressed below.\n  Fair comparison/normal value adjustments. Pursuant to Section 224 of \nthe implementing legislation, Commerce is required to make a fair \ncomparison between export price and normal value. Statements have been \nmade, however, suggesting that this provision generally requires \nCommerce to adjust normal value and export price (or constructed export \nprice) for the same costs and\n expenses and to make either a level of trade adjustment or a \nconstructed export price offset adjustment to normal value whenever \nconstructed export price is used.\n\n  This is not, however, what the statute or Statement of Administrative \nAction requires. Although expenses may be nominally the same in both \nmarkets, the actual circumstances surrounding the relationship between \nsuch expenses and claimed adjustments often differ. As a result, \nCommerce clearly has the authority to treat expenses differently in the \nU.S. and foreign markets. In fact, Commerce is expected to continue its \npractice of closely assessing all potential adjustments on a case-by-\ncase basis and not mechanically making adjustments without an analysis \nof the circumstances involved.\n  Moreover, there is no requirement for Commerce to make a level of \ntrade or offset adjustment in every case. Indeed, the express language \nof the statute and Statement of Administrative Action indicate that \nthere are circumstances where neither adjustment is appropriate or \npermissible. For example, Commerce may only make a level of trade \nadjustment where there are different levels of trade and where that \ndifference is shown to affect price comparability. Commerce's analysis \nof these issues must be based on the actual circumstances involved.\n  Constructed export price profit deduction. Section 223 of H.R. 5110 \nprovides for the deduction of profit from constructed export price. It, \nhowever, has been incorrectly suggested that this provision only \nauthorizes Commerce to base its calculation on data for the subject \nmerchandise in the U.S. and foreign markets.\n  While the statute and Statement of Administrative Action indicate \nthat the use of data specific to the costs of the subject merchandise \nis appropriate, they also allow for the use of alternative \nmethodologies when full cost of production information is not on the \nrecord. In particular, it is expected that, if the necessary profit \ndata for the subject merchandise is unavailable, Commerce will use the \nnext broader category of merchandise to calculate this deduction.\n  Startup costs. Section 224 of the implementing legislation governs \nCommerce's treatment of start-up operations. In considering the \ncircumstances surrounding start-up operations, Commerce should apply \nthis provision strictly to prevent foreign producers from using it as a \nloophole to evade the application of antidumping duties in the early \nstages of a product's life-cycle. In particular, Commerce should \ncarefully review the claimed duration of start-up periods so that they \nare not improperly expanded.\n  Export price and constructed export price definitions. Renaming \n``purchase price'' to ``export price'' and ``exporter's sales price'' \nto ``constructed export price'' should not affect the ``criteria'' used \nto categorize U.S. sales as one or the other. The Statement of \nAdministrative Action indicates that ``no change is intended in the \ncircumstances'' under which a sale would be characterized as one or the \nother. Commerce continues to retain the authority to alter or augment \nthe particular factors that it considers in making its determinations.\n  Reimbursement of antidumping duties. In the antidumping duty context, \nCommerce will increase the amount of antidumping duties when it finds \nthat the exporter has reimbursed the importer for payment of such \nduties. Although there has been no change in the law, statements have \nbeen made suggesting that Commerce is expected not to treat reimbursed \ncountervailing duties the same way that it treats reimbursed \nantidumping duties.\n  There is no such expectation. The Senate report language, written \nwith the acquiescence of the administration, states that Commerce \nshould promulgate a regulation to make an adjustment to U.S. price in \nantidumping cases for the amount of any countervailing duty which is \nreimbursed by the exporter to the importer. Since [[Page S5516]] this \nreimbursement represents a reduction in price to the importer, the \nregulation suggested by the Senate report language is clearly an \nappropriate and equitable way to address the reimbursement of \ncountervailing duties.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5514-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 58--PROVIDING FOR ADJOURNMENT OF THE TWO \n                           HOUSES OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, the District of Columbia's financial \nsituation is in a state of crisis. The District government does not \nhave sufficient funds to pay its bills which threatens the continued \ndelivery of services to the residents of the District of Columbia and \nthe many Americans that work in or visit our nation's capital.\n  I am pleased that we were able to reach agreement earlier today with \nthe House on a package of amendments that we believe will improve the \nHouse-passed bill and enable the Senate to pass this important \nlegislation before the Congress adjourns for the April recess.\n  The bill establishes the District of Columbia Financial \nResponsibility and Management Assistance Authority to aid the city in \nachieving financial stability while still preserving Home Rule. The \nconcept of a financial control board is not new. A number of U.S. \ncities facing fiscal crisis have established similar boards.\n  The new Authority will work with the Mayor and the Council toward \nresolving the city's financial and management problems. The Authority \nwill have the power to act, following consultation with congress, on \nrecommendations it believes are necessary to ensure the financial \nstability and operational efficiency of the District.\n  I want to commend Congressman Davis and D.C. Delegate Norton, the \nChair and Ranking Minority Member of the House D.C. Subcommittee, and \nCongressman Walsh and Congressman Dixon, Chair and Ranking Minority \nMember of the House D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, who have worked \nhard to craft a bill which received strong bipartisan support in the \nHouse. The financial recovery of the nation's capital is important to \nall Americans and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move \nexpeditiously to pass this important legislation .\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the financial crisis which requires the \ndramatic action we are taking today began sometime ago. I am not \ncertain anyone can pick a particular date it began, but certainly it \nhas been at least a decade since the signs of fiscal distress have been \nshowing. Of all of the economic indicators, perhaps the most alarming \nis the continued loss of taxpayers. The District has lost nearly 50,000 \npeople since 1985.\n  Five years ago, the Commission on Budget and Financial Priorities of \nthe District of Columbia, known as the Rivlin Commission, warned that,\n\n       The District of Columbia confronts an immediate fiscal \n     crisis. The budget deficit for this fiscal year will be at \n     least $90 million and will rise to at least $200 million in \n     1991 and $700 million in 1996 if actions are not taken \n     quickly to reduce spending or raise revenue or both.\n\n  Congress responded to that warning and immediately passed a $100 \nmillion supplemental appropriation for the District in early 1991. \nCongress went on to increase the Federal payment and authorized the \nDistrict to borrow $330 million to stabilize the local budget. Federal \nfunds to the District increased nearly 30 percent between 1991 and this \nfiscal year. In all, the District has received a cash infusion of over \n$1 billion since 1991.\n  Revenues were increased but spending was not reduced. Between 1985 \nand 1994, general fund tax revenues increased by 61 percent. But \nexpenditures increased by 87 percent. Now the trickle of red ink has \nturned into a raging river. Unfortunately, and despite our efforts, the \nRivlin warning is about to come true.\n  Along with the fiscal crisis, the District appears to be locked in a \nperpetual management crisis as well. The city has been buffeted from \none scandal to the next turmoil. The city's infrastructure is decaying. \nCrime, taxes, and schools continue to drive families out of the \nDistrict. [[Page S5517]] \n  During the entire time of this gathering storm, the Congress has time \nand again deferred to the local government to take corrective action. \nAll opportunity have been afforded to the locally elected officials to \navert the very action we are taking today. While there is no need to \nrecite the history of this sad course of events we know all too well, \nit is sufficient to state for the Record that congressional warnings of \nintervention have been unmistakable.\n  The sweeping changes we are introducing into the current local \nstructure must now be given every opportunity to succeed. The District \nof Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance \nAuthority must have all of the powers it needs to restore the \nconfidence of everyone concerned for the well-being of the Nation's \nCapital. I do have serious concerns as to whether the legislation is \nsufficiently clear in this regard and will raise those concerns with my \ncolleagues.\n  Let me say is closing, today's action is not a victory of one \npolitical idea over another. Today's action is being taken because the \npath leading to it is littered with failure. We cannot fail the people \nof this City and the many people who visit it each year. I support the \npassage of H.R. 1345.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Nation's Capital is in financial \ntrouble. This bill provides the mechanism to restore the city to fiscal \nhealth, but make no mistake the responsibility for acting rests \nsquarely on the shoulders of the elected leaders of the District of \nColumbia. This Authority has the tools to get the job done, but the \nDistrict government has the responsibility and accountability to act.\n  This bill is not perfect. There are things that I would change, I am \nsure most Senators feel that way, however on balance it has the \nessentials to get the job started and deserves our support. The \namendments proposed make improvements and clarifications, and I \nencourage our House colleagues to accept these changes and send the \nbill on to the President so that the Authority can begin its work.\n  There is a financial crisis in the city, we should not delay action \nand send the message to the citizens of the city, to the financial \nmarkets, and to the District government that the Congress does not \nconsider this crisis worthy of our immediate attention.\n  Every Senator who has worked on this bill, and indeed probably every \nSenator in this body, wants to preserve home rule for the citizens of \nthis city. Other cities have gotten into financial difficulty and their \nstates established a financial control board which for a time assisted \nthe city government in managing its fiscal affairs. But there are \nimportant features of those state statutes that are also part of this \nbill which preserves to the local citizens the right, and \nresponsibility, to make difficult decisions. These features include \nprovision for reduction of the Authority's powers upon certain events, \nprincipally achieving balanced budgets during 4 consecutive years. In \nshort, there is a clear definable end to this intrusion on the city's \nsway over its fiscal matters, this bill preserves home rule.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Senators Cohen and Roth for \nbringing this bill to the Senate for consideration. They and their \nstaffs have worked tirelessly to make sure that this bill reached this \npoint today. In the long-term this bill will make a positive difference \nto the citizens of the District.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the chairman of the subcommittee with \njursidiction over District affairs, about one aspect of this \nlegislation in particular. I have been concerned that the bill does not \nmake clear our intent that the District of Columbia Financial \nResponsibility and Management Assistance Authority will have sufficient \nauthority to ensure that its recommendations are adopted. I have \nthought that such authority should be expressly stated in the statute, \nin order to leave no ambiguity about our purpose in enacting section \n207. This authority is too important to the underlying purpose of the \nlegislation to leave at all in doubt, which I am concerned it may be. \nIs it the Senator's belief that the intention of Congress is \nsufficiently clear, nonetheless, that the Authority may implement any \nrecommendations it has made to the Mayor or Council, but which were \nrejected?\n  Mr. COHEN. The full scope of the authority's power to implement its \nrejected recommendations is well stated in the House report that \naccompanied the legislation. First of all, any non-response to a \nrecommended action is deemed a rejection under the act. Likewise, if \nthe District government does respond that it will adopt the \nrecommendation, but then fails to do so to the satisfaction of the \nAuthority, this shall be considered the same as if it had originally \nrejected the recommendation under section 207.\n  Mr. ROTH. The language of this section provides that in such a case, \n``the authority may by a majority vote of its members take such action \nconcerning the recommendations as it deems appropriate''. From reading \nthe House report, I believe it is clear that this is very broad power, \nincluding the ability to enact local laws and ordinances, provided \nthere is a period of congressional review of such legislation, as in \nthe case of an act of the D.C. Council. Is this your understanding of \nthat section's intent?\n  Mr. COHEN. Yes it is. Any recommendation made by the authority to the \nDistrict government which either the Mayor or the Council has the \nauthority to adopt, may itself be adopted by the Financial \nResponsibility and Management Assistance Authority, if rejected as I \ndescribed previously, and if the authority first consults with the \nSenate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and Oversight. This includes the authority to enact \nlocal legislation, which would go into effect after a congressional \nreview period, under the same conditions as if it had been enacted by \nthe District government itself. It also includes such matters as \npersonnel actions and structural reforms to the District government. It \nis clearly the intent of this section to give the authority as broad a \nrange of legislative, executive, and administrative powers as the Mayor \nand Council possess, while expecting that the District government will \nbe given the opportunity to act first.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As chairman of the District of Columbia Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I too have been closely involved in the development of \nthis legislation, and I can say that the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] \nhas in his description accurately reflected my understanding of the \neffect of section 207.\n  Mr. ROTH. Is this also the understanding in the other body?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] and I met with \nthe chairman of the House Subcommittee on the District of Columbia and \nthe District's congressional delegate to discuss this legislation, and \nboth of them agreed that the language in the House report accurately \nreflects the scope of authority being granted this new entity, which we \nare here creating.\n  Mr. COHEN. I believe it is correct to say that the drafters of this \nlegislation, in both Houses of Congress, understand that the authority \nis to have the full authority to adopt any recommendation that it deems \nappropriate, as submitted under this section of the act, if the \nDistrict itself does not adopt such a recommendation, subject to the \nconditions that I have already mentioned.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank my two colleagues for their explanations and for \nclarifying this important matter.\n  I have one other point. We are today adopting several useful \nmodifications to this legislation, but I have other improvements that I \nwould have liked to have seen added. I know that my colleagues are \naware of these provisions that I think are important, and I hope that \nin the near future we will be able to make those improvements to this \nlaw.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I can assure the Senator that I will work with him to \nenact those provisions as soon as is feasible.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank my friend for his support as I know the has a \nstrong interest in making this legislation work. I know that we all \nhave a great concern for our Nation's Capital, and especially for the \ncitizens who live and work here, and that we look forward to the day \nwhen the actions taken under legislation are no longer necessary.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the District of Columbia is facing \nthe most serious financial crisis in its [[Page S5518]] history. The \nDistrict made a number of major mistakes and bears a major portion of \nthe responsibility for the current debacle, however, the Federal \nGovernment also played an important part in creating this emergency \nbecause of its refusal to give the District the kind of home rule \npowers enjoyed by all 50 states.\n  Unlike every State from Alaska to Wyoming, the District does not have \nthe right to full self-governance. Our country was founded on the \nprincipal of no taxation without representation, but the Federal \nGovernment denies the District this right. The notion that 600,000 \nAmerican citizens are denied their fair voice in Congress offends the \ncore principles of representative democracy on which this republic was \nfounded.\n  Residents of the District, unlike residents across the bridge in \nArlington, Virginia, or residents of any other city in America, are not \nable to make basic decisions regarding their available resources. As \nthe District is unable to control its resources, it faces this fiscal \ncrisis, which Congress must step in to solve. The immediate solution to \nthe problem the District faces lies in the bill before us today.\n  I reluctantly support the legislation before us today, only because \nit is a step towards bringing the District out of this financial \nemergency. Congress can not allow the District of Columbia to go \nbankrupt while we go on vacation. We have an obligation to assist the \nresidents of the District of Columbia get its fiscal house in order. \nUnlike other cities, the District has no State to protect its \ninterests, so Congress must act as a State would and help solve the \nfiscal problems that it has helped create.\n  There is no question that the District has mismanaged its finances, \nhowever, truth be told the District does not have the tools to deal \nwith its problems. The District can not do what States do. The District \ncan not truly receive revenue from its entire tax base because at least \n\\1/3\\ of the land mass in the District of Columbia is non-taxable \nbecause it is owned by the Federal Government. Furthermore, the \nDistrict of Columbia is unable to tax the wages of those who earn their \nliving in the District but who reside elsewhere. Without the power to \nfully tax, the District fell into the fiscal crisis it faces today.\n  Because Congress is partially responsible for the District's fiscal \nproblems, it should act quickly to avoid the District's further \neconomic decline. That is why Congress should support H.R. 1345, which, \nquite literally, saves the city. It allows the District, which is now \ninsolvent, to borrow and avoid payless paydays and the shut down of \ncity services. It allows the city to stretch out its huge deficit in \norder to protect its citizens.\n  Other cities have gotten into trouble and the legislation before us \ntoday is not unlike what we have previously encountered. The major \ndifference is that the District is not a State. States have the ability \nto step in and help avoid fiscal problems within its cities. Since the \nDistrict has not been granted Statehood, Congress must step in at this \npoint to establish this control board.\n  This bill establishing the D.C. control board has particular elements \nof the Philadelphia and the New York City boards. These great American \ncities worked constructively and fruitfully with similar authorities \nwithout any evidence that their monitors had somehow made them less \nself-governing. The boards in those cities did not have to use their \nstrong powers because the elected city officials did what was necessary \nthemselves to revive their own cities and I expect no less in the \nDistrict.\n  As important as it is to save the city, however, I will not support a \nD.C. control board that undermines the autonomy of the District. That \nis why I am glad that the type of control board being proposed in this \nlegislation has been used by a number of other major cities in the \nUnited States, such as New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland, which no \none has suggested did not remain fully self-governing.\n  To address the city's projected $722 million shortfall, H.R. 1345 \nestablishes the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and \nManagement Assistance Authority. The Authority's five members will be \nappointed by the President, in consultation with Congress. The members \nwill be responsible for managing the District's finances until the \nDistrict balances four budgets in a row.\n  The bill authorizes the District's Chief Financial Officer to prepare \nthe financial plan and budget for the District and implement programs \nand policies for budgetary control. The bill also establishes an \nInspector General for the District, who will make an independent \nassessment of budget assumptions and report those findings to the \nboard.\n  This bill allows the Mayor to retain his budgetary and operational \nauthority and the Council to retain its lawmaking powers. However, the \nBoard is responsible for monitoring these activities to ensure that the \ncity is not acting inconsistent with fiscal prudence.\n  I would hope that we can act today to pass this legislation in an \neffort to ensure that the District's fiscal crisis will be on its way \nto recovery when Congress reconvenes. But the truth be told, the real \nlong term solution is not control boards and less home rule; the real \nlong term solution is the expansion of the District's autonomy, \nincreasing home rule. The citizens of the District of Columbia deserve \nto have full democratic privileges like all other United States \ncitizens enjoy.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 593) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, the Pittston Coal Group has brought a civil \nlawsuit against the United Mine Workers of America alleging that the \nunion breached an agreement by supporting provisions enacted in the \nCoal Act of 1992. The coal company has subpoenaed a former employee on \nSenator Rockefeller's staff to testify at a deposition as part of its \neffort to develop its case about enactment of the Coal Act. The \nplaintiff wishes to ask the employee about two documents appearing to \nbe from Senator Rockefeller's office relating to enactment of the Coal \nAct. Senator Rockefeller is concerned that questioning of a former \nSenate employee about her Senate employment will abridge legislative \nprivilege.\n  This resolution would authorize the former employee to testify only \nabout matters that do not trigger privilege concerns and would \nauthorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Rockefeller, \nthe former employee, and any other Member or employee of the Senate \nfrom whom testimony or documents may be sought, in order to protect the \nSenate's privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on a agreeing to the \nresolution.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 108) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n       Whereas July 16, 1995, is the 50th anniversary of the first \n     detonation of an atomic bomb at Alamagordo, New Mexico;\n       Whereas the members of the Armed Forces who have been \n     exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of the detonation \n     of a nuclear weapon or device are considered to be America's \n     ``atomic veterans'';\n       Whereas atomic veterans are in many ways one of the most \n     neglected groups of United States veterans;\n       Whereas atomic veterans served their country patriotically \n     and proudly, believing fully that the United States \n     Government would protect them from any serious hazards to \n     their health;\n       Whereas atomic veterans were not told of the hazards they \n     faced from exposure to ionizing radiation, often were \n     provided with little protection from such exposure even when \n     deployed at or near ground zero immediately after test \n     detonations of nuclear weapons, on occasion were not provided \n     film badges to measure their exposure to radiation during \n     such detonations, and were provided with no follow-up medical \n     care or other monitoring to determine the health consequences \n     of such exposure;\n       Whereas for 40 years after World War II Federal law \n     contained no provisions specifically providing veterans \n     compensation or health care for atomic veterans for service-\n     connected radiogenic diseases; and\n       Whereas many of the 250,000 members of the Armed Forces who \n     participated in post-World War II atmospheric nuclear testing \n     were forbidden from publicly revealing such participation for \n     reasons of national security and received no recognition for \n     their important contributions to the United States and the \n     Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) July 16, 1995, is designated as ``National Atomic \n     Veterans Day''; and\n       (2) the President is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling on the departments and agencies of the \n     Federal Government, State and local governments, and the \n     people of the United States to observe that day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was pleased to submit today, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Simon, Jeffords, Daschle, Pryor, Rockefeller, \nAkaka, Reid, and Leahy, a Senate resolution to designate July 16, 1995, \nthe 50th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic bomb at \nAlamagordo, NM, as ``National Atomic Veterans Day.''\n  Atomic veterans, members of the armed forces who were exposed to \nionizing radiation as a result of the detonation of a nuclear weapon or \ndevice, for 50 years have been one of the most neglected groups of \nveterans. While they served their country patriotically, \nunquestioningly, and proudly, they were not informed of the dangers \nthey faced from exposure to ionizing radiation, often were provided \nwith little or no protection from such exposure, and for many years \nwere provided with no follow-up medical monitoring or care to determine \nthe health effects of their exposure. In fact, for 40 years after World \nWar II, there were no provisions in Federal law specifically providing \nveterans compensation or health care for atomic veterans for service-\nconnected radiogenic diseases.\n  Many atomic veterans who participated in atmospheric nuclear testing \nwere forbidden from publicly revealing their participation for reasons \nof national security. Despite their valuable contributions to the \nUnited States and the Armed Forces, they have not received the \nrecognition that is due them.\n  The National Association of Atomic Veterans, AMVETS, and the Vietnam \nVeterans of America have expressed their strong and unequivocal support \nfor this resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to show their support by cosponsoring National \nAtomic Veterans Day.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5520-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5520-S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the nomination of Mr. Robert Pitofsky to serve on the \nFederal Trade Commission [FTC]. The President has indicated his \nintention to name Mr. Pitofsky as Chairman of the FTC, if he is \nconfirmed.\n  Having previously served as a Commissioner and staff member, Mr. \nPitofsky certainly understands the FTC's goals and duties. The \nCommission's two primary functions are first, to protect consumers from \nunfair and deceptive practices, and second, to ensure the operation of \nan efficient and competitive market-place. The Commission administers a \nnumber of Federal statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission \nAct--which provides the Commission its consumer protection authority--\nand the Sherman, Clayton, and Robinson-Patman antitrust statutes, as \nwell as the Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practices, and \nTruth in Lending Acts. A few of the specific duties include \nsafeguarding the public from false advertisement of goods and services, \ntelemarketing fraud, unfair pricing of products, unfair mergers and \nacquisitions, illegal boycotts, and other unfair methods of \ncompetition.\n  As we enter the 21st century, and a new era of global trade, the FTC \nundoubtedly will continue to face many challenges in fulfilling its \nresponsibilities. Mr. Pitofsky will, if confirmed, chair the Commission \nat a time when Federal agencies are facing the possibility of severe \nbudget reductions.\n  Mr. Pitofsky is aware of the tremendous challenges confronting the \nFTC. He is committed to the principles and goals of the Commission, and \nis prepared to take on the responsibilities of the FTC Chairman. I urge \nmy colleagues to approve his nomination.\n\n\n                       nomination of dr. jackson\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my unequivocal \nsupport for Dr. Shirley Jackson's nomination to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  Dr. Jackson is a fellow New Jerseyan, and has spent most of her \ncareer teaching and working in our State. But that's only one of the \nmany qualifications that make her so ideal for this position.\n  Dr. Jackson has devoted her life to the study of science. Over the \ncourse of her career, she has gained world-wide renown and she has also \nbroken many societal barriers.\n  Dr. Jackson was the first African-American woman to receive a PhD \nfrom MIT.\n  She has accumulated more than two decades of research and management \nexperience in high energy physics, nuclear physics and condensed matter \nphysics. She has been a professor and a consultant. And she has also \nfound time for public service, serving for 10 years as founding member \nof the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology.\n  Dr. Jackson is currently a consultant to AT Bell Laboratories on \nSemiconductor Theory, vice chair of Governor Whitman's Economic Master \nPlan Commission and a member of the [[Page S5522]] Executive Committee \nof the M.I.T. Board of Trustees.\n  And despite her heavy responsibilities, Dr. Jackson puts aside time \nto help recruit more women and more African-Americans to the sciences.\n  Dr. Jackson has always blended her advanced scientific research with \nan eye toward practicality. She has researched subjects as esoteric as \nthe electronic and optical properties of strained layer semiconductor \nsuper-lattices. But she has also worked toward basic goals that you and \nI can understand--like economic development in the State of New Jersey.\n  I understand that President Clinton has said he would like Dr. \nJackson to head the NRC after her confirmation and I enthusiastically \nsupport that decision.\n  I am confident that her scientific and management backgrounds have \nbeen ideal preparation for that leadership position.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Dr. Jackson's background has made her a \nunique, unparalleled nominee for this position. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for in support of this excellent nomination, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5520-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 889 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     889) making emergency supplemental appropriations and \n     rescissions to preserve and enhance the military readiness of \n     the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1995, and for other purposes, having met, after \n     full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 6, 1995.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to strongly urge the Senate to \nadopt today the conference report on H.R. 889, the emergency Defense \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  On Wednesday, the conferees completed work on this bill, which will \nensure that the readiness, quality of life and pay for our Armed Forces \nwill not be impacted by the costs of overseas peacekeeping and \nhumanitarian missions.\n  As chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, there is no question in my \nmind that we must act on this bill prior to the recess.\n  In summary, this bill provides $3.04 billion in new funding for the \nDepartment of Defense, and $28.3 million for the Coast Guard, to pay \nfor these contingency operations, and other emergency requirements.\n  For DOD, in addition to the contingency operations amounts, $258 \nmillion is included to meet the increases in overseas personnel costs \ndue to the decline in value of the dollar.\n  These amounts go directly to the men and women, and their families, \nstationed overseas, to defray the increased expenses they face because \nof this devaluation.\n  All new Defense spending in the bill is offset by rescission to DOD, \ndefense related and foreign aid appropriations.\n  From available DOD funds, $2.26 billion is rescinded. Also, $200 \nmillion from function 050 nuclear facility funds, $100 million from \nmilitary construction funds, and $120 million from foreign aid \nappropriations.\n  The conferees worked to ensure that no significant military program \nwas damaged by these cuts. Most reductions come from savings in \nprograms underway, or from reduced efforts in lower priority programs.\n  Some of these funds will need to be replaced in 1996, but will not \nreduce military readiness or capability this year.\n  The amount rescinded from DOD represents an increase of $300 million \nover the levels adopted by the Senate.\n  These reductions were necessary to ensure that these new \nappropriations did not increase the deficit, thus hampering our ability \nto provide needed funds for 1996.\n  All the military services have identified the severe cuts in training \nand readiness that will result if this bill is not enacted early this \nmonth.\n  Navy fleet steaming days will be reduced. Flight training will be \nreduced. Ships will not undergo needed overhauls at shipyards, \nresulting in substantial layoffs.\n  Air Force flight training will be slashed by 25 percent. Aircraft \nwill be parked on the ramp, because they will not receive necessary \ndepot maintenance.\n  In short, we face a return to the hollow force that many of us \nremember from the 1970's. We cannot permit this.\n  In the 1970's, that hollow force was the result of the Congress not \nappropriating the funds needed for military readiness. This crisis if \nthe result of the President diverting the funds provided by Congress \nfor the military.\n  Let me make clear, the 1995 Defense appropriations bill provided the \nfunds needed to maintain military readiness and training for 1995.\n  During the last quarter of 1994, and the first quarter of 1995, the \nPresident used these funds to undertake the overseas missions in \nKuwait, Korea, Bosnia, Iraq, Somalia, Cuba, and Haiti.\n  In no case did the President come to the Congress, to seek approval, \nand funding, for these missions.\n  The result was a $2.5 billion diversion of readiness and personnel \nappropriations.\n  I want the Senate to know that the appropriations committees of the \nHouse and Senate were unanimous in their commitment that this \ncircumstance should not happen again.\n  Included in the statement of the managers on the conference report is \nan explicit statement of our objections to the course followed by the \nadministration. This bipartisan, bicameral statement reflects our \nviews. I ask unanimous consent that this statement be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                Contingency and Nontraditional Missions\n\n       The conferees express their deep concern over the process \n     by which U.S. military forces are being deployed on major, \n     large scale contingency operations. The conferees note that \n     the Administration neither sought nor received advance \n     approval of or funding for military operations from the \n     Congress in support of peacekeeping and humanitarian \n     missions. The missions involving Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, and \n     refugee relief in the Caribbean all mark significant \n     departures from previous emergency deployments of American \n     forces dealing with valid threats to the national security. \n     The conferees strongly believe that military deployments in \n     support of peacekeeping or humanitarian objectives both merit \n     and require advance approval by the Congress.\n       This issue is of special concern to the conferees because \n     of the effect these operations have had on the defense \n     budgeting and planning process. There is no question but that \n     the recent spate of ``contingency'' deployments, none of \n     which was approved in advance by Congress nor budgeted for, \n     have wreaked havoc upon the ability of the Department of \n     Defense to maintain military readiness. These operations have \n     led to substantial and repeated diversions of funds intended \n     for training, equipment and property maintenance. From the \n     Secretary of Defense to commanders in the field, there is \n     universal acknowledgment that this practice has led to \n     degradations in readiness.\n       A related issue involves the rapid increase in Defense \n     Department participation in activities which under both law \n     and tradition are the responsibility of other Federal \n     departments. The principal example of this trend is the use \n     of DoD funds, personnel, and facilities to deal with the \n     issue of Cuban and Haitian refugees. The cost of these \n     operations has been almost entirely borne by the Department \n     of Defense, even though other Federal entities have long had \n     primary responsibility for dealing with refugee and \n     immigration issues and have, in the past, reimbursed the \n     Department of Defense for such support in accordance with the \n     Economy Act. At present, DoD is being forced to bear $1 \n     million per day in costs for these operations, out of funds \n     intended to be used for [[Page S5523]] military operations, \n     training, and readiness. The conferees believe DoD should not \n     be forced to bear the cost of operations which are not its \n     responsibility, especially when it results in a substantial \n     diversion of funds provided by the Congress expressly for \n     military activities.\n       These problems underline the need for the Executive Branch \n     to seek congressional approval for unanticipated \n     nontraditional military operations in advance. The conferees \n     intend to address these issues in connection with the fiscal \n     year 1996 appropriations process, in order to avoid the \n     recurrence of situations such as those which created the need \n     for the appropriations contained in this measure. The \n     conferees strongly urge the Administration to provide \n     detailed and timely proposals to assist in resolving these \n     issues.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there was no reluctance on the part of \nthe conferees to meet the needs of our Armed Forces. This was \naccomplished in a fashion that is fully offset in new budget authority, \nand virtually offset in new outlays for 1995 from rescissions.\n  The Senate-passed version of this bill fully offset all new outlays. \nThis conference agreement results in only $4.3 million in additional \noutlays for fiscal year 1995, though it provides over $3 billion in new \nspending.\n  I want to thank our chairman, Senator Hatfield, and Senator Byrd for \ntheir leadership and commitment to move this bill forward prior to the \nrecess.\n  In our first conference with the new House team, I want to report the \nexceptional efforts of the Defense Subcommittee chairman, Bill Young, \nand the full committee chairman, Bob Livingston, to work with us to \nmove this bill forward.\n  They drove a hard bargain of many of the differences between the two \nbills, but we were united on our commitment to meet the needs of the \nmilitary services.\n  As I stated when this bill was presented to the Senate last month, \nthe work of the Defense Subcommittee reflects the longstanding \npartnership between myself and Senator Inouye on defense matters.\n  His efforts were invaluable in seeking compromises with the House on \nmatters of interest to the Senate, and I am indebted to him once again \nfor his hard work and wise counsel.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will act immediately to pass this \nconference report, and send this bill to the President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support adoption of this supplemental \nappropriation bill, H.R. 889, and compliment the distinguished \nchairman, Mr. Hatfield, for his excellent work in putting together this \nconference report prior to the April break. It was a difficult task, \nbut it was driven by the need to replenish vital funding for the \nreadiness accounts of our armed services.\n  The conference agreement includes a total of over $3 billion for \nthese vital defense purposes. These accounts were seriously depleted in \nfiscal year 1995 because of unanticipated operations, in particular \nSomalia, Rwanda, and Haiti, as well as elsewhere, and the conference \nhad to balance this need to restore DOD readiness funding with the goal \nof maintaining our progress toward deficit reduction. The result was to \nshift defense funding from lower-priority items in the defense budget \nto replenish these readiness accounts.\n  Mr. President, I note that the conferees, in the statement of \nmanagers, have addressed their deep concern and desire not to repeat \nthe problem of engaging in expensive, non-traditional, humanitarian-\noriented military operations without a more careful assessment of the \ncosts. The conference agreement rightly recommends that prior \ncongressional approval should be sought and obtained for such \noperations. Given the budgetary constraints we are facing in \ndiscretionary spending, including defense spending, I do not think that \nthe Congress will easily approve supplementals in the future such as we \nhave before us today, for operations which do not have the advance-\napproval of the Congress. Certainly it is in the interest of the \nPresident to have Congress on board if and when he decides to launch \nthe Nation into these kinds of expensive, non-traditional operations, \nwhich are not directly related to the vital interests of the United \nStates.\n  In addition to over $2 billion in DOD rescissions, the conference \nagreement includes a number of rescissions of international and \ndomestic funds, including foreign operations, the Departments of \nTransportation, Commerce-Justice-State, Interior, Education, Veterans \nAffairs, and a variety of other accounts. The net effect of the bill on \nFederal spending is a reduction in excess of $700 million.\n  Again, I compliment the chairman of the committee, as well as the \nmanagers of the Defense Chapter, specifically, Mr. Stevens and Mr. \nInouye, for a particularly workman-like job in rearranging, in a \ndeficit-neutral manner, the department's accounts so as to support the \nbasic readiness of our armed forces.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee for a conference agreement which is, on the \nwhole, an excellent bill.\n  It is fully paid for.\n  It contains needed funds to reimburse DOD for the costs of conducting \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping operations.\n  It provides full funding for authorized military pay raises.\n  It rescinds $300 million from TRP and places restrictions on the \nability to provide grants for projects with little or no military \nrelevance.\n  It also rescinds $122 million from the Service R accounts for \ngeneral science and technology programs--low-priority programs with \nlittle demonstrable relevance to defense requirements.\n  It puts in place a requirement to notify Congress in advance of large \nobligations from the Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses account.\n  It rescinds funding from excess Guard and Reserve equipment which was \nadded by Congress.\n  It restores much of the funding in the BRAC cleanup and construction \naccounts that is recommended for rescission in H.R. 1158, the domestic \nrescission bill currently before the Senate.\n  I particularly want to thank my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns, for his successful efforts in negotiating an excellent \ncompromise with the House regarding elimination of military \nconstruction at closing bases. I understand the opposition he faced in \ndefending the provision adopted by the Senate, and I appreciate his \ndiligence. The compromise--which prohibits obligation of funds for \nmilitary construction at closing bases or for realigning functions--is \nactually an improvement over the Senate position, since it makes these \nfunds available for other high-priority defense needs, rather than \nreturning them to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, there are a few rescissions with which I am not in \nagreement, namely, the rescission of environmental cleanup funds in the \nDepartments of Defense and Energy. I believe it is irresponsible to \nreduce these accounts at a time when all indications are that the cost \nof cleaning up Federal facilities\n is skyrocketing. These funds will likely have to be restored in the \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations process.\n\n  On March 1, I provided a list of more than $6 billion in suggested \nrescissions of low-priority and non-defense items funded in the fiscal \nyear 1995 defense bill. With a few exceptions, the Senate chose not to \nrescind these funds, and they were therefore not within the scope of \nthe conference. However, I believe rescinding earmarked funds would \nhave been a much better decision for the conferees than rescinding \nenvironmental restoration funds.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that the conferees chose not to \nrescind $400 million for construction of two aeronautical wind tunnels, \nas proposed by the House. Our nation's fiscal crisis requires that we \neliminate projects that do not return good value to the American \npeople. I believe half a billion dollars for wind tunnels is one of \nthose projects that should be cut in favor of a higher purpose--deficit \nreduction.\n  I also question the necessity to set aside additional funds in this \nemergency bill to renovate Penn Station in New York, when many other \ntrain stations in the country could probably use a portion of this \nfunding to upgrade their facilities. I understand that this requirement \narises from safety concerns and recent fires at the station, but I have \nnot seen any official estimates of repair costs or safety \nmodifications. In addition, last year, cost-sharing was an essential \nelement of providing Federal funding for this [[Page S5524]] project; I \ntrust that will also be the case with these additional funds.\n  There are a number of other rescissions which were not accepted by \nthe conferees which could have provided additional deficit reduction in \nthis bill. While these projects are a very, very small part of this \nbill, I feel it is imperative that I bring to the attention of the \nSenate that certain Members are still able to protect their special \ninterests at the expense of the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, again, I commend my colleagues, Senator Hatfield and \nSenator Byrd, for this conference agreement. On the whole, it is a \nresponsible balance between restoring military readiness funds and \neliminating unnecessary Federal spending across-the-board. My outlook \non the upcoming fiscal year 1996 appropriations season is much improved \nbecause of the excellent work in this bill. I hope we can eliminate, or \nat least minimize, as this bill does, the earmarks and pork barrel \nprojects in the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement accompanying H.R. 889, the emergency defense supplemental \nappropriations and rescission bill for the fiscal year 1995.\n  The bill provides for a net decrease in fiscal year 1995 budget \nauthority and outlays of $4.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. \nThese are real cuts to the deficit.\n  Title I of the bill provides supplemental appropriations of $3.1 \nbillion in budget authority and $1.2 billion in outlays for the \nDepartment of Defense. These funds, largely for unanticipated \ncontingency operations, are necessary to maintain the readiness of our \nArmed Forces.\n  This title also rescinds $2.9 billion in budget authority and $1.2 \nbillion in outlays for various defense programs to help offset the cost \nof this additional military spending.\n  Title II provides for non-defense rescissions amounting to $1.1 \nbillion in budget authority and $0.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year \n1995. Most of these savings are to be devoted to deficit reduction.\n  The final bill does include the emergency designation for these \nadditional funds as requested by the President and approved by the \nHouse.\n  I must note, however, that the spending in this bill is largely \noffset by the rescissions in the bill, and I think this is an important \nachievement by both the Senate and House.\n  I thank my colleagues for the fine job they have done, and I urge the \nadoption of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tables showing the \nrelationship of the pending bill to the Appropriations Committee 602 \nallocations and to the overall spending ceilings under the fiscal year \n1995 budget resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   H.R. 889, DEFENSE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL AND RESCISSIONS CONFERENCE REPORT                   \n

MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the conference \nreport for the Department of Defense supplemental appropriations bill \nincludes an appropriation of $21.5 million for capital improvements \nassociated with safety-related emergency repairs to Pennsylvania \nStation in New York City.\n  Pennsylvania Station is the busiest intermodal station in the Nation, \nwith almost 40 percent of Amtrak's passengers nationwide passing \nthrough every day. Unfortunately, it is also the most decrepit of the \nNortheast corridor stations, others of which, such as Washington, DC's \nown Union Station, have been renovated with Federal grants. Today, \nPennsylvania Station handles almost 500,000 riders a day in a \nsubterranean complex that demands improvement. According to the New \nYork City Fire Commissioner, there have been nine major fires at the \nstation since 1987. Luckily, these fires have occurred at off-hours; as \nit stands, the station could not cope with an emergency when it is \ncrowded with the 42,000 souls who pass through every workday between 8 \nand 9 a.m. In addition, structural steel in the station has shown its \nage and needs immediate repair. And these are just the most pressing \nneeds.\n  There is a redevelopment plan to change things for the better, a $315 \nmillion project to renovate the existing Pennsylvania Station and \nextend it partially into the neighboring historic James A. Farley Post \nOffice, almost doubling the emergency access to the station's platforms \nwhich lie far below street level beneath both buildings. Moreover, \nthere is a financing plan in place that could do this with $100 million \nfrom the Federal Government ($31.5 million has already been \nappropriated), $100 million from the State and city, and $115 million \nfrom a combination of historic tax credits, bonds supported by revenue \nfrom the project's retail component, and building shell improvements by \nthe Postal Service, owner of the James A. Farley Building. Governor \nPataki of New York and Mayor Giuliani of New York City strongly support \nthe project and have made available funding in their budgets in \naccordance with a Memorandum of Agreement signed in August, 1994.\n  Thanks to our colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations, $21.5 \nmillion can now be used immediately for pressing safety repairs at the \nexisting station, in the first step of the overall redevelopment \neffort. These are the first Federal funds into the project that will \nactually go toward construction, and they will count towards the \nFederal share of the $315 million project to transform the station into \na complex capable of safely handling the crowds that have made \nPennsylvania Station the Nation's busiest intermodal facility. For \nmyself and the 75 million other people a year who use the station, I \nwould like to thank all those who have labored hard to make the station \nsafer, in particular our colleagues Senator Hatfield, Senator Byrd, and \nSenator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the conference \nreport be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the conference report was agreed to.\n \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/06/senate-section/article/S5522-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}]
