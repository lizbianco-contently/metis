Mr. President, we are now under a time agreement of 1 \nhour for the final debate on all of the second-degree amendments to the \nMcConnell amendment on medical malpractice.\n  Seeing no Senator prepared to debate, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that it be charged equally against \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n   [[Page S5932]] The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as a chief advocate and sponsor and manager of the \nproduct liability reform bill, which, as far as I know, is still being \ndebated on the floor, I want to comment on the situation on the floor \nas I see it now.\n  From just about every corner of the Senate floor, an amendment of \nsome kind dealing with malpractice--not product liability, but \nmalpractice--has been offered. So much so, in fact, that we now have 12 \namendments on malpractice in the pipeline. I am hoping that the Senate \nwill not have to vote on 12 amendments, and I hope indeed some of them \ncan be worked out, dropped, or whatever.\n  As I also said on Thursday when I last spoke, I share my colleagues' \ninterest in malpractice reform. In fact, I daresay that I more than \nshare my colleagues' interest on this subject. To me, it is part of the \nproblem with our health care system. It is intimately related to cost \nand psychology and whether doctors' kids or anyone's children want to \ngo into medicine or not. And malpractice reform is something I want \nvery much to do. But I do not want to do it at the risk of killing \nproduct liability reform. It is as simple as that.\n  I think if we were to adopt malpractice reform in conflict, not only \nwould it fail, but so would product liability. So in the interest of \nbringing malpractice reform into the discussion, everything would lose. \nWe can win product liability on a clean bill, which Senator Gorton and \nI want. But we cannot win product liability if there are substantial or \nunsubstantial amendments attached to it, and malpractice reform is a \nvery substantial amendment. We cannot win both.\n  As I said, I think at some point Senators have to choose: Do they \nwant product liability reform? Do they want medical malpractice reform? \nDo they want nothing? Of course, there are many who want nothing.\n  I just do not see 12 amendments on medical malpractice to a product \nliability reform bill as the way to produce actual results, results \nwhich will be signed into law. It may make a lot of people feel good to \noffer their own iterations on medical malpractice to this bill. We have \nhad some terrific speeches.\n  As somebody trying to enact something called a product liability bill \nfor the last 9 years, it just does not make me feel very confident that \nthis is the route to actually enacting either product liability reform \nor medical malpractice reform.\n  I repeat, I hope my colleagues understand this: If malpractice reform \nwere to pass, and I do not think it will, if it were to pass and become \npart of the product liability bill, the product liability bill would \nlose. It is 100 percent guaranteed it would lose. So we would lose \nmalpractice and we would lose product liability.\n  I do not understand that. I do not understand that. I think \nmalpractice reform ought to be pursued just the way a bipartisan team \nof Senators have tried to enact this product liability reform bill. It \nought to be done in the same manner--separately. That is, by getting a \nbill reported out of committee, onto the Senate Calendar, having the \nmajority leader call it up, debating it on its own terms and with the \ntime needed to work out any differences and issues that can be resolved \nhere in the Senate.\n  Trying to enact malpractice reform by amending a product liability \nreform bill with enough issues of its own, for Heaven's sakes, just \ndoes not make sense to me. Maybe I will be proven wrong. I think the \nchances of that are almost zero percent. Maybe some kind of consensus \nwill emerge around here on what form of malpractice reform should be \nattached to the product liability reform bill and we will suddenly have \nabout 70 votes for a bill with both.\n  That was the original conversation, because of the surge of that \nnature in the House. People said malpractice will help products. That \nis what Jim Todd with the American Medical Association said to me and \nDick Davidson of the American Hospital Association, and Tom Scully of \nthe Federation of American Health Systems. They all said that to me; it \nwill help.\n  All of the product liability alliance folks who surged in the House \nmake the same assumption about the Senate. We are just very different. \nWe are a very different body. It will not work here. This talk about \ngetting 70 votes for a bill with both--I am highly skeptical.\n  As somebody who has worked very hard, as have Senator Gorton and many \nothers here, on trying to enact product liability reform, I want to \nsend a very clear signal to the Senators and to the citizens who also \nwant to see a law enacted to achieve this result, this is no time for \nloading up this bill--neither now with these malpractice amendments nor \nafter they have been disposed of. After they have been disposed of, \nthere will be a chance for more amendments. Then there will also be not \nthe time to load up the bill.\n  This is no time for amendment proliferation. This is no time to use \nthis bill to make speeches on other issues to try to satisfy other \ninterests, to try to feel good about writing amendments on other \npriorities, like malpractice reform.\n  This is the time to focus on the job at hand, and it is called \nproduct liability. We have a large, good group of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who are prepared to vote for product liability \nreform, one of the most contentious issues that we face in any year in \nwhich we take this subject up, which is every other year. Up until this \ntime we have lost every single year. We have lost nefariously, we have \nlost flat out, we have just sort of lost, but we have lost. It has \nalways been close.\n  The majority of the Senate has always wanted product liability, but \nwe have just fallen short, for one reason or another, of cloture. This \nyear we can get it. This year we can do cloture and we can get a \nproduct liability bill which, in turn, will put the opposition in \nsubstantial disarray, and then we can move on to other aspects like \nmalpractice reform, securities, that kind of thing, all of which I \nstrongly favor, particularly malpractice.\n  So, again, this is the time to focus on the job at hand. I think that \nmalpractice reform, in fact, is such a serious subject that it deserves \nfar more attention than it has gotten. It deserves far more debate than \nit has gotten.\n  I am not convinced that there are 10 percent of the Senators who will \nvote on these amendments who understand what malpractice reform is all \nabout. I do not mean that to insult any of my colleagues, but just as I \nthink product liability reform is extremely complicated--particularly \nfor nonlawyers such as myself--malpractice becomes more so because we \nare dealing with humans in a different way. It is a hard subject that \ndeserves a very serious effort, but not on this bill.\n  Again, and in concluding, I am more than anxious to take up a bill on \nmalpractice reform. I understand the urgency and the voices of the \ndoctors and the health care institutions in my State of West Virginia \nand elsewhere. It is not right that it has to take so long to do \nsomething about problems with malpractice. It is the No. 1 subject on \nthe minds of physicians, the No. 1 subject on the minds of hospitals. \nThey desperately want it.\n  It also is not right to pretend that we can act on malpractice reform \nwhen trying to enact a serious piece of legislation on a different \nissue, which is called product liability.\n  My hope is that we simply will concentrate on product liability, that \nwe will try to keep away amendments, that we will drive this thing \nthrough to a conclusion and get one excellent piece of work done.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask the time be divided equally between the \nopponents and the proponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S5933]] Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we spent, now, 2 full days debating \nthis underlying medical malpractice amendment and numerous second-\ndegree amendments. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of the underlying \nfirst-degree amendment with the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr. McConnell] \nand the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum]. I would like to take a \nfew moments here to put this debate and the amendment in perspective.\n  Surprisingly, to my knowledge this is the first time the full Senate \nhas engaged in a real debate on medical malpractice reform, even though \nthis issue has been the subject of countless debates in State \nlegislatures throughout America going back to the 1970's, when I was \npart of the State Legislature of Connecticut. I am pleased the issue \nand the problem has finally come to this point, and I want to express \nmy admiration to my colleagues on both sides of this issue for the \nthoughtful remarks they have made over the last days.\n  We have heard a variety of views expressed, of course, but I am \npleased to note there is broad agreement that our present system for \ncompensating patients who have been injured by medical malpractice is \nineffective, inefficient, and in many respects unfair. The system \npromotes the overuse of medical tests and procedures and simply diverts \ntoo much money away from victims. I know we have heard a lot of numbers \nin the past couple of days, but to me the most important one is this: \nLess than half of the money spent on medical malpractice in this \ncountry goes to the victims of malpractice. Less than 50 cents of every \ndollar that goes into the medical malpractice system in this country \ngoes to those who are injured as a result of malpractice.\n  So the aim of the amendment is not to protect doctors who are guilty \nor health professionals who are guilty of negligence that injures \npatients. Quite the contrary, the aim of the amendment is to make sure \nthat more, rather than less than half a dollar of every dollar that \ngoes into this system, goes to the patients who are injured and not to \nthose, including the attorneys, who are churning, moving the current \nsystem.\n  We can argue about the numbers, obviously, but I hope most of my \ncolleagues will agree that the existing medical malpractice system does \ncontribute to the high cost of health care. The cost of liability \ninsurance has been estimated, the most recent number I could find, at \n$9 billion in 1992. That is not money that just comes out of the air or \nis printed by the Government; that is money that comes from everybody \nwho is paying premiums for insurance for health care.\n  The respected health care consulting firm Lewin-VHI has estimated \nconservatively the cost of defensive medicine--this is beyond the $9 \nbillion in premiums--but the cost of defensive medicine, which is to \nsay medicine practiced by health professionals not for what they take \nto be the medical needs of their patients but defensively because they \nare worried about lawsuits, is $25 billion a year. Again, that is $25 \nbillion coming out of the pockets of everybody who is paying health \ncare costs.\n  That number may seem to some who look at the big picture of health \ncare spending somehow small. If it does, they have perhaps lost touch \nwith reality, because $25 billion is a lot of money. It is not small in \nany sense. We can and should do something to reduce that number.\n  Taxpayers and health care consumers bear the financial burden of \nthose costs. I say taxpayers because we are paying for it in Medicare \nand Medicaid and every other Government-supported health care program. \nTens of billions of dollars every year is not a trivial amount of money \nto taxpayers and consumers in this country.\n  The underlying amendment we will vote on today will begin to address \nthe inefficiencies and perverse effect of our current malpractice \nsystem by directing a greater proportion of malpractice awards to \nvictims, by discouraging frivolous lawsuits, and by enhancing programs \nthat are aimed at improving the quality of medical practice, which is \nwhat this is all about.\n  The amendment will also improve consumer information, a key part of \npreventing malpractice, by establishing an advisory panel to improve \nquality assurance programs and consumer information. The panel will \nalso look at ways to strengthen the national practitioner data bank. My \ncolleague, Senator Wellstone, has offered an amendment that would open \nthe data bank without this review. I respectfully suggest that this \namendment goes too far too quickly, though I am sympathetic to the \ngoal.\n  I believe the underlying amendment sponsored by Senators McConnell, \nKassebaum, and myself will lead us appropriately down the path but will \ndo it with some also appropriate caution.\n  Mr. President, the underlying amendment is not new. It is not \nradical. It is a very moderate proposal which contains provisions from \nhealth care reform bills reported out of committees during the last \nCongress with the exception of the statute of limitations.\n  With the exception of the statute of limitations, the 2-year time \nlimit does not include a statute of repose and a cap on punitive \ndamages which is identical to the cap in the underlying product \nliability bill. Every provision in the pending first-degree amendment \nwas contained either in President Clinton's health care reform \nproposal, the bill reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, or the \nbill reported out of the Senate Finance Committee last year.\n  I agree with my colleagues who have argued that medical liability \nreform is only a small part of health care reform. But it is a \nsubstantial and important beginning. As both Democrats and Republicans \nconcluded last year, malpractice reform is an important part of health \ncare reform. Today we have an opportunity to take a modest and \nreasonable proconsumer step forward on this problem.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues, and I urge them to vote for \nthe underlying amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the opponents of this medical \nmalpractice amendment have wildly attacked it. But, this amendment is \nvery reasonable and moderate reform. In fact, if you compare it to some \nof the proposals from last year's health care debate, you will see many \nfamiliar provisions.\n  For example, the original Clinton Health Security Act contained a cap \non attorney contingent fees, collateral source reform, periodic payment \nof damages, and mandatory alternative dispute resolution. The medical \nmalpractice provisions reported from the Finance Committee contained \njoint and several liability reform, a cap on noneconomic damages, and \nmandatory alternative dispute resolution with modified loser-pays for \nthose who go onto court and do not improve upon the ADR decision. By \nomitting the cap on pain and suffering, this amendment does not go as \nfar as the Finance Committee's proposals which were reported out of the \ncommittee, on a bipartisan basis.\n  During last year's health care debate, some argued for the Canadian \nsingle-payer system. Canada's single-payer system also includes some \nvery strict rules on malpractice cases. While Canada's doctors do not \npay malpractice insurance premiums, they pay a membership fee to the \nCanadian Medical Protective Association. In the United States, doctors \nand hospitals buy malpractice insurance, costing tens of thousands of \ndollars annually. And, according to the Medical Liability Monitor, more \nthan half of all doctors have experienced 9- to 15-percent increases in \ntheir malpractice premiums in each of 1993 and 1994.\n  In Canada, noneconomic damages are capped at $240,000. The McConnell-\nLieberman-Kassebaum amendment does not cap noneconomic damages, \nalthough Senator Kyl has an amendment pending to add a cap of $500,000.\n  In Canada, contingency fees are illegal in some parts of the country \nand uncommon in the rest of the country. \n[[Page S5934]] Our amendment sets a limit on attorney contingent fees, \nto ensure that most of the award goes to the injured party.\n  In Canada, a plaintiff who loses, risks having to pay the defendant's \nlegal fees. This amendment contains no loser-pays provision.\n  So, Mr. President, in comparing this amendment to last year's efforts \non medical malpractice, as well as to Canada's law, we have very \nmoderate reform proposed here.\n  And, those who support product liability reform should support \nmedical malpractice reform. Enacting the underlying bill on its own \nwill, in my judgment, make the legal system more complex. What will \nhappen in a case where the injured party alleges malpractice over \ncertain drug treatment? It product liability reform is enacted, the \ndrug company will fall under the new law, but there will have to be a \nseparate lawsuit regarding the conduct of the doctor or hospital. Such \na result would be ridiculous.\n  The opponents assert that we are somehow trying to shield negligent \ndoctors and hospitals. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one \nloses the right to sue under this amendment. An injured party will be \nfully compensated for his or her injuries. Negligent doctors and \nhospitals will be held accountable for the injuries they cause.\n  In addition, this amendment takes important steps in the direction of \nassuring quality care for all patients.\n  While protecting the rights of the injured to get compensation for \ntheir injuries, this amendment also gives the American people relief \nfrom the tort tax. We know the litigation tax adds thousands of dollars \nannually to the household budgets of all American families. It adds \nextra costs to the delivery of a baby, as well as to the cost of a \nheart pacemaker.\n  Relief from the tort tax and an end to the lawsuit gamble are the \ngoals of our effort. We know that most of the money spent in the \nlitigation system does not go to the injured victims; they get only 43 \ncents of every dollar spent in the liability system. The legal system \nis akin to the casinos of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Sometimes you \nwin big, but most times the house--that is the system, made up of \nlawyers and related court costs, is the biggest winner.\n  The only opponents we have in this legal reform fight are the trial \nlawyers. They have the biggest stake in maintaining the status quo. The \ninjured people they represent will be treated better under this \namendment. They will get more compensation for their injuries. So, if \nyou are for the victims, you should vote for this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt the McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n7 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding because I \nknow he and I do not agree on this issue. So it must be in some ways a \npainful thing for him to yield to me. So I want to say to my friend, \nSenator Rockefeller, I thank him very much for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, what are we doing here in the Senate today? We are \nvoting, beginning to vote, to change a legal system that, while not \nperfect, is adjudged to be the best in the world. We are not tinkering \naround the edges. We are not dealing with frivolous lawsuits. We are in \nessence, if you follow the Contract With America, taking away the \nrights of average citizens to get justice in the courtroom. And what I \nfind most remarkable about this in this Republican Congress is that \nthis is the same Republican Congress that says let the States decide \nmost matters, they are closer to the people. But in this case, the U.S. \nSenate and the House of Representatives, well, we are going to \nsubstitute our judgment for that of a local jury, a local judge, who \nknows the community, who is of, by, and from the community. I do not \nthink we should be able to prejudge what a damage award should be, \nwhether it is in a medical malpractice case or whether it is in a \nproduct liability case, the underlying bill.\n  Let me give you an example. Most Americans were stunned to hear that \na physician in Florida in treating a gentleman actually cut off the \nwrong leg of that man. It meant that they had to then cut off the other \nleg and the man lost both legs.\n  In the debate on this subject of capping the damages and what people \ncould receive in medical malpractice cases, a Republican Congressman--\nwho happens to be a doctor--took to the floor of the House. He has \nserved there for many years. And this Congressman was asked by another \ncolleague, a Democratic colleague, ``What do you think about the fact \nthat a physician cut off the wrong leg of a victim, and now this \ngentleman has no legs at all?''\n He can never hope to have anything like a normal life. And this \nRepublican doctor-Congressman said mistakes happen. These things \nhappen. And then he was asked, what is it worth, the fact that a man \nhas no legs and can never have the semblance of an ordinary life again? \nAnd he said, mistakes will happen.\n\n  Well, he does not know what it is worth.\n  These things happen.\n  The fact is we do not know, but a jury and a judge together will make \nthat decision in accordance with State law. But, no, we are going to \ndestroy all of this.\n  Now, the story which all America shared, unfortunately, is not that \nisolated. Although we know we have the best doctors in the world, the \nmost healing doctors in the world, this is not isolated. It is a very \nsmall percent. Of all tort cases filed, only 7 percent are medical \nmalpractice. But we are going to take the iron fist of the Senate and \nsay we know best what a future victim should be awarded.\n  Now, let me tell you about a couple of cases. You also probably read \nabout Betsy Lehman, who died after given a massive overdose of a strong \nchemotherapy drug. That story was publicized by the Boston Globe. Are \nwe to tell the family of this young woman what the damages should be to \nthat family? I think not.\n  How about Grand Rapids, MI? The wrong breast of a 69-year-old cancer \npatient was negligently cut off during a mastectomy. In Denver, CO, an \nanesthesiologist fell asleep during a routine operation on an 8-year-\nold boy. The child died, and we are going to tell the people in \nColorado what that family should be awarded. I think there is something \nmisguided going on here.\n  I have to believe there is some special interests that are involved \nhere because the interests of the American people are not being served \nbecause we are all potential victims. We are all potential victims.\n  At the New England Medical Center, two skin cancer patients died when \na highly toxic drug called Cisplatin was given to them at three times \nthe recommended dosage. In California, my great State, Harry Jordan \nwent into the hospital to have a diseased kidney removed. Instead, the \nsurgeons removed his healthy kidney, and he remained on dialysis for \nthe rest of his life. He died last month, and we are going to tell the \njury and the judge what to do in this kind of case.\n  We could go on with examples. The fact is we have the safest products \nin the world, and we have the best physicians in the world. I have to \nbelieve that our system of justice, although not perfect, has played a \nrole in this. And I say often to myself--and this has to do with the \nunderlying bill on product safety--how many of us remember engines \nexploding in cars?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 more minute, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls the time.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will yield a minute to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator so much. I say to my friends, I know \nthese are arguments they do not enjoy hearing, and I therefore \nappreciate the generosity.\n  We all remember engines of cars exploding, company executives saying, \n``Well, we figured we would have a few explosions. We write it off as a \ncost of \n[[Page S5935]]  doing business.'' This Senate wants to limit the \npunitive damages to those future companies that would act in such a \ndespicable fashion. Most of our companies are good and most of them \ncare, but the bad apples should know they will be hit with punitive \ndamages, not just a slap on the wrist. Should this Republican contract \npass, the most change will occur in the boardroom--not in the \ncourtroom, in the boardroom--as people are getting ready to put new \nproducts on the market saying, well, we do not have to worry; the \nSenate, the Republican contract saved us from being hit with a \nmeaningful punitive damages suit.\n  So in closing, Mr. President, I wish to again thank my colleagues. I \nwill be supporting some of these amendments that are coming before us \nbecause they will make the bill a little better. I will be opposing \nothers. But nothing that we do here by way of amendment convinces me \nthat we are on the right path.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, among other things, the distinguished \nSenator from California spoke about special interests. I find that \nremarkable in light of an article which appeared a couple of weeks ago \nin the Wall Street Journal, and a followup report on campaign \ncontributions to congressional candidates which shows that the largest \nsingle special interest involved in campaigns for Congress is the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers Association and its members. In their \ncontributions, they outdo the Fortune 500; they outdo organized labor; \nthey outdo, multiplied by 4 or 5 times, oil and gas lobbyists' \ncontributions. They are, by a significant margin, the No. 1 special \ninterest from the point of view of contributions to political campaigns \nin the United States.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not normally argue this point of view. I am \ninclined to think that most of these lobbying organizations support the \npeople who are already on their sides. But to attack the legislation as \nbeing special interest legislation, when the opponents are supported by \nthe largest of all of the special interests, seems to me somewhat \nparadoxical.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? Will the Senator yield to me on \nthat point?\n  Mr. GORTON. This is particularly true----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me on that point?\n  Mr. GORTON. No, not right now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will wait, thanks.\n  Mr. GORTON. This is particularly true, Mr. President, when we reflect \non the fact that it is that special interest which is the greatest \nbeneficiary of the present system as, of all of the money that goes \ninto medical malpractice, only 40 percent gets to the victims and 60 \npercent goes to the transactions costs; that is to say, the attorneys, \nthe expert witnesses, the insurance adjusters and the like who involve \nthemselves in the question.\n  The greatest amount of money by far goes not to victims but to \ntransaction costs.\n  In my view, that is the great scandal of the present system, whether \nwe are dealing with medical malpractice or with product liability. The \ncosts of the system outside of the compensation provided for any of the \nparties is so overwhelmingly on one side that I think it would be those \nwho speak about victims and victims' rights who would be most in favor \nof a dramatic and drastic reform of the present system, most in favor \nof it, to create a system in which the transaction costs, the lawyer's \nfees were dramatically less, and a much greater percentage went to \nthose who were victims.\n  I will be perfectly happy to yield to the Senator from California for \na question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Is the Senator aware that well over 100 organizations, including some \nfrom his State, oppose this underlying bill very, very strongly? \nBecause I think what the Senator is doing in his remarks is leading \npeople to believe that there is one group that is opposed to it.\n  I read into the Record a number of groups the last time. Every single \nconsumer organization you can name, both State based and nationally \nbased: citizen action groups, public interest law people, Coalition of \nSilicon Survivors, and Colorado DES Action. The DES sons also oppose \ncertain liability reforms.\n  What I wish to point out to my friend is I really respect his right \nto disagree----\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand the question now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to put this list of people who \noppose this bill into the Record at this time, and I thank my friend \nfor yielding.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yes, the Senator from Washington is quite \naware of that list of organizations. Of course, there are all kinds of \norganizations that are on both sides of this case. The point made by \nthe Senator from Washington was that overwhelmingly of these special \ninterests, the largest single special interest in the United States, \nwhen one measures that influence by the amount of money put into the \npolitical system, is ATLA, the trial lawyers.\n  This is not surprising, given the fact that they are the principal \nbeneficiaries to a considerably larger degree than the very victims \nwhom they claim to be representing. That is the point from the \nperspective of organizations. The biggest special interest, the richest \nspecial interest, the special interest that gives the greatest amount \nof money leads the opposition to this view and contributes to many of \nthe other organizations which are opposed to it.\n  But that does not, as this Senator said, necessarily mean that they \nare wrong or that the other side is right. When, however, we have a \nsystem which hurts innovation, destroys American competitiveness in \nsome industries, and gives 60 percent of all the money in the system to \nthose who game the system rather than victims, there is something \nwrong, and that something ought to be corrected.\n       preemption in the mcconnell-lieberman-kassebaum amendment\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, last week I spoke in favor of the \npending amendment on medical liability and addressed, very briefly, the \nissue of Federal preemption.\n   [[Page S5937]] I want to take a few moments this morning to explain \nmore fully my reasons for supporting a limited Federal preemption of \nState medical liability laws and to urge my colleagues to reject both \nthe Simon and the Kennedy preemption amendments to the underlying \nMcConnell-Kassebaum-Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has a significant stake in \nreforming the health care liability system both because of the effect \nof the system on interstate commerce and because of the enormous amount \nspent by the Federal Government on health care.\n  Last Thursday, I spoke of the need to achieve some degree of \nuniformity and certainty in the system. Without greater predictability, \ninsurance rates will continue to reflect the potential for unlimited \nexposure to risk. And these higher insurance rates will continue to be \npassed along to the American consumer.\n\n\n     the private sector deserves to benefit from the same type of \n      protections that the federal government has afforded itself\n\n  The Federal Government already has taken significant steps to limit \nits own exposure for costs associated with health care liability. For \nexample, damages resulting from health claims disputes and redress in \nclaims dispute cases are limited for Federal employees receiving health \ncoverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Act [FEHBA], and \nfor Medicare beneficiaries. There are no punitive or extra-contractual \ndamages allowed under FEHBA or Medicare. See Hayes v. Prudential Ins. \nCo., 819 F.2d 921 (9th Cir. 1987); Homewood Professional Care Ctr., \nLtd. v. Heckler, 764 F.2d 1242 (7th Cir. 1985).\n  Moreover, responding to an outcry from Federal Community Health \nCenters about skyrocketing malpractice insurance premiums, Congress in \n1992 limited the exposure of centers and their providers to malpractice \nclaims by placing them under the Federal Tort Claims Act and taking \nsteps that go well beyond the reforms in this legislation. In addition \nto having judgments paid from a Federal fund, that act: (1) allows \nliability to be determined by a judge rather than a jury (28 U.S.C. \n2402); (2) contains a 2-year stature of limitations that is more \nrestrictive than the one contained in this legislation (28 U.S.C. \n2401); (3) prohibits the awarding of punitive damages (28 U.S.C. 2674); \n(4) places a cap on lawyers' contingency fees of 25 percent of a \nlitigated claim and 20 percent of a settlement (28 U.S.C. 2678); \ndisallows prejudgment interest (28 U.S.C. 2674), and requires claimants \nto exhaust administrative remedies before proceeding to court (28 \nU.S.C. 2675).\n  Mr. President, I believe that the private sector is entitled to the \nsame type of protections that the Federal Government has extended to \nits own health providers.\n\n\n   as the largest single payer of health care services, the federal \n  government has a compelling interest in health care liability reform\n\n  While the Federal Government has limited its exposure to health care \nliability claims in certain instances, large gaps remain. In \nparticular, liability for health care professionals and providers who \ntreat Medicaid and Medicare patients remain subject to uneven and \nsometimes insufficient State medical liability reforms. One-third of \ntotal health care spending in this country is paid by the Federal \nGovernment. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Federal \nspending for Medicare will reach $177 billion in fiscal year 1995, \nwhile Medicaid grants to States will total $96 billion.\n  Therefore, I believe that there is a direct, compelling Federal \ninterest in reforming the Nation's outmoded medical liability system.\nfederal legislation is necessary because of the increasingly interstate \n                   character of health care delivery\n\n  Moreover, some degree of uniformity is essential because health care \nmarkets are becoming increasingly regional, if not national. \nTelemedicine, by its very nature, is designed to overcome barriers to \nthe delivery of medicine, including long distances, geographic \nlimitations, and political borders. Some of the finest medical \nfacilities in the United States--such as the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, \nStanford University in California, Barnes Hospital in Missouri, the \nCleveland Clinic in Ohio, and the Dartmouth Medical Center in New \nHampshire--treat patients from across the Nation, and around the world.\n  While I do not believe there is a need for absolute uniformity in all \naspects of the health care system, I do believe that some minimum level \nof medical liability reforms are necessary to the continued development \nof a cost-effective private health care system. This is particularly \ntrue where, as under this legislation, insurers and other third party \npayers may be sued as defendants in health care liability actions.\n  As health care providers continue to consolidate and form integrated \nnetworks of care in response to market forces, economic pressure, and \nemerging treatment patterns, the number of individuals who receive \nhealth care services in one State while having them financed by \nentities in another will continue to increase.\n  While health care services generally are delivered locally, this does \nnot necessarily mean that health care is delivered within State \nborders. To the contrary: more than 40 percent of Americans live in \ncities and counties that border on State lines; in 26 States, more than \nhalf of the population lives in cities and counties that border on \nState lines, and over 50 percent of the population in 26 States lives \nin border cities and counties. In these areas, it is even more likely \nthat a patient will live or work in one State, receive health care \nservices in another, and have his or her bills paid by a third-party \npayer in another State. A recent analysis of health services purchased \nacross State borders found, for example: First, that Vermont and New \nHampshire residents visit an out-of-State physician nearly one-quarter \nof the time; second, that Wyoming residents visit out-of-State doctors \nover one-third of the time, and third, that nearly 40 percent of the \npatients admitted to Delaware hospitals travel from out of the State.\n   federal legislation is necessary because of state constitutional \n                              impediments\n\n  Some have argued that this legislation is an unnecessary intrusion \ninto an area of the law that traditionally has been the domain of the \nStates. I would like to point out, however, that many of the opponents \nof Federal medical liability reform are, at the same time, aggressively \nchallenging State tort reform efforts by arguing that the reforms are \nunconstitutional under State constitutions. As a result, many States \nhave been frustrated in their efforts to pass meaningful tort reform. \nFor example: First, statutes of limitations in health care liability \nactions have been held to violate State constitutions in Arizona; \nsecond, limits on punitive damage awards in health care liability \nactions have been held unconstitutional in Alabama, and third, periodic \npayment schedules for damage awards in health care liability actions \nhave been held to violate State constitutions in Arizona, New \nHampshire, and Ohio.\n\n\n  preemption provisions in the mcconnell-lieberman-kassebaum amendment\n\n  Mr. President, the preemption provisions contained in the McConnell-\nLieberman-Kassebaum amendment are designed to give both the States and \nthe courts clear guidance as to the scope of the reforms contained in \nthe legislation.\n  The amendment does not preempt State laws that: First, place greater \nrestrictions on the amount of or standards for awarding noneconomic or \npunitive damages; second, place greater limitations on the awarding of \nattorneys fees for awards in excess of $150,000; third, permit a lower \nthreshold for the periodic payment of future damages; fourth, establish \na shorter period of time during which a health care liability action \nmay be initiated or a more restrictive rule with respect to the time at \nwhich the period of limitations begins to run, or fifth, implement \ncollateral source rule reform that either permits the introduction of \nevidence of collateral source benefits or provides for the mandatory \noffset of such benefits from damage awards.\n  The amendment also states specifically that it should not be \nconstrued to preempt any State law which: First, permits State \nofficials to commence health care liability actions; second, permits \nprovider-based dispute resolution; third, places a limit on total \ndamages awarded in a health care liability \n[[Page S5938]]  action; fourth, places a maximum limit on the time in \nwhich such an action may be initiated, or fifth, provides for defenses \nin addition to those contained in the act.\n  Last week and again yesterday, some of my colleagues argued that the \nso-called one-sided preemption provisions contained in the McConnell \namendment were both novel and, somehow, unfair. I believe these \narguments are without merit.\n  For the record, I would like to make clear that the characterization \nthat all of the preemption provisions in the legislation are ``one-\nsided'' is simply incorrect. Two examples are instructive. First, the \npreemption provisions allow State collateral source reform measures to \ndiffer widely from the provisions contained in the legislation. States \nnot only have the flexibility under the McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum \namendment to adopt evidentiary collateral source rules and mandatory \noffset rules that permit introduction of collateral source benefits \nafter trial, but may, in fact, adopt a whole range of collateral source \nrule reforms that are more favorable to claimants than those contained \nin the amendment. Second, the amendment makes clear that State laws \nlimiting attorneys fees for awards of $150,000 or less may be both more \nrestrictive than the 33\\1/3\\ percent set forth in the legislation and \nless restrictive.\n  In support of the preemption provisions contained in the McConnell-\nLieberman-Kassebaum amendment, I would like to note further the long \nhistory of this Congress in setting minimum Federal standards and \nallowing the States significant flexibility beyond those standards. \nSee, e.g., Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549; Safe \nDrinking Water Act, Pub. L. 93-523; Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. \n88-352; Americans With Disabilities Act, Pub. L. 101-336.\n  Moreover, nearly every health care reform bill introduced last \nCongress--including President Clinton's ``Health Security Act''--\ncontained this type of Federal preemption for medical liability \nreforms. See, e.g., President Clinton's Health Security Act, H.R. 3600; \nSenator Dole and Senator Packwood's health care reform bill, S. 2374; \nSenator Chafee's Health Equity Access Reform Today Act, S. 1770; \nRepresentative Cooper's Managed Competition Act, H.R. 3222; the House \nRepublican leadership plan, H.R. 3080; the bipartisan mainstream \ncoalition health bill, and the House bipartisan health reform bill.\n  Another recent and relevant example of liability reform legislation \ncontaining the type of Federal preemption language included in the \nMcConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum amendment is S. 1458, the General \nAviation Revitalization Act of 1994. That legislation provided in part \nthat no civil action for damages arising out of an accident involving a \ngeneral aviation aircraft could be brought against the manufacturer of \nthe aircraft or the manufacturer of any component part of the aircraft, \nif the accident occurred more than 18 years after the date of the \naircraft's delivery or the component part's installation. S. 1458, \nwhich passed the Senate on March 16, 1994 by a vote of 91 to 8, \npreempts State law only to the extent that such law permitted civil \nactions to be commenced after 18 years. See Public Law 103-298.\n  I believe that the underlying amendment is loyal to this tradition.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to point out that many of \nthose who oppose the preemption principles embodied in this legislation \nhave repeatedly and enthusiastically embraced those principles in other \nlegislative contexts.\n  For example, S. 7, the Family Health Insurance Protection Act, \nprovides a clear example of one-sided preemption.\n  Section 1011 provides that State laws will not be preempted only if \nthey: First, contain preexisting condition waiting periods that are \n``less than those'' established in S 7; second, limit variations in \npremium rates ``beyond the variations permitted'' in S. 7, and third, \nexpand the size of the small group market to include groups ``in excess \nof'' the size set forth in the legislation.\nction 1012 of that legislation contains even more expansive one-sided \npreemption provisions. It states that: ``Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued as prohibiting States from enacting [any] health care reform \nmeasures that exceed the measures established under this Act, including \nreforms that expand access to health care services--for example, higher \ntaxes--control health care costs, and so forth, institute tighter \n  premium caps or cost controls, and enhance the quality of care.Mr. \nPresident, as I said earlier, I do not believe there is a need for \nabsolute uniformity in this area. But I do believe it is important to \nset some very clear minimum Federal standards that all States must \nmeet.\n  The standards in the McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum amendment are only \na floor. The amendment does not preempt States from going further with \nmedical malpractice reforms they may decide are necessary. I think this \nis the best way to balance the need for some State flexibility with the \nneed for greater certainty and predictability in the system.\n                       Medical Malpractice Reform\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to make a few observations regarding \nthe effort sponsored by Senator McConnell to add comprehensive medical \nmalpractice reform to the product liability legislation currently \npending before us.\n  I was much torn about the McConnell amendment because I support \nmedical malpractice reform and believe the time has come to profoundly \nchange the current system. Yet, in the end, I decided to vote against \nthe McConnell amendment.\n  I did so because I was deeply concerned that adding this desirable \nbut controversial reform effort to the pending legislation would \ngravely endanger the cause of product liability reform, a cause I have \nsupported for many years. After many years of frustration I have real \nhope that we will achieve product liability reform in this Congress and \nI wanted to avoid any action which would endanger that hope. I would \nadd that I was persuaded in this regard by the sponsor of the product \nliability reform effort, Senator Rockefeller.\n  However, I look forward to the opportunity to fully address medical \nmalpractice reform later in this Congress when the issues can be aired \nfully and not be encumbered by the desire to achieve progress in other \nareas of legal system reform. While I do not support all the provisions \nof the McConnell amendment, I do support its thrust and would welcome \nthe opportunity to debate the issue strictly on its own merits.\n                       medical malpractice reform\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have always been a staunch supporter of \nour Federal system of government, which has as its most fundamental \nprinciple the idea that matters of governance ought to be left as much \nas possible to the States. Traditionally, one such matter left to the \nStates has been the administration of medical malpractice law.\n  By virtue of its overwhelming financial stake in the Nation's health \ncare, however, the Federal Government has a unique and compelling \ninterest in the delivery of care, and this interest leads me to support \nthe McConnell amendment on medical malpractice reform. The McConnell \namendment reforms medical malpractice law by creating certain minimum \nstandards, such as a cap on punitive damages, that will apply \nnationwide. It permits States, however, to pass more thorough-going \nreforms if they wish to do so.\n  The Federal Government is the largest purchaser of health care, and \nit finances 32 percent of the Nation's health care spending through the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, federally qualified community health \ncenters, the veterans health care, military health care, Indian health \ncare, and many other programs. In fact, the Federal Government spent \n$280.6 billion in 1993 purchasing health care services--more than for \nany other service.\n  Projections of the growth of health care expenditures continue to \nescalate, and the Federal Government's role in paying for these \nservices will also continue to grow--unless we begin to take steps to \ncontrol the rate of growth. In the meantime, we should be working on \nincreasing access to health care coverage. Savings achieved through \nmedical malpractice reform will not only save the taxpayers of America \nsignificant amounts, it will help expand access to care.\n  [[Page S5939]] Based on the experience with federally qualified \ncommunity health centers, the evidence is good that the McConnell \namendment will lead to cost savings and expanded access to care. \nCurrently, more than 500 of these community and migrant health centers \nreceive Federal funding. These centers provide essential primary care \nfor about 6 million people living in areas where there are few \nphysicians or other health care providers. In fact, we have three such \nimportant centers in Delaware--the Henrietta Johnson Community Health \nCenter in Southbridge, the West Side Community Health Center in \nWilmington, and the DelMarVa Rural Ministries in Kent County. In \nOctober 1992, Congress enacted a type of medical malpractice reform for \nfederally supported community health centers by extending the Federal \nTort Claims Act [FTCA] to cover these centers. A Government Accounting \nOffice report estimates that for calendar years 1993 through 1995, a \ntotal of $54.8 million was saved by bringing the community health \ncenters within the reach of the FTCA.\n  It is clear to me that medical malpractice reform is needed in order \nto control the Federal Government's enormous share of our national \nhealth care costs and, thus, to ensure broad access to quality care. \nThe Physician Payment Review Commission, which is charged with advising \nCongress regarding Medicare policy, has advised in its latest report \nthat Federal medical malpractice reform should be enacted. The report \nstates that ``the medical liability system does not adequately prevent \nmedical injuries or compensate injured patients. There is concern that \nthe current functioning of this system promotes the practice of \ndefensive medicine and may impede efforts to improve the cost \neffectiveness of care.'' Last year, these problems led me to vote in \nfavor of medical malpractice reform when the Senate Finance Committee \nconsidered it during its deliberations on health care reform. Because \nthe problems are with us still, this year I support the McConnell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, at noon today, Attorney General Reno made a \nformal announcement that has dismayed the Cuban people.\n  The Attorney General, speaking for the President, announced that \neffective immediately the Cubans interdicted at sea will be forcibly \nreturned to face the wrath of Fidel Castro.\n  Mr. President, of course, Mr. Castro has said he will take no \npunitive action against Cubans forcibly returned to his tyranny. But \nthe Cuban people, many of whom died before firing squads, and others \nwho languished for years as political prisoners in Castro's prisons, \nlearned the hard way the value of Mr. Castro's word.\n  Mr. President, there has been another sad and tragic moment involving \nthe Clinton administration's dealings with the Cuban people. I am \nalready receiving in my office an endless stream of telephone calls and \nfaxes from Cuban-Americans who feel they have again been betrayed by \nthe administration.\n  For more than 35 years, Mr. President, the United States has been a \nsafe haven for Cubans fleeing Castro's repressive Communist \ndictatorship. Last year, Mr. President, the Clinton administration \nbegan a reversal of this policy. Cuban Americans now appropriately fear \nthat the administration has joined hands with the Castro regime in an \neffort having the continuing effect of enslaving the people of Cuba.\n  Today's announcement, described as the result of secret negotiations \nbetween the administration and the Castro regime, is seen as a sign \nthat the United States will now work in partnership with Castro's \nbrutal security apparatus by intercepting and capturing escaping Cuban \nrefugees and turning them over directly to Castro's thugs. How sad it \nis, Mr. President, that the United States is now viewed as an \naccomplice in Castro's repression of the Cuban people.\n  Mr. President, if the United States wants to send naval vessels to \nsurround Cuba, it should not be done to cooperate with the Castro \nregime. It should be done to blockade and strangle his brutal \ndictatorship once and for all. This development is another reason why \nCongress must pass the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. In \nthe face of this vacillation, the Congress must reaffirm that United \nStates policy is to isolate and replace Fidel Castro, not to keep the \nCuban people imprisoned in Castro's tropical gulag.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of the statement issued at noon \nby the Attorney General, Ms. Reno, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Attorney General Janet Reno Regarding Cuban Migration\n\n       I would like to make an announcement regarding Cuban \n     migration.\n       It has long been the policy of the United States that \n     Cubans who wish to migrate to the United States should do so \n     by legal means. The U.S. Interests Section in Havana accepts \n     and processes requests for visas, and it also operates an in-\n     country program for those Cubans who seek refugee status for \n     entry into the United States.\n       Pursuant to this policy, last August I announced that \n     Cubans attempting irregular means of migration to the United \n     States on boats and rafts would not be allowed to enter this \n     country, but rather would be brought to the United States \n     Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, where they would be offered \n     safe haven.\n       Last September, following negotiations with representatives \n     of the Cuban government, the United States announced that it \n     would increase Cuban migration to the United States to permit \n     20,000 legal entrants per year. This program, which includes \n     immigrant visas, refugee applications, and a Special Cuban \n     Migration Program designed to broaden the pool of potential \n     entrants, is on target, and we expect to continue legal Cuban \n     migration at this level in the years to come. This year \n     alone, we expect to bring 7,000 Cuban refugees to the United \n     States through our in-country program in Havana.\n       Following recent diplomatic exchanges with the Cuban \n     government, the United States is now prepared to take another \n     important step towards regularizing Cuban migration between \n     Cuba and the United States.\n       First, with respect to Guantanamo:\n       We will continue to bring to the United States those \n     persons who are eligible for special humanitarian parole \n     under the guidelines announced by the President last October \n     and December.\n       The government of Cuba has agreed to accept all Cuban \n     nationals in Guantanamo who wish to return home, as well as \n     persons who have previously been deported from the United \n     States and persons who would be ineligible for admission to \n     the United States because of criminal record, medical, \n     physical, or mental condition, or commission of acts of \n     violence while at Guantanamo.\n       All other Cubans in the safe haven will be considered for \n     entry into the United States on a case-by-case basis as \n     ``Special Guantanamo Entrants'', bearing in mind the impact \n     of paroles on state and local economies and the need for \n     adequate sponsorships. As has been true for all Cubans and \n     Haitians previously paroled into the United States from \n     Guantanamo, sponsorship and resettlement assistance will be \n     obtained prior to entry. The number of these ``Special \n     Guantanamo Entrants'' admitted to the United States will be \n     credited against the 20,000 annual Cuban migration figure, \n     beginning in September of this year, at the rate of 5,000 per \n     year (regardless of when the Special Guantanamo Entrants are \n     admitted).\n       Second, with regard to future irregular migration:\n       Effective immediately, Cuban migrants intercepted at sea \n     attempting to enter the United States, or who enter \n     Guantanamo illegally, will be taken to Cuba, where U.S. \n     consular officers will assist those who wish to apply to come \n     to the United States through already established mechanisms. \n     Cubans must know that the only way to come to the United \n     States is by applying in Cuba.\n       All returnees will be permitted to apply for refugee status \n     at the U.S. Interests Sections in Havana. Cuba is one of only \n     three countries in the world in which the United States \n     conducts in-country processing for refugees. The Government \n     of Cuba has committed to the Government of the United States \n     that on one will suffer reprisals, lose benefits, or be \n     prejudiced in any manner, either because he or she sought to \n     depart irregularly or because he or she has applied for \n     refugee status at the U.S. Interests Section. The Cuban \n     Government made a similar commitment in the context of the \n     September 1994 agreement, and we are satisfied that it has \n     been honored. Moreover, the Government of Cuba will permit \n     monitoring by U.S. consular officers of the treatment of all \n     returnees.\n       Migrants intercepted at sea or in Guantanamo will be \n     advised that they will be taken back to Cuba, where U.S. \n     consular officials will meet them at the dock and assist \n     those who wish to apply for refugee admission to the United \n     States at the Interests Section in Havana. They will be told \n     that the Government of Cuba has provided a commitment to the \n     United States Government that they will suffer no adverse \n     consequences or reprisals of any sort, and that U.S. consular \n     officers will monitor their treatment. They will also be told \n     that those persons who seek resettlement in the United States \n     as refugees must use the in-country refugee program.\n       Measures will be taken to ensure that persons who claim a \n     genuine need for protection which they believe cannot be \n     satisfied by applying at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana \n     will be examined before return.\n       Cubans who reach the United States through irregular means \n     will be placed in exclusion proceedings, detained, and \n     treated as are all illegal migrants from other countries.\n       The United States Government reiterates its opposition to \n     the use of violence in connection with departure from Cuba \n     and its determination to prosecute cases of hijacking and \n     alien smuggling.\n       These new procedures represent another important step \n     towards regularizing migration procedures with Cuba, finding \n     a humanitarian solution to the situation at Guantanamo, and \n     preventing another uncontrolled and dangerous outflow from \n     Cuba.\n       The United States policy towards Cuba remains the same. We \n     remain committed to the Cuban Democracy Act and its central \n     goal--promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. \n     We will continue to enforce the economic embargo to pressure \n     the Cuban regime to reform. We will continue to reach out to \n     the Cuban people through private humanitarian assistance and \n     through the free flow of ideas and information to strengthen \n     Cuba's fledgling civil society. And we remain ready to \n     respond in carefully calibrated ways to meaningful steps \n     toward political and economic reform in Cuba.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it had not been my intention to speak at \nthis moment but I happened to be on the floor and heard the Senator \nfrom North Carolina. I would like, if I could, to put \n[[Page S5943]]  in context what the Attorney General announced at noon \ntoday.\n  The first component of the announcement was that the United States \nwould adopt a new policy relative to those detainees who are currently \nbeing held at the naval station at Guantanamo Bay. For some background, \nin the late summer and early fall of 1994, a large exodus of Cubans \ncommenced from that island and were interdicted by United States Coast \nGuard and some military vessels. The decision was made by the U.S. \nGovernment at that time to establish a safe haven at Guantanamo Naval \nStation, to which in excess of 30,000 persons who had been interdicted \nat sea were subsequently taken.\n  In September 1994, the United States Government, as part of what has \nbeen a continuing negotiation with the Cuban Government, held \nnegotiations on the specific and limited and singular topic of \nimmigration. As a result of that, an agreement was reached. Parts of \nthat agreement provided that the United States would provide no less \nthan 20,000 visas per year for Cubans wishing to come legally to the \nUnited States, and would do so through a process administered by the \nUnited States interest section in Havana. Also, as part of that \nagreement, the Cuban Government agreed to undertake those steps which \nwould be necessary in order to prevent a continuation or restart of a \nmass exodus from Cuba.\n  Over time, the U.S. Government determined that there were three \ncategories of persons at Guantanamo who deserved to be granted parole \nin the United States, those three being families with children, the \nelderly, and those who had serious medical problems. Under those three \ncategories of parole, approximately 7,000 to 8,000 persons have been \nparoled into the United States thus far. There are another 2,000 to \n3,000 to be paroled into the United States. That will leave at \nGuantanamo a population of approximately 15,000, plus or minus, which \nwill be composed largely of single males, older adolescents, and young \nadults.\n  Over the past several months, there has been growing concern about \nwhat will happen at Guantanamo when we end up with that population. \nRecently, first privately and increasingly publicly, the \nrepresentatives of the U.S. military--including General Sheehan, who is \nthe Commander, Atlantic Command, which has responsibility for the U.S. \nmilitary interests in the Caribbean--indicated that they felt it would \nbe a very serious situation with potential for riots or other major \nunrest.\n  I personally have visited Guantanamo twice since it has been a \nprincipal safe haven for at one time Haitians, then mixed Haitians and \nCubans, and now primarily Cubans. I concur, as a lay person, in what I \nobserved at Guantanamo: It is a very stark environment. Many would \nthink Guantanamo would look like their vision of a Caribbean island. It \nis not. It is a very formidable, rocky, dry, arid place where cactus is \nmore prominent than palm trees. There is great concern about the \npotential of having a large number of persons of a young male status, \nwithout any hope or expectations for their future, being detained for \nan extended period under those circumstances.\n  I might say, this Senate spoke to that issue itself just a few weeks \nago when the Department of Defense requested a supplemental \nappropriation of over $50 million in order to enhance the conditions at \nGuantanamo--things like putting in permanent showers and bathroom \nfacilities where currently portable facilities are being utilized. The \nSenate elected not to fund that supplemental appropriation and \nexpressed in its declination to do so the need for the United States to \ndetermine what its long-term policy was going to be relative to the \ndetainees at Guantanamo.\n  So we have had the opportunity as a Senate to speak on this issue, \nand what we said to the administration was: Come up with a policy of \nhow to deal with this situation before we commit an additional $50 \nmillion on top of the $1 million a day we are spending in order to \nmaintain the population which is currently at Guantanamo.\n  Another part of this very unfortunate situation was the fact that \nthere is great concern in the United States about the increasing number \nof immigrants. What seemed to be a strategy that would try to maximize \nthe positives and minimize what are inherently going to be negatives in \nthis situation was a policy that said let us take some of those 20,000 \nvisas a year we are committed to offer through the interest section in \nHavana, and let us shift those to Guantanamo and assign those to those \npersons who, on a case-by-case basis, can meet the standards of entry \nto the United States. That has seemed to me for a number of months to \nbe a rational policy, one not without risk or problems, but better than \na set of unhappy other alternatives that face the United States.\n  I am pleased the administration did not wait until we had a riot at \nGuantanamo in order to act; that the administration essentially took \nthe direction which this Senate had given, to state what our long-term \npolicy was going to be vis-a-vis Guantanamo. That policy will be that \nover the next 3 years, we will shift visas from the interest section in \nHavana to Guantanamo, to begin the process of depopulating Guantanamo. \nThose who meet our standards will receive one of the visas for entry to \nthe United States. Those who do not meet our standards will be sent \nback to Cuba.\n  The major concern about that policy was the concern that is referred \nto as remagnetizing Guantanamo. If you depopulate Guantanamo through \nthis process but in the course of that you create such a strong impetus \nfor people to go to Guantanamo and it refills, then you are back to \nwhere you are today.\n  The Cuban Government has restated its commitment of last September; \nthat is, that it will enforce against mass exodus from the island. The \nUnited States, now having said we will not take people to Guantanamo as \na safe haven, the policy which the Attorney General announced today is \nthat those persons who are interdicted at sea will be given an on-board \nscreening at sea to determine if they have a legitimate claim of \npolitical asylum.\n  If they have such a legitimate claim for political asylum, they will \nbe given a special processing commensurate with that status and with \nour history of humanitarian outreach to political asylees and our \nobligations under international law.\n  If they do not meet that standard, then they will be returned \ndirectly to Cuba. That is a provision of this which causes great \nconcern to many people, including myself. I recognize the long history \nthat the United States has had relative to a special relationship with \nthe people of Cuba. This policy was taken as what was considered to be \na necessary backstop to the steps to depopulate Guantanamo without, in \nthe process of depopulating, creating the very impetus that would \nrepopulate it.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the legislation that the Senator \nfrom North Carolina has introduced. I was the principal Senate sponsor \nof the Cuban Democracy Act, which today represents the basis of United \nStates policy toward Cuba. That policy, as the President stated, is \nunchanged. That policy is one of economic and political isolation of \nCuba as the most appropriate United States policy for purposes of \nclosing down the 35-year nightmare which Fidel Castro has represented \nto the people of Cuba.\n  It is a policy that says we will outline with specificity and with \ncompassion what our policy will be toward the people of Cuba during \nthis reign of terror of Fidel Castro, and we will stipulate what our \npolicy will be upon Castro's fall, to reintegrate a democratic and free \nCuba into the international family of peace-loving nations and \neliminate the one blotch that remains on the map of democracies of the \nWestern Hemisphere, which is Cuba.\n  That was the essence of the Cuban Democracy Act. The legislation \nwhich I am cosponsoring with the Senator from North Carolina extends \nthose principles toward the same goal of a rapid, hopefully peaceful \ntransition of Cuba from the tyranny that exists today to a free and \ndemocratic government.\n  The decision the President made today was a difficult one. It \nrepresents a selection among a series of difficult choices. I respect \nthe fact he did not wait for a crisis to make the decision. He has made \nit firmly. He has done what will achieve, I think, the maximum national \nsecurity benefits to the \n[[Page S5944]]  United States in terms of our military base at \nGuantanamo.\n  The U.S. Department of Defense supported this proposition. It will \nallow Guantanamo to return to its role as an important part of our \nhemispheric security. It will not serve as a magnet for future buildup \nand diversion from its military use. It will stop almost $1 million a \nday of expenditure that we have been making at Guantanamo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there were some difficult decisions that \nhad to be made around that core judgment. The result of the series of \ndecisions will be: First that there will be no increase of total Cuban \nimmigration into the United States, legal Cuban immigration, beyond \nthat to which the United States was already committed.\n  Second, that immigration will now come from two streams, partially \nfrom Havana and partially from those persons who are at Guantanamo.\n  Third, the American people will be assured that only people from \neither place--Havana or Guantanamo--who will enter the United States \nwill be those who meet our standards for entry.\n  Fourth, steps have been taken to demagnetize Guantanamo for further \npopulation buildup.\n  Within that policy, the American principle of recognition of \npolitical asylum and provision for those persons who seek freedom to \nmake the case that they are seeking freedom out of the basis of a \nlegitimate fear of political persecution will be maintained. They will \nbe afforded that opportunity. The Attorney General outlined in summary \nform today what those steps will be.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership which the President \nhas taken in making a difficult decision. I believe this Senate should \nappreciate the fact that he has responded to our request for leadership \non this matter; that the U.S. Department of Defense will now be able to \nreturn its personnel and facilities to their intended purpose of \nsecurity of the United States; and that we will be able to say that our \npolicy of respecting human rights, and particularly respecting the \nrights of those claiming political asylum, will be maintained.\n  They are difficult choices, but in my judgment, choices that had to \nbe made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge the \nSenate to consider the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon \nGeneral, to consider that nomination ultimately on the Senate floor. I \nurge that this be done for two reasons: First, out of basic fairness to \nDr. Foster and, second, as an important sign that men and women can \nplace themselves up for nomination for important positions without fear \nof being, in effect, railroaded out of town without having an \nopportunity for their positions and their cases and their records to be \nheard.\n  This morning, Dr. Foster testified before the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources and the preliminary reports are that Dr. Foster has \nbeen an impressive witness on his own behalf. After Dr. Foster's name \nwas submitted for the position of Surgeon General, I met with him \nextensively to discuss his record, after having reviewed his \neducational record, his record as a practicing physician, the work that \nhe had done against teenage pregnancy, the work he had done for poor \npeople, and the work he had done in a community context.\n  Let us strip away the facade, Mr. President. What has really occurred \non Dr. Foster's nomination is an objection to his having performed \nabortions, and it seems to me that when Dr. Foster has performed \nabortions, however many, a medical procedure permitted by the U.S. \nConstitution, that ought not to be a reason for his disqualification.\n  Before any other consideration had arisen as to issues about \nperforming hysterectomies or an issue about syphilis in studies of \nAfrican-Americans or the question about how many abortions he had \nperformed, there was an immediate cry that Dr. Foster was disqualified \nbecause he had performed abortions.\n  I think that is totally inappropriate, that is just wrong, to \ndisqualify a nominee for Surgeon General because that person has \nperformed a medical procedure which is permitted by the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  With respect to the issue of how many abortions he had performed and \nwhat information had come from the White House--and it appears at one \npoint the White House made a representation of only one abortion; that \nwas not what Dr. Foster had represented--that ought not to be held \nagainst him and ought not to be a smokescreen or a red herring for \nsaying that he is disqualified. Whatever Dr. Foster has said about the \nnumber of abortions, that ought to be a question for the full Senate to \nconsider. And whatever the contentions are about the performance of \nhysterectomies or about the syphilis testing on African Americans, that \nagain is a question for consideration by the full Senate.\n  Now, I know, Mr. President, there have been statements by some that \nthey are going to filibuster the nomination. Well, if they choose to \nfilibuster the nomination, so be it. Let us have it out on the Senate \nfloor. And there are some who say that if the nomination is voted out \nby committee, and it is not brought to the floor, they are going to tie \nup the Senate. I do not think we need those kinds of threats for the \nSenate to consider its business and decide whether Dr. Henry Foster is \nqualified to be Surgeon General.\n  It is my hope that the committee will report Dr. Foster to the floor \nfor consideration by the Senate, and that can be done in a variety of \nways. It can be done on an affirmative vote by a majority saying he is \nqualified, it could be done on a vote by the committee saying that he \nought to be considered without recommendation, or it can even be done \nif the committee votes Dr. Foster down, as we have had with nominees. \nJudge Bork was voted down by the committee but it was voted to the \nSenate floor. Or Judge Thomas, later Justice Thomas, was a tie vote in \nthe committee and was voted to the Senate floor.\n  It seems to me, in fairness to Dr. Foster, he ought to be considered \nby the full Senate, and in fairness to the system where we are asking \npeople to come to Washington under very difficult circumstances as a \nmatter of precedent somebody ought not to be, in effect, railroaded out \nof town without having the Senate consider his nomination.\n  So as this matter is being considered today by the committee, I \nwanted to make these comments because the core question here, Mr. \nPresident, stripped away from all the subterfuge, stripped away from \nall the smoke, stripped away from all the red herrings is whether Dr. \nFoster ought to be disqualified for performing abortions, however many, \na medical procedure authorized by the U.S. Constitution. I think the \nSenate ought to face up to that squarely. If the balance of the \ntestimony shows qualification, as I think it will, based upon my \nexamination of the record and my detailed conversations with Dr. Foster \nin questioning of him, then I think he ought to be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5944-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

OSCAR TREVINO, JR., 1995 TEXAS SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to recognize the leadership of \na small business person in my State who is being honored today by the \nSmall Business Administration as the Small Business Person of the Year \nin Texas.\n  Mr. Oscar Trevino, Jr. is president of J.L. Steel, Inc. He is what \nAmerica is all about, Mr. President. He took a company, J.L. Steel, \nfrom $400,000 in revenues in the first year, in 1989, and built that \ncompany to over $13 million in revenues last year. It is the fifth \nfastest growing Hispanic-owned company in the United States.\n  I am really proud of this Texan. He has really added to the economic \nvitality of our community in that he now has 140 employees that are \nworking and paying taxes and are good citizens of our State. I am very \npleased to honor him today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that his biography be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Biography of T. Oscar Trevino, Jr.\n\n       It was 1989, and Oscar Trevino was comfortable with his \n     company care and steady paycheck. He and neighbor Jan La \n     Point were chatting on the lawn after dinner, while the kids \n     played out front. It seems that Jan was having trouble \n     expanding her two-year-old company, and Oscar was interested.\n       Before he realized it, he had worked out a business plan on \n     his computer, and they were in business as J.L. Steel. Oscar \n     borrowed against his retirement account, his credit cards and \n     from family to become 51 percent owner of the firm. From \n     $400,000 in revenues that first year, J.L. Steel has grown to \n     nearly $13.6 million in revenues last year, making it the \n     fifth fastest-growing Hispanic-owned company in the United \n     States, with an annual growth rate of 235 percent.\n       J.L. Steel installs reinforced steel in highways, bridges \n     and buildings. The firm competes for government and private \n     contracts in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, and satisfies its \n     customers with reliable estimates, quality workmanship and \n     attention to detail in the reams of accompanying paperwork. \n     The firm has called on the SBA twice: in 1992 for a loan \n     guarantee to finance growth and again in 1993, when it was \n     certified as an 8(a) contractor, allowing it to compete for \n     jobs from the federal government.\n       Oscar himself started out as a laborer, working summers for \n     a major general-contracting firm while he earned a civil \n     engineering degree from Texas A He stayed with the firm \n     after he graduated in 1978, advancing to become project \n     manager by 1989. He hasn't forgotten how difficult it can be \n     for others, and J.L. Steel has an aggressive equal-\n     opportunity policy.\n       Oscar supports fledgling companies by helping them with \n     marketing, construction practices and subcontracting \n     opportunities. His tireless advocacy work on behalf of \n     minority- and women-owned businesses includes work on various \n     boards and committees, including the Dallas Minority Business \n     Enterprise Advisory Committee and the Disadvantaged Business \n     Enterprise Support Services program of the Texas Engineering \n     Extension Service. He also helped the Association of General \n     Contractors of Texas develop and promote fair and equitable \n     goals, and training and apprenticeship programs for \n     minorities and women.\n\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the introduction of S. \n743 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) punitive damages are imposed pursuant to vague, \n     subjective, and often retrospective standards of liability, \n     and these standards vary from State to State;\n       (2) the magnitude and unpredictability of punitive damage \n     awards in civil actions have increased dramatically over the \n     last 40 years, unreasonably inflating the cost of settling \n     litigation, and discouraging socially useful and productive \n     activity;\n       (3) excessive, arbitrary, and unpredictable punitive damage \n     awards impair and burden commerce, imposing unreasonable and \n     unjustified costs on consumers, taxpayers, governmental \n     entities, large and small businesses, volunteer \n     organizations, and nonprofit entities;\n       (4) products and services originating in a State with \n     reasonable punitive damage provisions are still subject to \n     excessive punitive damage awards because claimants have an \n     economic incentive to bring suit in States in which punitive \n     damage awards are arbitrary and inadequately controlled;\n       (5) because of the national scope of the problems created \n     by excessive, arbitrary, and unpredictable punitive damage \n     awards, it is not possible for the several States to enact \n     laws that fully and effectively respond to the national \n     economic and constitutional problems created by punitive \n     damages; and\n       (6) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n     that punitive damages can produce grossly excessive, wholly \n     unreasonable, and often arbitrary punishment, and therefore \n     raise serious constitutional due process concerns.\n       (b) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, in any civil action whose subject matter affects \n     commerce brought in any Federal or State court on any theory, \n     punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable \n     State law, be awarded against a defendant only if the \n     claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that \n     the harm that is the subject of the action was the result of \n     conduct by the defendant that was either--\n       (1) specifically intended to cause harm; or\n       (2) carried out with conscious, flagrant disregard to the \n     rights or safety of others.\n       (c) Proportional Awards.--The amount of punitive damages \n     that may be awarded to a \n     [[Page S5946]]  claimant in any civil action subject to this \n     section shall not exceed 2 times the sum of--\n       (1) the amount awarded to the claimant for economic loss; \n     and\n       (2) the amount awarded to the claimant for noneconomic \n     loss.\n     This subsection shall be applied by the court and the \n     application of this subsection shall not be disclosed to the \n     jury.\n       (d) Bifurcation.--At the request of any party, the trier of \n     fact shall consider in a separate proceeding whether punitive \n     damages are to be awarded and the amount of such an award. If \n     a separate proceeding is requested--\n       (1) evidence relevant only to the claim of punitive \n     damages, as determined by applicable State law, shall be \n     inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \n     compensatory damages are to be awarded; and\n       (2) evidence admissible in the punitive damages proceeding \n     may include evidence of the defendant's profits, if any, from \n     its alleged wrongdoing.\n       (e) Applicability.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States, or by any State, under any \n     law;\n       (2) create any cause of action or any right to punitive \n     damages;\n       (3) supersede or alter any Federal law;\n       (4) preempt, supersede, or alter any State law to the \n     extent that such law would further limit the availability or \n     amount of punitive damages;\n       (5) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (6) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign \n     nation; or\n       (7) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of inconvenient forum.\n       (f) Federal Cause of Action Precluded.--Nothing in this \n     section shall confer jurisdiction on the Federal district \n     courts of the United States under section 1331 or 1337 of \n     title 28, United States Code, over any civil action covered \n     under this section.\n       (g) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) The term ``claimant'' means any person who brings a \n     civil action and any person on whose behalf such an action is \n     brought. If such action is brought through or on behalf of an \n     estate, the term includes the decedent. If such action is \n     brought through or on behalf of a minor or incompetent, the \n     term includes the legal guardian of the minor or incompetent.\n       (2) The term ``clear and convincing evidence'' means that \n     measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of \n     the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth \n     of the allegations sought to be established. The level of \n     proof required to satisfy such standard shall be more than \n     that required under preponderance of the evidence, and less \n     than that required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       (3) The term ``commerce'' means commerce between or among \n     the several States, or with foreign nations.\n       (4)(A) The term ``economic loss'' means any objectively \n     verifiable monetary losses resulting from the harm suffered, \n     including past and future medical expenses, loss of past and \n     future earnings, burial costs, costs of repair or \n     replacement, costs of replacement services in the home, \n     including child care, transportation, food preparation, and \n     household care, costs of making reasonable accommodations to \n     a personal residence, loss of employment, and loss of \n     business or employment opportunities, to the extent recovery \n     for such losses is allowed under applicable State law.\n       (B) The term ``economic loss'' shall not include \n     noneconomic loss.\n       (5) The term ``harm'' means any legally cognizable wrong or \n     injury for which damages may be imposed.\n       (6)(A) The term ``noneconomic loss'' means subjective, \n     nonmonetary loss resulting from harm, including pain, \n     suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional \n     distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of \n     consortium, injury to reputation, and humiliation.\n       (B) The term ``noneconomic loss'' shall not include \n     economic loss or punitive damages.\n       (7) The term ``punitive damages'' means damages awarded \n     against any person or entity to punish such person or entity \n     or to deter such person or entity, or others, from engaging \n     in similar behavior in the future.\n       (8) The term ``State'' means any State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, and any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any of the \n     foregoing.\n       (h) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to any civil \n     action in which trial has not commenced before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment--Senator Exon \nis a cosponsor, as are Senators Hatch, McConnell, Abraham, Kyl, Thomas, \nHutchison, and Gramm.\n  This is an amendment that offers needed protections from lawsuit \nabuse to every American--small business or large; volunteer or \ncharitable organizations. The spectre of lawsuit abuse hangs over us \nall, and our amendment would expand the protections in the Gorton \nsubstitute to ensure that every American is covered.\n  The bill as it now stands calls for limiting punitive damages in \nproduct liability cases to three times economic damages, or $250,000, \nwhichever is greater.\n  This amendment makes two changes: It would extend the limits on \npunitive damages beyond product liability to all civil cases; and it \nwould provide a rule of proportionality that limits punitive damages to \ntwo times compensatory damages; that is, any economic and noneconomic \ndamages combined.\n  This amendment is needed because our Nation desperately needs broadly \nbased relief from lawsuit abuse.\n  America's litigation tax--the tort tax--hurts every American; at \nleast every American who is not a personal injury lawyer.\n  Anyone who cares about middle-class American families, consumers, and \nworkers would want that litigation tax reduced.\n  We all know the numbers: $20 in the cost of an ordinary $100 step \nladder goes to the litigation tax, as does one-sixth of the price of an \n$18,000 pacemaker and $8 of an $11.50 DPT childhood vaccine.\n  The litigation tax is a\n   national ``value subtracted'' tax--$1,200 on every American, rich or \npoor, with nothing received in return.\n\n  And where does that money go? According to a 1986 Rand Corp. study, \nless than half ends up with those who are suing. Most goes to trial \nexpenses and particularly to lawyers.\n  In other words, the litigation tax takes income right out of the \nmiddle-class family's pocket and puts it into the pockets of one of the \nwealthiest groups in America--personal injury lawyers.\n  Even worse, just the fear of litigation has led to the canceling of \nlife-saving research and product improvements in many fields. Companies \nare afraid of being sued over anything that is new and this has made \nAmerica less safe.\n  In other words, the biggest cost of the litigation tax may be \nmeasured, not in dollars, but in lives.\n  The underlying bill goes a long way toward reducing the abuses we \ncurrently suffer. But, in my view, it leaves many deserving \norganizations and small businesses outside its protective scope.\n  The litigation tax is paid, not just by consumers who buy products, \nbut by every nonprofit organization, every small business, every \nmunicipality in the Nation--and those who depend on the services they \nprovide.\n  This amendment will free our nonprofit organizations, small \nbusinesses, and local governments to serve America without first \nserving up a tribute to personal injury lawyers.\n  We do not have to look far to count the costs of the litigation tax \nto nonprofits, small businesses, and municipalties--and to the rest of \nAmerica.\n  For example, the head of the Girls Scout Council of the Nation's \nCapital Area wrote this to House leaders during the debate over there:\n\n       Locally, we must sell 87,000 boxes of cookies each year to \n     pay for liability insurance. We have no diving boards at our \n     camps. We will never own horses. And, many local schools will \n     no longer provide meeting space for our volunteers.\n\n  The chief executive officer of Little League Baseball, Dr. Creighton \nHale, has issued a similar plea.\n  Writing in the Wall Street Journal recently, Dr. Hale reported that, \nas he put it:\n\n       In recent years, litigation has been the end result of two \n     boys colliding in the outfield [the two picked themselves up \n     and sued the coach]. * * * In still another case--\n\n  He continued:\n\n       A man and woman won a cash settlement when the woman was \n     hit by a ball a player failed to catch. The player was her \n     daughter.\n  Dr. Hale says:\n\n       The costs of this litigation lunacy score out * * * in \n     bewildered dads calling our offices asking about personal \n     liability, and volunteer coaches waking up to the fact that \n     they're taking major league risks.\n\n  And he added:\n\n       It's a problem common to all nonprofit organizations and \n     the volunteers they depend on.\n\n  [[Page S5947]] This is not even close to being in the ballpark of \nwhat most people think of when we think of justice in America.\n  Mr. President, legal speculators have declared war on American \nvolunteerism, entrepreneurship, and local government--the institutions \nthat make for strong communities and a better America.\n  Expanding the limits on punitive damages to all civil suits will help \nend the legal speculators' war on these institutions. It will help \nreturn justice to the law. It will reach into every home and school and \ntown board and small business and community group in the Nation.\n  It will tell them that they need not fear for their financial \nsecurity when they venture outside their home to help a neighbor or \nopen a small business.\n  It will tell them the siege is over.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that this is a very, very important \namendment to the substitute. It is one that I hope my colleagues will \nlook at very, very carefully.\n  I would certainly be willing to enter into a time agreement on this \namendment. We would like to finish action on the punitive damage \namendment today, as well as a joint and several liability amendment. I \nhope we can reach some time agreement. I state that now so that my \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue, perhaps we can negotiate a \ntime agreement later this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment to S. 565.\n  This amendment would, in effect, extend the punitive damage provision \nof S. 565 for product liability actions to all civil actions. The \nsubject matter affects interstate commerce brought in State or Federal \ncourts.\n  Our system of civil justice is broken, in the eyes of many people. \nThe American people do deserve better. They deserve change. They \ndeserve some common sense in our legal system.\n  I hope we can pass this amendment, along with some others, and send \nS. 565 to the President for his signature.\n  Let me be clear: The pending amendment helps volunteer organizations, \ntowns, cities, counties, States, farmers, small businesses, \ntransportation companies, convenience stores, blood banks, school \nboards, as well as product manufacturers. This amendment is \nproconsumer.\n  The pending amendment focuses on one aspect of our civil justice \nsystem: Punitive damages. Punitive damages are not awarded to \ncompensate a victim of wrongdoing. These damages constitute punishment \nin an effort to deter future egregious misconduct.\n  Punitive damage reform is not about shielding wrongdoers from \nliability, nor does such reform prevent victims of wrongdoing from \nbeing rightfully compensated for their injuries or for their damages. \nSafeguards are needed to protect against abuse in the form of punitive \ndamages.\n  In a 1994 opinion authored by Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court \nnoted that punitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary \ndeprivation of property. That was the Honda Motor Co. case.\n  More than that, our current punitive damage system harms consumers. I \nwish all of my colleagues could have heard the testimony of George L. \nPriest, who appeared before the Judiciary Committee on April 4 of this \nyear. Mr. Priest is a professor of law and economics at the Yale Law \nSchool and has taught in the area of tort law, product liability and \ndamages for 21 years, for the last 15 years at Yale.\n  Since 1982, he has been the director of the Yale Law School program \nin civil liability. He has studied jury verdicts extensively, and he \ndid not appear before the committee on behalf of any client, interest, \nor group.\n  Professor Priest testified, ``The reform of punitive damages alone, \neven reforms that would cap punitive damages or introduce a \nproportionality cap, will help consumers.''\n  I note that the amendment before Members embodies a proportionality \nprinciple for punitive damages. I will return to Professor Priest's \nremarks later in my remarks and to this point later.\n  Let me give examples of what is wrong. This past September, an \nAlabama Supreme Court upheld a multimillion dollar punitive damage \naward against an automobile distributor who failed to inform a buyer \nthat his new vehicle had been refinished to cure superficial paint \ndamage. The amount expended to refinish this automobile, $601, was less \nthan 3 percent of the vehicle's suggested price. A number of States do \nnot require disclosure of repairs costing below a 3 percent threshold. \nIndeed, Alabama later adopted such a minimum threshold statute after \nthe events which occurred in this case.\n  The victim was a purchaser of a $40,000 automobile. Nine months after \nhis purchase, he took his vehicle to Slick Finish, an independent \nautomobile detailing shop, to make the car look ``snazzier'' than it \nnormally does--to use his terms. He was not then dissatisfied with the \nvehicle's look and had not previously noticed any problems with the \ncar's finish. It was then that he was told by the detailer of the \npartial refinishing.\n  As a result of the discovery, he sued the automobile dealer, the \nNorth American distributor, and the manufacturer for fraud and breach \nof contract. He also sought an award for punitive damages. He won and \nhe did hit the jackpot.\n  At trial, the jury was allowed to assess damages for each of the \npartially refinished vehicles that had been sold throughout the United \nStates for a period of 10 years. The jury returned a verdict of $4,000 \nin compensatory damages. It also returned a verdict of $4 million in \npunitive damages.\n  On appeal to the State Supreme Court, the punitive damages award was \nreduced to $2 million, applicable only to the North American \ndistributor. The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted this case for review \nof the constitutionality of the $2 million punitive damage award.\n  There is some indication that the law, though, did not permit that \ntype of an award but the court decided anyway that they would halve the \naward from $4 million to $2 million.\n  My colleagues want to know why Americans are fed up with the civil \njustice system? I defy any Member of this body to read the opinion in \nthis case and tell the American people that justice was done.\n  Why does it matter? In this case, it is not the purchasers of $40,000 \nautomobiles that I am so concerned about, although they are consumers \ntoo. But the North American distributor of this automobile, spending \ntens of thousands of dollars in fees to defend a lawsuit over a $601 \npaint refinishing, and subject to a ridiculous $2 million punitive \ndamage award, employs our constituents. Many of those employees cannot \nafford such expensive cars--nor can they afford such ridiculous results \nfrom our legal system. If the cost of business goes up, that cost will \nget passed on, and a business can only raise prices so far before its \nproduct becomes uncompetitive. At some point, that business will have \nto reduce its payroll. Who makes out like bandits from this case? The \npurchaser of a car with a $601 refinished paint job and, of course, his \nlawyer. I mean, punitive damages, for this case? And 2 million dollars' \nworth?\n  I should also note that this same defendant can be sued again and \nagain for punitive damages by every owner of a partially refinished \nvehicle. In fact, according to defense counsel, the same plaintiff's \nattorney has filed 24 other similar lawsuits. No surprise there.\n  As a further note about this fiasco, in one of those other cases, the \njury awarded no punitive damages. The very same conduct by the \ndefendant and in one case, it is socked with $2 million in punitive \ndamages and in another case zero punitive damages. Who knows what the \nlitigation lottery will bring in the other, similar cases.\n  Let us look at another example. The September 26, 1994, National Law \nJournal, has a headline reading: ``Blockbuster Busted for $123.6 \nMillion.''\n  A Dallas, TX, judge ordered Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Video \nSuperstores Master LP, and an individual to pay $14.7 million in \ndamages and interest and $108.9 million in punitive damages to an \nindividual investor. Why?\n  [[Page S5948]] In 1986, the investor invested in the first \nBlockbuster franchises, and according to his attorney, ``he was \nsupposed to be included in the sale when the general partner sold.'' \nBut the plaintiff-investor was not informed when such a sale was made. \nHe charged the three defendants with breach of fiduciary duty and \nfraud. Aside from the $14.7 million in damages and interest, as \nmentioned earlier, the judge assessed just over $36 million in punitive \ndamages to each of the three defendants, or an astonishing $108.9 \nmillion in punitive damages assessed against the defendants.\n  If the defendants in this case did breach their fiduciary duty and \ncommit fraud, the plaintiff should be made whole. The pending amendment \nwould not alter anyone's right to such a recovery.\n  But is this a case where punitive damages should also be imposed for \nthe wrong? Moreover, after over $10 million in actual damages and \nnearly $4 million in interest, is there a further deterrent effect by \nimposing punitive damages? I do not have all of the facts, and I \nunderstand the case is under appeal. But even if punitive damages are \nappropriate, is it sensible to impose nearly 109 million dollars' \nworth, or over 7 times the award of damages and interest? I might add, \nif this plaintiff could meet the substantive standard of the pending \namendment, the amendment itself would allow over $30 million in \npunitive damages. Frankly, that is an astronomical award itself, yet \ncritics of this amendment argue that it is penurious.\n  My colleagues should understand, as the American people do, such \nawards impose costs. Prices on goods and services can be affected, \nwages and benefits paid to employees and the level of employment itself \ncan be affected. The availability of goods and services can be \naffected.\n  Let me go back to Alabama, for yet another case, demonstrating the \nlack of common sense in our current civil justice system giving rise to \nthis amendment. Indeed, this example is so outrageous, I will simply \nquote, at some length, the well-considered testimony of Professor \nPriest, at our April 4, 1995, hearing. This is from his written \nstatement:\n\n       In the case Gallant v. Prudential, decided this past April \n     1994, Iran and Leslie Gallant sued Prudential Life Insurance \n     Company based on the actions of a Prudential agent. The \n     Gallant's had purchased a combination life insurance-annuity \n     policy with a $25,000 face value at a monthly premium of \n     roughly $39.00. At the time of sale, the agent had told them \n     that the value of the annuity was roughly twice what in fact \n     it was; the agent had added together the table indicating \n     ``Projected Return'' with the table indicating the lower \n     ``Guaranteed Return.'' A jury found this action fraudulent \n     and held the agent liable and Prudential separately liable \n     for failing to better supervise the agent.\n\n  Professor Priest goes on to say:\n\n       Fortunately, the problem was discovered before either the \n     policyholder had died or had retired to receive the annuity. \n     Thus, to the time of trial, there was no true economic loss \n     beyond the failed expectation of the larger future return. I \n     have carefully read the transcript of the testimony, and the \n     Gallants testified that, between the time that they \n     discovered the misinformation and Prudential called them to \n     offer a remedy (Prudential offered to return their premiums \n     or to discuss adjusting the policy), they had suffered \n     roughly two weeks of sleepless nights and substantial anger \n     at having been misled. That was the extent of their ``mental \n     anguish''.\n       Twenty years ago, I taught cases of this nature in a course \n     entitled Restitution, in which the appropriate remedy was \n     restitution of all paid premiums or out-of-pocket costs. On \n     very rare occasions such as especially egregious actions by a \n     defendant, some courts considered awarding plaintiffs the \n     benefit of the bargains, say, by increasing their annuity \n     benefits.\n       Our modern world has changed: After a one and one-half day \n     trial, an Alabama jury awarded the Gallants damages equal to \n     $30,000 in economic loss; $400,000 in mental anguish; and $25 \n     million in punitive damages.\n\n  Again the face value of the policy was only $25,000, and they had not \nyet qualified to receive that. Think about it. A $25,000 policy, the \nagent made a mistake, they have 2 weeks of alleged sleepless nights, \nthey were angry for much of that time, and they got $30,000 in economic \nloss, $400,000 for their 2 weeks of sleepless nights and anger, and $25 \nmillion in punitive damages.\n  Professor Priest said:\n\n       I do not wish to minimize the harm to the Gallants, \n     especially the indignity of the misrepresentation, nor to \n     condone the fraudulent actions of the agent, apparently \n     perpetrated on several other Alabama citizens who recovered \n     separately. Nevertheless, there is not a single person to \n     whom I have described this case--not an attorney, whether \n     plaintiff or defendant; not a liberal or a conservative; not \n     even a radical or idealist Yale Law student (or faculty \n     member)--who has not been shocked by the outcome or who could \n     defend it as a rational or sensible verdict in the context of \n     the harm. Again, many defenders of punitive damages argue \n     that exceptionally large verdicts are usually overturned on \n     appeal. Alabama provides a review procedure for punitive \n     damages verdicts that the U.S. Supreme Court has approved. In \n     the Gallant case, however, the judge conducting the review \n     affirmed the $25 million award in its entirety, though \n     directing part of the amount to be paid to the State.\n       What will be the effect of a punitive damages verdict of \n     this nature? The Gallants appear to be persons of modest \n     means (before the verdict). Does a verdict of this nature \n     help middle- or low-income consumers? Totally, the opposite. \n     The insurance policy in question--face value, $25,000--was \n     the cheapest form of life insurance annuity available on the \n     market; again, its monthly premium was only $39.00. \n     Obviously, at such a premium, the insurance carrier could not \n     be expecting to make a substantial profit on the policy. \n     Indeed, an expert in the case estimated that over the entire \n     life of the policy, the premiums net of payouts paid by the \n     Gallants would increase Prudential's assets by only $46.00. \n     Prudential, like most other life insurance companies, profits \n     more substantially from large dollar, rather than small \n     dollar policies. The expert estimated that the verdict \n     reduced dividends to every Alabama policyholder . . . by \n     $323.\n\n  That points out the ridiculousness of this.\n  Priest goes on to say:\n\n       How do we analyze a case like this in terms of whether \n     punitive damages serve a necessary deterrent effect? In his \n     closing argument, the . . . attorney for the Gallants asked \n     the jury to determine a level of damages that would send a \n     message to the giant Prudential Life Insurance Company that \n     fraudulent behavior on the part of an agent will not be \n     tolerated. What kind of damages message is necessary to \n     achieve that effect? Obviously, if the insurer stood to gain \n     no more than $46 over the life of the policy, any damages \n     judgment greater than $46 sends the insurer a message by \n     making the policy unprofitable. (Of course, I ignore entirely \n     Prudential's defense costs plus the reputational harm from \n     the lawsuit.) The jury in the Gallant case went substantially \n     beyond that amount, however, in awarding compensatory damages \n     of $30,000 for economic loss and $400,000 for the mental \n     anguish of the two weeks' lost sleep and anger. It certainly \n     cannot be argued that the jury has undervalued the Gallant's \n     compensatory loss--indeed, the $400,000 for the mental \n     anguish award is extreme. Furthermore, there is no reason to \n     think that the agent's behavior in other contexts would go \n     undetected. (Prudential later settled other cases brought by \n     the agent's clients.) As a consequence, there is no \n     justification for a punitive damages award whatsoever.\n       What will be the effect of punitive damages verdicts such \n     as that in the Gallant case? In the face of such a verdict, \n     what is the rational response of an insurer like Prudential \n     or other insurers selling similar policies? Regrettably, but \n     necessarily in a competitive industry, the rational response \n     is to quit selling such low value policies altogether. It \n     makes little sense to expose the company and its \n     policyholders to the risk of such a damages verdict given the \n     very small gain from the sale of such a policy.\n       Is this the type of product that our civil liability system \n     should drive from the market? Obviously, not, and low-income \n     consumers in Alabama are directly harmed as a result. Here, \n     the dramatically differential effects of such verdicts on \n     high-income versus low-income consumers are made clear. In my \n     own view, it is far more important to our society to have our \n     insurance industry provide life insurance coverage to low-\n     income citizens, since the relatively affluent of our society \n     have other means of providing financial security for their \n     families. The availability of financial protection and \n     security at relatively low cost will be substantially \n     diminished if such low premium policies, as here, are no \n     longer available.\n       More generally, where expected punitive damages verdicts \n     are added to the price of products and services, the first to \n     feel the effect will be low-income consumers. And where the \n     magnitude of punitive damages verdicts rise, imperiling the \n     continued provision of the product or service, the first to \n     be affected will be those products and services with the \n     lowest profit margins, most attractive to the low-income. The \n     Gallant case provides a dramatic\n      example of the effect. Following Gallant and other large \n     punitive damages verdicts, several insurers have quit \n     offering coverage in Alabama altogether.\n\n  I understand this case settled for an undisclosed sum. I urge my \ncolleagues to take a close look at the concerns raised by Professor \nPriest.\n  The consequences of our current civil justice system can be felt in \nmany ways.\n  [[Page S5949]] The July 17, 1992, Science magazine reported that \nAbbot Laboratories put off testing for a drug that might prevent the \nspread of AIDS from infected pregnant women to their newborns. Why? \nAccording to the article, ``Abbott officials announced that testing its \nHIV hyperimmune globulin (HIVIG) * * * would make the company too \nvulnerable to lawsuits.'' This action touched off some controversy. The \nScience article continued:\n\n       In spite of the uproar, National Institute of Health \n     officials agree with Abbott that liability is a significant \n     issue in AIDS vaccine and therapy research. A recent \n     investigation by Science (April 10, 1992, page 168) revealed \n     that fear of lawsuits has led several HIV vaccine developers \n     to delay or even abandon promising projects.\n\n  Creighton Hale, chief executive officer of Little League Baseball, \nwrote about lawsuits filed against coaches over the ordinary mishaps of \na baseball game in the February 13, 1995, Wall Street Journal. He \nnoted, ``from my spot in the bleachers, the costs of this litigation \nlunacy [result in] bewildered dads calling our offices asking about \npersonal liability, and volunteer coaches waking up to the fact that \nthey're taking on major league risks.'' He went on to say \nsignificantly, ``It's a problem common to all nonprofits and the \nvolunteers they depend on. Little League Baseball has seen its \nliability insurance skyrocket 1000 percent--from $75 dollars per league \nannually to $795--in a recent five year period. Good Samaritans are \ncaught in a suicide squeeze.''\n  Mr. Hale urged Congress to extend common sense legal reform beyond \nproducts liability cases to cover volunteers and others. I note that \nMs. Jan A. Verhage, executive director of the Girl Scouts Council of \nthe Nations Capital, which also serves the surrounding Maryland and \nVirginia communities, wrote to Speaker Gingrich on February 13, 1995. \nShe asked that legal reform legislation be extended to include \norganizations like the Girl Scouts.\n  Now, she was not speaking for the national organization. But her \ncomments are very telling: ``Locally we must sell 87,000 boxes of these \nGirl Scout cookies each year to pay for liability insurance. We have no \ndiving boards at our camps. We will never own horses, and many local \nschools will no longer provide meeting space for our volunteers.''\n  Paul A. Crotty, the top lawyer for New York City, wrote to Commerce \nCommittee Chairman Larry Pressler on April 5, 1995, on behalf of New \nYork City and Mayor Guiliani. He urged that the punitive damages \nprovision in the underlying products liability bill be extended to all \ncases. He wrote, ``Although punitive damages generally cannot be \nimposed against cities, they generally can be imposed against \ngovernmental employees. Excessive awards against individuals providing \ngovernment services can be as destructive as large awards against \nbusinesses that manufacture or sell products.''\n  This is all just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\n                               statistics\n\n  Let me say a word about the battle of statistics that rages over \npunitive damages. Supporters and opponents of this amendment can rely \non various studies about the number and dollar amount of punitive \ndamages awards. We heard reports on some such studies in the Judiciary \nCommittee. There is no single definitive study.\n  But let me say this: anyone with even a passing familiarity\n   with our civil justice system knows that the likelihood of a \npunitive damages award, justified or not, is far greater today than 40 \nyears ago. Moreover, and this is the crucial point, even beyond the \nincrease in the frequency and amount of actual awards over that time, \nthe mere threat of punitive damages affects volunteers, school boards, \nbusinesses of all sizes. The mere inclusion of a claim for punitive \ndamages in today's litigation climate boosts the settlement value of a \ncase, regardless of the case's merits. Insurance premiums go up, \nproducts and services are curtailed, innovation is stifled, consumer \nprices go up, and payroll costs rise, adversely affecting employment.\n\n  Professor Priest states,\n\n       Forty years ago, punitive damages verdicts were \n     exceptionally rare and were available against only the most \n     extreme and egregious of defendant actions. The world of \n     civil litigation is severely different today. Both the number \n     and, especially, magnitude of punitive damages judgments have \n     increased dramatically, indeed the frequency of claims for \n     punitive damages has increased to approach the routine. These \n     claims affect the settlement process, both increasing the \n     litigation rate and, necessarily, increasing the ultimate \n     magnitude of settlements even in cases that are settled out \n     of court.\n\n  The terrible, irrational consequences of these developments are easy \nto see. Take the $601 paint refinishing case in Alabama that mushroomed \ninto a $2 million litigation bonanza. If the plaintiff knew punitive \ndamages were not a real possibility, the case could have settled. How \nutterly wasteful to the economy to have such a minor case, the \nequivalent of less than a fender-bender under any rational view, \nactually proceed through depositions and discovery, let alone actually \nbe tried and then go through the appeals process. For heaven's sake, \nthis paint refinishing case is now before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. What a waste of the company's resources which go to its \nlawyers and to court costs, and of scarce judicial resources. Only the \nplaintiff and his lawyer, if on a contingent fee, benefit from this \nwindfall.\n  A civil justice system where all of this can happen is broken. One of \nthe problems which needs fixing is the lack of meaningful control over \npunitive damages.\n\n\n                               deterrence\n\n  The cost of our current civil justice system might be offset at least \nsomewhat if it actually does deter egregious wrongdoing. Here again, \nlisten to the testimony of Professor Priest:\n\n       I have never once seen a careful study in a specific case \n     showing that a punitive damages judgment of some particular \n     amount was necessary to deter some particular wrongful \n     behavior.\n       * * * forty years ago, in a tort law regime that provided \n     little in the way of consumer remedies, it might have been \n     that ever-increasing civil liability verdicts, including \n     punitive damages verdicts, would serve to reduce the number \n     of accidents. That view, however, has been totally \n     discredited today, and I know of no serious tort scholar \n     publishing in a major legal journal who could maintain it. \n     Instead, it is widely accepted--and it is a routine \n     proposition of a first-year modern torts course--that \n     compensatory damages--economic losses and pain and \n     suffering--serve a complete deterrent purpose in addition to \n     their role in compensating injured parties. Compensatory \n     damages impose costs on defendants who wrongfully fail to \n     prevent accidents, costs equal in amount to the injuries \n     suffered * * *.\n\n  He also testified that adverse publicity is another powerful \ndeterrent to wrongdoers.\n  Let me stress that the pending amendment, of course, by no means \neliminates punitive damages. Indeed, it allows punitive damages in an \nappropriate case, in an amount up to\n three times economic damages or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n\n  Actually, that was the old rule. Senator Snowe's language allows two \ntimes the total of compensatory and noneconomic damages.\n\n\n                               consumers\n\n  Do punitive damages help consumers? Here, again, is the testimony of \nProfessor Priest: ``The central problem of punitive damages, however, \nis that except in the rare cases of jury undervaluation of damages or \nunderlitigation, punitive damages settlements and verdicts \naffirmatively harm consumers, ands low-income consumers most of all.\n\n       Where punitive damages become a commonplace of civil \n     litigation as in Alabama, or even where they become a \n     significant risk of business operations, consumers are harmed \n     because expected punitive damage verdicts or settlements must \n     be built into the price of products and services. The effect \n     of the greater frequency and magnitude of punitive damages \n     recoveries of modern times has been to increase the price \n     level for all products and services provided in the U.S. \n     economy.\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, as mentioned earlier, a punitive damage award \nin a case like Gallant versus Prudential, involving a combination life \ninsurance-annuity policy with a $25,000 face value and $39 monthly \npremium, can only make insurance less available and more costly for \nmiddle- and low-income people.\n  Mr. President, the problems with the current punitive damages regime \nin this country are national in scope. Only Congress can fix these \nproblems.\n  The pending amendment would require that the claimant establish by \nclear and convincing evidence that the harmful conduct was carried out \nwith conscious, flagrant indifference to the \n[[Page S5950]]  rights or safety of the claimant before winning an \naward of punitive damages. It would then place a proportional limit on \npunitive damages of up to two times the sum of a plaintiff's economic \nloss and noneconomic loss.\n  Any party to the action could obtain a separate proceeding for the \nconsideration of whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \namount of such award. Our amendment does not supersede or later any \nFederal law. It does not deny States the right to enact punitive \ndamages provisions, consistent with this amendment, or to place further \nlimits on such awards. These are worthy provisions.\n  I urge support for the Dole amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I speak in support of the Dole amendment. The comments of \nthe Senator from Utah just given really portray I think in the most \nthorough way the basic thrust of this amendment and the arguments for \nit. I will very briefly just add at the margins some information which \nI think helps to flesh out the arguments that have just been made by \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  As he pointed out, this amendment would extend the product liability \npunitive damage limitation in the Gorton-Rockefeller bill to be set at \ntwo times the economic damages in all civil actions involving \ninterstate commerce. The exception is the civil rights and \nenvironmental laws. Therefore, at the margin, this amendment makes the \nunderlying bill even better than it is.\n  Historically, as has been noted, punitive damages were awarded in \nonly the rarest and most egregious cases in order to punish, to make an \nexample of the defendant when that defendant's conduct fell below a \ncertain standard. According to Prof. George Priest of Yale Law School, \nwho has already been quoted here, 65 to 78 percent of all tort actions \nover the last fiscal year include punitive damages in the pleadings. So \nwhat was originally designed to be a recovery in the very most narrow \nsituation has now become part of the pleadings in a majority, even \nexceeding three-fourths, of the cases. Although punitive damage awards \nrepresent a relatively small part of the overall awards, the amount of \nthe average award continues to increase.\n  For example, according to Investors Business Daily, in an article of \nApril 3 of this year, a study of jury awards between 1965 and 1984 \nshows that the average inflation adjusted damage award increased 1,595 \npercent, Mr. President. These awards clearly are skyrocketing, and they \nneed to be reined in. Punitive damage awards have in effect become a \nlottery in which the jackpot is continuously doubling. The lawyer's \nincentive to file suit is the 30 percent of the settlement amount and \nthe 40 percent of most trial judgments that he or she realizes. The \nplaintiff's incentive is the often outrageous jury verdict.\n  Two well-publicized examples will be recalled by most people: The \nnearly $1 million awarded to the McDonald's customer who put hot coffee \nbetween her legs while driving and, unfortunately, was burned; and the \nAlabama case in which actual damages totaled only $1,200 but the jury \nawarded $4 million in punitive damages.\n  I said that punitive damages were skyrocketing a moment ago. Those \nwere not my words. Those were the words in an opinion of Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, who said in a 1993 Supreme Court opinion that they were \n``skyrocketing.'' She was addressing a lower court ruling which upheld \na $4.3 million award, Mr. President, to a convicted felon who, in the \ncourse of violently robbing a 72-year-old subway passenger, was shot \nand paralyzed by a transit authority police officer. The case was \nMcCummings versus New York City Transit Authority, 1993.\n  This is outrageous, Mr. President. It is the kind of cap that we need \nto place into law. These outrageous punitive damages create a tort tax \npaid by consumers in the form of higher prices, higher insurance \npremiums, and reduced market choice and quality.\n  It is a regressive tort tax paid disproportionately by citizens on \nthe lower end of the economic spectrum because higher prices, of \ncourse, hit them the hardest.\n  Do punitive damages serve as a necessary deterrent? Sadly, Mr. \nPresident, in many cases, no.\n  Again, according to Richard Posner, the best theory is that full \ncompensatory damages generate exactly the optimal level of deterrent.\n  Mr. President, punitive damages are a quasi-criminal remedy. They are \nthe product of a bygone era when the resources of public prosecutors \nwere slim.\n  Today, public prosecutors are better able to serve the public \ninterest in a certain level of punishment. To the contrary, plaintiffs \nand their lawyers seeking huge punitive damages awards often initiate \nlitigation without consideration of the public interest, but of their \nown interest. That is why these damages need to be controlled.\n  Let me cite just a few of the examples. The Senator from Utah cited \nsome egregious examples a moment ago.\n  Another example: A juror in a punitive damages case said that his \nfellow jurors discussed a damage award of between $100,000 and $8.5 \nmillion before deciding on $10 million. Later, when asked why $10 \nmillion was chosen, this juror said, ``Quite honestly, I think it had \nsomething to do with finding a round figure. We were given no \nguidelines.''\n  There was a recent article in USA Today, March 6, 1995, which I think \nhad some interesting points to make and some other examples to cite. I \nwill cite just a couple quotations from the article.\n\n       The court system that's supposed to assure fair \n     compensation for people harmed through the fault of others \n     looks at times more like a gambling casino than the house of \n     Justice.\n       Some injured individuals are walking away with pots of \n     money--far, far beyond any actual losses they've suffered.\n\n  Here are some of the horror stories that the USA Today story cited.\n\n       The Alabama woman awarded $250,000 in punitive damages even \n     though she wasn't injured and wasn't even present when a gas \n     water heater malfunctioned.\n       The San Francisco mugger who won a $24,595 judgment for leg \n     injuries when a cab driver pinned him to a wall with his taxi \n     to keep the criminal from escaping.\n       The Miami woman awarded $250,000 after she, having used \n     cocaine and alcohol and splashed herself with gasoline, was \n     severely burned trying to light a barbecue.\n       The Florida theme park ordered to pay 86 percent of a \n     woman's award for injuries received on its ``Grand Prix'' \n     ride, even though the jury found the park only 1 percent at \n     fault and the woman's husband--who rammed his car into hers--\n     85 percent at fault.\n       The tricycle manufacturer who settled out of court for $7.5 \n     million rather than risk an even more generous jury award \n     over the color of its trikes.\n       According to one five-state study, the dollar volume of \n     punitive-damage awards against business alone is up 89-fold \n     over a 20-year span.\n\n  I want to quote just one other thing from this USA Today article \nbefore I close, Mr. President.\n\n       Given the emotional pull of tragic personal injuries or \n     honest businesses driven to bankruptcy, few opportunities to \n     exaggerate have been missed by either side. But there is at \n     bottom an undeniable sense: The system doesn't operate \n     fairly. And that sense of unfairness invites opportunists to \n     try to cash in--looking for a jackpot on the chance that the \n     system's unfairness will work in their favor:\n\n  And then this article goes on to note a couple other cases.\n\n       Like the Michigan man who lost an eye when a July 4 \n     skyrocket exploded in his face and then sued his parents for \n     letting him set off fireworks when he was drunk.\n       Or the 305-pound man who had a stomach-stapling operation \n     and sued the hospital because he was allowed near a \n     refrigerator and ate so much he popped his staples.\n\n  Mr. President, these examples would be humorous if the problem were \nnot so serious. The problem is that we are all paying for this, for \nthis jackpot, this lottery that is called punitive damages. It is time \nto rein it in. It is time to put a modest cap on these punitive \ndamages.\n  That is all the amendment of the majority leader does. It is time \nthat we adopt this kind of approach to the liability reform that is \nbefore us today and, hopefully, that we will be voting on later this \nafternoon. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n   [[Page S5951]] The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise again to report to my \ncolleagues on our situation and to make a reflection.\n  This morning, we conducted a series of rollcall votes. I believe \nthere were eight. They all had to do with something called malpractice \nreform, which is not part of the product liability reform.\n  We were able to accept two amendments, which means that we did not \naccept others. Those were on fairly minor issues, I might say.\n  Of the eight amendments that required votes, the Senate adopted three \nby sort of an interesting variety of margins. The net result is that \nthe product liability bill, which is the sole focus of the concern of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, as well as the Senator from the State \nof Washington, now includes the malpractice proposal as offered by the \nSenator from Kentucky, which prevailed with 53 votes.\n  So that means we now have a bill which has product liability in it, \nhas malpractice reform in it. I have indicated before that I think at \nsome point Senators are going to have to make a choice. I do not think \nwhen it comes right down to it, we are going to be voting on a bill \nthat has these two elements in it. We may be voting on no bill that \nhas, therefore, nothing in it. Or we may be voting on a bill that has \nboth elements in it which causes both elements to lose, products and \nmalpractice, which is in nobody's interest. Now we found another one. I \nsay this with all respect and without anything but respect. But we are \ndebating an amendment by the majority leader, with a number of other \nSenators as cosponsors, to limit punitive damages in all civil actions, \nnot just product liability. So now this comes from the House.\n  This, again, opens up an entire new range of problems and \npossibilities for product liability and the chances of passage. This is \nopening the whole thing up. It is all civil torts. I recognize the \nbasis of the amendment. There is a very impressive array of \norganizations, including municipalities, small businesses, nonprofit \ngroups--they want to curb the costs--and problems associated with \npunitive damages in our legal system. They have that right in a \ndemocracy, and they are exercising that right. And now we are seeing \nthe results of that.\n  I am not going to get into the substance of the amendment or into the \nmerits of the amendment. I simply want to indicate that this is not \nproduct liability as it has been introduced. It is, again, trying to \nopen it up so that other things can be attached to it. Some may think \nthat helps it. Some may think that by adding other extraneous areas it \nshows that they are abreast of everything that is going on in the House \nand fighting with equal vigor, and I understand that; I understand it \npolitically, substantively, and every other way.\n  But it does not help product liability to pass. I would remind \nSenators, as I have on a number of occasions and I will continue, that \nthe underlying amendment here is the Product Liability Reform Fairness \nAct of 1995. For both those who oppose it and who favor it and who have \ninvested a lot of time in it, it is this bill which we want to see \nacted upon.\n  So I just make this point at the beginning of the debate. And I am \nperfectly willing to have a time agreement. I understand the majority \nleader will be very amenable to a time agreement. I think that is being \nshopped on both sides. I do not expect this debate to go on for a very \nlong time. But, again, it is an extraneous amendment. I simply point \nthat out. It hurts the possibilities of product liability reform. I \nthink it has almost no chance of passing. Of course, a vote will tell \nthat, but I forecast that. Thus, I wonder what it is in fact we are \naccomplishing by all of this.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I turned on the TV in the office and was amused to see \na series of whining and moaning and groaning with respect to punitive \ndamages. This contract crowd is going in two different directions. \nUnder the contract now, the welfare recipient is to show more \nresponsibility. Under the contract, we have a family. They do not want \nGovernment in anything, but they want it in everything. They want it in \nthe family. I would think that would be the last thing, to get into the \nfamily. But the contract crowd wants a family bill. And, of course, \nfundamental to the family is that we punish the child when it \nmisbehaves. We spank the baby and teach it some discipline when it \nmisbehaves and teach it how to do right as opposed to doing wrong.\n  But when it comes to large corporate America and manufacturers, there \nshould be no spanking. All of a sudden, it costs consumers. Mr. \nPresident, whoever thought for a second that this bill is in the \ninterests of consumers? It is the biggest fraud that ever tried to be \nperpetrated on this august body. Every consumer organization in the \nUnited States of any size, care, or responsibility is absolutely \nopposed to the bill.\n  And with regard to the better legal minds of the American Bar \nAssociation, the State supreme court justices and their Conference of \nChief Justices of the several State supreme courts, the Conference of \nState legislatures, the attorneys general, oh, yes, they are going to \nlook out for them? Uh-uh, no, they are looking out for manufacturers. \nLook at the section in here that exempts the manufacturer. They have \nall of these great provisions in here because they say they are so \nconcerned about consumers, except when you mention manufacturers. They \nsay, by the way, manufacturers should be exempt from this bill.\n  Now, come on. I will read several things about punitive damages, and \nI will go right to the heart of the issue. It is not saving consumers' \npocketbooks and costs. This crowd knows the cost of everything and the \nvalue of nothing. The truth of the matter is on account of product \nliability in this country of ours, we have the safest products and we \nare saving our citizenry from injury, from maiming, from blindness, \nfrom being killed over and over again by the millions. Why do you think \nthere were over 19 million car recalls in the last 10 years? We went to \nthe Department of Transportation and we summed up all these automobile \nrecalls. And if you think the big automobile companies--not only in the \nUnited States, but Toyota in Japan, and others--are recalling defective \nautomobiles to save consumers money--they are doing it to save \nthemselves money on account of product liability, because they are \ngoing to get nailed. And so to save themselves money, they save lives \nand injury to the consuming public. It is not the pocketbook that we \nare involved with here. On the contrary, it is the safety of products \nand the safety of our citizenry.\n  So let us quit bringing all of these cases, one by one, out here, and \nsay, oh, what a terrible punitive damage verdict this is and thereby we \nhave a national problem. Not so.\n  The States have handled this. And rather than going into this case or \nthat case--I do not countenance for a second that there are not some \nmistakes. There are mistakes everywhere in the administration of the \nlaw. That does not call for national legislation. But, in a general \nsense, if you take all the product liability verdicts in the last 30 \nyears--and this is what we asked when we saw the witness take the stand \nin the Commerce Committee. We asked Jonathan S. Massey, an expert who \nhad defended punitive damages before the U.S. Supreme Court, allegedly \nthe most experienced attorney. I said, yes, but I still get these \nanecdotal incidents of what we would call outrageous punitive damage \nfindings.\n  I said, ``Could you please go and get into the record exactly all the \npunitive damage verdicts for the last 30 years, since 1965, and find \nout just exactly how many there were, and what were the amendments and \nthen add them all up?'' With respect to that, I ask unanimous consent \nto have this material printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    [[Page S5952]] April 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: At the hearing on April 4, 1995 \n     before the Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce, and Tourism \n     Committee of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation on S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act \n     of 1995, you asked me to compare the $3 billion in punitive \n     damages awarded in the Pennzoil v. Texaco case with the sum \n     of punitive damage awards in all product liability cases \n     since 1965.\n       The attached pages show that punitive damage awards in \n     products liability cases since 1965 come to a fraction of the \n     $3 billion figure. For products liability cases in which the \n     punitive damage award is known, the total comes to \n     $953,073,079. There are 109 additional cases in which the \n     punitive damage award was not reported by the court or either \n     party, most likely because it was not large. If one were to \n     extrapolate for those 109 cases by taking the average award \n     in cases in which the punitive award is known--which would \n     err on the side of the inflating punitive damage awards in \n     products liability cases--the total of punitive damage awards \n     in all products liability cases since 1965 would come to only \n     $1,337,832,211--less than half the award in Pennzoil v. \n     Texaco.\n       I hope this information is of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jonathan S.

Mr. President, the pages show that punitive damage \nawards in product liability cases since 1965 come to a fraction of $3 \nbillion. To be exact, they come to $1,337,832,211.\n  Why does this Senator say ``a fraction'' of $3 billion? If we go to \nthe Pennzoil versus Texaco case, of businesses suing businesses, what \ndo we get? We get almost a $12 billion verdict that included what? It \nincluded a finding of punitive damages in the amount of 3 billion \nbucks.\n  In other words, of all the product liability punitive damage findings \nin the last 30 years amounting to $1.3 billion, we have one business-\nagainst-business case of $3 billion. Or another one, since they are \npicking out cases, I will pick the Exxon Valdez case, a case where \nExxon was sued and they came in with a verdict of what in punitive \ndamages? Mr. President, $3 billion.\n  I cannot find out the amount for businesses, there are so many of \nthem. But it is up into the billions and billions of dollars. If this \nCongress was really interested in lowering the verdicts in tort cases, \nthey would go right to the businesses suing businesses. They would go \nright to the automobile accident cases. They would go to all the other \nkinds of tort cases.\n  The fact is that, of all the civil findings in the United States of \nAmerica, tort filings only amount to 9 percent of the total amount of \ncivil findings; and of the 9 percent, product liability amounts to 4 \npercent of the 9 percent or .36 of 1 percent.\n  Another problem solved by the States. The Supreme Court Justices and \nlegislatures say we handle it, and I will go right, for example, to my \nown State of South Carolina with respect to punitive damages.\n  In a recent case of the State versus Rush, but the heading would be \nGamble versus Stevenson, an appeal of the Southern Bell Telephone \nTelegraph.\n  Now, I read from the opinion of the Supreme Court as follows: ``In \nSouth Carolina punitive damages are allowed in the interest of \nsociety.'' Listen to that. We would think punitive damages was the most \nheinous offense that ever occurred without any relation in the world to \nthe good it has done.\n  Why do we fine motorists for speeding and disobeying our motor \nvehicle laws in America? We fine them. Why do we fine the others for \ntheir various crimes? To make certain they do not commit them again. \nSimilarly, with manufacturers.\n  Punitive damages--fine them, to make absolutely sure that they do not \nrepeat their wrong.\n  They would say we cannot lose, we are making money. So why has \nChrysler recalled 4 million cars to fix the back latch on the door? Not \non account of the cost. They could get by with that. They would leave \nit there, but they know that there are chances now brought to the \nattention of the public that they are not only going to be verdicts \nagainst them in compensatory damages but in punitive damages. No longer \ncan they factor it in the cost of product because of punitive damages.\n  This is the very element that is bringing about the safety--not \ntaking care of the parties involved but taking care of society, \ngenerally--that is the point to be made here.\n  The first sentence:\n\n       In South Carolina, punitive damages are allowed in the \n     interest of society in the nature of punishment and as a \n     warning and example to deter the wrongdoer and others \n     [[Page S5953]]  from committing like offenses in the future. \n     Moreover, they serve as an indication of private rights when \n     it is proved that such have been wantonly, willfully, or \n     maliciously violated. Lastly, punitive damages may be awarded \n     only upon a finding of actual damage. In the instant case the \n     trial judge's jury charge concluded the degree of \n     recklessness requisite to punitive damage award, that such an \n     award was to punish a defendant or deter and stop it and \n     others from similar conduct in the future, that is, to make \n     an example of the defendant.\n\n  That is an affirmative action program, to make an example. Everybody \nis interested in affirmative action. Here it is. Make an example of the \ndefendant, the wrongdoer. ``That it must find actual damages before \nawarding punitive damages and that in calculating the amount of such \ndamages, it may consider the defendant's ability to pay.''\n  Now, Mr. President, to ensure that a punitive damages award is \nproper, the trial court shall conduct a post trial review and consider \nthe following: one, the defendant's degree of culpability; two, \nduration of the conduct.\n  Mind you me, Mr. President, this is not the jury, the runaway juries, \nthe same people that elected Members in Congress, all of a sudden \nimpanelled and with a sworn oath, to find unanimously by a \npreponderance of the evidence, willful misconduct. And all 12 having \nfound such, that same crowd that elects and sends Members, all of a \nsudden, they have lost their minds, their judgment. They are runaway \nand now have to be restricted by national restrictions. For what? For \nmanufacturers, that is for what, and for less safety in America.\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       To ensure that punitive damages award is proper, the trial \n     court shall conduct a posttrial review that may consider the \n     following:\n       1, defendant's degree of culpability; 2, the duration of \n     the conduct; 3, the defendant's awareness or concealment; 4, \n     the existence of similar past conduct; 5, likelihood the \n     award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; \n     6, whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely \n     to result from such conduct; 7, defendant's ability to pay; \n     8, as noted in Haslip case, ``other factors'' deemed \n     appropriate.\n\n  That is, the court, not only the 12 impaneled jurors, but the court \nitself, shall review and study.\n  Now, generally, this is a law that applies in 45 of the 50 States \nbut, of course, due to the Conference Board, due to the Business \nAdvisory Roundtable, due to the National Association of Manufacturers' \nlobbyists that have been going on for years and they come and report at \nevery election time, ``Now, Senator, we have to do something about tort \nreform or product liability reform.''\n  The average Senator or candidate, not aware of the ramifications, not \nhaving attended any of the hearings or otherwise, might say, ``Oh? I am \ntrying to get votes. Reform?'' They get caught. Words do mean things in \nour society. And they say, ``Heavens, I can get the support of this \nstrong crowd. I can even get financial contributions if all I have to \nsay is yes, yes, I am for reform. Product liability? Put me down.''\n  They put them down. Then they come here and they get embarrassed \nbecause they finally hear the truth of the matter here. And I sort of \nget embarrassed for them.\n  The reason I get embarrassed for them is just this. I got a letter \ntoday from my distinguished colleague and friend, Drew Lewis, the \nchairman of Union Pacific Corp., dated April 27. He is a former \nSecretary of Transportation. He did an outstanding job. I do not speak \nin criticism or derision. Rather, I speak--and this is the factual \ndismay that I have--because I know he knows better. It is a short \nletter and I know why he is writing it.\n\n       Union Pacific urges your support for S. 565, the Product \n     Liability Fairness Act legislation. The U.S. legal system is \n     out of control. The high cost of litigation and large damage \n     awards translate into higher prices for consumers. Typically \n     less than half the money awarded in product liability cases \n     goes to compensate the claimant. The winner is the trial \n     attorney, not the American consumer. If American business is \n     going to succeed in the global marketplace and American jobs \n     are to grow, your vote is critical. Please vote for cloture \n     and final passage of S. 565.\n       Sincerely, Drew.\n\n  Let us take that little letter here and see it exactly. I know this \ngentleman knows better. He is the most sophisticated of former public \nservants and corporate executives and he has been around. I know his \nentities. The Business Roundtable and the National Association of \nManufacturers and all got him to write this thing and it was ground \nout.\n  He calls it the ``Fairness Act.'' He picked up the title. That is not \nwhat they called it over on the House side. It started off--if you get \nthe title of the bill itself on the desk here, you will find out--``To \nestablish legal standards and procedures for product liability \nlitigation.'' At least it was straightforward in the House. Applesauce \nin the U.S. Senate. Fairness? Fair to whom? Not consumers. This crowd \ndoes not represent consumers. I have; they have not.\n  When I asked the distinguished Chair where was the record here \nwhereby trial lawyers had done in their clients, under the Abraham \namendment, he had one letter from a constituent in Michigan. I knew \nthat there were not a big wave of clients being done in. In fact, had \nit not been for the trial lawyers, they would not have received \nanything.\n  After all, these manufacturers do have a team of attorneys, \ninvestigators, adjusters, local attorneys and otherwise, and they \nreadily, on any kind of claim or letter they get, immediately zoom in \nand, generally speaking, settle the case or claim. It is good business \njudgment that they do; it is good business judgment they do. They do \nnot want to be claimed to have unsafe products.\n  It is only when they deny an obvious claim that should be compensated \nthat it comes to the trial lawyers. We do not scare up cases--except, \nof course, in these class action suits, like asbestosis. But that is \nwhat had to be done. That is exactly what was done with respect to the \nexample of the Senator from Michigan in his letter with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky relative to the airlines. They had to go and get all the \nairlines together, get law firms all over the country, and assemble 2.1 \nmillion clients.\n  In the letter to the colleagues, under the Abraham-McConnell letter, \nit appeared that, heavens above, quoting the Washington Post, the \nlawyers got $16.1 million in fees and the client got a $25 gift \ncertificate for travel. I knew that the client just getting $25 and the \nlawyer getting $16 million would not be approved by any court. So we \nwent back to the record.\n  Yes, in a class action of that kind, what was the number of clients? \nIt was 2.1 million. What was the amount of the verdict? It was $438 \nmillion. How many law firms? They had 37 law firms all over the \ncountry, and the average fee was not a third, or 33\\1/3\\ percent, or 25 \npercent, or 20 percent, or 10 percent, or 5 percent, or 1 percent. The \naverage fee of the attorneys involved was less--less than 1 percent. \nHad they not correlated all that, it would not look so garish and \nenormous to us unstudied witnesses here.\n  But this is the Fairness Act, they say. Then the next sentence, ``The \nUnited States legal system is out of control.''\n  That is sheer nonsense. If it is out of control, it is on account of \nbusinesses suing businesses. It certainly is not a litigation \nexplosion. We have proved that. We have proved time and again that \nproduct liability cases, as the Senator from West Virginia, the \nprincipal sponsor of the measure, says--when we engaged in looking at \nproduct liability cases, we find the entity in the testimony before the \nCommerce Committee, unquestioned--no one has proved otherwise--\nunquestioned, that there are less filings and less verdicts and less \nplaintiffs' victories all the way across the board. So if the legal \nsystem is out of control, it is out of control for other reasons but \nnot product liability.\n  ``The high cost of litigation and large damage awards translate into \nhigher prices for consumers.'' I just reread that my way: The high cost \nof litigation and large damage awards translate into higher safety for \nthe consuming public of America. That is what it translates into. And \nit ought to go into the costs. It is a minimal cost to them to put out \nsafe products. And the best of manufacturers want to do that and they \nbrag about the quality now of their particular manufacture. They brag \nabout their quality of manufacture. So it is not high cost translating \ninto high prices but, let us say, a higher degree of safety.\n   [[Page S5954]] ``Typically, less than half the money awarded in \nproduct liability cases goes to compensate * * *'' We find that is \nincorrect. There was a study by the National Insurance Foundation to \nthe effect that, yes, the claimant did not get the majority of the \nmoney, but the majority of the money was going to the defendants' \nattorneys.\n  You ought to see these billable hours. That is why the Senator from \nSouth Carolina wanted to limit billable hours around this town to $50 \nan hour. I could catch the thrust of the movement earlier last week, \nwhen they came in, about the money going to the claimant as compared to \nthe money going to attorneys. And the thrust was that they had given up \non Girl Scout cookies and they have given up now on Little League \nbaseball and all these other things they tried to raise, \ncompetitiveness and otherwise. Now they say, ``Well, let us kill all \nthe lawyers.''\n  I say, if you want to get rid of half the 60,000 lawyers in this \ntown, if you want to get rid of 30,000 lawyers, just put not a minimum \nwage but put a maximum wage, a maximum wage of $50 an hour which will \ngive them the salary of a U.S. Senator. If they worked any overtime, \nlike we do work overtime as Senators, they could easily make $200,000 a \nyear. But that is where the compensation is going. It is just like the \nsituation, if you had a $100 finding, you would find that $40 would go \nto the defendant's attorneys, $20 would go to the plaintiff's \nattorneys, and $40 to the claimant.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the Chair).\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the rationale of this simple statement \nis get rid of or kill all of the lawyers; get rid of the trial lawyers \nbecause--the next sentence is--``The winner is the trial attorney, not \nthe American consumer.'' If you think this crowd is interested in \nconsumers, just get all the consumer legislation and look at their \nvotes on that.\n  But going right back to the report, in the 103d Congress, I knew we \nhad this when we had the hearings. In a 1977 survey conducted by the \nInsurance Services Office, for every dollar paid to claimants, insurers \npaid an average of an additional 42 cents in defense costs; while for \nevery dollar awarded to a plaintiff, the plaintiff pays an average \ncontingent fee of 33 cents of that dollar. Thus, in cases in which the \nplaintiffs prevail, out of each $1.42 spent on litigation, half of that \ngoes to attorney fees, with the defendants' attorneys on average paid \nbetter than the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  That is the national insurance consumer organization finding that the \nattorney for the insurance companies received on the average close to \none-third more than the average attorney's fee paid to plaintiffs' \nattorneys. I am glad I quoted that for the record, but that is not the \nway this letter reads. ``The winner is the trial attorney.'' We are not \nwinners or losers. But if you are going to characterize, as my \ndistinguished friend, Mr. Drew Lewis, does here in the letter about the \nwinner, he says, ``The winner is the trial attorney, not the American \nconsumer.'' Absolutely false. We have all the facts and all the \nhearings proving otherwise.\n  Going now to the final two sentences, ``If American business is going \nto succeed in the global marketplace, and American jobs are to grow, \nyour vote is critical.'' What is the inference there? The inference \nregarding the global marketplace is that product liability costs and \nthe burden on American production is a cost and a burden not suffered \nby foreign production. We will go right to the heart of that matter.\n  In addition, working over the years--and I have had a delightful \nexperience, I have to immodestly acknowledge, with respect to the \nattraction of industry to my own State, and I will be glad to meet with \nanybody and we will compare the records. We will compare the endeavor, \nand we will compare the results. I have had the experience of working \nat the local level on the attraction not only of the American blue chip \ncorporations, but those in the global marketplace. Admittedly, of \ncourse, many of the blue chips are in the global marketplace. But let \nus go directly to the ones we know. Let us say German industries and \nJapanese industries.\n  In our great State of South Carolina, we have over 100 German \nindustries. I made the first trip over there with the Governors, to the \nvarious communities in Germany, with an industrial group to attract \ninvestment in South Carolina in 1960. So that is 35 years ago. We just \ngot, of course, BMW. BMW, by the way, in Spartanburg, stands not for \nBavarian Motor Works, but BMW stands for ``Bubba Makes Wheels.'' We \nhave a wonderful system down there.\n  I was with the Vice President this last Friday at a luncheon. We put \nout 20,000 and some BMW automobiles this year from Spartanburg, SC. Do \nthey have a problem with product liability? Not at all. I went to Bosch \nnot long ago. They came in making fuel injectors for all automobile \nmanufacturers, and more particularly now have become expert in antilock \nbrake manufacture. They have a 10-year contract with General Motors for \nall the antilock brakes on their cars. They have the contract for \nToyota and Mercedes Benz. I turned to that manufacturer. I said, ``What \nabout product liability? How many product liability claims?'' He said, \n``What is that?'' I said, ``Product liability? You know, where you have \na defective antilock?'' ``Oh, no, no, no,'' he said, ``We will not have \nthat.'' He went right over on the line and he picked up one of the \nantilock brake devices.\n  He said, ``See. See that serial number.'' He said, ``We have a serial \nnumber on every antilock brake that comes out of this factory. We would \nknow immediately by that number if there was a defect where it \noccurred. But we haven't had any of that occur down here, and we are \nnot going to have any of that occur.'' And he was proud--proud--not \nwhining and crying through political representation up here in the \nnational Congress about saving consumers money. He was proud of putting \nout an absolutely safe product.\n  Can you imagine one of those antilock brakes not working and the \nother three working on an automobile? It would turn it over into a \ntailspin in a minute. They know it. So they are super careful in their \nmanufacture. That goes into the cost of the product. And, yes, it costs \nconsumers, and consumers welcome paying that higher price for the \nantilock brake and safety.\n  Mr. President, it goes to the safety, not the cost. But what happens \nin Germany? In Germany, they come with Mercedes Benz down in Alabama \nwhere, incidentally, both Alabama Senators are opposed to this bill. \nBoth Alabama Senators are opposed to this bill. Mercedes Benz says, \n``We love Alabama, and we are putting our new manufacturer down \nthere.'' BMW says, ``We love South Carolina and its product liability \nlaw,'' just like Mercedes Benz likes Alabama's product liability law, \nand they put a factory there. I have over 100 German factories liking \nthe product liability law in my State. I have over 50 Japanese \nindustries liking the product liability law in my State. But they are \nnot a member of the Business Roundtable.\n  So what you have here is this mailing out of absolutely unfounded \nconclusions, which is an embarrassment to this Senator. Specifically, \nyou look at what they put out in their advertisements when it comes to \npunitive damages and product liability. Here is the ad they are running \nin newspapers. This is an easy one to carry. It is entitled, ``Let's \nPut an End to the Lawsuit Lottery.''\n  You know, my conservative friends, when they get this rap music, say, \n``You have to cut out that rap music. It teaches violence.'' There was \none that I remember even President Clinton as a candidate took to task, \nabout ``kill all the cops,'' the ``cop-killer'' one. He complained \nthen. The American public went along with him and voted for candidate \nClinton to become President because those words mean something. They \nwant to cut all of that out. Now that they are blowing up buildings in \nAmerica, and some people say, ``Oh, no. Words don't mean anything.''\n  The truth of the matter is, Mr. President, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have a school where they teach them to use words. I \nthink this is a good time, since this is the thrust of the measure \nhere, if I have it here in one of these files. With respect to the \nwords, they come in and they hold a school. I know they attend a \nschool, these newcomers to public office. I will see if I cannot find \nthat, generally speaking, so that the colleagues can be educated about \nwhat is really going on. But this is a school that the distinguished \nSpeaker has been running for \n[[Page S5955]]  years. He tells all the candidates that have come in. I \nknow when a new Republican is elected from South Carolina, he has to \nattend a school to find out how to talk. And, in fact, if they can get \nthem ahead of time, they tell them how to campaign and how to use words \nthat inflame, words that stir up.\n  It was put into the Record some time ago; I think back in 1990, if I \nam not mistaken. But we had the meaningful words. I certainly would \nlike to be able to refer to that, because what happens is that they \ncall this--that is, the Government here in Washington, and this is \nreported in the David Broder column. They reported that the Government \nin Washington is the ``corrupt, liberal, welfare state.''\n  These are the handouts in the schools that they give to my Republican \ncolleagues and say you ought to all join in. And they list the word \n``corrupt.'' They list the word ``liberal.'' They list the word \n``welfare.'' So the revolution, according to Speaker Gingrich in his \ncourses, is against the corrupt, liberal welfare State. And that is the \nway they refer to it.\n  Mr. President, let us go to the words here about the lawsuit lottery. \nThere is not any lottery, I can tell you that right now. All you have \nto do, if you defend a product liability case, is convince one juror. \nThat is all you have to do, raise a doubt in one juror's mind because \nit has to be a unanimous verdict by the greater weight of the \npreponderance of the evidence.\n  But here is the mailout that they put in the advertisements that they \nhave going now for the past several weeks. ``Let's Put an End to the \nLawsuit Lottery. It's sad,'' this article says, the advertisement, \n``but the civil justice system in America has become nothing more than \na legal lottery.''\n  That is outrageous nonsense. It is embarrassing to see things being \nsponsored by responsible business entities that have buddied up \ntogether here in what they call the Product Liability Coordinating \nCommittee.\n  It goes on to read, ``With juries returning one outrageous award \nafter another, it's not surprising that the number of product liability \nsuits is skyrocketing.''\n  Absolutely false. We have had hearings upon hearings upon hearings, \nand the filings and the suits themselves are less and less each year. \nThe awards given are less and less and the number of plaintiff \nvictories are less and less. But this ad says they have skyrocketed--no \nbasis in fact.\n  ``There are 51 separate laws, one for each State and the District of \nColumbia, governing product liability.''\n  There are 51 separate laws, Mr. President, governing insurance \ncompanies. Do you see them up here complaining? They have to file every \none of their policies they want to sell in any one of the States. Get \nthese casualty companies together and ask them when are they going to \ncomplain about filing all of these policies here, 50 to 60 different \npolicies that they have now, in each one of the 50 States. They are not \ncomplaining about that. In fact, they want the McCarran-Ferguson \nantitrust exemption so they can get together. They want to continue. I \nhave suggested maybe we ought to federalize it because they are in \ninterstate commerce. ``Oh, no, no, no, we don't want that. We don't \nwant you to see our records.''\n  We have had hearings upon hearings upon hearings. We never, in the \n15-year period of handling this problem, have been able to get from the \ncasualty insurance companies their costs and profits, their records. \nEven the Senator from West Virginia has put on an amendment, which I am \nconstrained to submit later on when we get to the actual bill itself, \nto say that they file these reports. They never have. They do not want \nto.\n  The reason we asked for these facts way back almost 15 years ago, \nthey said it was impossible to obtain insurance, impossible to obtain. \nThey have plenty of insurance. It is easily obtainable. And we wanted \nto find out, as was later found out in other hearings, if they, like \nthe S's and all, had made bad investments in real estate and where \ntheir losses came from--not from a product liability litigation \nexplosion but, rather, sorry investments in real estate and supermarket \nand shopping center developments. They made the same mistake that all \nof these banks and insurance companies and savings and loan \ninstitutions had made.\n  But this says 51 separate laws. If you did not know what you were \nreading, you would say, ``Good golly, Moses; let's get uniformity.'' \nThey do not want uniformity even under this. If they wanted uniformity, \nthey would give you a Federal cause of action. That is why, one of the \nbig reasons, the American Bar Association says this adds complexity; \nthis is not uniformity. You have words of art: requirements, findings, \nmeasures of evidence, exemptions of evidence, all to be interpreted by \n50 separate supreme courts and the circuit court of appeals here in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Now, try that on for a lawyers' full employment act. Come on. \nEveryone knows that if they really wanted uniformity, they would have \nrequired a Federal cause of action and they would have uniformity and \nthat would have at least cut down on some of the multiplicities--the \nappeals, the interpretations, the motions and everything else of that \nkind in the 51 separate laws and separate jurisdictions governing \nproduct liability.\n  ``But today the outcome of a lawsuit can depend more on geography \nthan the merits of the case.''\n  They know that. Their commercial code, the Uniform Commercial Code, \nis anything but uniform. You can sit up there in New York. You can sell \na product made in Canada and solicit down in Alabama and deliver it, by \ngosh, to the factory site in North Carolina, and you can say, ``Under \nmy interpretation of this particular contract, I select the New York \nlaw.''\n  You have got what they talk about, forum shopping. The manufacturers \ndo just that. They know about that. But unless you have diversity of \njurisdiction--and I do not go over to Alabama, I never have heard of a \nSouth Carolina lawyer going over and suing in Alabama. They act like \nall we have to do is go over there and file the case in Alabama.\n  ``The current product liability system with its patchwork of local \nlaws''--patchwork. Who has given us patchwork? Read this bill. ``* * * \nwith its patchwork of local laws got its start at the turn of the \ncentury when businesses were all so local, but times have changed.''\n  They are trying to give a sense of history to this. This is \nabsolutely false. During my 20 years of law practice before I came to \nthe Senate, I never heard of any of this, ever. And they continue to do \nbusiness under different laws in the 50 different States under the \ninterstate commerce clause and it is not about times have changed.\n  ``American-made products now travel across State lines''--well, they \nhave always traveled across State lines.\n  I will never forget Henry Grady and the funeral in the days just \nafter the Civil War. The Senator from Tennessee would remember it. I \nthink they said that he was a poor man, buried, let us say, in South \nCarolina. He was buried with a New Jersey frock and some New York \nshoes, and the buttons were made in Minnesota, the wood for the shovel \nhad come from New Hampshire, the steel had come from Pennsylvania, and \nthey went on and on down there about the caskets and all. They said the \nonly thing South Carolina furnished was the hole in the ground.\n  Now, tell me about traveling in the different States. That is Henry \nGrady 100 years ago. They say no, times have changed now and all \nproducts travel across State lines. ``Unfortunately, so do plaintiffs \nand their lawyers seeking the most favorable State for their claim.'' \nUnless you have diversity, you do not run around and seek anything of \nthat kind. And you have the client in the community where the client is \ninjured. I can tell you now, having tried these cases, that you go try \nit in the vicinity of the client where they can understand and know the \ninjury and we might get a friend on the jury or an acquaintance or \nwhatever it is. Sometimes the blind hog picks up an acorn. You might \nget a break. If I go to another State, that immediately cuts me down to \nnext to nothing with respect to the fee, if I have to go and get the \nlawyers who know the local law there, let us say, if I went to \nBirmingham, AL, I would have to give all the moneys to the lawyers in \nBirmingham.\n  I am not a passthrough for lawyers in Birmingham. I am trying my \nclients' cases in my own State.\n   [[Page S5956]] This is outrageous hogwash here and they know it.\n  ``Unfortunately, so do plaintiffs and their lawyers seeking the most \nfavorable state for their claim. This not only hurts competitiveness, \nit stifles innovation, eliminates jobs and hurts all Americans.\n  How can we stop the lawsuit lottery? We need a uniform, modern \nnational product liability law.\n\n       But it's time for Congress to act. When it comes to the \n     lawsuit lottery no one wins.\n\n  They do not say that for automobile accident cases, where there is a \nfar, far higher number of different laws, different highway speed laws, \ndegrees of care, comparative negligence, contributory negligence, go \nright on down the list, all the automobile accident cases and, in this \ncase, automobile product liability cases.\n  They do not say that here with respect to medical malpractice or the \nsecurities or anything else.\n  Then they have a little thing like they are even trying to mimic \nOliphant: ``Less than half of all money awarded in a lawsuit goes to \nthe victim.'' Like they are for the victim.\n  It is clever. But it is outrageous blasphemy, I can tell you right \nnow, to put this kind of thing out to the unknowing public and perhaps \nto the unknowing Congressman and Senator. We know better.\n  What we have is a solution looking for a problem. What we have here \nis trying to find justification for a lobbying effort that has been \ngoing on with the AMA, the Business Roundtable, and the Conference \nBoard for 15 years, where they seek out the candidates and ask for a \ncommitment and, generally speaking, get that commitment without any \nhearing.\n  And certainly if they are newcomers to this particular Senate, they \nhave not had any hearings in the Commerce Committee. We had 2 days \nbecause we were told we had to agree to it, because we had to move, we \nhad to catch up with the Contract With America. We did not have \nhearings in depth. We had them by reference. I had to include other \nhearings that we had with respect to the law professors that oppose \nthis measure, with respect not only to the American Bar Association now \nbut the American Bar Association in each one of the five hearings that \nwe had over the 15-year period, and all the other entities that went \ninto depth on this matter.\n  And that is what they hope to do here with this fix that is on in the \nU.S. Senate. And do not come up with, ``Oh, we are looking out for \nconsumers.'' They have the audacity in the same instrument here to say \nthey look out for consumers when they exempt the manufacturers. The \nunmitigated gall of that provision is just so offensive it gets me \nstirred up.\n  How we ever got good, right-thinking folks on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate proposing this measure, saying that they are proposing it for \nthe consumer, I do not know. Show me that consumer. What is that \nsaying--``Let them come to Berlin.'' Well, show me that consumer. \nHeavens above.\n  The Consumer Federation, Consumers Union, Public Citizen, all the \nconsumer groups again appear in opposition to this particular measure, \nparticularly with respect to punitive damages.\n  One more time. On punitive damages, go ahead and cite your two or \nthree little cases that sound outrageous. I do not have the time to run \ndown and search out every one of the cases to find out whether the \namount of the verdict was cut, whether it was changed.\n  Just like the McDonald's coffee case. Once we searched that out, we \nfound out, yes, there were third-degree burns over one-sixth of the \ninjured woman's body, 3 weeks in the hospital. After 700 calls and an \noffer to settle for $20,000, they totally ignored it and said we put \nthis in the cost of the product, because the hotter we make the coffee, \nthe more coffee we produce.\n  It is money, money that concerns these manufacturers on product \nliability. That is the one thing, the bottom line. It is not the safety \nof the citizenry in America, but it is the money that they are \ninterested in.\n  But of all the product liability cases, what we have found, as they \nsum up over the last 30 years, is some $1.333 billion. One verdict in \nbusiness suing business, Pennzoil versus Texaco, a $3 billion punitive \ndamages finding in just one case, is twice the number of the consummate \nsum total of all product liability punitive findings in the last 30 \nyears. Or take Exxon Valdez, another $3 billion in punitive damages.\n  At the court level, I do not think the courts of this land have gone \ncrazy. They have been all the way up to the Supreme Court to question \nthe constitutionality of punitive damages. And each State either \navoided it or it is measured or it is rescinded and sent back with a \ncut or total elimination.\n  Look under the steps that I have read here with respect to the South \nCarolina law. I can go down some other States laws if they are \ninterested.\n  As a matter of punishment, we spank the baby when the baby \nmisbehaves, that crowd that wants the family bill. What we are trying \nto do is spank the manufacturer when the manufacturer misbehaves and \ntell them, ``Don't repeat this. Don't you do this again.''\n  And when you tell that manufacturer, you have to look at his size, \nyou have to look at his income, you have to look at his culpability, \nyou have to look at his willfulness, whether it was mere neglect or \nwhether it was a willful act, whether they had any warnings or \ndisregarded or heeded the particular warnings, whether it was a mistake \nor exactly what. And you have to prove all that by the greater weight \nof the preponderance of the evidence to all 12 jurors and to the trial \njudge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, nominally, at least, the issue before the \nSenate at the moment is the Dole amendment. The Dole amendment, which \nincorporates the limitations on punitive damages proposed by the \nSenator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], and accepted earlier here today, would \nextend those limitations from the product liability sections of this \nbill and the now medical malpractice sections of this bill to all \nactions. In other words, we would have one uniform standard of \nlimitations and relatively one uniform definition of the degree of \nproof required for punitive damages in all States which have fewer \nlimitations at the present time or no limitations at all.\n  Mr. President, the majority leader has outlined some of the \npersuasive reasons for this extension. The primary reasons being the \nimpact on small businesses which now live under the Damocles sword of a \npunitive damage judgment which can literally put them out of business \nand the increasing and adverse impact of punitive damage awards or \npotential punitive damage awards on nonprofit organizations, including \ncharities, including, as the majority leader pointed out, the Girl \nScouts, Little League, and the like.\n  I find these reasons to be persuasive reasons. I find it easy to be \npersuaded because it has been my view, almost from the time that I \nbegan to practice law, that the rule with respect to punitive damages \nin the State I represent, the State of Washington, which prohibits \npunitive damages for all practical purposes in all civil litigations, \nto be the appropriate rule.\n  Punitive damages are just exactly that. They are a form of \npunishment. In our society and American tradition, punishment by the \nGovernment or at the hands of the Government is traditionally reserved \nfor the criminal code. The criminal code carries with it privileges \nagainst self incrimination, a requirement that the prosecution prove \nits case beyond a reasonable doubt and, of course, explicit statutory \nlimitations and definitions of what punishment is appropriate in \nconnection with a particular crime. None of these projections exist \nwith respect to punitive damages. Juries decide them on an ad hoc \nbasis, generally speaking, on whether or not the same conduct or \nproduct resulted in punitive damages.\n  There is, of course, no self-incrimination. The standard of proof in \nmany States is a preponderance of the evidence, and even in this bill \nit is clear and convincing evidence, which falls short of the beyond a \nreasonable doubt standard. And most significantly of all, there are \nabsolutely no limitations on the amount of punitive damages, thus the \ndegree of punishment which can be imposed on a given defendant in civil \nlitigation.\n  [[Page S5957]] The Supreme Court of the United States has heard \nseveral appeals of large punitive damage judgments, appeals based on \nconstitutional protections through the 14th amendment. The Supreme \nCourt has never come up with a standard, with a maxim, by any means, \nalthough there have been hints that punitive damage awards that exceed \nfour times the actual damages come close to reaching some potential \nconstitutional limitation.\n  So from my perspective, I believe that it is both constitutional and \nappropriate for the Congress to deal with these issues and for the \nCongress to adopt the rule of the minority of the States--my own \nincluded--that say punishment should be reserved for the criminal code \nand that civil litigation should make a claimant whole, a wronged \nclaimant whole, but do no more. As a consequence, I find it easy to \nsupport the relatively mild limitations which are included in the \namendment proposed by Senator Dole, the majority leader of this body.\n  My friend from South Carolina, with whom I have engaged in debates on \nthis subject in the Commerce Committee and here on the floor, is most \neloquent on the other side of this issue. Whatever his point about a \npolitical organization which trains its candidates in rhetoric may have \nbeen, it is very clear that he does not need any lessons in how to \npresent a case forcefully and well. He does it here on this floor in \nthis connection and in many others. But I must admit to being puzzled \nby at least some elements of the point that he makes. He says that \nbecause certain foreign companies--in this case in the automobile \nbusiness--are willing to locate their factories in Alabama, that must \nmean they love the Alabama laws with respect to product liability.\n  Well, Mr. President, there is no connection between the two. Just \nbecause the market for manufactured products is nationwide, the \nlocation of a particular factory is absolutely irrelevant. Those \nautomobile companies can be sued, for all practical purposes, in any \nState because they sell their automobiles in every State, whether it is \nthe State in which their factory is located or some other. In fact, if \nthere might be any possible motivation created by product liability \nlaws, which I doubt, it would be to locate your factory in the most \nnotorious plaintiff-minded State because at least the judgments in that \nState would not be against an out-of-State manufacturer but an in-State \none, which might create the tiniest degree of sympathy for the \nmanufacturer. But the location of a place at which a manufacturer \noperates and the product liability laws of that State simply have no \nrelevance to one another at all.\n  The question before this body is whether we are dealing with product \nliability or with medical malpractice or, for that matter, with tort \nlitigation in general. Do we have a system at the present time that \nappropriately balances the interests of claimants, people who have been \ninjured or claim injury as a result of the use of products or as a \nresult of the quality of health care they have received, or as a result \nof any other kind of act; do we properly balance their rights in court \nwith other undoubted purposes of our society?\n  In the case of product liability, have we properly balanced it with \nour desire that our companies spend large amounts on research and then \ndevelop new and improved products and then market those products or \nmarket existing products--sometimes for dangerous occupations where \ninevitably someone using the product is going to be injured? Or do we \nhave a system which is so unbalanced that perfectly legitimate products \nare taken off the market, not because they are unsafe but because they \nsimply cannot create profits enough to run the risk of litigation, even \nof successful litigation.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, very little has been said here on the \nfloor about the impact of unsuccessful litigation in these areas. The \nattorney's fees, the expert witness fees, the cost in time and effort \non the part of employees is every bit as much when the claim is \nrejected, when there is a verdict in litigation for the defendant, as \nit is when the litigation lottery turns out exactly the other way. Any \nintelligent individual or company is going to say, ``I know I am going \nto get sued and even if I am successful, I am going to spend more money \nthan I can possibly make by marketing the product or engaging in the \nactivity.'' That individual is going to say, ``Why bother?'' Even if \nthat individual or that company has produced something good for society \nor is a part of the medical profession that is frequently sued or, for \nthat matter, is a Little League volunteer or Red Cross volunteer, that \nvolunteer figures he or she has a good chance of being sued, and it \nhardly matters whether they calculate that they will lose or win the \nlawsuit. They are going to say, ``I do not need the aggravation.''\n  It seems to me that it is almost beyond arguing that we have \nconstricted the activities, restricted the activities, of individual \nvolunteers. We have caused physicians with many productive years left \nin their careers to abandon those careers and to retire when they \nbecome reasonably financially comfortable. We have caused companies to \nabandon promising areas of research and development. We have caused the \nremoval from the market of significant products by the threat of \nlitigation, by the lottery of litigation--not just litigation that is \ngoing to be lost, but litigation which, more often than not, is won.\n  We have done this all in the name of a system which produces only a \nrelatively moderate percentage of the dollars that go into it for \nclaimants who actually establish their claims. A claimant who loses the \ncase, of course, ends up with nothing. But claimants taken collectively \nwho win these cases, at least in the fields of product liability and \nmedical malpractice, win less than half the cost of the system.\n  Sixty percent, roughly, of the dollars that go into the system go to \nthe lawyers and insurance adjustors and hired expert witnesses--all of \nthe transaction costs of the system.\n  So we have a system which not only penalizes volunteers and restricts \nthe operation of our health care system and restricts research and \ndevelopment and the production and sale of goods, but one which is \nextraordinarily inefficient in compensating the actual real victims of \nbreakdowns in the system itself.\n  To say, as opponents do, that somehow or another this presents no \nnational issue whatever just seems to me to beg the question. There is \na problem. In a national economy, it is appropriate that at least there \nbe a partial national solution to the problem.\n  Yes, we have not attempted to move all of these cases into Federal \ncourts with the requirement that we probably double the number of our \njudges and courthouses. We have not made an entirely uniform system.\n  However, we have created in this bill a considerably greater degree \nof uniformity than there is now. We have even, in one section, said \nthat the interpretation of this statute by circuit courts of appeals \nare going to be strong precedents for all State courts and all other \nFederal courts in those given circuits.\n  So the degree of uniformity as a result of this bill will not by any \nmeans be 100 percent. It is not designed to be 100 percent. However, it \nwill be far greater than it is at the present time, and the \npredictability of the result will be greater than it is at the present \ntime, and the lottery aspects of the business will be fewer than they \nare at the present time.\n  If we learn from the experience of this bill that greater uniformity \nis not necessary, we can go ahead and change it in the future. This is \nnot an unchangeable law, by any stretch of the imagination.\n  We can at least find out, by this cautious and partial experiment, \nwhether or not the evils ascribed in this legislation are true, but \nwhether or not there is a cure or a partial cure as a result of this \nlegislation.\n  I come back to one initial point, Mr. President. We have already \ntried this solution in one modest area of our Nation's economy: The \nreforms we made just a year ago in connection with the manufacture and \nsale of piston-driven aircraft. It is now clear beyond any argument \nthat that business, that manufacturing business, was for all practical \npurposes destroyed by product liability litigation.\n  The production of such aircraft declined 95 percent in the United \nStates of America over a 20-year period, ascribed by the manufacturers \nto product liability litigation.\n   [[Page S5958]] Those manufacturers said that there would be a \nrecovery if we reformed the system. We did reform the system a year \nago, more modestly than the product liability system is reformed here, \nbut in a significant fashion.\n  Already, there has been a significant recovery, including the \nplanning and construction of new plants and an increase in the \nproduction and sale of U.S.-built piston-driven aircraft.\n  This side in the debate is able to argue not from theory but from \nexperience. That experience would, it seems to me, give extraordinarily \nheavy weight to saying that if we expand it, if we expand it to other \nareas, we will have a similar, if perhaps not so striking, increase in \nthe creation of jobs in this country, in the development and marketing \nof new products, of voluntarism, if the Dole amendment passes and the \nlike.\n  I hope we will be able to go forward, Mr. President, and cast votes \non these various amendments and the other amendments before the Senate, \nand reach a positive conclusion to this debate within the immediate and \nforeseeable future.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington.\n  I mention once again the Girl Scouts, because I want to try to clean \nup the Record here. What I will read here is the Associated Press \nreport:\n\n       When advocates of tort reform went looking for sympathetic \n     symbols, they thought they had found a winner--the Girl \n     Scouts of America. The story spread quickly among tort reform \n     lobbyists and their supporters on Capitol Hill, and it was \n     compelling. Girl Scouts in the Nation's Capitol have to sell \n     87,000 boxes of cookies each year just to cover the cost of \n     their liability insurance. The lobbying and public relations \n     machinery went into high gear. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     produced a radio ad using the information, and a business \n     coalition began planning a television spot showing a Girl \n     Scout trudging door to door with a basket of Thin Mints and \n     S'Mores. But when the Girl Scouts got wind of it, they called \n     a halt. The 87,000-box statistic was undocumented, they said. \n     The Girl Scouts do not consider damage suits much of a \n     problem. The local council in Washington has never been sued, \n     and the National Accounting Organization takes no position on \n     tort reform legislation. ``They found an easy and emotional \n     issue that they could get hold of,'' said Sandra Jordan, \n     spokeswoman for the Washington Area Girl Scouts. People will \n     take a sound bite on easy image over hard information.\n\n  Therein, Mr. President, is my position in referring not only to Girl \nScouts, but to the sound bites here with respect to ``Let's put an end \nto the lawsuit lottery.''\n  Now, we are not talking about product liability reform or uniformity \nor, more correctly, any kind of abuses of the law. They immediately \ncall it a lottery and skyrocket, and all these words that have been \nused; ``The lottery wins, and the consumer loses,'' and that kind of \nthing.\n  I referred a moment ago to the matters of words with respect to these \nwords being used here. I know some in this Congress are very sensitive \nabout it. However, it has had its effect.\n  A former colleague here had introduced this, and we had it received \notherwise back in 1990, because I am referring to the one who is \ndisassociating himself from his GOPAC movement, because here is a GOPAC \nmovement that I will read out, and I will say how it has had an effect \nin my State with respect to the Government being the enemy.\n  This is a GOPAC letter, signed by Newt Gingrich, and it is addressed:\n\n       Dear friend: The enclosed tape is another in the regular \n     series of GOPAC audio cassettes, but is more than just \n     another tape. This is a special lecture I delivered just a \n     few weeks ago on August 22, 1990, to the third-generation \n     group at the Heritage Foundation.\n       I am sending you this tape in the belief that it contains a \n     timely and extraordinary message that could be of help to you \n     in the coming months. While most activists and legislative \n     candidates are not asked to give your views on Iraq, the \n     Mideast crisis, the budget conference, and the state of the \n     economy, it is critical that you have the tools available \n     that will help you take the offensive and define the agenda \n     of the campaign based on our values rather than falling into \n     the trap of merely answering the news releases.\n       I have also included a new document entitled ``Language, a \n     Key Mechanism of Control,'' drafted by GOPAC political \n     director Tom Morgan. The words in that paper attest to \n     language from a recent series of focus groups where we \n     actually tested ideas and language.\n       I hope this proves useful in writing speeches and other \n     campaign communications. My personal wish for the best of \n     luck in your campaign and everything else.\n\n  Then, the GOPAC language is here, ``A Key Mechanism of Control.''\n\n       As you know, one of the key points in the GOPAC tapes is \n     that language matters.\n\n  I will repeat that sentence. Here is the Speaker himself now saying \nback 5 years ago, practically:\n\n       As you know, one of the key points in the GOPAC tapes is \n     that language matters.\n       In the video ``We Are a Majority,'' language is listed as a \n     key mechanism of control used by a majority party along with \n     gender, rules, attitude, and learning. As the tapes have been \n     used in training sessions across the country and mailed to \n     candidates, we have heard a plaintive plea: ``I wish I could \n     speak like Newt.'' That takes years of practice, but we \n     believe that you could have a significant impact on your \n     campaign in the way you communicate if we help a little. That \n     is why we have created this list of words and phrases.\n       This list is prepared that you might have a directory of \n     words to use in writing literature and mail, in preparing \n     speeches, and producing electronic media. The words and \n     phrases are powerful. Read them. Memorize as many as \n     possible. And remember that, like any tool, these words will \n     not help if they are not used. While the list could be the \n     size of the latest college edition dictionary, we have \n     attempted to keep it small enough to be readily useful yet \n     large enough to be broadly functional. The list is divided \n     into two sections, the optimistic governing words to help \n     describe your vision, contrasting words to help you clearly \n     define the policies and record of your opponent in the \n     Democratic Party.\n\n  Then, ``Please let us know of your suggestions.''\n  Now, Mr. President, listen to these words amongst others. We will put \nthem all in the Record:\n\n       Sick, lie, liberal, betray, traitors, devour, corrupt, \n     corruption, cheat, steal, criminal rights.\n\n  I ran into this in my campaign for reelection in 1992. I never heard \nsuch expressions before, and I wondered where in the world my opponent \nwas getting all these blase references and words that really, in my \njudgment, were out of order.\n  Now let us bring it up to date in two instances. The Speaker himself \nuses these words. You look in David Broder's column here just about 10 \ndays ago and you will see where Speaker Gingrich, talking of his \nrevolution, says we have a revolution against the Washington \nGovernment. But he does not call it the Washington Government. He calls \nit--and he has the buzz words, the key words, ``the corrupt, liberal \nwelfare state.''\n  If these are not inflammatory, I do not know what are. They have had \nthat effect in my State of South Carolina.\n  I went home to a 600-member State Chamber of Commerce seminar where \nthey bring in the congressional delegation and we answer these \nquestions as they go along. It so happened the distinguished colleague \nfrom the 4th district in Greenville, SC, Bob Inglis, had answered a \nquestion and ended up by saying:\n\n       Yes, abolish the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy \n     and Housing.\n\n  My turn came immediately afterwards and I said:\n\n       Wait a minute. You don't mean to say that the Chamber of \n     Commerce wants to do away with the Department of Commerce?\n       Yes. Yes.\n\n  A good number of them, I would say, a fifth of them, started smiling \nand putting their hands together. And I said to Dick Riley, the former \nGovernor, popular Governor, Secretary of Education--he was there and I \nsaid:\n\n       Dick Reilly, do you want to do away with the Department of \n     Education?\n       Yes, yes, yes.\n       And HUD and Energy both? All four of them?\n       Yes.\n\n  Half of them clapping and all, standing up. That is what is happening \nabout this ``corrupt, liberal welfare state.'' They feel, irrespective \nof the functions and the need for these various departments, that the \ndickens with it. ``The Government is the enemy,'' they say. ``Get rid \nof the Government. That is the only way. Tear it down, rip it out. \nAbandon it, abolish it. And then let us start all over again and to be \nsure none,'' as they say, ``get corrupted. Be sure nobody serves over 6 \nyears, or 12 years in this body.'' That is what you have going on in \nthis land.\n  I can tell you here and now, words do count. And they count with \nrespect to this, which is a total mislead as to the actual hearings, \nthe facts that we had \n[[Page S5959]]  before us about the lawsuit lottery, who wins and who \nloses, and about the rights of consumers and everything else. It is \nentirely different. It is the safety of consumers. It is the \ndefendants' lawyers on billable hours that are winning, sitting up \nthere just grinding out, trying their own case.\n  It is a matter not of a lottery but a sworn jury to listen to the \nfacts, reviewed by the trial judge and reviewed by the appellate court. \nAnd all back to the issue at hand, punitive damages, a sum total of \n$1.333 billion, the whole sum total of all punitive damage findings in \nthe last 30 years, which is less than half of one business verdict \nagainst another business verdict in punitive damages, in two cases, not \nonly the Pennzoil case but in the Exxon case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 619 to Amendment No. 617\n\n       (Purpose: To strike the punitive damage limits)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a second-degree amendment \nto the Dole amendment that is now pending. I send the amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 619 to amendment No. 617.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, beginning with line 3, strike through line 2 on \n     page 8 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 107. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR AWARDS OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       ``(a) General Rule.--Punitive damages may, to the extent \n     permitted by applicable State law, be awarded against a \n     defendant in a product liability action that is subject to \n     this title if the claimant establishes by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the harm that is the subject of the \n     action was the result of conduct that was carried out by the \n     defendant with a conscious, flagrant indifference to the \n     safety of others.\n       ``(b) Bifurcation at Request of Either Party.--At the \n     request of either party, the trier of fact in a product \n     liability action that is subject to this title shall consider \n     in a separate proceeding whether punitive damages are to be \n     awarded for the harm that is the subject of the action and \n     the amount of the award.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered deals with \nthe cap on punitive damages in the bill, S. 565, that was reported out \nby the Senate Commerce Committee. I voted for this legislation because \nI think, on balance, there is reason for us to legislate in this area. \nI think there is a problem with product liability legislation. And I \nthink the approach that is taken is generally a reasonable approach. \nTherefore, I cast a ``yes'' vote. I did say in the committee, however, \nI was concerned about the punitive damage section and intended to offer \nan amendment on the floor of the Senate to respond to my concerns. That \nis what brings me to the floor today.\n  It occurs to me as I listen to the debate on product liability, as \nwell as the debate on tort reform in general, that this is another one \nof those cases where there is truth on both sides of this issue. I \nlistened to the Senator from South Carolina, who has spoken not just \nthis year but in previous years on this subject and speaks with great \npassion and eloquence on this issue. He feels very strongly that it is \na mistake for Congress to move forward and to enact Federal legislation \nin this area. I understand what he says and why he says it.\n  On the other hand, I hear others in the Chamber stand up and speak \nwith great persuasiveness about the need for Federal product liability \nlegislation to restrain the number of suits that are filed.\n  My sense is we are a country that litigates too much. We have lawyers \nall over our country filing suits for virtually everything. I would \nlike to see us litigate a little less in this country. I would like to \nsee judges throw out frivolous lawsuits and sanction those who bring \nthem. I would like to see us back away from this excessive litigation.\n  Excessive litigation puts many small businesses and others at risk. I \ntalked with a business owner recently and she said, ``They have jacked \nup my insurance cost to $500 a month. I pay $6,000 a year now for \nliability insurance to protect me against lawsuits.'' I asked, ``Have \nyou ever been sued?'' ``No, never had a suit against me. But, I have to \npay these tremendous costs because somebody might decide to sue me.'' \nThis is a real problem for many.\n  Some might say this is a problem with insurance companies. That may \nbe, I do not know. I do know we have too many lawsuits in this country \nand too many people who want to sue. Excessive litigation has an effect \non people trying to run small businesses who have to shell out money \nmonth after month in order to protect themselves.\n  On the other hand, there are enterprises in this country that provide \nproducts that they know are unsafe. They make these products available \nto consumers figuring they can make a bunch of money. These \ncorporations accept the risk that a product might hurt somebody in \norder to make a profit. In most cases their profit will exceed their \npotential risk for damages. There are plenty of lawsuits that exemplify \nthis.\n   I think there are merits on each side of this issue. I think we need \nto pass a Federal standard with respect to product liability. But, let \nus go back to last year's legislation on the issue of punitive damages. \nThe bill that we reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee last \nyear had no limit on punitive damages. We do change the standard or the \nthreshold. We raise the bar. We require clear and convincing evidence \nthat the harm caused was carried out with a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the safety of others. That is the bar you have to get \nover in order to prove that you are entitled to punitive damages and \nthat this enterprise should be punished for its behavior.\n  That is an appropriate place to establish burden of proof. You have \nto prove that there is clear and convincing evidence that the harm is \ncarried out with a conscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of \nothers.\n  Once you have done that, we should not say to the largest enterprises \nin this country, those with billions and billions of dollars, do not \nworry--even though you knew that product was going to harm them, could \nhave killed them, we have put a limit on punitive damages. It does not \nmake any sense to me.\n  Let us take punitive damages as an issue. The punitive damage section \nof tort law is to punish or deter a defendant's egregious conduct. \nThere is no litigation crisis with respect to punitive damages. \nAccording to a survey, from 1965 to 1990, 355 punitive damages were \nawarded in State and Federal product liability lawsuits nationwide, an \naverage of 14 a year. Of these awards, only 35 were larger than $10 \nmillion. All but one of these awards were reduced, and 11 of the 35 \nwere reduced to zero. This was in a 25-year span.\n  It is hard for anyone to make the case that punitive damages \nrepresent some sort of crisis in the area of product liability. That is \nnot supported by the facts. Congress should decide to raise the bar and \ncreate a new, higher standard, higher threshold over which someone who \nwas injured must cross in order to prove punitive damages. To restrict \nit even further by placing a limit, a substantial limit on what someone \ncan collect on punitive damages, is not justified. I think in rare \ncases where punitive damages should be or can be awarded, if this test \nis met, the test of conscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of \nothers, then it is inappropriate for this Congress to provide this \nlimitation.\n  My amendment would allow the States to debate this and provide their \nown limitation. Some States have limits. My amendment will not affect \nthose States. But it will say that the underlying bill, S. 565 will not \nestablish a new national standard that will replace every other State \nthat has a limit and replace those specific limits. Or, in cases where \nStates do not now have a limit, tell those States, ``Here is your new \nlimit on punitive damages.'' That is inappropriate.\n  I hope that Congress will support the amendment that I am offering \ntoday, which strikes those provisions in the punitive damages section \nthat limit caps.\n   [[Page S5960]] I come from a State that is largely a State of small \nbusinesses. We have some industry and a few larger enterprises. I have \nvisited with many North Dakotans who have told me of their view of and \ntheir circumstances with respect to product liability. The case they \nmake warrants this kind of legislation. But, it does not warrant a cap \nthat has been placed on punitive damages.\n  I would like to include in the Record some examples of punitive \ndamage cases. I will not go into them. But most of us understand where \nand when punitive damages have been awarded in this country, and in \nmost of these instances they were warranted and necessary. The fact is \nthe awarding of those punitive damages deter and persuade other \ncorporations from taking the same risk. Corporations who suffered those \ndamages may be more careful in the future.\n  I think that many safety improvements on products have been made not \nbecause of the benevolence of those making the products but because \nthey worry about the consequences of putting an unsafe product on the \nmarket. Especially because other large enterprises which put unsafe \nproducts on the market knowing they were not safe suffered some very \nsubstantial punitive damages.\n  That has helped this country and the people in this country produce \nproducts that are safer and more reliable and products that consumers \ncould purchase without fear of being hurt by the product. I hope that \nwe will have an opportunity to allow others to discuss my amendment. My \nunderstanding is that they are seeking some kind of unanimous consent \nin which we would stack some votes tomorrow. I would like the \nopportunity to have others discuss the issue of lifting the cap on \npunitive damages in the underlying bill.\n  Let me again reemphasize. I am not amending the Dole amendment that \ndeals with issues other than product liability. My amendment will deal \nwith the underlying bill, and the cap on punitive damages in S. 565.\n  My hope would be that we will continue to debate this issue. As we \ndiscuss punitive damages, this Congress ought to consider the option of \nreturning to the language in the product liability reform legislation \nconsidered last year with respect to punitive damages. Under last \nyear's legislation a Federal standard would have been established \nwithout a cap on punitive damages. The legislation we are considering \nthis year not only changes the standard but imposes a cap. It seems to \nme this cap is not necessary and inappropriate.\n  Last year, I was upset about another provision. The legislation that \nwas brought to the floor included an FDA defense, whereby, a product \nthat was approved by the FDA would be immune from punitive damage \nliability. Last year, I said I will not support that, and I will not \nvote for cloture until that is stripped out. I voted against cloture, \nuntil I was assured that the FDA defense would be stricken. I decided \nto vote for cloture at that point.\n  The FDA provision was not included in this year's provision, but, \nthey put in another cap on punitive damages which they did not have \nlast year. That makes no sense to me. I hope that this Congress will \ncome to the same conclusion that I have come to, that this bill is \nworth advancing, that we should pass a product liability reform bill, \nbut that it should be enacted without the section that includes a cap \non punitive damages. I think a cap is unwarranted, unfair and unwise.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for offering and defending his amendment. It moves this \nprocess forward, and as he said we are seeking at this point a \nunanimous-consent agreement under which we can deal with punitive \ndamages today and tomorrow morning the way in which we dealt with \nmedical malpractice yesterday and this morning, by gathering all the \namendments together, debating them tonight and for a while tomorrow \nmorning and then voting on them all in a row.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 620 to amendment No. 596\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded \n                  in a health care liability action.)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, at this point I send an amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of the distinguished Senator who now occupies the Chair \nand ask for its immediate question.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. This is an amendment to the Gorton substitute, so I ask \nto set aside the Dole amendment as well for the purposes of considering \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 620 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19 strike line 22 through page 20 line 4, and \n     insert the following new subsection:\n       (b) Limitation on Amount.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount of punitive damages that may be \n     awarded to a claimant in a product liability action that is \n     subject to this title shall not exceed 2 times the sum of--\n       (A) the amount awarded to the claimant for economic loss; \n     and\n       (B) the amount awarded to the claimant for noneconomic \n     loss.\n       (2) Application by court.--This subsection shall be applied \n     by the court and the application of this subsection shall not \n     be disclosed to the jury.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, for the information of the Senate, this \nis identical to the Snowe amendment on punitive damages which was \nadopted as a part of the medical malpractice amendment which now, as a \nresult of our last recorded vote, is a part of this bill. It differs \nonly in that it is an amendment to the underlying Gorton substitute and \nimposes the same rule with respect to punitive damages, that is to say, \ntwo times the combination of economic and noneconomic damages for the \noriginal limitation on punitive damages included in the Gorton \nsubstitute.\n  I have discussed this next request with the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota because it is a milder version than his, I think \nlogically assuming that we get the votes tomorrow, that it be voted on \nbefore his amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that it be placed on \nany future agreement to a vote ahead of the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And I do not expect we will object, but I wanted to clear \nthat with our side of the aisle, so if the Senator will withhold \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will withhold it momentarily.\n  Madam President, I briefly explained this amendment. I would expect \nthat it would be adopted by voice vote because there was a rollcall \nvote earlier today on precisely this amendment, and I doubt that the \nbody needs that vote repeated. It is in my view a preferable formula to \nthat proposed by the Senator from North Dakota, which, of course, would \nremove all limitations and essentially all Federal controls over \npunitive damages. And it is punitive damages, of course, which is the \nsubject not only of the Dole amendment but of much of the original \nproduct liability bill, and it is a formula with respect to punitive \ndamages proposed by the occupant of the chair as accepted by a \nunanimous vote this morning.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I withdraw my reservation. I have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. GORTON. I repeat the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Washington repeat the \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GORTON. Assuming there is later today an order for votes on all \namendments dealing with punitive damages, that the Snowe amendment \n[[Page S5961]]  be voted on immediately prior to the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I wish to repeat once more that I \nunderstand there are additional amendments to be proposed by the \nSenator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nKyl], the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], the majority leader, the \nSenator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], and the Senator from Alabama [Mr. \nShelby], from this side of the aisle and perhaps additional amendments \non punitive damages on the other side of the aisle. We have no \nunanimous consent on the subject yet. I hope that Members who want to \nspeak to the subject of punitive damages and introduce amendments on \nthe subject of punitive damages will do so as promptly as is convenient \nto them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5945-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5961-S5975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      AUTOMOTIVE TRADE WITH JAPAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, America's trading relationship with Japan \nis now reaching a historic, serious phase in what has been a long \nhistory of innumerable initiatives and negotiations to gain access for \nAmerican products into her market. Strong action will very likely need \nto be taken by the administration, and the support of the Senate and \nAmerican industry will be important.\n  The United States and Japan are nearing the end of over a year and a \nhalf of negotiations on automotive trade, aimed at reducing our $66 \nbillion trade imbalance with Japan by opening major elements of her \nclosed domestic market to our products. The issue, access to Japan's \nautomobile market, including to her dealerships for American cars, and \nto the lucrative auto parts market, is reaching a critical juncture. \nThe issue this time involves, once again, more than the securing of \ncommitments by the Japanese in a written agreement to try to do \nsomething to open her market. It goes to the heart of America's \nstrategy on how to gain the actual results of opening the Japanese \nmarket.\n  The question is whether we, including both the executive branch and \nthe Congress, along with American industry are all prepared to stick to \nour guns and take action against Japanese imports if the auto market in \nJapan remains essentially closed to our cars and our spare parts. \nSpecifically, are we willing to take retaliatory action and impose \ntrade sanctions on her products, under section 301 of the 1974 Trade \nAct? I say to my colleagues that now is the time to change the paradigm \nin our trading relations with Japan. If we are not prepared to take \nretaliatory actions under the law, in a situation which is about as \nperfectly suited as is possible to the intent of the law as it was \nwritten, then we may be looking at a continuation of these deficits in \nperpetuity.\n  Madam President, if anyone doubts the persistence of unfair barriers \nin Japan to her marketplace, then they ought to take a look at the 1995 \nNational Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, which \nprovides an annual inventory of the most important foreign barriers \naffecting U.S. export of goods and services, foreign direct investment, \nand protection of intellectual property rights. The latest report \ndedicates some 44 pages of material to the subject on Japan alone, far \nmore than to any other country, far more than to the second place, the \nEuropean Union, most of the important countries of Western Europe \ncombined, which takes up 28 pages, and double that of China, with which \ncountry we run our second largest annual trade deficit--44 pages, much \nof it dedicated to the automobile trade.\n  How important is the auto trade for America's current account balance \nand for the American economy? The answer is: as important as any single \nsector can be. America's trade deficit with Japan in 1994 reached \nanother record high, at $65.7 billion, up 10 percent from 1993, when it \ntotaled $59.3 billion. Of that amount, the bilateral automotive trade \ndeficit accounted for\n about $37 billion, or 56 percent of the total, so most of our deficit \nwith Japan can be attributed to cars and to auto parts. More than that, \nthe auto trade deficit with Japan constituted some 22 percent of our \nentire trade deficit with the world. The policy announced by our Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Kantor--according to his testimony before \nthe Finance Committee on April 4, 1995--is that this deficit is the \nresult of unfair Japanese practices, that it is unacceptable, that he \nwill use every tool at his disposal to correct it, and that, in \ngeneral, he will use a practical, market-based, results oriented \napproach to dealing with these non-market barriers. I strongly support \nthis approach, and I believe that the Senate as a whole does as well.\n\n  As far as the impact on the American economy is concerned, a strong \nauto sector is crucial. Two million, two hundred thousand people in the \nUnited States are employed in the parts industry alone--such vital \nindustries as aluminum, steel, glass, rubber, electronics, \nsemiconductors, machine tools, and many others. This is on top of the \nsome 700,000 people employed by the Big Three auto manufacturers \nthemselves, the Nation's largest manufacturing industry. Sales of cars \nand trucks constitute some 4.4 percent of our gross domestic product.\n  Negotiations with Japan have reached a crucial stage regarding the \nauto industry's attempts to deregulate the Japanese auto parts market. \nNegotiations on access to the Japan auto business began as a result of \nthe agreement reached by this administration with the Government of \nJapan in July of 1993, the so-called Framework for a New Economic \nPartnership. This framework established a general set of results to be \nused in specific negotiations, and refocused the criteria for progress \naway from the process of removing trade barriers to actual results in \nthe way of real economic progress in market penetration. After 18 \nmonths of negotiations on automobile negotiations--including access to \nthe motor vehicle market by breaking into Japan's dealerships, the \npurchase of original parts by Japan's automakers from United States \nsuppliers, and the regulation of the auto parts aftermarket, which is \nrepair parts--Ambassador Kantor has concluded that ``there has been \nvirtually no progress.'' One result has been the initiation by the \nTrade Representative, on October 1, 1994, of a section 301 \ninvestigation of Japan's replacement auto parts market, which is \nvirtually closed.\n  The difference between the United States and Japanese markets in this \narea could not be more dramatic and more symbolic of our troubled trade \nrelationship: A Department of Commerce study in 1991 estimated that \nJapanese vehicle manufacturers controlled about 80 percent of the parts \nmarket, while in the United States the situation is the reverse, and \nindependent replacement parts producers account for 80 percent of the \nmarket. So, while the United States market is wide open, the Japanese \nmarket is closed. To make the situation more unfair to us, the Japanese \nclosed market allows their manufacturers to run the prices up on their \nown consumers for\n repair parts. Another U.S. Government survey has concluded that their \naftermarket repair parts cost, on average, some 340 percent higher than \ncomparable parts in the United Sates.\n\n  This tremendous windfall of billions of dollars in extra profits \nhelps subsidize the Japanese car industry, so that it can compete more \neffectively in the international market, subsidizing lower costs for \nJapanese cars here in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. \nTherefore, it's a triple whammy: Our parts manufacturers cannot sell \neffectively in the Japanese market; Japanese consumers get gouged; and \nthe whole thing results in cheaper, more competitive Japanese cars \nworldwide.\n  The ``Karetsu'' system of interlocking and cozy exclusive \nrelationships among suppliers, manufacturers, and dealers serves as an \neffective blocking action against market penetration, and I am advised \nthat the powerful Japanese Government bureaucracy serves to abet this \nexclusivity in supporting a regulatory framework not conductive to easy \naccess. Japan's competition law, known as the Antimonopoly Act, \n[[Page S5962]]  which prohibits unfair trade practices has, according \nto the 1995 Foreign Trade Barriers report, a ``weak and ineffective'' \nenforcement history. The Japan Fair Trade Commission, which is supposed \nto implement that law, has ``not shown any serious inclination to use \nits enforcement powers to eliminate the anticompetitive practices in \nsectoral markets that are excluding foreign goods and services from the \nJapanese market.'' This is a system totally incompatible with the \nprinciples of free international trade.\n  As to new American cars, it is nearly impossible for Japanese \nbusinessmen who operate dealerships and showrooms to agree to sell \nAmerican cars. I understand that many of these dealers would like to do \nso, but they fear retribution from Japanese car manufacturers and are \nwarned against taking American business. Hence, the marketplace for new \nAmerican cars in Japan remains extremely narrow and difficult to \npenetrate. What are the results? While Japanese automakers hold some \n22.5 percent of the American market, the share of the Japanese market \nheld by the Big Three United States automakers is less than 1 percent.\n  The Japanese economy is, in many ways, a sanctuary market, closed to \nthe world, but depending to a large extent on robust exports. Trade \nagreements are, more often than not, written agreements which are \nfrustrated by a maze of business practices, Government regulations, and \nother hurdles for importers to jump. The problem is that other nations, \nparticularly in Asia, are engaging in the same practices, and if the \nJapanese market is not pried open, these trade imbalances will be \nmirrored elsewhere, as they are today with China. We see the same kind \nof practices in Korea.\n  Therefore, the stakes in fair trade with Japan have worldwide \nramifications and affect the very future of American participation in a \ntrading system which enjoys access to a wide open American market. We \nneed to demand reciprocity, which would\n allow our products to compete freely. If our products fail to attract \nbuyers because they fall short on the merits, fine, then that is our \nfault. But this is not what is driving the large deficits with Japan, \nand our industries and economy will suffer as they are suffering, and \nas they have suffered.\n\n  I was very pleased to see the dramatic accord that was achieved by \nour Trade Representative with China on the matter of intellectual \nproperty rights, and I would note that it was achieved only at the 11th \nhour and with the certainty of definite retaliation by the United \nStates, absent achieving an accord. Given the history of trade \npractices with the Japanese, I fear that only a believable threat, or \nactual retaliation, may be sufficient to get equitable results in the \nJapanese auto market.\n  In the new world that is emerging after the collapse of the Soviet \nEmpire, it is important to see the overall United States-Japanese \nrelationship as one of give-and-take across the board. The United \nStates still maintains armed forces in Japan and that relationship has \nbeen excellent, with Japan providing needed host-nation financial \nsupport. It is an excellent burden-sharing arrangement. While our \nsecurity relationship has been in balance, and a close relationship \nremains intact, the trading situation has generated unneeded frictions.\n  Today, American national security and economic security go together, \nhand-in-hand. Japan has a deep-vested interest in the health of the \nAmerican economy, and economy increasingly dependent on trade. Eleven \nmillion Americans are now employed in export-industry jobs, a doubling \nof the number from just 10 years ago. It will be more and more \ndifficult to maintain robust deployed forces in the Pacific, as we \nshould, without a strong American economy.\n  Persistent massive trade deficits with Japan and other Asian nations \nruns counter to this, and they erode our ability to sustain the kind of \na Pacific rim presence that both we and our allies in the Pacific, \nparticularly Japan, believe is in our overall interest of stability and \npeace. And so it is important for the Japanese Government to make every \neffort to ensure that our trade relationship enjoys the same healthy \nsubstance of a two-way street.\n  The deficit in the United States-Japanese automotive parts trade \nreached a record $12.8 billion in 1994, deteriorating 15 percent from \n1993, at the very time that negotiations were ongoing on this matter. \nThe Japanese sold a record $14.3 billion in auto parts in the United \nStates, compared to a meager $1.5 billion in United States auto parts \nwhich managed to squeeze into the Japanese market. It is a major \nelement in our deficit picture, and something has to give.\n  It is precisely in this situation that the 301 law is available to \nthe Trade Representative, and I certainly expect that he will probably \nhave to use it and he should have no compunction against using it. This \nmeans that when the section 301 investigation of unfair practices in \nthe auto parts market is concluded--at the latest by October 1, 1995--\nif the current stalemate continues, the United States should not \nhesitate to retaliate. According to a New York Times article of April \n13, 1995, an administration ``task force has already been established \nto draw up a list of Japanese\n products that would be subject to 100-percent tariffs unless Japan \ntakes what one senior official today called `enormous leaps' during \nmeetings scheduled over the next several weeks.'' These officials \nindicated such a list would be announced this month. I note that the \nnext round of negotiations with the Japanese is scheduled to take place \nthis week, on tomorrow, Wednesday, May 3, 1995, and I hope that our \nnegotiator there, Ambassador-designate Ira Shapiro, will tell the \nJapanese that stonewalling will result in retaliatory action, with \nstrong Senate action, if needed, to follow up on the retaliatory \nmeasures that might be announced by the administration.\n\n  I point out, Madam President, that there is extensive support across \nthe board in American industry for the strong action that might be \nrequired against Japanese products in the event that the results sought \nby the administration are not obtained. I include in the Record a list \nof 27 major United States companies and associations that deal with \nJapan which support our negotiations on this matter. It includes the \nBusiness Roundtable, the major auto companies, and associations \nrepresenting those manufacturers who have a stake in the health of the \nauto and auto parts industries, such as glass, iron and steel, and \nelectronics. It includes the major labor organizations, including the \nUnited Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. There is obviously very broad \nconsensus across American business and labor organizations that the \ntime for action is past; so we have only now left to us.\n  It is clear that, while there may be every good intention on the part \nof Japanese policymakers and other sectors of Japanese society and \nbusiness to open the Japanese market to American automobiles and \nproducts, what really counts in the long run are results, and actions \nto do so. Performance, not promises, is only what we are seeking, and \none must be prepared to take strong action to encourage such \nperformance.\n  Madam President, automobiles and parts have been the central problem \nin Japan's trading relations with the rest of the world for many years. \nIf we can solve the problem, and break the ``keiretsu'' psychology and \npractices which close Japan's markets, a new era between our two \nnations will emerge. If we fail, our relationship will continue to \ndeteriorate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a group of supporting \ndocuments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOrganizations Supporting United States-Japan Auto and Auto Parts Trade \n                              Negotiations\n\n       Aluminum Association.\n       American Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n       American Electronics Association.\n       American Federation of Labor Congress of Industrial \n     Organizations.\n       American Forest and Paper Association.\n       American Iron and Steel Institute.\n       American Textile Manufacturers Association.\n       Association of Manufacturing Technology.\n       Automotive Parts and Accessories Association.\n       Business Roundtable.\n       Chrysler Corporation.\n       Copper and Brass Fabricators Association.\n       Ford Motor Company.\n       General Motors.\n       Guardian Industries.\n       [[Page S5963]] International Insurance Council.\n       Joint Automotive Supplier Government Action Council.\n       Motion Picture Association.\n       Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Glass Association.\n       Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association.\n       Semiconductor Industry Association.\n       Specialty Equipment Market Association.\n       United Auto Workers.\n       United States Business and Industrial Council.\n       US-Japan Business Council.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    National Consumers League,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the National Consumers \n     League, I want to express our support for the \n     Administration's position in the Framework negotiations with \n     Japan and our interest in opening the Japanese market to \n     competitive American automotive products. The vehicles and \n     parts made in this country meet a wide variety of safety and \n     environmental standards. The production facilities in which \n     they are made meet standards for their operation as well. The \n     workers in these plants benefit from protective health and \n     safety laws and many have won further protection through \n     union representation. All of these conditions contribute to \n     beneficial results for Americans who are consumers of the \n     products made by the industry and consumers of its \n     environmental impacts.\n       The companies that meet these conditions should be able to \n     supply markets abroad on the same terms as foreign companies \n     find in this market. All foreign producers of vehicles and \n     auto parts have unrestricted access to the U.S. market. We \n     understand that the Clinton Administration is seeking just \n     such access to the Japanese market for U.S. automotive \n     products and we fully support that objective.\n       American industries that contribute to the social and \n     economic well-being of the nation, as does the automotive \n     industry by meeting a variety of legal and regulatory \n     standards and affording workers a voice in their work lives, \n     deserve the support of the U.S. government in gaining the \n     ability to sell their products internationally. American \n     consumers and Japanese consumers would benefit from the \n     elimination of Japanese barriers to access to that market for \n     the quality products made by American workers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Linda Golodner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Caterpillar, Inc.,\n\n                                                    April 7, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: I'm writing as Chairman of the \n     U.S.-Japan Business Council which represents the interests of \n     leading U.S. manufacturing and service firms. The purpose of \n     my letter is to commend your Administration for the \n     aggressive leadership it's providing on behalf of U.S. \n     automobile and auto parts producers as they attempt to \n     compete in the Japanese marketplace.\n       As your trade negotiators have recognized, the fundamental \n     problem in the U.S.-Japan economic relationship is that \n     Japan's markets in a host of industrial and service sectors \n     remain more restrictive than those in the United States and \n     other major economies. It's equally clear that the U.S. trade \n     deficit with Japan will persist--despite sharp appreciations \n     of the yen and a sizable reduction in the U.S. budget \n     deficit--until Japan reforms its regulatory and market entry \n     practices.\n       Your Administration has managed to negotiate several \n     results-oriented trade agreements with Japan in such areas as \n     government procurement of medical and telecommunications \n     equipment, insurance, flat glass, and financial services \n     under the U.S.-Japan Framework Agreement. The members of the \n     U.S.-Japan Business Council, many of whom will benefit once \n     these agreements are implemented, commend your trade team for \n     this achievement.\n       But the fact that no agreement has been reached in one of \n     the most important sectors of our trading relationship with \n     Japan--autos and auto parts--is troublesome . . . especially \n     given the broad range of industries and jobs involved in the \n     automotive sector . . . electronics, semiconductors, steel, \n     chemicals, and machine tools.\n       Although U.S. auto and auto parts companies are now \n     competitive and committed to the Japanese market, they and \n     other foreign producers continue to be denied full and \n     comparable access to the Japanese automobile distribution \n     system, as well as markets for original equipment and \n     replacement parts.\n       Meanwhile, the bilateral trade imbalance in motor vehicles \n     and parts, which typically accounts for some 60 percent of \n     the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, hit a record high of $36.7 \n     billion in 1994. Forecasts suggest even greater deficits in \n     this sector in 1995.\n       On behalf of the U.S.-Japan Business Council, I urge your \n     Administration to continue working toward a comprehensive \n     agreement that will result in increased access and sales \n     opportunities for U.S. automobile manufacturers and parts \n     producers in the original equipment and replacement parts \n     markets in Japan and the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald V. Fites.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Statement of The National Association of Manufacturers on The United \n                     States-Japan Auto Negotiations\n\n       The NAM's membership has a clear and substantial interest \n     in a U.S.-Japan relationship characterized by a two-way free \n     flow of goods, services and investment. The NAM thus supports \n     the ``framework for a new economic partnership'' between \n     Japan and the United States. As part of this framework, it is \n     appropriate that Japan has committed to implement policies \n     ``intended to achieve a highly significant reduction'' in its \n     persistent and large trade surplus with the United States. \n     The framework addresses both structural imbalances between \n     the U.S. and Japanese economies as well as those sectors of \n     the Japanese economy where market forces have, in the past, \n     clearly not been allowed to operate freely.\n       The NAM recognizes the importance of successfully resolving \n     the current bilateral automotive negotiations by ensuring \n     significant and sustained market access and sales \n     opportunities for foreign vehicles and parts in the Japanese \n     market. The NAM thus supports the efforts of the U.S. and the \n     Japanese Governments to reach speedy agreement to achieve \n     such access.\n       The NAM also urges the U.S. Government to reassert that the \n     full implementation of all previously negotiated agreements \n     with Japan in other sectors remains a priority objective.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      The Business Roundtable,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor. As you know, The Business \n     Roundtable has long been a major supporter of the efforts of \n     the U.S. government to open foreign markets to international \n     trade and investment. In this connection, U.S./Japan trade \n     policy developments have been of particular concern to us.\n       The difficulties that U.S. business has had in expanding \n     its sales and investments in Japan have been a continuing \n     frustration. While progress has been achieved in some \n     sectors, such as semiconductors, other areas have seen \n     insufficient improvements.\n       In particular, the automotive sector has experienced \n     significant difficulty penetrating the Japan market, and the \n     trade imbalance in this sector alone represents nearly 60% of \n     the total trade deficit between the U.S. and Japan. The \n     Roundtable believes that a successful auto negotiation with \n     the Japanese will have ramifications beyond Japan and could \n     help to facilitate further market opening initiatives in \n     other Asian countries.\n       The purpose of this letter is not to provide you with the \n     specifics of the auto sector trade problem faced by U.S. \n     exporters; the U.S. auto and auto parts industries can do \n     this far more effectively than we can. Rather, it is to \n     underscore the importance of negotiations in this sector. We \n     are also not the ones to advise you on the precise shape of a \n     successful agreement on auto sector trade with Japan. That \n     said, we believe that fundamental to any successful \n     negotiation is the need for agreements to include a basis on \n     which the results can be evaluated. Without an acceptable \n     basis to gauge the impact of an auto sector trade agreement, \n     there will be a significant risk that subsequent activities/\n     discussions to any agreement will devolve into continuous \n     argument regarding implementation process rather than \n     achieving actual results.\n       We know that the auto sector negotiations with Japan have \n     been, and will continue to be, difficult. For this reason, we \n     think that it is important for you to know that The Business \n     Roundtable fully supports the pursuit of U.S. rights under \n     the rules of the World Trade Organization, aggressive use of \n     U.S. trade laws and whatever other action may be necessary to \n     achieve meaningful access to the Japanese market in this \n     critical sector.\n       In closing, thank you for your tireless efforts to open \n     foreign markets to U.S. exports, and we encourage your \n     continued resolve in these negotiations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jerry R.

Mickey Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: I am writing to urge the \n     Administration to continue its efforts to reach a results-\n     oriented agreement with Japan on autos and auto parts. The \n     discrimination and inequity present in the existing trading \n     relationship can no longer be papered over.\n       American workers in a wide range of industries and \n     occupations would benefit from the reduction of the U.S. \n     deficit in automotive \n     [[Page S5964]]  trade with Japan and the elimination of \n     discriminatory practices by Japanese companies directed at \n     U.S. firms. Union members in the rubber, glass, steel, \n     aluminum, textile, machine tool, chemical, electrical, \n     electronics and other industries would directly benefit from \n     increased access to the Japanese auto market for competitive \n     American products. Unionized workers in other industries, \n     including entertainment, telecommunications, construction, \n     aerospace, paper and even-more, would gain additional jobs if \n     the Japanese market were truly open and discrimination \n     against U.S. producers was ended.\n       The AFL-CIO believes that international trade can benefit \n     American workers, but that trade must be fair and equitable. \n     That is not the case with U.S. auto trade with Japan today. \n     During the past nine years, the U.S. deficit in auto trades \n     with Japan nearly hit $300 billion. If that deficit could be \n     reduced substantially, the Clinton Administration's effort to \n     establish equity in that trading relationship through the \n     Framework negotiations could lead to the creation of many \n     thousands of American jobs. We will judge the success of the \n     Framework's auto talks by their impact on the jobs of \n     American workers, not by the quantity of words in any \n     agreement. Under a good agreement, we expect the U.S. \n     automotive trade deficit with Japan to decline rapidly.\n       The commitment of the Clinton Administration to ``result-\n     oriented'' negotiations must be fulfilled either through \n     effective, verifiable agreements or reciprocal treatment of \n     U.S. imports from Japan. If an acceptable agreement cannot be \n     reached in the next few months, the U.S. must impose \n     sanctions on imports from Japan that are commensurate with \n     the damage to American workers caused by Japan's barriers to \n     U.S. products. It is time to demonstrate the Administration's \n     commitment to settling this long-running trade disaster.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lane Kirkland,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           Aluminum Industry Supports U.S.-Japan Negotiations\n\n\n  the aluminum association strongly supports market access with japan\n\n       Washington, D.C., April 13, 1995.--The Aluminum Association \n     announced today its strong support for a swift and positive \n     conclusion to the U.S.-Japan automotive trade negotiations. \n     The aluminum industry, long-time advocates of free trade, \n     urged the removal of barriers and the opening of Japan's \n     parts and vehicle market to foreign cars and parts.\n       U.S. aluminum companies are historic free-traders. They \n     produce 19 billion pounds of metal each year, making them the \n     world's largest aluminum industry. The U.S. aluminum market \n     is the world's largest, most sophisticated and most open, yet \n     major barriers to market access in Japan remain. The aluminum \n     industry strongly supports the U.S. Government's efforts to \n     remedy this persistent problem.\n       The auto and auto parts industry and its unhindered access \n     to Japanese markets and manufacturers is extremely important \n     to our industry. In 1993, the aluminum industry shipped about \n     4.2 billion pounds of aluminum to the transportation market. \n     This makes it the industry's second largest market.\n       Aluminum Association President David N. Parker, called for \n     an effective, results-oriented agreement on the negotiations \n     and remarked that the ``talks mirror our industry's long time \n     efforts to achieve open markets for aluminum.''\n       Aluminum represents over 200 pounds of an average vehicle, \n     a growth of over 55 percent in the last decade. Aluminum \n     plays a significant role in lightweighting both domestic and \n     foreign vehicles. Industry experts expect its percentage of \n     the average car to increase rapidly as demand for fuel \n     efficient vehicles which retain size, safety, and \n     environmental friendliness grows. Select cars have already \n     shown that as much as 500-1,000 pounds of aluminum can be \n     used successfully to achieve high performance or fuel \n     efficiency.\n       The Aluminum Association represents primary and secondary \n     producers of aluminum, as well as semi-fabricated products. \n     Member companies operate approximately 300 plants in 40 \n     states.\n                                                                    ____\n\n AISI Issues Policy Statement on United States-Japan Auto Talks: Steel \nGives Strong Support to Goal of Timely and Meaningful Market Access in \n                                 Japan\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The American Iron and Steel Institute \n     (AISI) today issued the following policy statement in strong \n     support of U.S. government efforts to achieve a prompt, \n     ``results-oriented'' resolution of the U.S.-Japan bilateral \n     automotive negotiations.\n       ``Steel producers in North America have an important, \n     direct stake in--and indeed, have contributed substantially \n     to--the renewed competitiveness of North America's auto \n     industry in recent years. That was a main reason steel \n     producers throughout North America strongly supported NAFTA--\n     because we saw it benefiting our major customers in the North \n     American auto industry.\n       Given the auto industry's continued importance to the North \n     American economy (4.6 percent of total U.S. GDP). AISI's \n     U.S., Canadian and Mexican member companies remain deeply \n     concerned by North America's large and persistent trade \n     deficit with Japan in the automotive sector.\n       The fact is, as competitive as the North American auto \n     industry has become, it still requires free and open markets \n     and fair and reciprocal market access worldwide to reap the \n     full benefits of its restored status as a world class \n     industry. Unfortunately, North America's producers of motor \n     vehicles and auto parts do not have such equality of market \n     access currently with respect to Japan.\n       It is therefore essential that the ongoing U.S.-Japan \n     bilateral automotive negotiations produce a successful and \n     timely resolution of this critical problem by achieving \n     significant and sustained market access and sales \n     opportunities in Japan for North American and other non-\n     Japanese producers of vehicles and parts. Thus, AISI strongly \n     supports the U.S. government's ``results-oriented'' efforts \n     to reach agreement as quickly as possible on meaningful \n     market access in Japan for this vital North American \n     industry.\n       As part of the U.S.-Japan ``framework agreement''--under \n     which the automotive talks are occurring--Japan has committed \n     to implement policies ``intended to achieve a highly \n     significant reduction'' in its trade surplus with the United \n     States, which exceeded $65 billion last year.\n       This enormous and unsustainable trade imbalance, two-thirds \n     of which is in the automotive sector, requires prompt \n     corrective action--by achieving measurable results in the \n     auto sector as soon as possible, and ensuring full \n     implementation of all previously negotiated agreements with \n     Japan in other sectors.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Statement of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute on United \n                     States-Japan Automobile Trade\n\n       The American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) \n     strongly supports the Clinton administration's efforts to \n     open the Japanese market to U.S. automobile and automobile \n     parts. ATMI is the national trade association for the \n     domestic textile industry. ATMI member companies operate in \n     more than 30 states and account for over 80 percent of all \n     textile fibers consumed by U.S. mills.\n       The American textile industry is a major supplier to the \n     U.S. automobile industry. Textile goods produced for use in \n     automobiles include not only upholstery and floor coverings, \n     but sidewalls (the interior sides of cars), head linings (the \n     interior roof material), hood linings (material on the \n     underside of the hood), trunk linings, convertible tops and \n     vinyl hardtops, tire reinforcement, hose fabric and \n     transmission belts. In fact, the average truck contains 18 \n     square yards of textile fabric, while the average car \n     contains 29 square yards.\n       In 1993, automobiles and trucks accounted for more than 1.2 \n     billion square yards of fabric consumption in the United \n     States, or 1.2 billion pounds of fiber. By weight, this \n     represents nearly 10 percent of the total fiber consumption \n     in the U.S. Clearly, the auto industry is an important \n     customer of the American textile industry.\n       The opening of foreign markets to U.S. textile products and \n     to items containing U.S. textile products is a vital part of \n     our industry's global competitiveness strategy. In this \n     light, ATMI endorses the efforts of Ambassador Kantor to open \n     Japan's market to U.S. autos and auto parts and urges the \n     administration to continue to seek adequate market access in \n     the current negotiations with the government of Japan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Nearly Twenty Industries Join in Call for Japan Government to Open \n                    Closed Markets to U.S. Products\n\n       Washington, D.C.--A diverse group of the nation's largest \n     industries joined together today to call on the Japanese \n     government to open its market to reduce its record $66 \n     billion merchandise trade surplus with the U.S.\n       ``Japan's chronic trade surplus is choking its economy and \n     playing havoc with the world's currency markets,'' said \n     Andrew H. Card, Jr., President and CEO of the American \n     Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA). ``After more \n     than 25 years of foot-dragging, it's time for the Japanese \n     government to join with other industrialized nations to \n     practice free trade in its own market.''\n       Autos and auto parts accounted for $36.8 billion of the \n     U.S. trade deficit with Japan last year and is predicted to \n     reach $39 billion in 1995.\n       The latest round of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations is \n     scheduled to conclude in Washington on Tuesday.\n       Nearly twenty industry representatives--from aluminum and \n     steel producers to pharmaceutical manufacturers--joined Card \n     in calling for greater access to Japan's ``sanctuary'' \n     markets.\n       ``The whole world is watching the outcome of these \n     negotiations. If Japan fails to undertake decisive reform to \n     open its automotive sector, there are numerous developing \n     economies waiting in the wings--China, Korea, Indonesia, \n     Vietnam--which will be tempted to follow Japan's sanctuary \n     market as a model, rather than to adopt a free and open model \n     which provides benefits to all participants in the world \n     open-trading system,'' Card said.\n       Other groups joining AAMA at the press conference include \n     the: Aluminum Association, American Electronics Association, \n     American Forest and Paper Association, American Iron and \n     Steel Institute, Automobile Parts and Accessories \n     Association, Copper and Brass Fabricators Association, \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, \n     Association of Manufacturing \n     [[Page S5965]]  Technology, International Insurance Council, \n     Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Specialty \n     Equipment Manufacturers Association and the United Auto \n     Workers Union.\n       Other groups calling on Japan to open its markets include \n     the: American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Joint \n     automotive Supplier Government Action council, Motion Picture \n     Association of America, National Association of \n     Manufacturers, National Glass Association and U.S.-Japan \n     Business Council.\n       During the press conference, Card pointed to a new report \n     by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan which outlines \n     trade barriers across 35 industrial sectors.\n       With regard to autos, the ACCJ report concluded that the \n     Japanese manufacturers intend to continue discouraging \n     dealers from franchise agreements with U.S. automakers.\n       The ACCJ report recommends that the Japanese Government: \n     Open Japan's auto market; provide free access to Japanese \n     dealers; simplify regulations and procedures; and open \n     Japan's parts market to foreign suppliers.\n       AAMA is the trade association headquartered in Washington, \n     D.C. whose members are Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Semiconductor Industry Association,\n\n                                     San Jose, CA, April 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ronald H. Brown,\n     Secretary of Commerce, Department of Commerce, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor and Secretary Brown: The \n     Semiconductor Industry Association strongly supports your \n     efforts to achieve a substantial measurable increase in \n     imports into Japan's automotive and automotive parts markets. \n     These efforts are both necessary and appropriate. There can \n     be no acceptable alternative to having outcomes in the \n     Japanese market reflect the competitiveness of American auto \n     and auto parts producers. This has not yet been allowed to \n     occur.\n       Your efforts serve not only the broad national interest but \n     are of real economic interest to our industry as well. \n     Semiconductors are a key component in modern automobiles, \n     with applications including engine controllers, air bags, and \n     antilock brakes. There is a direct impact on U.S. chip \n     companies from both the very low levels of U.S. automobile \n     exports to Japan and the reluctance of Japan automobile \n     companies to use American components.\n       In 1994 over $1.7 billion of semiconductors were used in \n     American automobiles. This figure could have been \n     substantially higher if it were not for the fact that of the \n     10 million vehicles produced by the three American firms in \n     the U.S., only 33,000 were exported to Japan.\n       U.S. firms have been working for years to increase their \n     share of the $1.3 billion Japanese automotive chip market \n     through the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. The foreign \n     automotive semiconductor share in Japan of about 10 percent, \n     while much higher than five years ago, remains well below the \n     dominant shares that U.S. firms have achieved in other world \n     markets. The limited foreign penetration to Japan's auto \n     semiconductor market is also in contrast to the significant \n     progress which is being made in a number of other electronics \n     sectors in Japan.\n       The implementation of market access agreements with Japan \n     requires extraordinary efforts on the part of both American \n     suppliers and Japanese purchasers, and by both governments, \n     but the benefits can also be extraordinary. The U.S.-Japan \n     Semiconductor Agreement has led to an additional $2.5 billion \n     in annual U.S. sales in Japan and to unprecedented \n     cooperation between American and Japanese companies and \n     industries.\n       While SIA intends to continue to work through the U.S.-\n     Japan Semiconductor Agreement to further programs in \n     semiconductor market access, an agreement on auto parts is \n     fully complementary and very much in the interest of not only \n     the U.S. economy, but of harmonious relations between the \n     United States and Japan.\n       We wish you well in this vital endeavor. A successful autos \n     and auto parts agreements would promote the change in \n     attitudes towards imported components that is required for \n     success in increasing access to the Japanese market. SIA \n     fully supports your efforts to quickly achieve an effective \n     results-oriented agreement with the Government of Japan on \n     auto and auto parts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 A. A. Procensini,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 American Forest &\n\n\n                                            Paper Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Ira Shapiro,\n     General Counsel, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ira: The American Forest & Paper Association, on \n     behalf of the U.S. forest products industry, is highly \n     supportive of your efforts to open the Japanese market to \n     U.S. suppliers of autos and auto parts.\n       The long-standing problems of market access in this \n     sector--including kieretsu relationships between auto \n     producers and suppliers, denial of access to the producer-\n     owner distribution network, and the use of government \n     standards to exclude imports--are all-too-familiar features \n     of our own problems in penetrating the Japanese market. We \n     believe that a comprehensive, negotiated solution to the \n     auto/auto parts problems will have important implications for \n     the resolution of similar problems in other sectors, such as \n     ours, where the same pattern of exclusion is evident.\n       At the same time, we believe that the firm stand which USTR \n     has taken in these negotiations sends a very clear signal to \n     the Government of Japan that the Administration will take the \n     steps necessary to ensure compliance with existing \n     agreements. With both the wood and paper agreements \n     designated to a Super 301 watchlist, we anticipate that the \n     result of your efforts in the auto sector will be to heighten \n     Japanese awareness of the need to refocus its \n     ``encouragement'' of imports in a direction which leads to \n     concrete results.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Maureen R. Smith,\n                                    Vice President, International.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me commend our distinguished \nsenior Senator, former leader and President pro tempore of the body. \nSenator Byrd's words are music to this Senator's ears, because in all \nof the almost 5 months now of the so-called ``contract,'' not one word \nhas been stated until Senator Byrd has spoken about competitive trade \npolicy.\n  That is exactly what we need. Right to the point, as the \ndistinguished Senator has pointed out, the Japanese are subsidizing \ntheir sales--what we call ``loss leaders,'' in the retail business. \nThey subsidize and sell automobiles there for less than it costs them \nback in Japan.\n  I could not get the updated figures right now to be accurate, but I \nremember over a year ago a Toyota Cressida that sells for $21,800 in \nWashington, DC, sells for $31,800 back in Tokyo.\n  We had other comparable prices, and I would be glad to bring us up to \ndate. The point is, in the year 1994 just passed, Business Week \nreported that, once again, Japan had taken over a larger share of the \nAmerican domestic automobile market. Specifically, they had inched up \nanother 1.2 percent in spite of the competitiveness and quality \nproduction of the American automobile industry. We have all been \nbragging. Detroit is finally putting out real cars, quality production, \nand we are now demanding, instead of foreign cars, American cars for a \nchange. But with it all, Japan has still taken over more of the market.\n  Five years ago, I had the vice presidents of Chrysler, Ford, and \nGeneral Motors orchestrated almost to bring an antidumping case against \nJapan. While I had the agreement of Chrysler tentatively and Ford \ntentatively, General Motors bugged out. They said it was not good for \nbusiness. They better wake up and understand what is good for business.\n  Yes, our leader here is making a very cogent observation, but we will \nhave to go back to another colleague of ours who adopted the \nexpression, ``Where's the beef?'' Our Vice President.\n  We have been talking for years--years on end. I testified 35 years \nago with similar language about the textile industry. In 1980, 15 years \nago, the deficit in the balance of textile trade of the entire European \nmarket with Japan was some $4 billion--not with just Japan but with the \nPacific rim. We had a deficit, also, in the balance of textile trade of \n$4 billion.\n  In the ensuing 15 years now the Europeans have shown they know how to \ndeal with Japan. They do not have this weeping and wailing about fair \ntrade and level the playing field and whining and crying and moaning \nand groaning--business is business. Through the enforcement of their \nantidumping laws, they have reduced it to less than $1 billion. And our \ndeficit in the balance of textile trade has gone from $4 billion to $32 \nbillion. Add in that $28 billion in textile manufacture, and we have \nmillions of jobs.\n  Politicians are running all over the Hill talking about jobs, jobs, \ncreate jobs, jobs, jobs. We are exporting them as fast as we possibly \ncan.\n  A fundamental is involved, Madam President. They use the Friedrich \nList or German model, which Alexander Hamilton initiated in the \nfounding days of this Republic whereby the wealth of a nation is \nmeasured not by what it can buy but by what it can produce. The \ndecisions are made on the basis of whether or not it strengthens the \nJapanese economy or weakens the Japanese economy. The Japanese use \n[[Page S5966]]  government, along with trade policies and private \nsector to take over--in this instance, market share. That is why year \nupon year, end upon end, we send over our trade representatives. They \nmoan, they groan, they whine, they cry. We continue to keep our markets \nopen.\n  The only time anybody made any progress at all was under the \nvoluntary restraints agreement, and we slowed it down somewhat. \nHowever, we still have not really denied them access to our market.\n  Adam Smith, free trade is strictly passe in the global competition. \nForget it. Forget it. We have little Boy Scouts, and the Golden Rule, \ndo unto others as they do unto you. That does not apply in global \ncompetition.\n  I can say here and now we have to protect the economic backbone, the \nmanufacturing capacity and capability of our Nation or, as Akio Morita \nsaid years ago, that power that loses its manufacturing power ceases to \nbe a world power.\n  That is the road that we are on in this country of ours. I am glad \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia is emphasizing this. It is \nwell stated, and I hope we can get an administration that will answer \nthe question of our former Vice President Mondale, ``Where's the beef?\"\n  If they begin to put in some beef like they did with China, then we \ncan get an agreement like we did with China. If we put some beef behind \nthe words of the distinguished leader from West Virginia, we will get a \nresult. Business is business and it is not politics, and we have got to \nbegin to understand that.\n  One other item, and then I will yield, Madam President. It is a very, \nsome might say, splendored thing, but the question of \ntelecommunications, the information superhighway, is one of the most \ncomplex subjects or issues that we can possibly deal with.\n  The problem is that everyone wants to deregulate and let market \nforces control. Certainly this Senator does, and all the Senators that \nI know of with respect to our Commerce Committee holding the particular \nhearings.\n  The problem is we have a monopoly on the one hand and a \nresponsibility for universal service on the other hand. With respect to \nuniversal service, Madam President, we do not want to make the same \nmistake we did with airlines whereas today, now, 85 percent of the \nmedium- and small-sized towns and communities of America are \nsubsidizing the 50 percent long hauls, and all the airlines have gone \nbroke.\n  Universal service is splendid, outstanding, wonderful communications \nfrom our seven Bell companies. The local service operators, we want to \ncontinue that universal service and require, thereby, on the one hand, \neverybody coming in to contribute to a universal service fund, and on \nthe other, not allow our Bell companies to be cherrypicked and take off \nthe good business, high-concentrated service, so to speak, and leave \nthe rural and less populated areas for others to serve.\n  That is one of the tasks in regulating service. Otherwise, we have to \nregulate the unbundling of the monopoly. The monopoly is there, and we \nknow twofold: No. 1, that monopoly gets a 46 percent return on their \nguaranteed cash flow. Now, man, oh man, oh man. It did not come to my \nattention until just now. Later in the Record I will insert whereby the \nreturn of all investment to the leading industrial sectors of the \nUnited States of America--and now we will take long distance--the \nreturn they receive is 19 percent. The average is less than the 19 \npercent return on their investment. The highest of any in the United \nStates of America are seven Southern Bell. They get a 46 percent \nreturn.\n  Now, if I am president of a Bell company, why should I be pursuing \nthe Congress to get over the business where I am getting a 46-percent \nreturn into a business that gets, say, 19 percent or lesser return? \nBusiness is business.\n  I do not want my stockholders to lynch me and throw me out. So \nnecessarily, I am not, although I talk pretty-like on the one hand \nabout the superhighway and everything else like that, let the \ncompetition begin, I really do not care if we never pass a bill because \nI have a guaranteed cash flow of 5.6 billion bucks.\n I keep Wall Street happy with that. I spend about $2.7 billion in \nupgrading the system. And I have $1.7 billion in my back pocket here--\ncash. I can go to any bank, not only in the United States, but into \nTokyo or wherever, and with $1.7 billion cash in my back pocket, I can \nfinance anything.\n\n  So what I am saying in essence is that what we have to do is break up \nthat monopoly. These monopolistic Bell companies, we intended for them \nto be monopolies. The law required it. But having given it to them, we \nknow now, under the modified final judgment, they know how to get past \nevery rule and every regulation. I found it out all during the 1960's \nand 1970's when, on the Communications Subcommittee, I worked with \nthem. We tried our dead-level best to, by gosh, deregulate and open up \nAT and the Bell companies, and we could not do it.\n  We had to finally do it with the Department of Justice, the Antitrust \nDivision, and a consent decree. That modified final judgment is what \nfinally did the trick, because we had 12 rulings and findings by the \nFederal Communications Commission and they kept appealing them. And \neven though we would find against them, nothing was enforced. This \ncrowd knows how to use every word we write in the law and how to get \naround it and how to appeal it. And therein is another complexity.\n  Now we have an astounding development. The astounding development is \nthat with all the hearings and everything we have had, and how they \nhave stonewalled us, we finally had, just about 3 weeks ago, Ameritech, \na Bell company, along with the Justice Department, along with AT, the \nlong distance carrier, along with the Consumer Federation of America, \nagreed to a consent order to open up competition up in the mid-Northern \nsection of the United States of America.\n  I could hardly believe my ears, but they agreed to it. In fact, the \nBell companies have jumped all over their friend, Ameritech, and said, \n``Oh, no, no; this is not a precedent. This cannot be done. It is \nterrible. What did you do? You are a traitor,'' and everything else. \nThey have really been giving poor Ameritech a fit.\n  Be that as it may, I have in my hand a memorandum of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice ``In Support of its Motion for a Modification of \nthe Decree to Permit a Limited Trial of Interexchange Service by \nAmeritech.'' This explains the complexities of all the requirements \nnecessary in doing those two things, bringing about competition in the \nmain; but the two things: Maintaining the universal service on the one \nhand, and unbundling a monopoly on the other.\n  That is why some of these Senators can run around and say I want to \nbuild more deregulatory policy. That is political cover for saying I \nwant you to give me a day certain. If they get a day certain and the \nmonopoly is not broken up, then no one will enter the particular local \nexchange. The local exchange monopoly will be used to take over all the \nother competitive services and satellites, long distance, PCS, and all \nthe rest of the communications, and you are going to end up with \nmonopolistic conduct and not open competition. It is very, very \ncomplex. The best document I could possibly find is the one by our \nAssistant Attorney General, the Honorable Anne Bingaman, and her \ncolleagues here, on behalf of the United States of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this explanation of these complexities \nof this issue of deregulating communications and bringing about \ncompetition be printed in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the document was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n                    Civil Action No. 82-0192 (HHG)]\n\nUnited States of America, plaintiff, v. Western Electric Company, Inc., \n     et al., and American Telephone & Telegraph Company, defendants\n\n\n    memorandum of the united states in support of its motion for a \n modification of the decree to permit a limited trial of interexchange \n                          service by ameritech\n\n       Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant Attorney General.\n       Willard K. Tom, Counselor to the Assistant Attorney \n     General.\n       David S. Turetsky, Senior Counsel to the Assistant Attorney \n     General.\n       Jerry S. Fowler, Jr., Special Counsel to the Assistant \n     Attorney General.\n       [[Page S5967]] Donald J. Russell, Chief, Telecommunications \n     Task Force.\n       The United States has moved for a modification of the \n     Decree in this case to permit a limited trial of \n     interexchange service by Ameritech. As explained in the \n     Preliminary Memorandum filed with that motion, the trial \n     would begin only when Ameritech faces actual local exchange \n     competition and there are substantial opportunities for more \n     such competition; would be limited to certain geographic \n     areas within the states of Illinois and Michigan; and could \n     be terminated if Ameritech violates the order governing the \n     trial or if it can no longer establish the absence of any \n     substantial possibility that continuation of the trial would \n     impede competition. The United States, Ameritech, and AT \n     have stipulated that the proposed order filed with the motion \n     is in the public interest and have consented to its entry \n     under Section VII of the Decree.\n       The Preliminary Memorandum outlined briefly the terms and \n     conditions of the proposal. This Memorandum provides a more \n     detailed explanation of the purpose, history, and structure \n     of the proposed modification and the reasons why it should be \n     approved.\n\n\n     i. purpose and general structure of the proposed modification\n\n       The proposed modification is both more limited and more \n     profound than most requests for removal or modification of \n     the Decree's line of business restrictions that have \n     previously come before the Department of Justice and the \n     Court: more limited because it proposes only a circumscribed \n     trial of an otherwise prohibited service, not a permanent \n     lifting of the restriction for some category of service; more \n     profound because it would take affirmative steps toward \n     understanding and achieving the conditions that might render \n     unnecessary one of the most fundamental and important \n     restrictions of the Decree.\n       The proposal contemplates a three-stage process. First, the \n     motion and proposed order present to the Court the rules \n     under which the proposed trial would be conducted, and seek a \n     determination that they are in the public interest. Second, \n     before any interexchange service could actually begin, \n     Ameritech would have to take certain steps to open local \n     exchange service to competition, and the Department of \n     Justice would have to determine that competitive conditions \n     in the marketplace, in conjunction with the other safeguards \n     in the order, ensure that there is no substantial possibility \n     that commencement of the experiment could impede competition \n     in interexchange service. (Proposed Order, para.para.9-11.) \n     Third, after interexchange service begins, Ameritech would be \n     subject to certain post-entry safeguards, including all \n     existing equal access requirements, and the Department would \n     supervise the trial and could terminate it if conditions \n     required. (Proposed Order, para.para.15-17.) The Court would \n     retain discretion to take any necessary actions at any point, \n     including review of any determinations made by the \n     Department. (Proposed Order, para.51.)\n       This three-stage process recognizes that the transition to \n     competition in local exchange services will be complex. No \n     set of conditions for promoting such competition could hope \n     to address in advance the dozens of complicated \n     implementation issues that will have to be resolved before \n     meaningful competition is a practical reality, rather than \n     merely a theoretical possibility. As local competition \n     develops, and as industry and regulators gain experience with \n     ensuring the competitiveness of markets that depend on access \n     to local exchange services when the principal local exchange \n     carrier is a participant in those markets, it may be possible \n     to relax some of the post-entry restrictions, and the \n     proposed order makes provision for such modification. \n     (Proposed Order, para.17.)\n       The process that the proposed modification would establish \n     will help the Department, the Court, the telecommunications \n     industry, and the public to gain practical experience and \n     develop real marketplace facts about (1) the extent to which \n     telecommunications markets can become fully competitive so \n     that Decree restrictions might become unnecessary and (2) \n     short of such fully competitive conditions, what combination \n     of competition and safeguards might be sufficient to enable \n     the Regional Bell Operating Companies (``RBOCs'') to enter \n     the market for interexchange services without harming \n     competition in that market--all in a setting that does not \n     threaten substantial harm to competition in the interexchange \n     market. Equally important, the Department believes that the \n     same process will itself hasten the development of \n     competition for local exchange services. It will encourage \n     the states that are working to open up local exchange \n     services to competition. And it will establish a mechanism to \n     identify, understand, and address the many implementation \n     issues that will arise in the transition to competition in \n     local exchange markets.\n\n\n                    ii. development of the proposal\n\n             A. Technological and competitive developments\n\n       Technological changes in recent years have raised the \n     possibility that the scope of the natural monopoly in local \n     telephone service may be subject to erosion.\\1\\ For example, \n     in many densely populated urban areas, Competitive Access \n     Providers (``CAPs'') have laid their own fiber optic networks \n     to serve large business customers. At present, those fiber \n     networks are principally used to provide exchange access, \n     either by supplying a direct link from the customer's \n     premises to the point of presence (``POP'') of the \n     interexchange carrier (``IXC''), or by supplying only the \n     transport from the central office or tandem switch of the \n     local exchange carrier (``LEC'') to the IXC's POP. Those same \n     fiber networks, under the right circumstances, might be able \n     to be used to provide ``dialtone''--i.e., local exchange \n     service. Indeed, two CAPs--MFS and Teleport--have already \n     obtained certificates from the Illinois Commerce Commission \n     to operate as local exchange carriers in Chicago, and another \n     CAP, U.S. Signal (formerly known as City Signal), has \n     obtained such authority to serve Grand Rapids.\\2\\ Similarly, \n     as cable television systems make greater use of fiber optics, \n     those systems may also be able to provide both dialtone and \n     access.\\3\\ Although competition from CAPs has just begun to \n     develop (and competition from cable companies remains largely \n     a theoretical possibility), these technological developments \n     raise important questions about the possible future extent of \n     such competition.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n                    B. Ameritech's original proposal\n\n       Based in part on these technological changes, Ameritech \n     filed with the Department and circulated for public comment a \n     waiver request under Section VIII(C) of the Decree, seeking \n     complete removal of the interexchange prohibition, or in the \n     alternative, a waiver of the prohibition to conduct statewide \n     trials of interexchange service in one or more states. It \n     premised that request partly on the notion that the \n     technological changes described above, plus developments in \n     Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') regulatory tools \n     and policies, were enough to constrain any possible \n     anticompetitive conduct.\\4\\ At the heart of its request, \n     however, was what it called its ``Customers First Plan''--its \n     proposal that it would take certain steps and seek certain \n     state regulatory changes that would open up the local \n     exchange to competition.\n       To understand the significance of the steps outlined in the \n     Customers First Plan, it helps to consider some of the \n     principal barriers facing potential entrants into local \n     exchange service. First, there are substantial legal barriers \n     to entry in most markets. Until quite recently, the \n     underlying assumption of telecommunications regulation was \n     that local exchange service is a ``natural monopoly'' that \n     should be provided by one entity, subject to government \n     regulation. Thus, states strictly prohibited entry into local \n     telephone service by competitors, often granting monopoly \n     franchises to a single company in each market.\\5\\ Even where \n     states have taken steps to end prohibitions on entry by \n     competitors, potential entrants have sometimes had difficulty \n     obtaining required certification from state regulators.\n       Second, even as legal and regulatory barriers come down, a \n     substantial barrier remains if entrants must replicate the \n     entire network of the LEC in order to provide local exchange \n     service. See United States v. Western Elec. Co., 673 F. Supp. \n     525, 544-45 (D.D.C. 1987) (``The conditions that caused these \n     monopolies to emerge in the first place . . . preclude any \n     thought of a duplication of the local networks.''), aff'd in \n     relevant part, F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. \n     911 (1990).\n       Third, a fundamental characteristic of telephone markets--\n     the existence of network externalities\\6\\--requires that any \n     entrant be able to offer its customers the ability to make \n     calls to and receive calls from the incumbent's customers. \n     Because a large portion of the value of telephone service for \n     a particular user depends on that user's ability to contact \n     other users, the incumbent's ubiquity is an insurmountable \n     barrier to competition, absent mechanisms for effective \n     interconnection of networks.\n       Ameritech's original Customers First Plan had three basic \n     components. First, Ameritech promised not to oppose \n     certification of local exchange competitors and to waive any \n     exclusive franchise rights it had ``if the interexchange \n     restriction is removed, and if state and federal regulators \n     adopt the other reforms proposed [by Ameritech].'' Ameritech \n     Memorandum in Support of Motions to Remove the Decree's \n     Interexchange Restriction (``Ameritech's Customers First \n     Memo'') at 36 (filed with the Justice Department on Dec. 7, \n     1993) [Appendix, Tab 6]. Second, Ameritech offered what it \n     characterized as ``unprecedented interconnection at the local \n     level,'' id. at 4, which would ``enabl[e] [competitors] \n     customers to originate and terminate calls on the same basis \n     as Ameritech customers, without dialing access codes or \n     waiting for a second dial tone,'' id. at 37. Third, the Plan, \n     Ameritech claimed, ``thoroughly unbundle[d] Ameritech's \n     network for resale.'' Id. at 38. This unbundling was designed \n     to ``enable competitors either to provide for themselves, or \n     to procure from Ameritech, any facilities or functions they \n     require, either one at a time or in any combination,'' thus \n     obviating the need for competitors to replicate Ameritech's \n     entire network. Id.\n       In sum, Ameritech argued, the Customers First Plan ``does \n     away with legal barriers to entry by rejecting `first in the \n     field' regulation, and . . . tears down economic barriers to \n     competition by allowing full interconnection and resale.'' \n     Id. at 40.\n\n            C. Inadequacies of Ameritech's original proposal\n\n       The Customers First Plan as originally proposed represented \n     an innovative and significant step in the right direction, \n     because it acknowledged and sought to remove many of the \n     barriers to local competition. But the \n     [[Page S5968]]  Department recognized, and stressed in \n     subsequent negotiations with Ameritech, that the plan neither \n     resolved all the issues involved in breaking down those \n     barriers, nor contained adequate safeguards against \n     Ameritech's impeding competition in the interexchange market \n     before those barriers were fully identified and eliminated. \n     It thus fell short of Ameritech's claims in numerous \n     respects, of which the following are illustrative.\n       To begin with, the original proposal assumed that local \n     competition would automatically flow from eliminating the \n     legal bar to such competition and from the theoretical \n     availability of interconnection and unbundling. ``No more \n     needs to be done to enable and encourage competition for \n     local exchange service.'' Ameritech's Customers First Memo at \n     40 [Appendix, Tab 6]. The Department concluded otherwise, \n     however. The terms and conditions of interconnection and \n     unbundling are critical. For example, Ameritech argued that \n     its unbundling proposal obviated the need for competitors to \n     replicate the ``loop'' that connects the subscriber's \n     premises to Ameritech's central offices. With unbundling, \n     such competitors could connect Ameritech loops to their own \n     ``ports'' (i.e., switches and other non-loop elements of \n     local exchange service) by running trunks from their central \n     offices to Ameritech's central offices. But if loops are \n     priced too high in relation to the retail price of the \n     bundled local exchange service, it will be uneconomic for \n     even the most efficient competitor to connect Ameritech loops \n     to the competitor's ports in order to offer service in \n     competition with Ameritech. One therefore cannot simply \n     assume that competition will occur; the Department must \n     instead apply its traditional expertise, evaluating the \n     competitive state of markets in light of actual market \n     conditions and experience.\n       Similarly, Ameritech argued that the network externality \n     problem would be solved if Ameritech agreed to interconnect \n     with other carriers, to terminate traffic originating from a \n     competing carrier and destined for a customer on Ameritech's \n     network, and to send traffic to other carriers when Ameritech \n     subscribers wished to call competitors' subscribers. But the \n     Department recognized that if Ameritech's prices to terminate \n     calls from subscribers of competing recognized that if \n     Ameritech's prices to terminate calls from subscribers of \n     competing networks to called parties on Ameritech's network \n     are unreasonably high, competition could be seriously \n     hindered. Indeed, in a decision rendered just last month, the \n     Illinois Commerce Commission found that:\n       ``. . . Illinois Bell's proposal to charge new LECs \n     tariffed switched access rates to complete local traffic on \n     its network would result in a situation in which wholesale \n     compensation rates would be above retail market rates for a \n     wide variety of calls. In other words, carriers would pay \n     more in terminating compensation to Illinois Bell than it \n     currently receives in revenues from its local usage \n     customers. . . . [S]everal witnessed independently \n     demonstrated that in most cases Illinois Bell would charge a \n     new LEC more in access charges than it would charge its own \n     local residential or business customer for the entire usage \n     service, making it impossible for a new LEC to establish a \n     competitive price. . . .''\\7\\\n       Implementation issues of this kind are inevitable, and no \n     one knows for certain whether, or how soon, entry into the \n     local market will occur on a significant scale. Every \n     scenario for the emergency of competition assumes continuing \n     dependence upon Ameritech, at least for interconnection and \n     in many cases for loops and perhaps other network elements as \n     well. This continuing dependence means that competition will \n     involve complex business relationships and numerous pricing \n     and technical issues, any one of which can make competition \n     infeasible. The Department therefore concluded that \n     Ameritech's original proposal that it be granted \n     interexchange authority simultaneous with the formal lifting \n     of legal entry barriers and adoption of regulatory reforms \n     permitting unbundling and interconnection was unrealistic. \n     That proposal offered no assurance that consumers would \n     actually have alternatives available to them upon the \n     adoption of such reforms, or that competitors would be able \n     to enter sufficiently quickly or pervasively to prevent \n     anticompetitive conduct by Ameritech. The potential harm to \n     competition was particularly great in light of Ameritech's \n     own argument that the ability to offer a full range of ``one-\n     stop shopping'' services confers a great competitive \n     advantage. If true, giving Ameritech such ability at a time \n     when competitors cannot realistically offer local exchange \n     services would tend to extend Ameritech's monopoly from local \n     exchange services to the interexchange market. It is thus \n     critical that actual marketplace conditions be examined to \n     test the true economic feasibility of local competition \n     before Ameritech is allowed to offer interexchange services.\n       A second major flaw of the original proposal was its \n     failure to address the issue of number portability. Customers \n     are reluctant to switch to competing providers if it entails \n     the inconvenience of losing their existing telephone numbers. \n     For example, a Gallup poll of residential and business \n     customers in 1994 found that 40-50% of residential customers \n     and 70-80% of business customers who otherwise would consider \n     switching local telephone\n      service providers if alternatives existed were unlikely to \n     consider such a switch if they had to change telephone \n     numbers in order to do so.\\8\\ The Department therefore \n     concluded that number portability was an important issue \n     that needed to be addressed if local competition were to \n     play the role envisioned by Ameritech's plan.\n       Third, the original Customers First Plan did not address \n     competitors' access to poles, conduits, and rights of way. \n     Entrants who wish to lay wire networks face formidable \n     obstacles in obtaining rights of way, problems that the \n     incumbents historically have avoided through use of public \n     condemnation powers and that new entrants might be able to \n     avoid by obtaining access to existing poles and conduits. \n     Discussions between the Department and Ameritech led \n     Ameritech to agree to make access available to the extent \n     such access was in Ameritech's control, so as to provide the \n     best possible opportunity for the Ameritech trial to succeed.\n       Fourth, the original Customers First Plan gave Ameritech \n     excessive latitude to market its interexchange service \n     through its local exchange operations--through which the \n     overwhelming majority of existing customers get their local \n     phone service and which is usually the first place that new \n     customers call when they need to get phone service. The \n     Department concluded that this latitude would have provided \n     Ameritech's interexchange business a tremendous advantage \n     over other interexchange carriers, attributable only to its \n     position as the monopoly provider of local exchange service.\n       Fifth, although the original proposal would have prohibited \n     Ameritech from using the Customer Proprietary Network \n     Information (``CPNT'') gained in the course of providing \n     access to competing interexchange carriers, it would have \n     allowed Ameritech to use CPNI gained in providing local \n     exchange and intraLATA toll service in marketing its own \n     interexchange service. The Department concluded that this \n     would give Ameritech a significant advantage based on its \n     current position as the monopoly provider of local exchange \n     service.\n       Sixth, the original proposal did not require that Ameritech \n     provide interexchange services through a subsidiary separate \n     from its local operations. Although separate subsidiary \n     requirements are imperfect instruments, the Department \n     believes they will nonetheless be useful, both to regulators \n     trying to ensure that Ameritech does not cross-subsidize or \n     discriminate, and to the Department in supervising the trial \n     and evaluating its results.\n       Seventh, Ameritech's original plan included departures from \n     equal access. For example, it would have allowed Ameritech to \n     put interexchange routing functions in its local switch for \n     its own interexchange traffic but not for that of competing \n     IXCs. The Department concluded that, in the absence of a \n     truly competitive marketplace, this would make it virtually \n     impossible to prevent cross-subsidization and discrimination.\n\n                  D. Revision of Ameritech's proposal\n\n       The proposed modification presented to this Court differs \n     substantially from Ameritech's original proposal, suffers \n     from none of the deficiencies identified in that proposal, \n     and offers far more procompetitive potential and far fewer \n     anticompetitive risks than that proposal. It is the product \n     of thousands of hours of work over the past year by the \n     Department as well as by Ameritech, state regulators, \n     potential competitive local exchange carriers, long distance \n     carriers, consumer groups, and others who filed several \n     rounds of public comment on several versions of the proposal \n     and engaged in intensive discussions with the Department. The \n     Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust participated \n     directly in many of these discussions and in the crafting of \n     language for the proposed order, reflecting her strong \n     personal commitment to the purpose of the 1982 Decree and to \n     competition in telecommunications markets. thus, although \n     Ameritech's original proposal shares with the current \n     proposal the important concept of taking steps to open the \n     local exchange to competition as a predicate for removing the \n     interexchange line of business restriction, the two proposals \n     are otherwise far different. The current proposal is in every \n     sense a joint product of the Department of Justice, \n     Ameritech, and all of the parties that filed comments or \n     participated in these discussions. The principles embodied in \n     the current proposal have the support of AT, a decree party \n     and major competitor in the interexchange market; Sprint, \n     also a major interexchange competitor; CompTel, a trade \n     association representing more than 150 competitive \n     interexchange carriers and their suppliers; America's \n     Carriers Telecommunication Association (``ACTA''), a trade \n     association of smaller interexchange carriers; MFS \n     Communications, Time-Warner Communications, and Electric \n     Lighwave, Inc., three providers of competing local exchange \n     service in various parts of the country; the Association for \n     Local Telecommunications Services, a trade association of \n     competing providers of local exchange services; and the \n     Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, two major \n     consumer groups.\n    iii. detailed explanation of the competition-based criteria and \n                safeguards in the proposed modification\n\n       At the heart of the proposed order is the premise that \n     various steps are being taken by Ameritech and the state \n     regulatory commissions in Illinois and Michigan, and that \n     these steps will likely lead to competitive \n     [[Page S5969]]  conditions that make it both safe and \n     desirable to allow Ameritech, on a trial basis, to offer \n     interexchange services in certain portions of those states \n     (the ``Trial Territory'').\\9\\ Because those competitive \n     conditions have not yet been achieved, the proposed order \n     contemplates a multi-stage procedure, under which the actual \n     trial of such services will not begin until Ameritech \n     presents facts from which the Department can determine that \n     such competitive conditions do, in fact, exist. The process \n     by which that determination is to be made is set forth in \n     paragraphs 9-11 of the proposed order. That process has two \n     parts. First, Ameritech begins the process by certifying that \n     certain required steps have, in fact, been taken to open \n     local exchange service to competition, and by filing a \n     compliance plan dealing with equal access, separate \n     subsidiary provisions, and other post-entry safeguards. The \n     Department will then investigate, take any necessary \n     discovery, and make a determination, reviewable by the Court, \n     as to whether there is sufficient competition and other \n     sufficient assurances against harm to the interexchange \n     market that the trial may safely begin.\n       The proposed order also contains a number of post-entry \n     safeguards and gives the Department the responsibility of \n     supervising the course of the trial. If Ameritech violates \n     the order or otherwise engages in anticompetitive conduct, \n     the Department can require it to cease such conduct, ask the \n     Court to impose civil fines, or terminate the trial.\n       The required steps to foster local competition, the \n     standard for the Department to determine that the \n     interexchange trial should begin, the post-entry safeguards, \n     and the Department's supervisory responsibilities are \n     described below.\n\n         A. Steps to foster the emergence of local competition\n\n       Paragraph 9 of the proposed order lists a number of \n     developments with respect to local exchange competition that \n     must occur before Ameritech can apply for authority to begin \n     interexchange services. By design, the order does not specify \n     in every detail the precise terms and conditions on which \n     these developments must take place--matters that are in the \n     purview of the state regulators, and with which the \n     regulators in the two trial states are already grappling in \n     their efforts to foster competition. There are many issues \n     that remain to be resolved, and it is for the states and the \n     market participants, not the Department, to resolve them. On \n     the other hand, the way in which those issues are resolved \n     may have an extremely significant effect on competitive \n     conditions, as may a variety of other technical and economic \n     factors, some of which may be beyond the control of the \n     regulators. The Department's traditional area of expertise, \n     of course, is in evaluating the competitive structure and \n     behavior of markets. Under the proposed order, therefore, the \n     state regulators and the Department each discharge their \n     traditional types of responsibilities: the states are already \n     in the process of determining the terms and conditions under \n     which the steps set forth in paragraph 9 will take place, and \n     the Department, under paragraph 11 of the proposed order, \n     will concern itself with the resulting competitive \n     circumstances, and with whether those circumstances and other \n     safeguards are sufficient to ensure that a trial of Ameritech \n     interchange entry will not harm interexchange competition.\n       The specific steps required by paragraph 9 of the proposed \n     order are as follows.\n     I. Unbundling of loops and ports\n       As discussed in Section II.B, unbundling of loops and ports \n     is important to local competition because it obviates the \n     need to replicate the LEC's entire network of distribution \n     facilities. Outside of dense downtown areas, a portion of \n     that network--the loop connecting the customer premises to \n     the main distribution frame in the central office--may well \n     exhibit natural monopoly (or at best, duopoly) \n     characteristics for some time to come. Unbundling is intended \n     to address the natural monopoly problem, but whether it does \n     so successfully or not depends heavily on the pricing of the \n     unbundled loops and on other terms and conditions such as the \n     speed and reliability of provisioning and repair. (See \n     Section II.C.) The proposed order recognizes this dependence \n     and deals with it through a collaboration between the \n     Department and the appropriate state regulatory authorities, \n     whereby each entity acts within its sphere of expertise. \n     Thus, the state regulatory authorities will regulate the \n     pricing of loops and ports.\\10\\ For Ameritech to be \n     authorized to begin interexchange service, however, the \n     Department will have to investigate and determine, among \n     other things, that\n       ``regulatory developments (including * * * the terms and \n     conditions thereof) and market conditions offer substantial \n     opportunities for additional local exchange competition. * * \n     *''\n     (Proposed Order, para. 11(b)(ii).) Because the proposed order \n     bases entry into interexchange service on an assessment of \n     marketplace facts about competitive conditions at the time of \n     decision, it is unnecessary to resolve the pricing issue--or \n     most of the other myriad and perhaps unforeseeable \n     implementation issues--in advance.\\11\\\n     2. IntraLATA toll dialing parity\n       The Court recognized, at the time of the Decree, the \n     importance of dialing parity to a competitive \n     telecommunications marketplace. See United States v. Western \n     Electric Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 197 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd sub \n     nom, Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). The \n     proposed order requires that, before it applies to begin the \n     interexchange trial, Ameritech must\n       ``I have made the necessary technical, operational, \n     administrative and other changes to implement dialing parity \n     for intraLATA toll telecommunications no later than 21 days \n     prior to the effective date of Ameritech's authority . . . on \n     terms approved by the appropriate state regulatory \n     authority.''\n\n     (Proposed Order, para.9(b).) Thus, to begin the application \n     process, Ameritech must make the necessary changes to ensure \n     that dialing parity can be implemented prior to Ameritech's \n     interexchange authority. Before the Department can approve \n     commencement on the trial, it must ensure that Ameritech has \n     taken the further step of having installed and tested the \n     capability for providing such parity. (Proposed Order, \n     para.11(d).) The Department can thus ensure that Ameritech \n     annually implements dialing parity no later than the time it \n     begins interexchange service.\\12\\\n     3. Resale of local exchange service\n       Another prerequisite before Ameritech can file its \n     application with the Department is that steps have been taken \n     to allow non-facilities-based (i.e., resale) competition for \n     all classes of service, including residential service. \n     (Proposed Order, para.9(c).)\n       Resale competition is not a replacement for facilities-\n     based competition. Competition from exchange carriers that \n     supply their own loops (e.g., cable systems) can help thwart \n     discrimination in the pricing, provisioning, and maintenance \n     of loop facilities, so long as adequate provisions are made \n     to deal with the advantages that flow to the dominant carrier \n     because of network externalities (i.e., the need to terminate \n     calls on the dominant carrier's system, number portability, \n     access to signalling resources and database information, \n     etc.). Competition from exchange carriers that supply their \n     own switching facilities but use Ameritech loops (e.g., CAPs \n     connecting their switches to Ameritech loops to extend the \n     geographic area they can serve) are dependent upon the \n     appropriate pricing, provisioning, and maintenance of loop \n     facilities. If those conditions are right, however, they can \n     prevent discrimination in the provision of network features \n     and functionality, excessive charges for exchange access, and \n     so on. Pure resale competition, by itself, does none of these \n     things. It brings competition only to the marketing of local \n     exchange services, and it requires extensive regulations to \n     ensure that the prices, terms, and conditions under which \n     Ameritech offers the underlying service make resale \n     meaningful available.\n       Nonetheless, resale competition is important for two \n     reasons. First Ameritech will be able to offer interexchange \n     services very quickly and easily once it has the authority to \n     do so, by reselling such services just as hundreds of other \n     companies resell interexchange services. The availability of \n     commercially feasible resale opportunities is one way to \n     ensure that interexchange carriers that are not in a position \n     to enter local exchange service quickly and easily on a \n     facilities basis will have opportunities similar to \n     Ameritech's to offer a full range of services.\n       Second, the availability of resale will tend to reduce the \n     barriers to facilities-based entry, because a company that \n     already has a subscriber base as a reseller will be able to \n     make investments in switches and other facilities with less \n     risk. Just as unbundling of loops and ports makes it possible \n     for competing exchange carriers to offer services outside the \n     dense downtown areas where they can justify installing their \n     own loops, so full resale of the entire local service (loops \n     and ports) makes it possible to offer services before there \n     is enough traffic to justify investment in a switch (or in \n     trunks to connect more distant Ameritech central offices to \n     an existing switch). Once a subscriber base is built, more \n     investment may be justified. Such reductions in barriers to \n     entry will enhance the prospects of the ultimate success of \n     the trial.\n       The requirement that there be adequate resale opportunities \n     is thus directly tied to the requirement of paragraph 11 that \n     competitive circumstances and the safeguards and supervisory \n     provisions of the order ensure the absence of any substantial \n     possibility that Ameritech could use its position in the \n     local exchange market to harm competition in the \n     interexchange market. The important point is that the ability \n     of the interexchange market to function competitively not be \n     harmed.\n       As with the other provisions already discussed, it is left \n     to the states whether non-facilities-based competition should \n     be achieved by directly reselling Ameritech bundled services, \n     or by renting Ameritech loops and Ameritech ports on their \n     separate pricing schedules and selling the combined package \n     as a service, or both.\n     4. Pole attachments and conduit space\n       A fourth prerequisite is that Ameritech have implemented \n     reasonable and nondiscriminatory arrangements for sharing of \n     pole attachments and conduit space, and for competitors to \n     secure access to entrance facilities, risers, and telephone \n     closets, to the extent such arrangements are under the \n     control of Ameritech. Inability to secure access \n     [[Page S5970]]  to poles, conduits, entrance facilities, and \n     so forth could be a significant barrier to a facilities-based \n     competitor seeking to install its own loops. To the extent \n     that this potential barrier is under Ameritech's control, \n     Ameritech promises, by its consent to the proposed order, to \n     eliminate it, thereby encouraging the competition that could \n     serve as a predicate for Ameritech's entry into interexchange \n     service. In many cases, of course, such barriers may not be \n     in Ameritech's control. But whether they are or not, the \n     ultimate question remains that set forth in paragraph 11: to \n     what extent do competition, the potential for more \n     competition, and the other provisions of the order constrain \n     Ameritech's exercise of market power to harm competition in \n     the interexchange market? (See Section III.B.)\n     5. Interconnection\n       Effective interconnection arrangements are among the most \n     critical issues for facilities-based competitors. As \n     explained above (Section II.B), competitors must be able to \n     offer their customers the ability to make calls to and \n     receive calls from anybody else who owns a phone--most \n     notably Ameritech's customers. Without such interconnection, \n     the competitor's service essentially would be worthless. This \n     basic need for interconnection gives rise to a host of \n     complex issues, the resolution of which has important \n     ramifications for competition. For example, arrangements must \n     be made for networks to compensate each other for terminating \n     calls that originate in another network. Unless properly \n     structured, the reciprocal compensation arrangements can \n     raise significant barriers to entry by potential local \n     competitors.\n       Likeswise, the interconnection arrangements must be on \n     terms that permit local dialing parity, so that customers of \n     Ameritech's competitors can place local calls without \n     suffering any inconvenience--such as dialing extra digits--\n     that is not imposed on Ameritech customers. Local competitors \n     must also have adequate access to various services necessary \n     to the provision of local exchange service, such as unbundled \n     signalling and 611, 911, E911, call completion, and TRS relay \n     services, as well as data necessary to provide 411 (directory \n     assistance) service.\n       The proposed order does not attempt to dictate the precise \n     resolution of each of these issues. Some of these issues \n     might be resolved among the carriers without intervention by \n     state regulators. If the terms are acceptable to the \n     competitive exchange carriers, the arrangements will satisfy \n     paragraph 9(e).\\13\\ If the carriers cannot agree, regulatory \n     approval will satisfy paragraph 9(e), because it would not \n     further the public interest in competition to give each \n     competitor a veto power over Ameritech's ability to move \n     forward with a trial.\\14\\ In either case, the ultimate \n     question will be the competitive effects of the arrangements, \n     which will necessarily be considered in connection with the \n     assessment of competitive conditions required by paragraph 11 \n     of the proposed order.\n     6. Number portability\n       As discussed above in Section II.C, an important element in \n     local exchange competition is service provider number \n     portability--the ability of a subscriber to retain his \n     telephone number when changing carriers. The proposed order \n     distinguishes between two ways of achieving service provider \n     number portability: true number portability and interim \n     number portability. True number portability allows calls to \n     be delivered directly to the subscriber's new exchange \n     carrier without having to route traffic through the old \n     exchange carrier and retains the full range of functionality \n     (e.g., delivery of information necessary to provide caller ID \n     functions) that would have been available to the subscriber \n     in the absence of a change in service provider. Such true \n     number portability is likely to involve some form of database \n     look-up: for example, an IXC delivering a call into the \n     Chicago area would use the signalling network to consult a \n     database, which would supply to the service provider the \n     information necessary to deliver the call to the correct \n     exchange carrier.\n       In the absence of true number portability, a variety of \n     means exist to provide number portability on an interim \n     basis. An example is remote call-forwarding. A subscriber \n     changing from Ameritech to a new exchange carrier would \n     receive a new telephone number, the first three digits (``NXX \n     code'') of which would be an NXX code assigned to the \n     subscriber's new carrier. If a caller dialed the subscriber's \n     old telephone number, the call would be routed to Ameritech's \n     switch, since the old number would contain an NXX code \n     assigned to Ameritech. Ameritech's switch would be programmed \n     to complete the call by use of an additional circuit from its \n     switch to the next exchange carrier's switch. Such interim\n      forms of number portability may suffer certain drawbacks, \n     e.g., the loss of data necessary to provide certain \n     functions, such as caller ID; transmission delays as a \n     result of the additional switching that may impair \n     suitability for data transmission; and inability of the \n     new exchange carrier to collect the access charge for \n     terminating an interexchange or intraLATA toll call.\\15\\\n       The proposed order requires Ameritech to implement true \n     number portability in the Trial Territory, except that if it \n     is unable to do so as of the date 120 days before the \n     anticipated implementation of intraLATA dialing parity, it \n     may rely on interim number portability if it explains \n     satisfactorily why it cannot implement true number \n     portability as of that date and sets forth a plan acceptable \n     to the Department for achieving true number portability.\n       Achievement of true number potability is not totally in the \n     control of Ameritech. It will require cooperation from \n     vendors of hardware and software, such as AT, as well as \n     from other industry participants, such as IXCs, who will be \n     delivering traffic destined for ported numbers. Ameritech has \n     already issued a Request for Proposal for the technology and \n     administrative services necessary to implement true number \n     portability. The Illinois Commerce Commission has ordered an \n     industry task force to be created, under the supervision of \n     the Commission staff, to deal with the issue of number \n     portability. ICC Order, supra note 7, at 110 [Appendix, Tab \n     7]. This task force will hold workshops, at which industry \n     participants can react to that RFP, propose alternative \n     specifications, and attempt to arrive at a workable solution. \n     The first of those workshops was held on April 21, 1995.\n       As with many of the other steps in paragraph 9, the actual \n     terms and conditions under which either true or interim \n     number portability is offered are likely to have a major \n     impact on whether there are substantial opportunities for \n     other exchange carriers to compete. The proposed order \n     requires that arrangements be made for allocating the costs \n     of number portability that do not place an unreasonable \n     burden upon competing exchange carriers, leaving to \n     Ameritech, industry participants, and state regulators the \n     task of working out the precise terms of such arrangements in \n     the first instance.\n       Separate from service provider number portability is the \n     issue of location portability--the ability to retain the same \n     telephone number at a different location within a geographic \n     area. It is not particularly significant for competition that \n     location portability be available. If it is available, \n     however, competition could be adversely affected if \n     Ameritech's control over monopoly facilities allows it to \n     offer such a feature while preventing its competitors from \n     doing the same. The proposed order thus requires that, to the \n     extent Ameritech is offering location portability to its own \n     customers, and to the extent it is technically and \n     practicably feasible, Ameritech make available to other \n     exchange carriers, on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, \n     the capability to offer such portability.\n       Nondiscrimination in this context would not mean that \n     exchange carriers offering switching services in competition \n     with Ameritech would necessarily be afforded access to \n     features in Ameritech's switch. To the extent that switching \n     facilities are competitive, and location portability is a \n     service offered through such facilities, competition should \n     encourage all competitors to differentiate their services by \n     offering new and better features. Nondiscrimination would \n     mean, however, that Ameritech could not hinder competitors \n     offering such services through discrimination in the terms in \n     which they connected to Ameritech's network or through other \n     means. For example, if location portability is achieved \n     through wiring changes at the central office rather than \n     through software features in the switch, an exchange carrier \n     competing with Ameritech by connecting its own switches to \n     Ameritech loops would be placed at a significant disadvantage \n     if Ameritech denied equal access to such wiring changes. \n     Similarly, it would likely be discriminatory for Ameritech to \n     refuse to offer to switchless resellers, (i.e., those using \n     both Ameritech loops and Ameritech ports, including switching \n     services) the same location portability features it offers to \n     its own subscribers; since Ameritech facilities are handling \n     the entire call, there is no apparent reason why the same \n     features could not be made available.\n     7. Number assignment\n       Telephone numbers are the most fundamental means of \n     interface between end users and the telephone network, as \n     well as between one network and another. A competitive local \n     telephone network must have fair and equal access to number \n     resources as an essential element of developing \n     telecommunications services and competing for customers. To \n     ensure the competitively neutral administration of number \n     resources, the proposed order requires Ameritech to have made \n     reasonable efforts to transfer any duties it has in \n     administering those resources to a neutral third party. \n     (Proposed Order, para.9(h).) If its efforts to transfer its \n     duties are not successful by the time Ameritech applies for \n     authorization to provide interexchange service, it must \n     explain in writing why they have not been successful and what \n     further steps it plans to take, and must implement a \n     nondiscriminatory procedure for assigning numbers. The \n     efficacy of such arrangements will be considered by the \n     Department in making its determination under paragraph 11.\n     B. Actual marketplace facts concerning the emergence of local \n                              competition\n\n     1. Procedures for department approval\n       Completion of the above steps would not result in immediate \n     commencement of the trial of interexchange service. Instead, \n     at that point Ameritech will apply to begin the trial if it \n     believes competitive circumstances in the local market \n     warrant. Ameritech will report to the Department that it has \n     taken the required steps with respect to unbundling, \n     intraLATA toll dialing parity, \n     [[Page S5971]]  resale of local services, pole attachments \n     and conduit space, interconnection, number portability, and \n     nondiscriminatory number assignment. In addition, Ameritech \n     must file a compliance plan.\\16\\ After Ameritech has filed \n     both the report and compliance plan, the Department will have \n     thirty days to determine whether it needs any additional \n     information from Ameritech. Within sixty days after Ameritech \n     has substantially complied with the Department's request for \n     additional information or 120 days after the filing of both \n     the report and the compliance plan, whichever is later, the \n     Department will determine whether Ameritech may begin the \n     trial. In making that decision, the Department will seek \n     comments from the appropriate state regulatory authorities \n     and interested persons. (Proposed Order, para.11(a).) It may \n     also take any other action reasonably necessary to make its \n     decision, including conducting third-party discovery. (Id., \n     para.para.11(a), 49.)\n     2. Procedures for court review\n       The Court may, in its discretion, review any decision of \n     the Department, both with respect to commencement of the \n     trial and otherwise. (Id., para.51.) If the Department \n     approves commencement of the trial, such approval could not \n     go into effect for at least 30 days (Proposed Order, \n     para.13), thus allowing a period of time during which \n     interested persons could seek a temporary restraining order \n     from the Court. The Court could then establish such schedule \n     and procedures for such review as it deemed appropriate under \n     the circumstances. If the Department does not approve \n     commencement of the trial upon a particular application by \n     Ameritech, Ameritech does not have a right of review within \n     the structure of the proposed order. (Proposed Order, \n     para.51.) It does, however, retain the right to seek Court \n     action independent of the proposed order, under sections VII \n     or VIII(C) of the Decree. (Id.). Ameritech is thus no worse \n     off under the unreviewability provision than it would be in \n     the absence of the proposed order. to avail itself of the \n     benefits of the proposed order, however, it would have to \n     work further toward creating conditions that meet the \n     standard of paragraph 11 rather than involve the Court in \n     reviewing the Department's decision. This provision gives \n     Ameritech a strong incentive to apply to begin the \n     interexchange trial only when the test for doing so is \n     actually met. The judicial system is thus spared the burden \n     of premature applications that could otherwise lead to \n     extensive judicial review, and Ameritech is given a reason to \n     provide information to the Department as quickly as possible, \n     even in advance of its application where appropriate.\n     3. Substantive standard for department approval\n       The substantive standard for commencing the trail of \n     interexchange service is set out in paragraph 11(b) of the \n     proposed order:\n       ``To render an affirmative decision on Ameritech's \n     application, the Department must find that\n       ``(i) actual competition (including facilities-based \n     competition) in local exchange telecommunications exists in \n     the Trial Territory,\n       ``(ii) the conditions specified in paragraph 9 have been \n     substantially satisfied, and that regulatory developments \n     (including but not limited to those developments set forth in \n     Paragraph 9 and the terms and conditions thereof) and market \n     conditions offer substantial opportunities for additional \n     local exchange competition, as evidenced by, among other \n     things, the increasing availability of local exchange \n     telecommunications alternatives for such customers,\n       ``(iii) the conditions described in (i) and (ii) above, \n     together with regulatory protections, the Department's right \n     to terminate Ameritech's interexchange telecommunications \n     authority under Paragraph 16, the transport facilities \n     restrictions of Paragraph 19, the compliance plan, the \n     limited geographic scope described in Exhibit A, and the \n     other provisions of this Order, are sufficient to ensure that \n     there is no substantial possibility that Ameritech could use \n     its position in local exchange telecommunications to impede \n     competition for the provision of interexchange \n     telecommunications to business or residential customers in \n     the Trial Territory.''\n     (Proposed Order, para.11(b) (emphasis added).)\n       Thus, the standard has three parts--actual competition, \n     substantial opportunities for additional competition, and a \n     determination that such competition and competitive \n     opportunities, together with regulation, post-entry \n     safeguards, and the fact that Ameritech's interexchange \n     service would only be on a trial basis, make it safe and \n     desirable to begin the trial. These three parts of the \n     standard are related both to each other and to the ultimate \n     objectives of the trial.\n       For the trial to be an ultimate success, it will have to \n     help prove or disprove one or both of two propositions: (1) \n     the competitive steps outlined above produce enough actual \n     competition and opportunities for additional competition to \n     ensure by themselves that there is no substantial possibility \n     Ameritech could engage in anticompetitive conduct affecting \n     the interexchange market, or (2) some combination of actual \n     competition and opportunities for additional competition, \n     together with regulation and post-entry safeguards, is \n     sufficient to ensure the absence of such possibility.\\17\\\n       Paragraph 11 does not require that either of these \n     propositions be proved before the trial begins; indeed, the \n     purpose of the trial is to test these propositions. At the \n     same time, it is important to ensure that the trial itself \n     does not result in harm to competition in the interexchange \n     market. Many of the same factors--actual competition, \n     opportunities for additional competition, and post-entry \n     safeguards--that would protect competition in the event \n     permanent relief were appropriate will also serve to protect \n     competition during the trial. Since the premise of the trial \n     is that these factors will not be known to be sufficient at \n     the beginning of the trial, however, the proposed order also \n     provides for very close supervision by the Department, \n     including a provision for the Department to terminate the \n     trial if necessary. Before beginning the trial, the \n     Department is to make a determination that all of these \n     factors, including the provision for termination, together \n     will be sufficient to negate any substantial possibility that \n     Ameritech could use market power in the local market to harm \n     competition in the interexchange market.\n       The three parts that make up that judgment are discussed in \n     greater detail below. Because they are so closely related, \n     actual competition and substantial opportunities for \n     potential competition are discussed together.\n  a. Actual Competition and substantial opportunities for additional \n                              competition\n\n       Competitive outcomes can generally be assured if there is a \n     sufficient level of actual competition--multiple competitors \n     actually producing and selling the good or service. \n     Theoretically, some markets can produce competitive outcomes \n     even if they do not contain multiple competitors actually \n     producing and selling the good or service. One situation in \n     which such outcomes may occur is where firms not currently \n     producing or selling the relevant product in the relevant \n     area would start doing so quickly, and without the \n     expenditure of significant sunk costs, in response to a small \n     but significant price increase. If these firms are \n     sufficiently numerous that the incumbent firm cannot maintain \n     prices above the competitive level, then the market will \n     behave competitively. Cf. Department of Justice and Federal \n     Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, Sec. 1.32 \n     (April 2, 1992) [hereinafter ``1992 Merger Guidelines'']. \n     Such a market is said to be ``contestable.''\n       It is hard to think of a market less likely to be \n     ``contestable'' than local exchange service. Sunk costs in \n     this industry are, in a word, gigantic. Perhaps recognizing \n     this, Ameritech's original waiver request was supported by an \n     affidavit and a reply affidavit that spoke not of \n     ``contestability'' but of something Ameritech's expert called \n     ``effective'' or ``as-if'' contestability. Affidavit of David \n     J. Teece, para. 41 (Nov. 29, 1993) (filed with the Department \n     of Justice in support of Ameritech's Original Proposal on \n     Dec. 7, 1993) [Appendix, Tab. 13]; Reply Affidavit of David \n     J. Teece at 3-8 (Apr. 6, 1994) (filed with the Department of \n     Justice on Apr. 12, 1994) [Appendix, Tab. 14]. By this he \n     meant that Ameritech's unbundling of loops and ports would \n     allow competitors to treat those assets as if they were not \n     sunk costs, freely entering and exiting the industry in \n     response to competitive conditions by renting only what they \n     needed at a given moment in time from Ameritech.\n       Such an argument, however, is highly speculative. It \n     assumes that state regulators will get the prices of those \n     loops and ports exactly right, precisely duplicating the \n     prices that would obtain in a competitive market. (See \n     Section II.C.) It further assumes that Ameritech could not \n     discriminate in the provisioning or maintenance of loops or \n     ports or in the terms and conditions of interconnection, and \n     that competitors will not incur substantial sunk costs in \n     other elements of their operation. In short, on the current \n     state of the record, the Department regards the suggestion \n     that unbundling would make local telephone markets behave \n     ``as-if'' they were contestable as both unproven and \n     implausible.\n       A market with only one firm could also behave competitively \n     if longer-term entry (i.e., with sunk costs) into the market \n     is so easy that the incumbent firm could not profitably \n     behave anticompetitively (e.g., maintain a price above \n     competitive levels or--more relevant here--use a monopoly \n     position in that market to adversely affect competition in an \n     adjacent market). For entry to be that easy, it would have to \n     be ``timely, likely, and sufficient in its magnitude, \n     character and scope to deter or counteract the competitive \n     effects of concern.'' 1993 Merger Guidelines, Sec. 3.0. \n     Ameritech argues that unbundling, interconnection, and the \n     other steps it is taking pursuant to state regulatory action \n     and paragraph 9 of the proposed order will make entry that \n     easy.\n       As a practical matter, however, it is impossible to \n     evaluate that argument in the abstract, without the existence \n     of some actual competition to guide the way. Once there are \n     significant actual competitors, one can begin to ask \n     questions such as:\n       How were those competitors able to enter? What \n     certification and other regulatory requirements did they have \n     to meet, and how long did it take? Is there any reason other \n     competitors would not be able to do the same?\n       Is the availability of such competing service expanding? \n     Are competitors encountering significant barriers to such \n     expansion?\n       To what extent are competitors entering by renting loops \n     from Ameritech as opposed \n     [[Page S5972]]  to building their own loop plant, either for \n     the whole of their local exchange business or as a way of \n     extending the reach of their network? To the extent that \n     competitors have to build some of their own facilities, how \n     long does that take, and how many other competitors could do \n     the same?\n       Are competitors able to serve a wide range of customers \n     throughout the Trial Territory, or are they limited to niche \n     markets?\n       To the extent that not all customers have competitive \n     alternatives available to them, could Ameritech discriminate \n     against just those customers that have no alternatives, or \n     would anticompetitive behavior against those customers \n     necessarily cause it to lose so many other customers that \n     Ameritech could not profitably persist in the anticompetitive \n     behavior?\n       The proposed order does not specifically state how much \n     actual competition is necessary to satisfy paragraph 11(b). \n     Nonetheless, the foregoing discussion suggests the implicit \n     level: there must be enough actual competition to provide an \n     empirical basis for answering these kinds of questions, and \n     the answers must indicate that there are substantial \n     additional opportunities for competition and that these \n     opportunities will be sufficient, in combination with the \n     safeguards and supervisory provisions of the order, to deter \n     Ameritech from behaving anticompetitively. To provide such \n     answers requires more than a single competitor serving niche \n     markets but less than the level of actual competition that \n     would suffice in and of itself to justify permanent removal \n     of the interexchange restriction, without the safeguards and \n     supervisory provisions that will accompany the trial \n     (including the right of the Department to terminate the trial \n     and the ability of the Court to review the Department's \n     determinations).\n       The proposed order also emphasizes that there must be \n     facilities-based competition in the Trial Territory. As \n     discussed in Section III.A.3, resale competition is not a \n     perfect substitute for facilities-based competition. \n     Facilities-based competition can discipline a wide range of \n     anticompetitive conduct that would be left untouched by \n     resale. Thus, the Department will look closely at the extent \n     of facilities-based competition in determining whether the \n     standards of paragraph 11 are met.\n\n     b. Determination that the state of the market safeguards, and \n         supervisory provisions make it safe to begin the trial\n\n       In addition to actual competition and ease of entry, the \n     proposed order relies on supervisory provisions and post-\n     entry safeguards, as more fully described in Section III.C. \n     For example, the Department may terminate Ameritech's \n     interexchange authority if it no longer believes that there \n     is no substantial possibility that continuation of the trial \n     would impede competition. (Proposed Order, para.16.) To \n     authorize commencement of the trial, then, the Department \n     must determine that actual competition, substantial \n     opportunities for additional competition, and these other \n     supervisory provisions and safeguards are sufficient to \n     ensure that going forward with the trial will not create any \n     ``substantial possibility that ameritech could use its \n     position in local exchange telecommunications to impede \n     competition for the provision of interexchange \n     telecommunications.'' (Proposed order, para.11(b)(iii).) The \n     assurance against harm to competition must protect both \n     business and residential customers in the Trial Territory. \n     (Id.)\n     4. Other factors the department may consider\n       The proposed order specifically highlights a number of \n     additional factors that the Department may consider in making \n     the determination under paragraph 11 to proceed with the \n     trial.\n\n   a. Certification, licensing, franchising, and similar requirements\n\n       Implicit in the concept that there are substantial \n     opportunities for additional local exchange competition is \n     the premise that certification, licensing, franchising, and \n     similar regulatory and legal requirements are not \n     significantly impeding the development of such competition. \n     State and local regulation serves important public policy \n     objectives, such as protecting consumers from deception and \n     ensuring that carriers have adequate financial backing. In \n     states such as Illinois and Michigan, which have state \n     policies favoring competition and in which there is already a \n     recent history of granting certificates to competitors, it is \n     the Department's expectation that such requirements would be \n     narrowly tailored to achieve such public policy objectives \n     without impeding competition significantly. Nonetheless, this \n     factor is specifically mentioned in the proposed order as an \n     issue for the Department to consider, because state and local \n     government policies can have a major and even decisive impact \n     on whether and how fast competition will develop.\n\n             b. Ordering, provisioning, and repair systems\n\n       There are two different provisions in the proposed order \n     dealing with electronic access to ordering, provisioning, and \n     repair systems. First, if Ameritech wishes to make such \n     systems available to the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary, \n     it must offer such access, on nondiscriminatory terms and \n     rates, to unaffiliated carriers. (Proposed Order, para. 26.) \n     Second, in making its decision under paragraph 11, the \n     Department may take into account the extent to which \n     Ameritech offers unaffiliated carriers access equivalent to \n     that used in Ameritech's local exchange operations (whether \n     or not Ameritech's interexchange subsidiary is given access). \n     (Proposed Order, para. 11(c)(ii).)\n       The requirement in paragraph 26 is a matter of equal \n     access--putting other carriers in a position equal to \n     Ameritech's interexchange subsidiary--and is absolute. The \n     requirement in paragraph 11 is more judgmental. It recognizes \n     that there could be technical reasons why it would not be \n     practicable for Ameritech to provide access to certain \n     systems to anyone outside Ameritech's local exchange \n     operations, including Ameritech's interexchange subsidiary. \n     At the same time, it recognizes that lack of such access \n     could have a considerable impact on the prospects for local \n     competition, and thus specifically provides for the \n     Department to consider the issue and take it into account.\n\n                     C. Supervision and safeguards\n\n       When the interexchange trial begins, there will be actual \n     local exchange competition and substantial opportunities for \n     additional such competition, but no firm assurance that the \n     competitive state of the market will suffice by itself to \n     thwart any anticompetitive conduct that Ameritech might \n     attempt in the interexchange market. Therefore, the proposed \n     order contains supervisory provisions and post-entry \n     safeguards, designed for use during the trial, to supplement \n     such competition and ensure that there is no substantial \n     possibility that Ameritech could use market power in the \n     local market to harm competition in the interexchange market \n     during the trial.\n       As competition develops, many of the post-entry safeguards \n     may become unnecessary to ensure the absence of any such \n     substantial possibility, and the proposed order provides for\n      their removal as appropriate. (Proposed Order, para.17.) The \n     proposed order does not specifically provide for \n     Ameritech's interexchange authority to be made permanent \n     and the Department's supervisory role to be terminated, \n     because Sections VII and VIII(C) of the Decree already \n     establish the appropriate mechanism and standard for \n     permanent relief.\n       The Department is required to conduct a comprehensive \n     review of all aspects of the trial within three years of \n     Ameritech's interexchange authority under the proposed order. \n     (Proposed Order, para.18.)\n       The specific supervisory provisions and safeguards are as \n     follows:\n     1. Terminability of the trial\n       If Ameritech violates the order, or if the Department no \n     longer believes that there is no substantial possibility that \n     continuation of the trial would impede competition, \n     Ameritech's interexchange authority can be terminated \n     (Proposed Order, para.16.), subject to review by the Court \n     (Proposed Order, para.51.). This termination provision \n     ensures that, even if the opportunities for local exchange \n     competition at the start of the trial and other safeguards \n     turn out not to be sufficient to prevent Ameritech from \n     taking actions that harm competition in the interexchange \n     market, any such harm will be short-lived and insubstantial.\n       During the comment process, a number of commenters \n     suggested that it would be difficult for the Department to \n     exercise this authority. In response to these concerns, a \n     provision was included in the proposed order to require \n     Ameritech's compliance plan to supply, prior to approval of \n     its interexchange service, a credible plan for orderly \n     withdrawal from the provision of interexchange \n     telecommunications in the event Ameritech's authority to \n     offer interexchange telecommunications is discontinued. \n     (Proposed Order, para.10(j).) Such a plan might include, for \n     example, a procedure for balloting customers or for reverting \n     them to their previous interexchange carrier. Moreover, the \n     proposed order makes clear that financial hardship to \n     Ameritech resulting from such discontinuance shall not be a \n     ground for opposing such discontinuance. (Proposed Order, \n     para.16.)\n     2. Self-reporting\n       The proposed order requires Ameritech to develop a plan for \n     detecting and reporting violations of the order or of the \n     compliance plan, and to report any such violations and any \n     corrective action taken. (Proposed Order, para.para.10)i), \n     15.)\n     3. Orders to discontinue conduct\n       If the Department determines (a) that Ameritech is \n     violating any of the terms of the order, its compliance plan, \n     or additional conditions imposed on Ameritech in connection \n     with approval of its interexchange service, or (b) any other \n     conduct by Ameritech may impede competition for interexchange \n     telecommunications in the Trial Territory, the Department may \n     require Ameritech to discontinue such violations or other \n     conduct. Ameritech bears the burden of proof in resisting \n     such a requirement. (Proposed Order, para.15.)\n     4. Civil fines\n       In the event of a violation by Ameritech, the proposed \n     order gives the Department the authority to ask the Court to \n     impose civil fines. (Id.)\n     5. Limited geographic scope\n       The proposed trial is limited initially to the portion of \n     the Chicago LATA that is in the state of Illinois and to the \n     Grand Rapids, Michigan, LATA. Focusing on the state of \n     competitive conditions on a LATA-by-LATA basis ensures that \n     the competitive analysis takes into account differences not \n     just in \n     [[Page S5973]]  state regulatory schemes, but also in \n     demographic and other conditions. Chicago was chosen because \n     there is widespread agreement that, of all the\n      areas in the Ameritech service territory, the potential for \n     competition--though still embryonic--is most advanced \n     there. Grand Rapids was chosen because the first competing \n     exchange carrier in Michigan, U.S. Signal (formerly known \n     as City Signal), has been certified to serve a portion of \n     that territory and was the subject of a detailed \n     interconnection order issued by the Michigan Public \n     Service Commission. Thus, it seems appropriate for the \n     Department to focus first on those two areas and to be \n     prepared to act with respect to those areas within the \n     period set forth in paragraph 11(a).\n       The inclusion of these two areas in the Trial Territory \n     does not mean that the trials in those two areas necessarily \n     must proceed simultaneously. Competitive conditions in one of \n     the areas may justify proceeding with an interexchange trial \n     before such conditions have evolved in the other area. \n     Further, explicit provision is made for expansion of the \n     Trial Territory in those two states, and each area in the two \n     states will stand on its own merits, governed by the standard \n     in paragraph 11b).\\18\\ (See Proposed Order, para.17.) As with \n     other determinations under the proposed order, the Court may, \n     in its discretion, review any decision to expand the Trial \n     Territory, (Id., para.51.) If the Department approves \n     expansion, such expansion could not go into effect for at \n     least 30 days (Proposed Order, para.17), thus allowing a \n     period of time during which interested persons could seek a \n     temporary restraining order from the Court. A decision by the \n     Department not to expand the Trial Territory would also be \n     reviewable. (See Proposed Order, para.51.)\n       Most important, the designation of those two areas as \n     comprising the initial Trial Territory, and of those two \n     states as being eligible for expansion of the Trial Territory \n     within the framework of the order, is not meant in any way to \n     discourage the ongoing efforts of the other Ameritech states \n     (Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin)--or similar efforts underway \n     or that may arise in the states in which other RBOCs \n     operate--to bring the benefits of local competition to the \n     consumers in their states, completely independent of any \n     interexchange entry by Ameritech in those states. Local \n     competition promises benefits to consumers separate from any \n     benefits they may get as a result of interexchange \n     competition from Ameritech. Moreover, the development of such \n     competition can only hasten the day when interexchange entry \n     by Ameritech--or other RBOCs--will be appropriately granted \n     under Section VII or VIII(C), wholly apart from the proposed \n     order now before the Court.\n     6. Types of services\n       Paragraph 7 of the proposed order limits Ameritech to \n     providing certain enumerated types of interexchange services \n     that have a clear nexus to the Trial Territory, i.e., \n     services as to which the fact that competition exists in the \n     Trial Territory is relevant even if competition does not \n     exist elsewhere in the country. Thus, for most switched \n     services, as to which the interexchange carrier is selected \n     by the party placing the call, Ameritech could provide \n     interexchange service originating from the Trial Territory. \n     (Proposed Order, para.7(a).) For services such as inbound 800 \n     service, which is ordinarily carried by the interexchange \n     carrier selected by the billed party at the terminating \n     location, Ameritech could provide service terminating at \n     subscribers' locations in the Trial Territory. (Proposed \n     Order, para.7(b).) Ameritech may also provide certain other \n     types of services normally provided by interexchange carriers \n     to their subscribers, such as calling card and private line \n     services, with limitations to ensure an adequate nexus to the \n     Trial Territory. (Proposed Order, para.para.7(c)-(d).) There \n     may also be other types of services that Ameritech may wish \n     to offer in the future in order to stay competitive with the \n     offerings of other IXCs. Because these services may not yet \n     exist, it is difficult to enumerate them, much less to \n     determine in advance whether any potential harm to \n     competition is adequate addressed by the proposed order. \n     Hence, a mechanism is provided to allow Ameritech to provide \n     such services, subject to disapproval by the Department. \n     (Proposed Order, para.7(e).) Under the provision, Ameritech \n     would have to give at least 30 days notice of such services, \n     and the Department, after soliciting comments from interested \n     persons, could disapprove the offering of such services. A \n     relatively short notification and objection period is \n     provided because it is anticipated that this provision will \n     principally be used to respond to competitive offerings in \n     the marketplace; however, a decision not to disapprove the \n     services would be without prejudice to later withdrawal of \n     authority under paragraphs 15 or 16 of the order if \n     necessary.\n     7. Ownership of transport facilities\n       Paragraph 19 of the proposed order provides that Ameritech \n     shall not own any of the transport facilities used to provide \n     interexchange telecommunications. Instead it must contract \n     for such facilities for a term not to exceed five years. This \n     safeguard serves two purposes: to the extent Ameritech has \n     not made substantial investments in facilities in the ground, \n     it makes it easier to terminate the trial; and it reduces \n     Ameritech's incentive to discriminate in favor of those \n     facilities because it makes it harder for Ameritech to \n     capture all of the benefits of such discrimination.\n     8. Separate subsidiary requirements\n       Paragraph 20 of the proposed order provides for the \n     separation of the Ameritech subsidiary providing \n     interexchange services from the Ameritech local exchange \n     operations. The provisions generally track the more stringent \n     approach taken by the Federal Communications Commission in \n     its Computer Inquiry II proceedings and rules and in the \n     requirement of separate subsidiaries for RBOC provision of \n     commercial mobile radio services, rather than more lenient \n     approaches relying on cost accounting instead of structural \n     separation (such as the approach taken by the FCC in its \n     Computer Inquiry III proceeding\\19\\). The more stringent \n     structural separation approach is more appropriate for a \n     trial of interexchange services, at least in the early stages \n     before competition is fully developed and before additional \n     information about the need for separate subsidiary \n     requirements is gained from the trial itself.\\20\\\n     9. Equal access provisions\n       Under the proposed order, the equal access provisions of \n     the Decree would remain in full force; the order would grant \n     Ameritech only a temporary and limited modification of the \n     line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1) of the \n     Decree and would not relieve Ameritech of any other \n     restrictions. (Proposed Order, para.4.) In addition, a number \n     of provisions are added to adapt the equal access concept to \n     a situation in which an Ameritech subsidiary is one of the \n     interexchange carriers interconnecting with the Ameritech \n     local exchange operations. These provisions deal with \n     equality in the type, quality, and pricing of \n     interconnection, exchange access, and local exchange \n     telecommunications (para.para.21, 25); technical information, \n     standards, collocation, and other terms of interconnection \n     (para.para.22-24); availability of service order, \n     maintenance, and other telecommunications support systems \n     (para.26);\\21\\ billing services (para.27); location number \n     portability (para.28); White Pages directory listings \n     (para.29); and customer information (para.para.30-32).\\22\\\n     10. Marketing restrictions\n       The marketing provisions of the order (para.para.33-47) \n     deal with two principal issues: (1) ``equal access''-type \n     obligations preventing Ameritech's local exchange operations \n     from assisting the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary in its \n     marketing efforts, and (2) the circumstances under which \n     Ameritech can make one-stop shopping arrangements (i.e., the \n     ability of customers to get their local and long distance \n     calling from one, full-service carrier) available to business \n     and residential customers, respectively. The ``equal access'' \n     obligations (para.para.34, 36, 38-39, 44) embody the basic \n     principles of existing obligations, with modifications to \n     ensure that those principles will be effectuated when \n     Ameritech competes in the provision of interexchange \n     services. The provisions regarding one-stop shopping \n     (para.para.35, 41-43, 45-47) are intended to avoid giving an \n     inappropriate competitive advantage to, or imposing an unfair \n     handicap on, any carrier. The order would allow Ameritech to \n     offer one-stop shopping to business or residential customers \n     only when at least one other carrier is marketing services on \n     a comparable basis.\\23\\\n       The proposed order does not set out specific conditions \n     under which Ameritech can engage in ``bundle-pricing'' of its \n     interexchange services with local exchange or intraLATA toll \n     services (i.e., pricing whose availability is contingent upon \n     the subscriber's election of Ameritech for both such \n     services). Whether such bundle-pricing is appropriate, and \n     the types of conditions needed to prevent harm to competition \n     in interexchange services, depends on the state of \n     competition. The issue of ``bundle-pricing'' has therefore \n     been made an element of Ameritech's compliance plan (Proposed \n     Order, para.para.10(e)-(f)). Ameritech will tailor its \n     proposal to the competitive circumstances then existing, and \n     the Department will review it in light of those \n     circumstances.\n     11. Compliance plan\n       The proposed order requires Ameritech to file a compliance \n     plan prior to obtaining approval to begin its trial of \n     interexchange services. (Proposed Order, para.10.) The \n     compliance plan reinforces the separate subsidiary, equal \n     access, and marketing provisions of the order by requiring \n     Ameritech to spell out detailed plans for implementation of \n     those requirements. (Proposed Order, para.para.10(a)-(d), \n     (g).) It also provides the mechanism for determining the \n     appropriate market and other conditions for Ameritech's \n     offering of bundled pricing (para.para.10(e)-(f)) and for the \n     Ameritech interexchange subsidiary's ownership, leasing, or \n     control of any of the facilities it uses to provide local \n     exchange telecommunications and exchange access services \n     (para.10(h)). The compliance plan also will include \n     procedures for Ameritech to detect and self-report violations \n     of the order or the compliance plan (para.10(i)) and for \n     Ameritech's withdrawal from interexchange service should it \n     be required to do so (para.10(j)).\n     12. Other conditions\n       Ameritech's entry into interexchange services may also be \n     conditioned on any other terms that may be appropriate to \n     further the purposes of the order. (Proposed Order, \n     para.11(e).)\n[[Page S5974]] IV. The Proposed Modification Should Be Approved Because \n                     It is in the Public Interest.\n\n   A. The public interest standard applies to entry of the proposed \n                              modification\n\n       In reviewing the proposed modification, the Court should \n     apply the ``public interest'' standard. The motion was filed \n     by the United States under section VII of the decree, and \n     Ameritech and AT have joined the United States in \n     stipulating to the proposed order.\n       The Court of Appeals has held that a proposed modification \n     satisfies the public interest test ``so long as the resulting \n     array of rights and obligations is within the zone of \n     settlements consonant with the public interest today.'' \n     United States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1576 \n     (D.C. Cir.) (quoting United States v. Western Electric Co., \n     900 F.2d 283, 307 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 911 \n     (1990)) (emphasis in original), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 487 \n     (1993). The public interest test is ``flexible,'' allowing \n     the government to choose among various decree provisions that \n     could further the public interest in competition. When the \n     government and the party whose decree obligations are at \n     issue agree on a decree modification proposal, as is the case \n     here,\n       ``the court's function is not to determine whether the \n     resulting array of rights and liabilities ``is one that will \n     best serve society,'' but only to confirm that the resulting \n     ``settlement is `within the reaches of the public \n     interest.'''\n     993 F.2d at 1576 (citing and quoting 900 F.2d at 309; United \n     States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. \n     denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981); and United States v. Gillette \n     Co., 406 F.Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975)) (emphasis in \n     original). Therefore, a court is to approve a consensual \n     decree modification under the public interest standard unless \n     ``it has exceptional confidence that adverse antitrust \n     consequences will result--perhaps akin to the confidence that \n     would justify a court in overturning the predictive judgments \n     of an administrative agency.'' 993 F.2d at 1577.\n       The Department welcomes this Court's careful review of the \n     proposed modification under this standard. We are confident \n     that the text of the proposed order, the explanation that we \n     are providing in this Memorandum, and the comments of other \n     interested persons will give the Court ample reason for \n     entering the proposed order.\n         B. The proposed modification is in the public interest\n\n       The proposed modification both avoids harm to competition \n     in the interexchange market and yields affirmative benefits \n     to competition. Accordingly, it is in the public interest and \n     should be approved and entered by this Court.\n     1. The proposed modification is structured to avoid harm to \n         competition in the interexchange market\n       Far from giving the Court ``exceptional confidence that \n     adverse antitrust consequences will result,'' the proposed \n     modification gives the Court ample assurance that no adverse \n     consequences will occur. As this Memorandum has explained, \n     the order we ask the Court to enter would permit only a \n     limited trial of Ameritech provision of interexchange \n     services, and even that trial could not begin until the \n     Department (and the Court if it reviews the Department's \n     determination) is satisfied that local competition exists and \n     will continue to develop in the Trial Territory. In addition, \n     the interexchange services that the modification permits \n     would remain subject to a variety of safeguards, including \n     the power of the Court or the Department to terminate the \n     trial at any time.\n       The proposed order thus ensures that competition in the \n     interexchange market will not be harmed by the modification--\n     a fact underscored by AT's stipulation that the proposed \n     modification is in the public interest and by the support of \n     Sprint, CompTel, and ACTA.\n     2. The trial will provide affirmative benefits to competition\n       Not only is the proposed order structured to prevent any \n     harm to competition, but it also presents a valuable \n     opportunity affirmatively to advance the public interest in \n     competition.\n       First, as a prerequisite to its offering of interexchange \n     service pursuant to this modification, Ameritech must take \n     specific actions to remove barriers to local competition, \n     including those relating to terms of interconnection, \n     unbundling of loops, dialing parity, and number portability. \n     The proposed modification thus complements the efforts of the \n     state regulatory commissions in the Ameritech region to lower \n     such barriers, as reflected in the comments of the staff of \n     the Michigan PSC on an earlier version of the proposal:\n\n       ``[T]he Department of Justice (DOJ) and the court should \n     move forward in a measured fashion to permit more competition \n     in the telecommunications marketplace. That action, \n     however[,] should be such that it recognizes the need to \n     balance the interests of the Regional Bell Operating \n     Companies (RBOC), their local and toll competitors, and \n     residential and business customers in the telecommunications \n     marketplace. That balance can be achieve through an approach \n     which minimizes the potential for anticompetitive actions on \n     the part of the RBOCs. This coupled with the coordination and \n     recognition of appropriate State law and regulatory agency \n     actions to remove barriers to entry to the State or local \n     telecommunications markets should set the stage for a trial \n     waiver of the interLATA restrictions currently in effect.''--\n     Michigan PSC Staff Comments on Draft Dated February 21, 1995 \n     [Appendix, Tab 16].\n       Second, the trail will yield important information about \n     RBOC provision of interexchange services. The Department, the \n     Court, all segments of the telecommunications industry, and \n     the public will be able to observe and analyze the effects of \n     the stipulated conditions, and related regulatory and \n     technological developments, on competition in local and \n     interchange telecommunications markets. We will learn much \n     about whether local competition will develop to such an \n     extent that harm to interchange competition can be avoided, \n     with or without other safeguards. We will also enhance our \n     understanding of the importance of factors such as call set-\n     up and transmission delays resulting from interim forms of \n     number portability, consumer demand for one-stop shopping, \n     the terms and conditions of\n      interconnection, and the pricing of network elements in the \n     development of such competition. If competition is not \n     sufficient to be self-policing, we may learn how difficult \n     and costly it is to monitor and prevent discrimination and \n     cross-subsidization. We will also learn about what kinds \n     of safeguards are effective and/or necessary.\n       No trial, or course, could provide all the answers. \n     Nonetheless, this trial should substantially assist in \n     determining whether and on what terms the Decree's \n     interexchange restriction should be retained, modified or \n     removed.\n       Third, the trial may yield important information about the \n     possible benefits to interexchange competition from RBOC \n     provision of interexchange services. The RBOCs have argued \n     that the interexchange market, particularly for residential \n     customers, is oligopolistic rather than competitive, and that \n     RBOC entry will tend to disrupt that oligopolistic \n     coordination, resulting in substantial benefits to consumers. \n     While Ameritech has not yet presented sufficient evidence to \n     substantiate this claim, actual experience may cast \n     additional light on this argument.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The carefully crafted details of the proposed order grew \n     out of intensive work by the Department and extensive \n     consultation and negotiation with interested persons. We do \n     not expect all commenters to be satisfied; in an arena filled \n     with competing private interests, we can be assured that some \n     will claim that the balance has not been struck precisely \n     right. The issue, however, is whether the Department \n     ``reasonably regard[s]'' the modification ``as advancing the \n     public interest,'' 993 F.2d at 1576. On that issue, the terms \n     of the proposed order demonstrate, and we believe the \n     comments of interested persons as a whole will confirm, that \n     the proposed modification advances the public interest. The \n     Court should therefore enter the proposed order and allow \n     this important trial to proceed, subject to the \n     preconditions, safeguards, and continuing review for which \n     the order itself provides.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Anne K.

A similar telephone survey was conducted \n     in January 1994, by First Market Research Corporation, for a \n     study sponsored by AT, MCI, and CompTel.

In Michigan, the Michigan PSC \n     adopted on an interim basis a pricing scheme for unbundled \n     loops that was proposed by City Signal, a CAP which in 1994 \n     was granted a license to provide local service in the Grand \n     Rapids LATA. Under the interim scheme, Ameritech will charge \n     City Signal $8 for a residential loop and $11 for a business \n     loop. The Commission will further address these issues in an \n     upcoming generic proceeding, to commence June 1, 1995, and to \n     be completed no later than nine months thereafter. In the \n     matter of the Application of City Signal, Inc., for an Order \n     Establishing and Approving Interconnection Arrangements with \n     Ameritech Michigan, Case No. U-10647, at 85-95 (Mich. Pub. \n     Serv. Comm'n, Feb. 23, 1995) [hereinafter ``City Signal \n     Order''] [Appendix, Tab 9].\n     In Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission heard extensive \n     testimony on Ameritech's proposed pricing of unbundled loops \n     and ports, disapproved certain aspects of that pricing, and \n     required that Ameritech file new tariffs to ensure that the \n     sum of prices for unbundled network functions not exceed the \n     price of bundled functions and to reduce and equalize the \n     contribution that those prices would make to common costs. \n     ICC Order, supra note 7, at 60-61 [Appendix, Tab 7].\n     \\11\\The issue of ``sub-loop unbundling'' is dealt with in \n     similar fashion. AT and others have contended that merely \n     unbundling loops from ports does not go far enough. Instead, \n     AT contends that local service should be unbundled into at \n     least twelve basic network elements: distribution, \n     concentration, feeding, end office switching, dedicated line \n     transport, common transport, tandem switching, databases used \n     in signaling, packet switching of signaling from the \n     originating central office, packet switching of signaling at \n     the destination, links from the packet switches to data \n     processors and storage points, and operator services. \n     Affidavit of Lawrence A. Sullivan, submitted by AT in its \n     Opposition to Original Proposal, at 29-30 (filed with the \n     Department of Justice on Feb. 15, 1994) [Appendix, Tab 10]. \n     Advocates for this position argue, for example, that a \n     provider of personal communications services (``PCS'') might \n     be able to provide a witness connection from the home to a \n     neighborhood node, and then use Ameritech facilities to get \n     from the neighborhood node to the central office. Testimony \n     of Dr. Mark T. Bryant on behalf of MCI before the Illinois \n     Commerce Commission, at 10-11 (Dkt. No. 94-0048, Aug. 8, \n     1994) [Appendix, Tab 11]. Ameritech responds that such an \n     approach could lead to the uneconomic stranding of \n     significant amounts of its investment, to no real purpose \n     since the facilities can be made available to competitors on \n     a nondiscriminatory basis and since continued use of \n     Ameritech facilities whose costs are already sunk would be in \n     the interests of consumers. The proposed order does not \n     require sub-loop unbundling, but makes clear that this \n     resolution is without prejudice to the power of a state to \n     require such further unbundling. (Proposed Order, para.1(m).) \n     Moreover, it makes clear that the Department may consider the \n     competitive effects of such unbundling (or lack thereof). \n     (Id.).\n     \\12\\State law or regulatory requirements intended to benefit \n     competition in the intraLATA toll market may require \n     Ameritech to implement intraLATA toll dialing parity before \n     Ameritech has met the conditions in para.11 of the proposed \n     order. In that case, intraLATA toll dialing parity would come \n     into effect before Ameritech commences interexchange service.\n     \\13\\The proposed order does not displace state regulation, \n     however. (See Proposed Order, para. 3.) State regulators may \n     choose to regulate arrangements even when consented to by the \n     carriers involved.\n     In allowing paragraph 9(e) to be satisfied by consent of the \n     other exchange carriers, we recognize that unequal bargaining \n     power may lead a competitive exchange carrier to agree to \n     unsatisfactory terms. That is precisely why the provisions of \n     paragraph 9 are not a checklist that will lead automatically \n     to Ameritech's entry into interexchange service. The ultimate \n     issue will always be the competitive results of the \n     negotiated arrangements, as tested against actual marketplace \n     facts. (See Section III.B.) Thus, because the proposed order \n     requires that the Department analyze market facts and assess \n     competitive circumstances, the proposed order gives Ameritech \n     the incentive to negotiate in good faith and arrive at a \n     procompetitive agreement with competitive exchange carriers.\n     \\14\\Of course, the reasons advanced by a competing carrier as \n     to why the proffered interconnection arrangements are \n     inadequate may have a bearing on any assessment of \n     competitive circumstances.\n     \\15\\See, e.g., A Blueprint for Action, supra note 1, Tab 3 at \n     5-19 (discussing shortcomings of interim number portability) \n     [Appendix, Tab 1].\n     \\16\\The compliance plan, which deals principally with post-\n     entry safeguards, is discussed in more detail in Section \n     III.C, below.\n     \\17\\The Department is currently investigating claims that \n     regulation and post-entry safeguards are sufficient to ensure \n     that there is no substantial possibility that an RBOC could \n     engage in anticompetitive conduct, without the market-opening \n     measures contemplated in the proposed order, in connection \n     with the Motion of Bell Atlantic Corporation, BellSouth \n     Corporation, NYNEX Corporation, and Southwestern Bell \n     Corporation to Vacate the Decree. (Bell Atlantic has since \n     withdrawn from that motion.) Ameritech is not advancing that \n     proposition at this time, however, and the proposed trial is \n     not designed to test such claims.\n     \\18\\The staff of the Michigan PSC, in its comments on an \n     earlier version of the proposal, urged the Department to \n     include the Detroit and Lansing LATAs in the Trial Territory. \n     Revised Comments of the Staff of the Michigan Public Service \n     Commission (Mar. 22, 1995) [Appendix, Tab 15]. The Department \n     does not believe this change to be appropriate, because it is \n     too early to tell how widely different areas of the state \n     will vary in the availability of competitive alternatives and \n     the ability of such alternatives to guard against harm to \n     competition in the interexchange market. We stress, however, \n     that the modification provisions of the proposed order \n     establish sufficient flexibility to deal appropriately with \n     whatever competitive conditions should arise.\n     \\19\\The FCC's order removing structural separation \n     requirements was vacated and remanded by the Ninth Circuit. \n     California v. FCC, 39 F.3d 919 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, \n     63 U.S.L.W. 3721 (U.S. April 3, 1995). Further proceedings on \n     remand are pending at the FCC.\n     \\20\\Even under the FCC's Computer Inquiry II approach, \n     certain kinds of services can be shared between the \n     interexchange subsidiary and other affiliates. These are \n     enumerated in para. 20(g). To the extent that any such \n     sharing is carried out in a way that harms competition, the \n     Department and the Court retain the power to take corrective \n     action under para.para. 15-16, as well as to take that fact \n     into account in evaluating the progress of the trail under \n     para. 18.\n     \\21\\The proposed order calls for ``equivalent'' rather than \n     identical order, maintenance, and support systems, to account \n     for the possibility that access to such systems may involve \n     the use of different interfaces because of the different \n     requirements of different carriers' computer systems and \n     because of Ameritech's need to protect the security of its \n     systems. The access must, however, be equivalently \n     convenient; the provision would not be satisfied by providing \n     electronic connections to Ameritech's interexchange \n     subsidiary but only fax machines to its competitors.\n     \\22\\Among the restrictions on access to customer information \n     is a provision that the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary \n     may not have access to customer proprietary network \n     information (``CPNI'') as defined by the FCC, except in the \n     same manner that CPNI is available to unaffiliated carriers. \n     This would mean, for example, that unlike the Ameritech local \n     exchange operations, the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary \n     would have to obtain the affirmative consent of the local \n     exchange operations' customers in order to get local and \n     intraLATA toll usage patterns of those customers. At one \n     point, Ameritech expressed concern that this restriction \n     would put it at a marketing disadvantage compared to AT, \n     which could target the marketing of one-stop shopping \n     services to its more lucrative interexchange customers, based \n     on their long-distance usage patterns, which would be \n     available to AT without such affirmative consent because \n     they would relate to services as to which AT was the \n     subscribers' provider. Ameritech concluded, however, that it \n     could overcome this disadvantage if it could start seeking \n     such affirmative consent from Ameritech local exchange \n     customers as soon as possible. Since nothing in the existing \n     Decree would appear to prohibit the seeking of such consent \n     before the trial begins or even before the proposed order is \n     entered, so long as customers are not misled as to the actual \n     extent of Ameritech's authority to offer interexchange \n     service, Ameritech withdrew this concern.\n     \\23\\In some cases, such as the provision of interexchange and \n     intraLATA toll services by the interexchange subsidiary \n     (para.para. 41, 45) and the provision of Centrex service to \n     business customers (para. 43), the proposed order provides \n     for the offering of such services immediately upon the \n     commencement of Ameritech's authority to offer interexchange \n     telecommunications, because other carriers are already \n     offering such services on a ``one-stop-shopping'' basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks \nappear as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I was very interested to hear the \ncomments by Senator Byrd and Senator Hollings today on the issue of \ntrade. I think the three of us, with perhaps one or two others, are the \nonly Members of the Senate who come and speak about the issue of trade. \nThere is almost a conspiracy of silence in this Senate, in the entire \nCongress, and in this town, especially, on the issue of trade.\n\n\n                           U.S. TRADE POLICY\n\n  We have the largest trade deficit in human history in this country \nnow. We have a lot of hand wringing about the fiscal policy deficits, \nand they are dangerous and troublesome. We must deal with them. But no \none speaks about the trade deficit and what causes it and what it means \nfor our country. I hope one day soon that will change, because today's \ntrade deficits will be repaid in the future with a lower standard of \nliving in this country. We must get rid of these terrible, terrible \ntrade deficits that are going to ruin this country's future.\n  Beginning on Friday this week, I am going to make about four \npresentations on the floor of the Senate over the period of the next \ncouple of weeks, talking about the last 50 years. I want to start with \npost-Second World War \n[[Page S5976]]  trade strategy, which was really foreign policy, in \nwhich we were linked to other countries try to strengthen others around \nthe world who had been suffering from the ravages of war. During that \nperiod of time, there was general expansion in world trade and general \nexpansion of prosperity. Our allies prospered and so did we. We \nprospered in output. We saw higher wages. Our country generally, in the \nfirst 25 years, did well.\n  You look at the last 25 years and you will see, even as others began \nto compete with us very aggressively, we clung to the same strategy. \nAnd what have we seen for it? We have seen a lower standard of living \nin this country generally, lower wages, and we have seen American jobs \nmove overseas. That has been the result of this strategy. It is a \nstrategy that hurts this country, and it is a strategy that must be \nchanged.\n  We must get to a point where, if you close your eyes and simply \nlisten, you can hear a difference between what people are saying on \ntrade policy. You cannot anymore. There is no difference between what \nthe Republicans say and what the Democrats say on trade. It sounds all \nthe same to me.\n  Oh, Senator Hollings sounds different to me because he is talking a \ndifferent kind of strategy--plus he comes from a different part of the \ncountry. And Senator Byrd sounds different because he is talking about \ntrade in a completely different way. But it is very unusual, and we \nneed to create a national debate on this subject. We need to do it \nsoon. The merchandise trade deficit last year was $166 billion, the \nhighest in history. Jobs left our country. Wages in this country were \ndown.\n  Our current strategy says to American workers they can now compete \nwith 2 or 3 billion others in the world, some of whom are willing to \nwork for 12 cents an hour at the age of 12, for 12 hours a day. That \nought not be the competition for the American worker. No one should \nproduce a product that enters our marketplace under those conditions. \nAnd we must, posthaste, create a national debate about trade strategy, \nlooking out for the best interests of this country.\n  I do not want a trade war. That does not serve anybody's interests. \nBut I do want our country to stand up for its own economic interests \nfor a change. Can we not, for a change, just for once, have a trade \nnegotiation that we win, or at least come out even on? We lose every \ntime we pull up to the table. We lost on NAFTA; we lost on Canada; we \nlost on GATT. We can go all the way back. It is time for this country \nto stand up for its economic interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5975-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5976-S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEDICARE AND TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not come to speak about trade, but I wanted to say \nsomething about what I saw this weekend--the Speaker of the House, the \nmajority leader of the Senate, and now today I see the chairman of the \nWays and Means Committee of the other body, all talking about Medicare.\n  It was interesting to me. I was thinking about these old movies I \nused to see when I was a kid, when all these cowboys would whistle when \nthey go into a box canyon and then when the trouble would start, they \nwould start jumping off their horses, trying to find a place to hide.\n  This is kind of a box canyon we have created in the last couple of \nmonths, just riding in, whistling all the way, with the Contract With \nAmerica, saying: Do you know what we can do? We can balance the Federal \nbudget easily. We can do it before lunch. We will not even break a \nsweat. We will just change the U.S. Constitution and use $1.3 trillion \nin the Social Security trust funds to offset against other revenues. We \nwill balance the budget.\n  Plus we will do more than that. We will promise you American people \nwe will not only balance the budget, we will give you a tax cut. In \nfact, we will call it a middle-class tax cut. We will do all of that, \nand we will tame this Medicare and Medicaid problem. We will cut money \nout of Medicare and Medicaid and we will solve that problem.\n  Then what happened? I think this weekend somehow these folks that \nrode into this box canyon understood the trouble they were in because, \nall of a sudden, the three dismounted and are scurrying in every \ndirection.\n  I noticed today the Ways and Means Committee in the House was asking \nthe administration to give them advice on how to solve the Medicare and \nMedicaid problem. They were not asking for any advice when they talked \nabout the tax cut bill or the welfare reform bill that they moved \nthrough there quickly. They did not need any advice then. But all of a \nsudden they find out their promises are coming home to pinch. What they \nare worried about is that the American people might see what has been \ncreated--a promise of tax cuts for the middle class that looks like \nthis:\n  This is the middle-class tax cut for those middle-class folks who \nlive on Rodeo Drive. At least it must be Rodeo Drive because how else \ncould you explain this chart? Who benefits from the tax bill? If you \nearn $30,000 or below, as an average family, you get an enormous tax \ncut, $134 a year. If your income is $200,000 or above as an American \nfamily, you get a check back for your tax bill, a tax cut of $11,266.\n  I was on a radio talk show with a conservative host, somebody who \nbelieves in all of this, who said, ``Well, Senator Dorgan, what do you \nthink about this middle-income tax cut?'' I said, ``What middle-income \ntax cut? What on Earth are you talking about?'' He said, ``The one just \npassed by the House of Representatives which benefits the middle-income \nfolks.'' I said, ``Really? Do you understand it? Have you really seen \nthe results of it?'' I said, ``If you are over $200,000, you get a \n$11,200 tax break; $30,000 or under, you get $134. That is middle \nincome?'' Not in my hometown, it is not middle income.\n  But you know what has happened here. You know what the box canyon \nis--people are going to look and say, ``Gee. Now if we have a big \ndeficit and we have economic troubles in our country and we are trying \nto reduce the budget deficit and give a $11,200 tax cut to families \nover $200,000 a year, and then the same folks who want to do it come \nalong and say, ``Do you know how we can pay for all of this? We can \ntake a $300 billion or $400 billion out of Medicare and Medicaid. That \nis how we can pay for this.''\n  All of a sudden I think a light bulb went on in the minds of some of \nthese architects who said maybe we will get blamed for taking money \naway from people who are elderly or poor for their health care and \nusing it to give a tax cut to those who are wealthy. Will not that be \nunfair for those of us who know the facts to stand up and talk about \nthose folks? So all of a sudden we have seen in the last 48 hours, 72 \nhours, folks scurrying around town here saying, ``Wait a second. Do not \nbe so quick on Medicare and Medicaid. That is not really what we meant. \nThat is not what we said.''\n  We do not really know what they mean because those same folks who \nwere out here in an enormous hurry to change the U.S. Constitution were \nnot in a very big hurry on April 1 when the law said they were required \nto bring a budget to the floor of the Senate.\n  You see, you cannot change the Constitution and alter the deficit. If \nyou change the Constitution with a constitutional amendment to require \na balanced budget, you will not change the deficit by one nickel. What \nchanges the budget deficit is when we bring a budget to the floor and \nmake decisions.\n  They were in a big hurry to change the Constitution, but somehow this \nenormous need to move quickly has left them. Now they simply cannot \nseem to get over here. The law says April 1 they should be here with \ntheir budget. Then it says by April 15 we should have a conference \nreport. Well, April 1 came and went. April 15 is here and gone. May 1 \nis here and gone. No budget. But we have tax cuts for the big folks.\n  If you make half a million dollars sitting there clipping coupons, \nusing that channel changer to search to see what entertainment is on \ntonight for you, boy, you can look at this Congress, and, say, ``What a \nCongress. What a bunch of folks those folks are. $11,000 I have to \nspend. I can buy some more radio equipment. In fact, I can probably \nlease a Rolls Royce for 6 or 8 months, or lease a Mercedes Benz.'' \nCould you not with $11,000 lease a Mercedes Benz for a year? Then you \nsay to the person that is making $20,000 or \n[[Page S5977]]  $25,000 a year, maybe a hubcap. Maybe you will not be \nable to afford the hubcap. Maybe a radiator cap, but certainly not the \nMercedes Benz we are going to give to the big folks.\n  Here we are. No budget; got a tax cut, not middle-class tax cut, a \ntax cut that gives the bulk of the benefits to the wealthiest. It is \nthe old cake and crumbs theory. Give the cake to the big shots. Leave a \nfew crumbs to the rest and say everybody got something.\n  It is like somebody going to Camden Yards and saying, ``You know \nsomething. I am going to give away $100 million in Camden Yards over at \nthe baseball stadium in Baltimore.'' So everybody files in with great \nexpectations because it is going to be divided up among them. The \nperson goes around to every seat and gives everybody a dollar. But the \nperson sitting behind home plate, seat A, row one, that person gets \n$99,999,000--essentially the bulk of the tax cut, the bulk of the \ngiveaway. That is what is happening here, and people understand that.\n  So we are in a situation now where those of us who look at this \ncontract and the strategy wonder what is real. They say, ``I want a \nbalanced budget. I want a balanced budget. I am willing to weigh in and \nlift for a balanced budget. I am going to propose a container of \nspending cuts that is real and substantial.''\n  But as I said a couple of months ago, you know, I tuned in once to a \ntelevision program and saw weight lifting and body building. They had \nthe body building contest where the folks come out and pose. I had \nnever seen this before. They oil themselves up and they come out and \nflex their muscles. And the announcer said, ``In the sport of body \nbuilding there is a big difference between lifting and posing.''\n  I thought to myself. Gee. That sort of spells the difference in \npolitics. There are a lot of folks who are terrific in posing. They \ncome out here and flex around, get all oiled up, and look pretty and \nimpress everybody. The question then on April 1 is what can you lift? \nThe answer is apparently nothing. This is all posing.\n  I think all of us here need to understand what the dimensions of the \nproblem are for this country. We have serious dimensions in the problem \nof Medicare and Medicaid, and we have to resolve it. We have to reform \nthe system. We ought to redress the rate of growth to the extent we \ncan. We ought to do that in a bipartisan way. But nobody that I know of \non this side of the aisle believes we ought to provide $11,000 tax cuts \nfor the people with a couple hundred thousand dollars in income, and \nthen say to the seniors in this country, ``We are sorry. We don't have \nenough money to provide health care for you.''\n  Those are the issues. Is it fair to juxtapose them? It is darned \nright it is fair. We intend to do that because I think we ought to pass \na budget that moves us toward a balanced budget and get rid of these \ndeficits. I think we ought to reform the welfare system. We ought to \nreduce the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid. We should reform \nthe welfare system as well. We ought to reduce the rate of growth in \nhealth-care programs.\n  But we ought not under any circumstance play this kind of a game \nwhere we can construct one more bit of evidence of reaching out to the \nwealthiest in our country and saying, ``By the way, let us give you an \nextra bonus, a little extra appreciation for what you do for America.'' \nThere is nothing wrong with being wealthy. I think everybody would like \nto be wealthy. But there are a whole lot of folks in this country who \nare not wealthy who work and try very hard and also need some help.\n  I think the help we can give them in this country as a whole is to \nreduce this crushing budget deficit, do it in an honest way, address \nthe wrenching issues of health care in an omnibus way, but especially \nwith respect to Medicare and Medicaid. If we do that, then I think \nfinally these kinds of things will be believable.\n  I came today to discuss this only because I have seen the scurrying \nor the flurry of activity in the last couple of days by our majority \nleader, and by the Speaker, and by so many others who now say, ``Well, \nit is true we were thinking of several hundred billion dollars in cuts \nin Medicare and Medicaid but now we want to talk about it in a \ndifferent context.'' Why the change? All of us know why the change. \nBecause they understand that even those of us who went to the smallest \nschools can add and subtract, and when things do not add up, you have \nto live with the consequences.\n  This kind of a chart does not add up against the backdrop of those \nwho want to go after Medicare and Medicaid. It does not add up either \nthat those who are most anxious to change the Constitution now somehow \nseem not anxious at all to bring the budget resolution to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  My hope is that in the very near future all of us who care about this \ncan work together and solve these problems together.\n  You know, I supported, in 1993, a budget resolution that passed this \nChamber by one vote, and I have never apologized and never intend to \napologize to anybody for voting to do it. I am glad I did. It was the \nright vote.\n  The easiest vote and the political vote would have been to vote no, \nbecause what we did was we cut some spending, we increased some taxes, \nand we reduced the deficit.\n  Nearly half of our Chamber said, ``Count me out. I just want to talk \nabout deficit reduction, but when it comes to voting for it, I ain't \ngoing to vote for it in a minute, not an hour, not a year.'' So we did \nnot even get one Republican vote to pass the budget resolution.\n  So I do not want people in this Chamber wondering whether the Senator \nfrom South Carolina or others are willing to balance the budget. We \nhave been willing to cast the difficult votes and live with the \nconsequences. And I am perfectly satisfied with that.\n  But there is much, much more to do. The next step, and I hope the \nfinal step, in getting toward a balanced budget amendment requires, I \nthink, sober, serious budget cuts. It requires us to jettison these \nkinds of approaches that are called middle-class tax cuts, that really \nonce again reduce the revenues and increase the deficit in order to \ngive tax cuts to the wealthy.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from South Carolina is on his \nfeet. Those are the points I wanted to make today about wondering why \nthe budget is not before us, No. 1; and, No. 2, trying to understand a \nbit, why so much activity in the last 72 hours by leaders of the other \nparty on the Medicare and Medicaid reform issue? I think I understand \nit. I think they understand it. We will see in the coming days what \nresults from it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to join in the comments of our \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota along the line of the \ndifficulty with respect to the budget, and then let me also address \nMedicare and some of the comments made recently.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document released last January on the \nrealities of truth in budgeting be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n                                                                        \n[[Page S5978]]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust                                                                                                                      \n funds).................................             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CONGRESSIONAL \n                   ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate\n       (A) that the Congress should move to eliminate the biggest \n     unfunded mandate--interest on the national debt, which drives \n     the increasing federal burden on state and local governments; \n     and\n       (B) that prior to adopting in the first session of the \n     104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution requiring a balanced budget--\n       (1) the Congress set forth specific outlay and revenue \n     changes to achieve a balanced federal budget by the year \n     2002; and\n       (2) enforce through the Congressional budget process the \n     requirement to achieve a balanced federal budget by the year \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in this particular document, I went as \nseriously in purpose as I possibly could to try my dead-level best to \ndo what the contract said.\n  As you well know, Mr. President, I have voted for and supported a \nbalanced budget. I voted for one in 1968 and 1969. As chairman of the \nBudget Committee, we cut the deficit materially. I opposed the tax cuts \nof President Reagan and favored the spending cuts, which was very \ncostly to me politically. But I knew we had to do it. I knew what the \nproblem was.\n  I, thereupon, recommended a freeze when our friend, Senator Howard \nBaker, was the majority leader, and we worked on that. I later worked, \nof course, with Senator Gramm and Senator Rudman on Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings, where we sequestered, cut right straight across the board, \nreduced the deficit for awhile, and fought like a tiger at 12:41 a.m., \nOctober 19, 1990, when they repealed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on that \npoint of order, with Senator Gramm voting to repeal it. And I have been \ndisillusioned by that.\n  But I had tried the freeze; I tried the cuts. And then, under \nPresident Bush, talking with his OMB Director, Dick Darman, I said to \nDick, ``If you can get President Bush to go along now, we will have to \nhave not only the spending cuts, the spending freezes, the elimination \nof tax loopholes, but we need revenues to get on top of this.''\n  Because I will show in later debate where President Reagan got us the \nfirst $100 billion deficit and the first $200 billion. President Bush \ngot us the first $300 billion deficit and the first $400 billion \ndeficit. And I will show that by actual record.\n  As I have said, we have to get on top of this monster. I testified \nbefore the Finance Committee for a value-added tax. So I put this \nparticular item that I have referred to in the Record just once again \nto justify my capacity and sincerity to talk on this particular point.\n  Because I listed the very, very difficult task that was confronting \nus whereby, in a line, you are not going to save that much in \nentitlements and welfare reform and health reform or Social Security or \ndefense, but rather you are going to have to look for domestic \ndiscretionary spending. And to put us on a glidepath that first year, \nyou had to cut $37 billion in domestic discretionary spending and even \nthen, you would not accomplish it because interest costs grows this \nyear by $43 billion.\n  So like ``Alice in Wonderland,'' in order to stay where you are, you \nhave to run as fast as you can; in order to get ahead, you have to run \neven faster. So it is a far, far more serious problem.\n  And the talk about tax cuts, that is out of the whole cloth. \nEverybody likes tax cuts. I joined with Senator Feingold from Wisconsin \nearlier this year in saying forget about cutting the revenues. The \nproblem is you need revenues, because we have spending on automatic \npilot.\n  I can tell you here and now, irrespective of what they are saying, as \nwe talk this particular day, May 2, 1995, we have spent another $1 \nbillion. And tomorrow, we will spend another $1 billion; Thursday, \nanother $1 billion; and Friday another $1 billion; and Saturday, \nanother $1 billion; and Sunday, another $1 billion, just in interest \ncosts, on automatic pilot.\n  How do you get on top of this monster? Well, you have to do all the \nabove \n[[Page S5979]]  and, yes, it is going to take bipartisanship and not \ngoing to take politics.\n  I want to make reference now to the statement just made by the \nSenator from North Dakota about Medicare, because we hear a lot of \nwhooping and wailing about Medicare and, above all, about the President \nof the United States.\n  Now, heavens above, if there is one thing--and I think President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton has been blamed for everything up here--but \nif there is one thing that President Clinton cannot be blamed for, that \nis any deficit in Medicare-Medicaid. He was back home in Little Rock, \nAR, when we were up here creating these deficits. So let us not blame \nthe President.\n  Moreover, let us not blame him since he has come to town. He put this \nas the No. 1 issue. They are talking about AWOL now. I am going to get \nto this point. Here is the gentleman they talk about being AWOL. He \ncame to town with health care reform as his No. 1 interest and issue. \nAlong with that, he submitted a cut of $125 billion. And the then-\nchairman of our Finance Committee was the distinguished Senator from \nNew York, Senator Moynihan. He described that as fantasy. And Senator \nPackwood, the ranking member, joined in with him--a $125 billion cut \nwas fantasy. It just could not be done.\n  But we worked on it. And we worked on spending cuts. We worked on \ncontrolling entitlements, and we worked on tax increases. And, yes, we \ncame up, finally, with a plan that year with all three of them, without \na single, single, single Republican vote in either the Senate or the U. \nS. House of Representatives.\n  We reduced the deficit some $500 billion. We eliminated over 100,000 \nGovernment jobs. We increased taxes on gasoline, liquor, and \ncigarettes. We increased taxes even on Social Security. And, finally, \nwe did get an agreement, after hard work, of a $56 billion cut in \nMedicare.\n  Now, remember, in the last 24 hours, we have heard AWOL: The \nPresident is AWOL; took a walk; waved the flag of surrender; AWOL.\n  Here was a President who led and got his Vice President over and all \nto get the necessary votes so we could get those cuts in Medicare.\n  Thereupon, the President came last year with another $80 billion in \ncuts, along with health care reform, and what did they do? They \nrebuffed him and beat up on him and ridiculed the First Lady. But she \nworked, and, agree or disagree, you could not say that Hillary Rodham \nClinton was AWOL or that William Jefferson Clinton was AWOL.\n   Now what they want to do, Mr. President--and this is the interesting \nthing and I am going to include this in the Record--they wanted the \nPresident of the United States to do all the dirty work, all the cuts. \nI want to show you the Dole-Domenici alternative entitled ``Because \nGovernment, Not People, Should Be the First to Sacrifice.'' Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the Dole-Domenici alternative \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n The Dole/Domenici Alternative: Because government, not people, should \n                       be the first to sacrifice\n\n                                                            Billions\\1\\\nDrop all proposed spending add-ons................................-$124\n  Drop investment\n  Drop stimulus\n  Permit new spending if paid for by added spending cuts\nEliminate proposed taxes...........................................-295\n  Drop all individual income taxes\n  Drop President Clinton's proposed new energy tax\n  Drop all business income taxes\n  Eliminate Social Security tax increase\nEliminate all proposed user fees....................................-18\nAccept all proposed mandatory and discretionary cuts...............-241\n  Accept all mandatory savings\n  Accept all discretionary savings (Defense and non-Defense)\nRestore $20 billion in Defense budget...............................+20\n  Specific details await President's budget submission\nFreeze domestic discretionary baseline..............................-92\n  Freeze fiscal year 1994 domestic discretionary BA except for \n      increased funding for child immunization and WIC programs ($500 \n      million in 1994)\n  Extend domestic discretionary sequester to enforce freeze and savings\nRevenues:\n  Pay for R and other investment tax incentives:\nCap non-Social Security mandatory spending........................-93.1\n  Total non-Social Security mandatory savings: $177 billion over 5 \n      years\n  Cap on Medicare and Medicaid spending (CPI+population+4%)\nDebt savings........................................................-38\n                                                             __________\n\n      Real deficit reduction\\2\\..................................-444.2\nSasser assumptions on debt management..............................16.1\n                                                             __________\n\n      Total deficit reduction....................................-460.4\n                                                               ==========\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\\1\\Numbers are based on CBO capped baseline.\n\\2\\Deficit in 1998 would drop to $168.4 billion and continue falling \ninto the next century.\n       Process reform proposals:\n       Establish discretionary spending caps for defense and non-\n     defense domestic programs.\n       Create fixed deficit targets with enforcement through \n     across the board cuts if targets breached.\n       Assumes zero-based budgeting to control future spending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the Dole-Domenici alternative \nbudget they put up in March 1993. The language is: ``Accept all \nproposed mandatory and discretionary cuts, $241 billion.'' They not \nonly accepted the President's cuts but on top of that they capped non-\nSocial Security mandatory spending--a cap on Medicare and Medicaid. So \nthey could go to the 1994 election and say, ``Look at what they have \ndone. The President wants to cut your Medicare.''\n  And in 1994, here is what they had. This one is entitled ``GOP \nAlternative Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief, Slashing the Deficit, \nCutting Middle-Class Taxes.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nprint the GOP alternative in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           GOP Alternative: Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief\n\n\n            slashing the deficit, cutting middle class taxes\n\n       The Republican Alternative Budget will reduce the deficit \n     $318 billion over the next five years--$287 billion in policy \n     savings and $31 billion from interest savings. This is $322 \n     billion more in deficit reduction than the President proposes \n     and $303 billion more in deficit reduction than the House-\n     passed resolution contains.\n       Moreover, the GOP alternative budget helps President \n     Clinton achieve two of his most important campaign promises--\n     to cut the deficit in half in four years and provide a \n     middle-class tax cut. The GOP plan:\n       Reduces the deficit to $99 billion in 1999. This is $106 \n     billion less than the 1999 deficit projected under the \n     Clinton budget.\n       Even under this budget Federal spending will continue to \n     grow.\n       Total spending would increase from $1.48 trillion in FY \n     1995 to more than $1.7 trillion in FY 1999.\n       Medicare would grow by 7.8-percent a year rather than the \n     projected 10.6-percent. Medicaid's growth would slow to 8.1-\n     percent annually rather than the projected 12-percent a year \n     growth.\n       It increases funding for President Clinton's defense \n     request by the $20 billion shortfall acknowledged by the \n     Pentagon.\n       Provides promised tax relief to American families and small \n     business:\n       Provides tax relief to middle-class families by providing a \n     $500 tax credit for each child in the household. The \n     provision grants needed tax relief to the families of 52 \n     million American children. The tax credit provides a typical \n     family of four $80 every month for family expenses and \n     savings.\n       Restores deductibility for interest on student loans--\n     321,000 for 25,000.\n       Indexes capital gains for inflation and allows for capital \n     loss on principal residence.\n       Creates new incentives for family savings and investments \n     through new IRA proposals that would allow penalty free \n     withdrawals for first time homebuyers, educational and \n     medical expenses.\n       Establishes new Individual Retirement Account for \n     homemakers.\n       Extends R tax credit for one-year and provides for a one-\n     year exclusion of employer provided educational assistance.\n       Adjusts depreciation schedules for inflation (neutral cost \n     recovery).\n       Tax provisions result in total tax cut of $88 billion over \n     five years.\n       Fully funds the Senate Crime Bill Trust Fund, providing $22 \n     billion for anti-crime measures over the next five years. The \n     Clinton budget does not. The House-passed budget does not. \n     The Chairman's mark does not.\n       Accepts the President's proposed $113 billion level in \n     nondefense discretionary spending reductions and then secures \n     additional savings by freezing aggregate nondefense sending \n     for five years.\n       [[Page S5980]] Accepts the President's proposed reductions \n     in the Medicare program and indexes the current $100 annual \n     Part ``B'' deductible for inflation. Total Medicare savings \n     would reach $80 billion over the next five years.\n       Achieves $64 billion in Medicaid savings over the next five \n     years, by capping Medicaid payments, reducing and freezing \n     Disproportionate Share Hospital payments at their 1994 level.\n       Achieves additional savings through reform of our welfare \n     system totaling $33 billion over the next five years.\n       Repeals Davis-Bacon, reduces the number of political \n     appointees, reduces overhead expenditures for university \n     research, and achieves savings from a cap on civilian FTE's.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now we have in March of last year: \n``Accept the President's proposed reduction in the Medicare program, \nand index the Part B deductible. Total Medicare savings would reach $80 \nbillion over the next 5 years.''\n  So there is a conscious awareness in the distinguished majority \nleader when he talks of the President being AWOL on Medicare. Rather \nthan being AWOL, he has been wounded in the front lines while these \nothers have been all back in the barracks and not even attending the \nbattle. In fact, back in the barracks, the cattle call was what we \nneeded was portability so you can carry your coverage from job to job--\na little bit of this, that and the other, just some minor adjustments--\nwhy is there all this problem, there is no real problem in medical \ncoverage in America.\n  Now it is a crisis. When? In 2002. I am trying to get by tomorrow. I \nam trying to stop spending a billion dollars a day today, tomorrow, and \nthe next day. If I can stop doing that, I can get on top of the \nproblems in the year 2002. But to come forward at this particular time \nand run all over the national TV talking about taking a walk and going \nAWOL when the poor fellow has been ground into the ground, he has been \ntotally rebuffed. He has tried and fought the good fight. So now they \ncome with all of this ``Let's have bipartisanship.'' They would not \ngive us a single vote, and now they want to get bipartisan, now they \nwant to get commissions, now we are AWOL because we are ready to try to \nput the truth to their so-called contract.\n  The rubber is now meeting the road, and if you look at that contract, \nMr. President, talking about Medicare and AWOL, who shoots the troops \nout there on the front line, the Medicare troops? The contract does, \nfor the simple reason that we in raising Social Security taxes--and \nthis Senator voted to raise Social Security taxes--we raised 25 billion \nbucks and allocated it to Medicare.\n  And what does the contract call for? Abolish that tax and not give \nthe $25 billion, rather let us shoot the Medicare troops and add to the \nMedicare deficit.\n  Do not come with your contract and tell me how serious you are about \nthis deficit and all the costs of Medicare. Then you say, oh, by the \nway, that problem that the President said for 2 years was the principal \ncause of the deficit and you shot him down, the President is AWOL. You \nknow it. It was adopted momentarily by the distinguished majority \nleader, because one of these alternatives says ``the GOP alternative,'' \nand I take it the majority of the GOP certainly was for it in March of \nlast year. It is in the Record. Read it. And now you say that the \nPresident is AWOL, he does not even know the problem and he will not \ncome front and center. He has used good common sense, as they call it, \ncommonsense budgets, or whatever is supposed to be common sense around \nhere. He used common sense on this one.\n  He has tried and fought the good fight. But to be accused, of all \nthings, of being AWOL when they come with a contract trying to increase \nthe Medicare deficit some 25 billion bucks and saying those who have \nled the fight since they have been in office and never caused any of it \nare AWOL. The President has been in the front lines leading the battle \nand fighting the fight.\n  My suggestion is they get out of the barracks and get out there on \nthe line themselves and put out the full meaning of their so-called \ndeficit reduction package.\n  On that score, I have been the chairman of the Budget Committee, and \nI have been the ranking member of the Budget Committee. I have worked \non it since 1974, the only remaining Member of either the House or the \nSenate who has been on it all that time. And I can tell you here and \nnow, in trying to get prompt consideration so the authorizing \ncommittees would know what to do and how to do it, we finally put into \nlaw that you had the budget out of the committee by April 1 and passed \nthe Senate and passed both Houses by April 15 the concurrent \nresolution.\n  As of this minute, we have not met to discuss--we had some cursory \nhearings the first of the year--but we have not met in 2 months on this \nbudget. They do not even call a meeting. They do not call a discussion. \nAnd yet they have the audacity to run around here as leaders and talk \nabout people being AWOL on Medicare and Medicaid.\n  We have done our best, and we will continue to do our best. But if \nthey want to get any kind of following, they are not going to get any \nfollowing out of this Senator as long as they continue these political \nshenanigans. They know it and everybody else knows it. I hope the press \nwill report it, because that is all they do now. They treat it like a \nspectator sport up here and just avoid dealing with the real issue.\n   I have pointed out the virtual impossibility of attaining--what \nChairman Kasich says on the other side--a balanced budget by the year \n2002 without taxes. They can be put on notice, now that I am speaking, \nthat I will join with them on any plan they have so long as it includes \nrevenue.\n  The reason I say that is because I have tried it every other way--and \nI am not dumb enough now, having struggled with this thing for 20 years \non the Budget Committee with half a haircut. I do not want a little bit \nhere in cuts and a little bit here and a halfway going there and \nsaying, oh, we are going to save $170 billion in interest costs by 2002 \nand give $170 billion over to the Finance Committee so they can give a \nmiddle class tax cut, and beginning to play politics that way. We do \nnot have the money. We are borrowing every day to keep this Government \ngoing. They put a bunch of numbers down on paper, then they all wink at \neach other and say, ``Well, who is going to be here in 2002?''\n  We can project it just as economists have projected it. We can put it \ndown in black and white when we all know differently. If you are going \nfor a real budget deficit reduction, by having the Government operating \nin the black by the year 2002, you have my vote. We will give, and \ntake, all the way around because I am committed to the spending cuts \nand what have you, but not overall, unless you are going to agree to \nhave the revenues. I put in a 5 percent value added tax because it is \nneeded. But you have to have substantial revenues and not tax cuts for \nmiddle class and capital gains and family cuts and all these other \nkinds of things that they have in, just to buy the 1996 election. No \nhalf a haircut for me. If you want to have truth in budgeting, then you \nhave my cooperation and vote. But if you are going to have a half \ntruth, which is worse than any at all, a half a haircut, keep it \nyourself and get it passed by yourself.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have quite a bit to say with respect to \npunitive damages, because there have been more than enough articles \nwritten on this particular score. Let me ask at this point that we have \nprinted in the Record an article by Thomas Lambert with respect to \npunitive damages, outlining, if you please, the various cases that are \nbrought about safety in America. It is an article of some years ago. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Suing For Safety\n\n                      (By Thomas F. Lambert, Jr.)\n\n       It has been well and truly said, ``If you would plant for a \n     year, plant grain; for a decade, plant trees; but if you \n     would plant for eternity, educate a man.'' For nearly four \n     generations, ATLA has been teaching its men and women, and \n     they have been demonstrating to one another, that you can sue \n     for safety. Indeed, one of the most practical measures for \n     cutting down accidents and injuries in the field of product \n     failure is a successful lawsuit against the supplier of the \n     flawed product. Here, as well as elsewhere in Tort Law, \n     immunity breeds irresponsibility \n     [[Page S5981]]  while liability induces the taking of \n     preventive vigilance. The best way to make a merchant \n     responsible is to make him accountable for harms caused by \n     his defective products. The responsible merchant is the \n     answerable merchant.\n       Harm is the tort signature. The primary aim of Tort Law, of \n     the civil liability system, is compensation for harm. Tort \n     Law also has a secondary, auxiliary and supportive function--\n     the accident prevention function or prophylactic purpose of \n     tort law--sometimes called the deterrent or admonitory \n     function. Accident prevention, of course, is even better than \n     accident compensation, an insight leading to ATLA's \n     longstanding credo: ``A Fence at the Top of the Cliff Is \n     Better Than an Ambulance in the Valley Below.''\n       As trial lawyers say, however, ``If you would fortify, \n     specify.'' The proposition that you can sue for safety is \n     readily demonstrable because it is laced and leavened with \n     specificities. They swarm as easily to mind as leaves to the \n     trees.\n\n\naccident prevention through successful suits in the products liability \n                                 field\n       (1) Case of the Charcoal Briquets Causing Death from Carbon \n     Monoxide. Liability was imposed on the manufacturer of \n     charcoal briquets for the carbon monoxide death and injury of \n     young men who used the briquets indoors to heat an unvented \n     mountain cabin. The 10-pound bags read, ``Quick to Give Off \n     Heat'' and ``Ideal for Cooking in or Out of Doors.'' The \n     manufacturer was guilty of failure to warn of a lethal latent \n     danger. Any misuse of the product was foreseeable because it \n     was virtually invited. Next time you stop in at the local \n     supermarket or hardware store, glance at the label on the \n     bags of charcoal briquets. In large capital letters you will \n     find the following: ``WARNING. DO NOT USE FOR INDOOR HEATING \n     OR COOKING UNLESS VENTILATION IS PROVIDED FOR EXHAUSTING \n     FUMES TO OUTSIDE. TOXIC FUMES MAY ACCUMULATE AND CAUSE \n     DEATH.'' Liability here inspired and exacted a harder, more \n     emphatic warning, once again reducing the level of excessive \n     preventable danger.\n       (2) Case of the Exploding Cans of Drano. When granular \n     Drano is combined with water, its caustic soda interacts with \n     aluminum, another ingredient in its formula and produces \n     intensive heat, converting any water into steam at a rapid \n     rate. If the mixture is confined, the pressure builds up \n     until an explosion results. The manufacturer's use of a \n     screw-on top in the teeth of such well known hazard was a \n     design for tragedy. The expectable came to pass (as is the \n     fashion with expectability). In Moore v. Jewel Tea Co., a 48-\n     year-old housewife suffered total blindness from the \n     explosion of a Drano can with a screw-on top, eventuating in \n     a $900,000 compensatory and $10,000 punitive award to the \n     wife and a $20,000 award to her husband for loss of conjugal \n     fellowship.\n       A high school chemistry student could see that what was \n     needed was a ``flip top'' or ``snap cap'' designed to come \n     off at a pressure of, say, 15-20 pounds per square inch. \n     After a series of adverse judgments, the manufacturer \n     substituted the safer flip top. Of course, even the Drano \n     flip top will be marked for failure if not accompanied by \n     adequate testing and quality control. Capers involved a suit \n     for irreversible blindness suffered by 10-year-old Joe Capers \n     when the redesigned flip top of a can of Drano failed to snap \n     off when the can fell into the bathtub and the caustic \n     contents spurted 8\\1/2\\ feet high impacting Joe in the face \n     and eyes with resulting total blindness. The shortcomings in \n     testing the can with the reformulated design cost the company \n     an award of $805,000. As a great Torts scholar has said, \n     ``Defective products should be scrapped in the factory, not \n     dodged in the home.''\n       Drayton v. Jiffee Chemical Corp., is a grim and striking \n     companion case to the Drano decisions mentioned above, and it \n     underscores the same engineering verities of those cases: the \n     place to design out dangers is on the drawing boards or when \n     prescribing the chemical formula. a one-year-old black girl \n     suffered horrendous facial injuries, ``saponification'' or \n     fusion of her facial features, when an uncapped container of \n     Liquid-Plumr was inadvertently tipped over. At the time of \n     the accident, this excessively and unnecessarily caustic \n     drain cleaner was composed of 26 percent sodium hydroxide, \n     i.e., lye. No antidote existed because, as the manufacturer \n     knew. Liquid-Plumr would dissolve human tissue in a fraction \n     of a second. To a child (or any human being) a chemical bath \n     of the drain cleaner could be as disfiguring as falling into \n     a pool of piranha fish. Liquid-Plumr, mind you was a \n     household product, which means that its expectable \n     environment of use must contemplate the ``patter of little \n     feet'' as the children's hour in the American home \n     encompasses 24 hours of the day.\n       At the time of marketing this highly caustic drain cleaner, \n     having made no tests as to its effect on human tissue within \n     the existing state of the art, the defendant could have \n     reformulated the design to use 5 percent potassium bydroxide \n     which would have been less expensive, just as effective and \n     much safer. After some 59 other Liquid-Plumr injuries were \n     reported to defendant, it finally reformulated its design to \n     produce a safer product. In Drayton the defendant was allowed \n     to argue in defense and mitigation that its management was \n     new, that it had learned from its prior claims and litigation \n     experience and that it had purged the enterprise of its prior \n     egregious misconduct.\n       To open the courtroom door is often to open a school door \n     for predatory producers.\n       (3) Case of the Tip-Over Steam Vaporizer. A tip-over steam \n     vaporizer true to that ominous description was upset by a \n     little girl who tripped over the unit's electric outlet cord \n     on the way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The \n     sudden spillage of scalding water in the vaporizer's glass \n     jar severely burned the 3-year old child. The worst injuries \n     in the world are burn injuries. The cause of the catastrophe \n     was a loose-lidded top which could have been eliminated by \n     adopting any one of several accessible, safe, practical, \n     available, desirable and feasible design alternatives, such \n     as a screw-on or child guard top. The truth is that the \n     manufacturer, Hankscraft, had experienced a dozen prior \n     similar disasters. In the instant case, the little girl \n     recovered a $150,000 judgment against the heedless \n     manufacturer, impeaching the vaporizer's design because of \n     lack of screw-on or child-guard top. When the manufacturer, \n     with icy indifference to the serious risks to infant users of \n     its household product, refused to take its liability \n     carrier's advice to recall and redesign its loose-lidded \n     vaporizer, persisting in its stubborn refusal when over 100 \n     claims had been filed against it, the carrier finally balked \n     and refused to continue coverage unless the company would \n     recall and redesign. Then and\n      only then did Hankscraft stir itself to redeem and correct \n     the faulty design of its product, thereafter proudly \n     proclaiming (and I quote), ``Cover-lock top protects \n     against sudden spillage if accidentally tipped.'' Once \n     again Tort Law had to play professor and policeman and \n     teach another manufacturer that safety does not cost: It \n     pays. Under what might be called the Cost-Cost formula, \n     the manufacturer will add safety features when it comes to \n     understand that the cost of accidents is greater than the \n     cost of their prevention. The Tip-Over Steam Vaporizer \n     case is the most graphic example known to us showing that \n     corporate management can be recalled to its social \n     responsibilities by threat of stringent liability, \n     enhanced by deserved civil punishment via punitive \n     damages, and that belief in such a proposition is more \n     than an ivory tower illusion.\n       A good companion case to the Tip-Over-Steam-Vaporizer case, \n     serving the same Tort Touchstone of Deterrence, is the \n     supremely instructive Case of the Remington Mohawk 600 Rifle. \n     While a 14-year-old boy was seeking to unload one of these \n     rifles, pushing the safety to the ``off'' position as \n     required for the purpose, the rifle discharged with the \n     bullet entering the boy's father's back, leaving him \n     paralyzed and near death for a long time. The agony of his \n     guilt, his feeling that he was to blame for his father's \n     devastating injuries, pressed down on the boy's brow like a \n     crown of thorns and almost unhinged his sanity. Assiduous \n     investigation by the family's lawyer unearthed expert \n     evidence of unsafe design and construction and lax quality \n     control of the safety selector and trigger assemblies of the \n     Mohawk 600.\n       The result of the exertions of the plaintiff's lawyer, \n     deeply and redoubtedly involved in challenging the safety \n     history of the rifle model, was a capitulation by Remington \n     and an agreement to settle the father's claim (he was a \n     seasoned and successful defense trial lawyer) for $6.8 \n     million. Remington also wrote the son a letter, muting some \n     of his anguish by stating that the weapon was the whole \n     problem and that he was in no way responsible for his \n     father's injuries. Then, facing the threat of cancelled \n     coverage from its carriers for skyrocketing premiums in the \n     projection of other multimillion dollar awards, Remington \n     commendably served the public interest by announcing the \n     recall campaign in which we see another electrifying example \n     of Tort Law litigating another hazardous product feature from \n     the market.\n       Remington's nationwide recall program affected 200,000 \n     firearms; notices in newspapers and magazines similar to this \n     one that appeared in the January 1979 issue of Field and \n     Stream cut back on the harvest of hurt and heartbreak: \n     ``IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO OWNERS OF REMINGTON MODEL 600 and 660 \n     RIFLES, MOHAWK 600 RIFLES, AND XP-100 PISTOLS. Under certain \n     unusual circumstances, the safety selector and trigger of \n     these firearms could be manipulated in a way that could \n     result in accidental discharge. The installation of a new \n     trigger assembly will remedy this situation. Remington is \n     therefore recalling all Model 600 rifles except those with a \n     serial number starting with an `A'. . . Remington recommends \n     that prior\n      to any further usage of guns included in the recall, they be \n     inspected and modified if necessary. [Directions are then \n     given for obtaining name and address of nearest Remington \n     Recommended Gunsmith who would perform the inspection and \n     modification service free of charge.].''\n       Tort Law forced Remington to look down the barrel and see \n     what it was up against. Once again Tort Law was the death \n     knell to excessive preventable danger.\n       For a wonderfully absorbing account of The Mohawk 600, see \n     Stuart M. Speiser's justly praised Lawsuit (Horizon Press, \n     New York, 1980) 348-55.\n       (4) Case of MER/29, the Anti-Cholesterol Drug Which Turned \n     out to Cause Cataracts. Many trial lawyers will recall the \n     prescription drug MER 29 marketed for its benign and \n     benevolent effect in lowering blood cholesterol levels and \n     treating hardening of the arteries but which turned out to \n     have an unpleasant and unbargained for effect on users, \n     [[Page S5982]]  the risk of causing cataracts. As Peter \n     DeVries recently observed, ``There is nothing like a calamity \n     to help us fight our troubles.'' Blatant fraud and \n     suppression of evidence from animal experiments were proved \n     on the manufacturer's part in the marketing of this dangerous \n     drug. Who did more--the federal government or private trial \n     lawyers--in getting this dangerous drug off the market and \n     compensating the numerous victims left in its wake? The \n     question carries its own answer. The United States drug \n     industry has annual sales of 16 billion dollars per year, \n     while the Food and Drug Administration has an annual budget \n     of 65 million dollars to oversee all drug manufacture, \n     production and safety. How can the foothills keep the Alps \n     under surveillance? Worse, as shown by the MER/29 experience, \n     enforcement of the law in that situation, far from being \n     vigorous and vigilant, was lame, limp and lackluster. It was \n     only private suits advanced by trial lawyers that furnished \n     the real muscle of enforcement and sanction, compensation for \n     victims, deterrence of wrongdoing, and discouragement of \n     corporate attitudes toward the public recalling that \n     attributed to Commodore Vanderbilt.\n       As to the indispensible role and mission of the trial \n     lawyer in Suing for Safety, it should not be overlooked that \n     the current Administration has moved to sharply restrict the \n     regulation of product safety by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission. The 1982 Budget for the commission was reduced by \n     30 percent in the first round of Reagan Administration budget \n     cuts and is marked for further cuts in the future.\n       As the Thalidomide, MER/29, Dalkon Shield, Asbestos, DES, \n     Slip-into-Reverse Transmissions and Fuel Tank scandals have \n     been starkly revealed, we have crime in the suites as well as \n     crime in the streets. Corporate culpability calls for \n     corporate accountability, and our society has developed no \n     better instrument to encourage socially responsible corporate \n     behavior than the vehicle of adverse judgments beefed up by \n     punitive damages. In the MER/29 situation, for example, the \n     criminal fines levied on the corporate producer and its \n     executives were slap-on-the-wrist trivial when contrasted \n     with the deterrent impact of punitive damage awards in \n     current uncrashworthiness cases where flagrant corporate \n     indifference to public safety was established.\n       Our leading scholar in the field of punitive damages, \n     writing with verve and virtuosity on that subject, concluded \n     in 1976 that punitive damages awards should be permitted in \n     appropriate products liability cases. Writing in 1982 with \n     the same unbeatable authority, Professor David G. Owen traces \n     the ferment and developments of doctrine in the ensuing years \n     and then delivers a conclusion informed by exhaustive \n     research, seasoned reflection, and an obvious morality of \n     mind. ``I remain convinced of the need to retain this tool of \n     legal control over corporate abuses. . . .''\n       (5) Case of the Infant Who Died from Drinking Toxic \n     Furniture Polish Where Manufacturer Failed to Warn Mother to \n     Keep Toxic Product out of Reach of Children. This is the \n     celebrated case of Spruill v. Boyle-Midway, Inc., in which a \n     14-month old child reached over from his crib and pulled a \n     doily off a bureau, causing a bottle of Old English Red Oil \n     Furniture Polish, manufactured by the defendant, to fall into \n     the toddler's crib. During the few minutes his mother was out \n     of the room, the baby got the cap off the bottle and drank a \n     little bit of the polish. He was dead within two days of \n     resulting chemical pneumonia. The bottle had a separate \n     warning about combustibility in letters \\1/8\\ inch high, but \n     only in the midst of other text entitled ``Directions'' in \n     letters \\1/32\\ inch high did it say ``contains refined \n     petroleum distillates. May be harmful if swallowed, \n     especially by children.'' The mother testified that she saw \n     the warning about combustibility but did not read the \n     directions because she knew how to use furniture polish. In a \n     negligence action against the maker, the jury found that both \n     defendant and the baby's mother were negligent and awarded \n     wrongful death damages to the child's father and siblings but \n     not to the mother. The Fourth Circuit in keeping with the \n     grain of modern authority held that it was irrelevant that \n     the child's ingestion of the toxic polish was an unintended \n     use of the product. The jury could properly find that in the \n     absence of an adequate warning to the mother that she could \n     read and heed--to keep the polish out of the reach of \n     children--such misuse of the product was a foreseeable one. \n     The defect was to be tested not only by intended uses but by \n     foreseeable misuses.\n       The jury could find that the manufacturer's placement of \n     the warning was designed more to conceal than reveal, \n     especially in view of the greater prominence given the fire \n     warning \\1/8\\ of an inch compared to the Lilliputian print, \n     \\1/32\\ of an inch, as to the contents containing ``refined \n     petroleum distillates''. The poison warning could be found to \n     fall short of what was required to convey to the average \n     person the dangerous nature of this household product. The \n     label suggested that harm from drinking the polish was not \n     certain but merely possible, while experts on both sides \n     agreed that a single teaspoon would be lethal to children.\n       The warning in short could properly be found to be \n     inadequate--too soft, mispositioned and not sufficiently eye \n     arresting. Defendant admitted in answer to interrogatories \n     that it knew of 32 prior cases of poisoning from ingestion of \n     its ``Old English Red Polish.''\n       Did the imposition of liability in this seminal Spruill \n     case supra stimulate, goad or spur the manufacturer to take \n     safety measures against the foreseeable risk of ingestion by \n     innocent children? A trip to the local hardware store a \n     couple of days ago reveals that Old English Red Oil Polish \n     now sports the following on its label: ``DANGER HARMFUL OR \n     FATAL IF SWALLOWED. COMBUSTIBLE. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF \n     CHILDREN. SAFETY CAP.''\n       An error is not a mistake unless you refuse to correct it.\n       (6) Case Holding Manufacturer of PAM (Intended to Keep Food \n     from Sticking to Cooking Surfaces) Liable for Death of Teen-\n     Ager from Inhalation of PAM's Concentrated Vapors. Harless v. \n     Boyle Midway Div. of Amer. Home Products, involved an \n     increasing number of teenagers who were dying of a ``glue-\n     sniffing syndrome,'' inhaling the concentrated vapors of PAM, \n     a household product intended to keep food from sticking to \n     cooking surfaces. Originally, the manufacturer used only a \n     soft warning on the can's label: ``Avoid direct inhalation of \n     concentrated vapors. Keep out of the reach of children.'' \n     However, to the knowledge of defendant, the children \n     continued sniffing and dying. Then the manufacturer, as an \n     increasing number of lawsuits were pressed upon it for the \n     preventable deaths of such children, changed the warning on \n     its label, shifting to a harder warning: ``CAUTION: Use only \n     as directed, intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating \n     and inhaling the contents can be fatal.'' This was, of \n     course, a much harder and more emphatic warning. The Fifth \n     Circuit held that it was reversible error to exclude \n     plaintiff's evidence (in an action for the wrongful death of \n     a PAM-sniffing 14-year-old) that no deaths had occurred from \n     PAM sniffing after the defendant had hardened its warning by \n     warning against the danger of death, the ultimate trauma.\n       On remand the jury brought in a verdict for the boy's \n     estate in the amount of $585,000 with an additional finding \n     by the jury that the lad's administrator was entitled to an \n     award of punitive damages. Prior to the punitive damages \n     suit, the case was settled for a total of $1.25 million. It \n     was uncontested that prior to the lad's death the \n     manufacturer knew of 45 inhalation deaths from foreseeable \n     misuse of its product, and upon remand admitted to an \n     additional 68 from the same expectable cause.\n       If you will examine the label on the can of PAM on your \n     shelf, as the writer has just done, you will find: ``WARNING \n     USE ONLY AS DIRECTED, INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY DELIBERATELY \n     CONCENTRATING AND INHALING THE CONTENTS CAN BE HARMFUL OR \n     FATAL.'' Once again the pressures of\n      liability, stimulated a producer to avoid excessive \n     preventable dangers in its product's use by strengthening \n     its warning label, thereby enhancing consumer protection.\n       (7) Case of the Poisonous Insecticide Holding That Warnings \n     Must Contain Appropriate Symbols, Such as Skull and \n     Crossbones, Where Manufacturer Knows That Product May Be Used \n     by Illiterate Workers (Spanish-Speaking Imported Puerto Rican \n     Laborers) Who Would Not Understand English. This is the \n     salutary holding in the celebrated case of Hubbard-Hall Chem. \n     Co. v. Silverman. The First Circuit upheld judgments entered \n     on jury verdicts for the wrongful death of two illiterate \n     migrant farm workers who were imported by a Massachusetts \n     tobacco farmer and killed by contact with a highly toxic \n     insecticide manufactured and distributed by defendant. Even \n     though the comprehensive and detailed danger warnings on the \n     sacks fully complied with label requirements of the \n     Department of Agriculture, the jury could properly find that \n     because of the lack of a skull or crossbones or other \n     comparable symbols the warning was inadequate. Use of the \n     admittedly dangerous product by persons who were of limited \n     education and reading ability was within the range of \n     apprehension of the manufacturer. While evidence of \n     compliance with governmental regulations was admissible, it \n     was not decisive. Governmental standards are ``minimums,'' a \n     floor not a ceiling, and so far as adequate precautions are \n     concerned, federal regulations do not oust the possibly \n     higher common-law standards of the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts.\n       The steady, unflagging pressures of litigation against the \n     inertia, complacency and moral obtuseness of manufacturers \n     have not only resulted in enhanced safety in the field of \n     conscious design choices (substituting child-guard screw-on \n     tops on tip-over steam vaporizers or over-the-axle fuel tanks \n     for those mispositioned more vulnerably in front of the axle \n     or adding rear-view mirrors to blind behemothic earth-moving \n     machines whose design obstructs the vision of a reversing \n     operator, etc.) but also in inducing product suppliers to \n     reduce marketing defects in the products they sell by \n     strengthening the adequacy of the instructions and warnings \n     that accompany their products set afloat in the stream of \n     commerce.\n       The net affect of such benign and beneficial litigation has \n     been to improve the adequacy and efficacy of the educational \n     information given to consumers by producers via improvements \n     in the conspicuousness of warnings given; making them more \n     prominent, eye-arresting, comprehensive, complete and \n     emphatic; placing the warnings in more effective locations; \n     avoiding ambiguous warnings; extending warnings to the safe \n     disposition of the product; and avoiding any dilution of the \n     warnings given. In short, the \n     [[Page S5983]]  bottom line, as indicated in the cited \n     representative sampling of cases, is that successful lawsuits \n     operate as safety incentives to ``inspire'' product suppliers \n     to furnish instructions and warnings that are in ratio to the \n     risk and in proportion to the perils attending foreseeable \n     uses of the marketed products.\n       Here, too, we see the conspicuous usefulness of the lawsuit \n     as the weapon for ferreting out marketing defects, whether \n     ingenious or ingenuous, in selling dangerously defective \n     products.\n       (8) Case of Marketing Carbon Tetrochloride Using Warnings \n     Found to Be Inadequate Because Inconspicuous. Suppose a \n     defendant sells carbon tetrachloride and places on all four \n     sides of the can, in large letters, the words ``Safety \n     Kleen,'' and then uses small letters (Lilliputian print) to \n     warn of the serious risk of using the cleaning fluid in an \n     unventilated place for places the fine print warning only on \n     the bottom of the can). It requires no tongue of prophecy to \n     predict that this warning will be found inadequate because \n     too inconspicuous. It was so held in Maize v. Atlantic \n     Refining Co. Not only was the warning inadequate because not \n     conspicuous enough, but the representation of safety \n     (``Safety Kleen'') operated to dilute, weaken, and counteract \n     the warning. Moreover in Tampa Drug Co. v. Wait, the court \n     upheld a judgment for the wrongful death of a 38-year-old \n     husband who died from carbon tetrachloride poisoning after \n     using a jug of the product to clean the floors of his home. \n     While the label warned that the vapor from the liquid was \n     harmful and that prolonged breathing of it or repeated \n     contact with the skin should be avoided and that the product \n     should only be used in well ventilated areas, the court with \n     laser-beam accuracy ruled that the warning nonetheless could \n     be found inadequate because of its failure to warn with \n     qualitative sufficiency as to deadly effects or fatal \n     potentialities which might follow from exposure to its fumes.\n       Decisions such as Maize and Wait supra were the prologue \n     and predicate for the action taken by the FDA in 1970, under \n     the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, to ban and outlaw \n     carbon tetrachloride.\n       Torts archivists know that successful private lawsuits to \n     recover for harm from products simply too dangerous to be \n     sold at all, regardless of the completeness or urgency of the \n     warning given, frequently lead to a recall and reformulation \n     of the product's design or to a decision to ban the product \n     from the market. Life and limb are too important to trade off \n     against unmarketed inventory.\n       (9) Case of the 8-Year-Old Boy Who Choked to Death from \n     Strangling on a Quarter-Inch Rubber Rivet, Part of a Riviton \n     Toy Kit Given Him for Christmas. This case will indeed rivet \n     the attention (in the sense of attract, fasten and hold) of \n     concerned citizens who wish to understand how the threat of \n     liability operates as a spur to safety on the part of product \n     producers. The present example involves a toymaker whose work \n     is indeed ``child's play.''\n       Parker Brothers, a General Mills subsidary headquartered \n     some 18 miles north of Boston, had big plans for Riviton. \n     This was a toy kit consisting of plastic parts, rubber rivets \n     and a riveting tool with which overjoyed children could put \n     together anything from a windmill to an airplane. In the \n     first year on the market in 1977, the Riviton set seemed on \n     its way to becoming one of those classic toys that parents \n     will buy everlastingly. However, one of the 450,000 Riviton \n     sets bought in 1977 ended up under the Christmas tree of an \n     8-year-old boy in Menomonee Falls, Wis. He played with it \n     daily for three weeks. Then he put one of the quarter-inch \n     long rubber rivets into his mouth and choked to death. Ten \n     months later, with Riviton sales well on their way to an \n     expected $8.5 million for the year, a second child strangled \n     on a rivet.\n       What should the company do? Just shrug off the two fatal \n     child strangulations, ascribe the deaths to freakish \n     mischance, try to shift the blame to parental failure to \n     supervise and police their children at play, or assign \n     responsibility to the child's abnormal misuse or abuse of \n     their product? Could not the company cap its disavowal of \n     responsibility by a bormidic disclaimer that, ``After all, \n     peanuts are the greatest cause of strangulation among \n     children and nobody advocates the banning of the peanut.''?\n       However, as manufacturers, Parker Brothers well knew that \n     they would be held liable to an expert's skill and knowledge \n     in the particular business of toymaking and were bound to \n     keep reasonably abreast of scientific knowledge, discoveries \n     and hazards associated with toys in their expectable \n     environment of use by unsupervised children in the home. The \n     toymaker knew that the Riviton set must be so designed and \n     accompanied by proper instructions and warnings that its \n     parts would be reasonably safe for purposes for which it was \n     intended but also for other uses which, in the hands of the \n     inexperienced, impulsive and artless children, were \n     reasonably foreseeable. When you manufacture for children, \n     you produce for the improvident, the impetuous, the \n     irresponsible. As a seasoned judge put it: ``The concept of a \n     prudent child, God forbid, is a grotesque combination.'' Much \n     must be expected from children not to be anticipated when you \n     are dealing with adults, especially the propensity of \n     children to put dangerous or toxic or air-stopping objects \n     into their mouths. The motto of childhood seems to be: ``When \n     in doubt, eat it.'' Knowledge of such childish propensity is \n     imputed to all manufacturers who produce products, especially \n     toys, which are intended for the use of or exposure to \n     children. Cases abound to document this axiom.\n       Recently, Wham-O Manufacturing Co. of San Gabriel, Calif., \n     voluntarily recalled its Water Wiggle, a garden hose \n     attachment that drowned a child when it jammed in its throat. \n     Still more recently, Mattel, Inc. of Hawthorne, Calif., \n     initiated a recall of missiles fired by its Battlestar \n     Gallactica toys when a 4-year-old boy inhaled one and died. \n     The manufacturer of a ``Play Family'' set of toy figurines \n     would have been well advised to pull from the market and \n     redesign the small carved and molded figures in the toy set, \n     intended for children of the teething age. A 14-month-old \n     child swallowed one of the toy figures 1\\3/4\\\" high and \\7/\n     8\\\" in diameter, and before it could be extricated from his \n     throat at a hospital's emergency room, the child was reduced \n     to vegetable status as a result of irreversible brain damage \n     from the toy's windpipe blockage of air supply to the brain. \n     The manufacturer's dereliction of design and lack of product \n     testing were to cost it a $3.1 million jury verdict for the \n     child and his parents.\n       Against the marketing milieu and the legal setting sketched \n     above, what should be the proper response of Parker Brothers, \n     manufacturers of the Riviton toy set, when its executives \n     learned of the second child's death from strangulation on the \n     quarter-inch rubber rivet in the toy kit? Should they have \n     tried to tough it out or luck it out in the well known \n     lottery ``do nothing and wait and see''? The company was \n     sensitive not only to the constraints of the law (liability \n     follows the marketing of defective products), but also to the \n     imperatives of moral duty and social responsibility, and the \n     commercial value of an untarnished public image. Parker \n     Brothers decided to halt sales and recall the toy. As the \n     company president succinctly stated. ``Were we supposed to \n     sit back and wait for death No. 3?''\n       Business, the Frenchman observed, is a combination of war \n     and sport. Tort Law pressures business to realize how \n     profitless it may prove to war against children or to trifle \n     and jest with their safety. The commendable conduct of Parker \n     Brothers in this case is one of the most striking tributes we \n     know to the deterrent value and efficacy of Tort Law and the \n     example would make a splendid case study for the nation's \n     business schools.\n       (10) Case of the Recycling Washing Machine That Pulled out \n     a Boy's Arm. In Carcia v. Halsett. The plaintiff, an 11-year-\n     old boy, sued the owner of a coin-operated laundromat for \n     injuries inflicted while he was using one of the washing \n     machines in the launderette. He waited several minutes after \n     the machine had stopped its spin cycle before opening the \n     door to unload his clothing. As he was inserting his hand \n     into the machine a second time to remove a second handful of \n     clothes the machine suddenly recycled and started spinning, \n     entangling his arm in the clothing, causing him serious \n     resulting injuries. The evidence was clear that a common $2 \n     micro switch--feasible, desirable, long available--would have \n     prevented the accident by automatically shutting off the \n     electricity in the machine when the door was opened. The \n     reviewing court held the launderette owner strictly liable \n     for defective design because the machine lacked a necessary \n     safety device, an available micro switch. Shortly thereafter \n     the defendant obtained 12 of these micro switches and \n     installed them himself on the machines. Once again, the \n     threat of tort liability serves to deter--the prophylactic \n     purpose of Tort Law at work. The deterrent function of Tort \n     Law is not just an idea in the air; it has landing gear, has \n     come down to earth and gone to work.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The foregoing 10 cases and categories are merely random and \n     representative examples, not intended to be complete or \n     exhaustive, of the deterrent aim and effective of Tort Law in \n     the field of product failure or disappointment.\n       It needs to be emphasized that the preventive aim of Tort \n     Law is pervasive and runs like a red thread throughout the \n     entire corpus of Torts. For example, the private Tort \n     litigation system has served, continues to serve, as an \n     effective and useful therapeutic and prophylactic tool in \n     achieving better health care for our people by discouraging \n     and thereby reducing the incidence of medical mistakes, \n     mishaps and ``misadventures.'' An error does not become a \n     mistake unless you refuse to correct it. For example, \n     successful medical malpractice suits have induced hospitals \n     and doctors to introduce such safety procedures as sponge \n     counts, electrical grounding of anesthesia machines, the \n     padding of shoulder bars on operating tables, and the \n     avoidance of colorless sterilizing solutions in spinal \n     anesthesia agents. Remember, the fraudulent butchery \n     practiced on defenseless patients by the notorious Dr. John \n     Nork was not unearthed, pilloried or ended by the vigilant \n     action of hospital administrators, peer review groups, or \n     medical societies but by successful, energetically pressed \n     malpractice actions prosecuted by trial lawyers in behalf of \n     the victimized patients.\n       So we come full circle and end as we began: Accident \n     Prevention Is Better Than Accident Compensation: ``A Fence at \n     the Top of the Cliff Is Better Than an Ambulance in the \n     Valley Below.'' A successful lawsuit and the pressures of \n     stringent liability are one of the \n     [[Page S5984]]  most effective means for cutting down on \n     excessive preventable dangers in our risk-beleaguered \n     society.\n       My hero in the foregoing chronicle of good lawyering has \n     been the hard-working trial lawyer with his care, commitment \n     and concern for public safety, the civil religion of us all.\n       He more than any other professional has proved that we can \n     indeed Sue for Safety. My tribute to him is in words Raymond \n     Chandler used to salute his hero: ``Down these mean streets a \n     man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished \n     nor afraid.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think the point of the article, Mr. \nPresident, is that we really should be focusing on the issue of safety. \nWe have a magnificent record here in the United States of America with \nrespect to the safety of products, and one of the best articles I have \never seen on this is the one just printed in the Record entitled \n``Suing For Safety'' by Thomas F. Lambert. He goes down the various \ncases up until that particular point some years ago. He says:\n\n       Tort law also has a secondary, auxiliary and supportive \n     function--\n\n  In addition to compensation for the injured party.\n\n     sometimes called the deterrent or admonitory function.\n\n  He cites then the various cases that come to mind. ``Accident \nPrevention Through Successful Suits in the Products Liability Field.''\n\n       Case of the charcoal briquets causing death from carbon \n     monoxide. Liability was imposed on the manufacturer of \n     charcoal briquets for the carbon monoxide death and injury of \n     a young who used the briquets indoors . . .\n\n  They produce these in my backyard in South Carolina. The warning is:\n\n       Do not use for indoor heating or cooking unless ventilation \n     is provided for exhausting fumes to outside. Toxic fumes may \n     accumulate and cause death.\n\n  That is exactly what happened in that case.\n  So we have hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands, of individuals \nthat have been saved from death by this one particular case. \nSpecifically, the Moore versus Jewel Tea Co., where ``a 48-year-old \nhousewife suffered total blindness from a Drano can * * *'' They had an \nimperfect screw on top of the can and, of course, it came under \ntremendous pressure and the Drano exploded and caused her blindness.\n  We also have the case of the Liquid-Plumber, where in almost the same \nway injuries were reported to defendant. They reformulated its design \nto produce a safer product. ``After some 59 Liquid-Plumber injuries \nwere reported to defendant, it finally reformulated its design to \nproduce a safer product.''\n  Then you have the Tip-over Steam Vaporizor.\n  A tip-over steam vaporizer scalded a young kid who was walking and \ntripped and pulled the particular electrical cord, turning it over. The \ninsurance carrier finally balked after hundred claims, and went to the \nmanufacturer and said, ``Look, we are not going to continue coverage on \nyour company unless you have recall and redesign.'' thereafter, the \ncompany proudly proclaimed\n\n       Cover-lock top protects against sudden spillage if \n     accidentally tipped.\n\n  Once again, the tort law had to play professor and policeman and \nteach another manufacturer that safety does not cost, it pays. All this \nabout consumer cost, I am rather embarrassed to hear some of the \narguments. A companion case goes to the Remington Mohawk 600 Rifle \ncase, where when a young lad was trying to put the safety on to the off \nposition, it discharged and shot the boy's father in the back. After \npressure was brought Remington sent out this notice:\n\n       Important message to owners of Remington Model 600 and 660 \n     rifles, Mohawk 600 rifles and XP-100 pistols. Under certain \n     unusual circumstances, the safety selector and trigger of \n     these firearms could be manipulated in a way that could \n     result in accidental discharge. The installation of a new \n     trigger assembly will remedy this situation. Remington is \n     therefore recalling all Model 600 rifles except those with \n     serial numbers starting with an ``A''. . . Remington \n     recommends that prior to any further usage of guns included \n     in the recall, they be inspected and modified if necessary. \n     [Directions are then given for obtaining name and address of \n     the nearest Remington recommended gunsmith . . .\n\n  Then of course, there was MER/29, the anti-cholesterol drug which \nturned out to cause cataracts. It would cause a calamity, and blatant \nfraud was proved on the manufacturer's part when they got into the \nmanufacturer's record. In that particular case, they were manufacturing \na dangerous drug. Who did more? Did the Federal Government or private \ntrial lawyers do more in getting this dangerous drug off the market? \nThe question carries its own answer.\n  The U.S. drug industry has annual sales of $16 billion per year, \nwhile the Food and Drug Administration has an annual budget of $65 \nmillion to oversee drug manufacture safety. How can the foothills keep \nthe Alps under surveillance. Worse, as shown by the Mer/29 experience, \nenforcement of the law in that situation, far from being vigorous and \nvigilant, was lame, limp, and lackluster.\n  So it was the trial lawyers, product liability, all those who are \ntalking about consumers. We are talking about consumers, manufacturers, \nand everybody else.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission came about at that particular \ntime. That is when we instituted it. The 1982 budget, of course, under \nPresident Reagan, cut it some 30 percent. Talking about spending cuts \nin the Government, in Government spending, in cut spending.\n  Now, looking at the Dalkon shield, asbestos, DES, slip into reverse \ntransmission, fuel tank scandals--all the way down the list--and we \nfind we have crime in the suites as well as crime in the streets.\n  We have the case of the infant who died drinking toxic furniture \npolish, while the manufacturer failed to warn the mother to keep the \ntoxic product away and out of the reach of the children.\n  We have warning changes as to the foreseeable misuse: ``DANGER. \nHARMFUL OR FATAL IF SWALLOWED. COMBUSTIBLE. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF \nCHILDREN,'' and so forth. That was done.\n  Then we have the case holding the manufacturer of PAM liable for the \ndeath of a teenager from inhalation of the PAM concentrated vapors, in \nthe Harless versus Boyle-Midway Division of American Home Products \ncase.\n\n       It was uncontested that prior to the lad's death the \n     manufacturer knew of 45 inhalation deaths from the \n     foreseeable misuse of its product, and upon remand admitted \n     to an additional 68 from the same expectable cause.\n\n  In examining the label on the can of PAM on the shelf, Mr. President, \nwe have: ``WARNING: USE ONLY AS DIRECTED. INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY \nDELIBERATELY CONCENTRATING AND INHALING THE CONTENTS CAN BE HARMFUL OR \nFATAL.''\n  We go even to the language difficulties--down in the distinguished \nPresiding Officer's backyard, they speak Spanish fluently--the case of \nthe poisonous insecticide, holding that warning labels must contain \nappropriate symbols. Where they cannot read the language, at least they \nsee the symbol. For wrongful death, in the case of Hubbard-Hall \nChemical Co. versus Silverman, Puerto Rican laborers that could not \nunderstand English had to have, thereupon, the proper symbols.\n\n       The First Circuit upheld judgments entered on jury verdicts \n     for the wrongful death of two illiterate migrant farm workers \n     who were imported by a Massachusetts tobacco farmer and \n     killed by contact with a highly toxic insecticide \n     manufactured and distributed by defendant.\n\n  We see here, of course, the conspicuous usefulness of the lawsuit as \nthe weapon for ferreting out marketing defects, whether ingenious or \ningenuous, in selling dangerously defective products.\n  We have the case, Mr. President, of marketing carbon tetrachloride. \nThat was finally taken, of course, off the market by the FDA as a \nresult of this very disastrous case in Maize versus Atlantic Refining \nCo. and Tampa Drug Co. versus Wait. The court found that life and limb \nwere too important to trade off against unmarketed inventory.\n  We have the case, Mr. President, of the 8-year-old boy who choked to \ndeath in strangling on a quarter-inch rubber rivet, part of a Riviton \ntoy kit given him for Christmas. The toymaker knew that the Riviton set \nmust be so designed and accompanied by proper instructions and warnings \nthat its parts would be reasonably safe for purposes \n[[Page S5985]]  for which it was intended but also for other uses \nwhich, in the hands of the inexperienced, impulsive and artless \nchildren, were reasonably foreseeable.\n  So we had that decision. Parker Brothers decided to halt the sales \nand recall the toy. The company president, Mr. President, succinctly \nstated: ``Were we supposed to sit back and wait for death No. 3?''\n  So there is a responsible manufacturer responding to product \nliability, saving thousands of others that are buying these toys and \ngames. The commendable conduct of Parker Brothers in this case is one \nof the most striking tributes we know to the deterrent value and \nefficacy of tort law. The example would make a splendid case study for \nthe Nation's business schools.\n  The case then, Mr. President, of the recycling washing machine that \npulled out a boy's arm. He had waited for the washing machine at the \nlaundromat for several minutes after the machine had stopped the spin \ncycle before opening the door to unload the clothing. As he was \ninserting his hand into the machine a second time to remove a second \nhandful of clothes, the machine suddenly recycled and started spinning \nand tore his arm off.\n  The reviewing court held the launderette owner strictly liable for \ndefective design because the machine lacked the necessary safety \ndevice, and of course thereafter they installed what they call a \nmicroswitch, which gave safe operation.\n  I could pursue this on and on, and I should. All we have heard here \nis a sham pose of how we are, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nsponsoring this bill to save the consumer the cost, the cost of the \nproduct, the thrust recognized with the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, which has done outstanding work, and that is why this came \nabout.\n  I could go into flammable pajamas, in the textile field, in my \nparticular backyard. I visited, Mr. President, at Penney's safety \nlaboratory on the 14th floor on Lexington Avenue in downtown New York. \nI was amazed at what Penney was doing. This was years ago.\n  I went up on that floor and they had all kinds of safety tests for \nall the toys and articles going into Penney stores around the country. \nThat is responsible, corporate leadership. That is what product \nliability has brought about. The manufacturers and the retailers, \nPenney knows, under joint and several liability, they could be held \nliable. So they do not just take a product that appears good which they \ncan make a profit on without looking at it themselves.\n  So we have the large marketing operations like Penney's which have \ninstituted a safety laboratory. This has really saved money, and \nconsumers--I wish they could find for me the word consumer in the \nConstitution. That is all I hear about with the sham trade policy they \nhave. We are supposed to be saving the manufacturers' backbone, the \njobs in the country.\n  We just referred a little while ago to manufacturing trade. Twenty-\nfive years ago, in 1970, 10 percent of the manufactured products \nconsumed in the United States of America was represented in imports--\njust 10 percent.\n  Today, in 1995, 25 years later, over 50 percent of manufactured \nproducts consumed in the United States is represented in imports. If we \nwere back to 1970, with 90 percent of manufactured products consumed in \nthe United States produced in the United States, we would automatically \nhave 10 million more manufacturing jobs.\n  That is middle class. Those running around here wanting to do \nsomething for the middle class: We should build it, we should expand \nupon it, we should employ them, let them be able to afford a home, \nafford sending their kids to college.\n  We are going like the country of Great Britain, where they told them \nyears ago, ``Do not worry.'' Instead of a nation of brawn, we will be a \nnation of brains; instead of producing products, we will provide \nservices, a service economy. Instead of creating wealth, we are going \nto handle it and be a financial center.\n  England has gone to hell in an economic handbasket, with two classes \nof society, in exactly the way we had it here in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  When we get to product liability, we have one of the finest \ninitiatives ever to come about in law. National problem--heavens above. \nManufacturers come from the world around and gladly respond to product \nliability, bragging about their quality and safety, production.\n  That is what I have in my backyard. I see it. I talk to the Federal \njudges there. Most of them have been appointed by President Bush, \nPresident Reagan, President Nixon, President Ford --all of them.\n  They are good appointments. I am proud of them. I joined in them in \nconfirming. I know them intimately. They will say, about product \nliability--they will laugh and they say they know it is a political \nissue gotten up by Victor Schwartz, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Business Round Table, and the conference board, and \nthey run around and ask candidates for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House \nof Representatives, to commit. They use the buzzword reform.\n ``Will you help us on product liability reform?''\n\n  I would say 95 percent of those asked as candidates have never tried \nor were aware of a product liability case. The easy answer, running for \nreelection or election, be that as it may, is to solve rather than \ncreate problems. If you have large financially supportive groups like \nthe Conference Board, the Business Round Table, the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers asking you, your \nimmediate response is, ``Well, sure, yes, I am for reform.''\n  That is why we have been able to hold it up. Because the merit is on \nour side. This is a solution looking for a problem. There is not a \nnational problem in product liability. Of all civil claims in the \nUnited States of America, torts are 9 percent of all civil filings. Of \nthat 9 percent, only 4 percent of the 9,--36/100 of 1 percent--is in \nproduct liability. The States, over the past 15 years, with this issue \nraised, have all reformed--practically all--their product liability \nlaws.\n  Why change on punitive damages, now the law of 45 States, at the \nnational level? Why change that? Has anybody from the States come up \nand asked? Not a soul. The nearest they could get--and I remember \npolitically when they changed it in the Governors Conference. I was \nwaiting for the Governors because I have been a Governor. You could not \nfind a Governor coming up and saying there is a terrible problem in my \nState. Because you would have to say: Wait a minute, I am a Governor. \nWhat did I propose? What did I try to do? So they sent up the executive \nsecretary, who just rattled off some nostrums about litigation. He did \nnot even know what he was talking about.\n  They brought up other witnesses. It was an embarrassment. In the \nAlabama cases they talked of businesses suing businesses. It had \nnothing to do with product liability. The hearings that we had before \nthe Commerce Committee were an embarrassment, the way they were trying \nto get this thing on. And that is all it is and that is what is holding \nus up.\n  On the budget, we have not spent any time on the budget--serious \nnational problems. Welfare reform--serious national problems. Crime, if \nthey want to go back into the crime bill, or terrorism--serious \nnational problems. Telecommunications--serious national problems.\n  But here they come with 36/100 of 1 percent of tort claims, which \nhabitually have been held, for over 200-and-something years under the \nEnglish rule, at the State level. They are preaching, if you please, \nJeffersonian government, ``That government nearest to the people is the \nbest government'' and that is why we have to get rid of this Washington \nbureaucracy, what they call the ``corrupt, liberal welfare state.'' \nTake housing, block grants back; welfare, block grants back; crime, no \npolicemen on the beat, block grants back--everything back in block \ngrants, save this manufacturers bill. And by the way, as we enunciate \nthe rules and regulations and compliance to the users and so forth, for \nthe lawyers, let us not make them pertain or apply these to the \nmanufacturers themselves.\n  The unmitigated gall of presenting this in a serious fashion on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate is an embarrassment to this Senator. I feel \nvery keenly about it. I know I have behind me the American Bar \nAssociation. I know I \n[[Page S5986]]  have behind me the Association of State Legislatures. I \nknow I have behind me the States Attorneys General. I know I have \nbehind me the Association of State Supreme Court Justices. I know I \nhave a list of over 130 organizations that we put in there comprising, \namongst others, all the leading consumer organizations in the United \nStates. Yet they have the audacity to keep pleading here, we have to \nsave the cost to the consumer, the cost to the consumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I simply would like to inform my \ncolleagues on the status of debate. We have two amendments to the Dole \namendment that have been placed before us. One, by the Senator from \nMaine [Ms. Snowe] is identical to the amendment that was agreed to this \nmorning as an add-on to medical malpractice. I hope, and ask my \ncolleagues who are here present--I hope we can simply adopt that \namendment by a voice vote. We had a rollcall vote this morning on an \nidentical proposition. Then, after an opportunity for Members to come \nto the floor and to debate the Dorgan amendment, I intend to move to \ntable the Dorgan amendment.\n  The majority leader has said there will be votes, at least one \nadditional vote and maybe more this evening.\n  All attempts during the afternoon have been made to secure a \nunanimous-consent agreement under which we could complete the debate on \nall amendments relating to punitive damages this evening and in a brief \ntime tomorrow morning and then have a series of votes on punitive \ndamages tomorrow morning, very much like those on medical malpractice \ntoday. We have been unable to secure that unanimous-consent agreement. \nIn the absence of being able to secure it, the only way that any \nprogress can be made is by motions to table and record votes on the \namendments that are before us or are going to be in front of us.\n  So I intend at this point to yield so the Senator from Wisconsin may \nspeak, I assume on one of these subjects.\n  Immediately after he has completed speaking I will ask unanimous-\nconsent that we--I will ask we simply take a voice vote on the \namendment by the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe. And then after the \nSenator from North Dakota has an opportunity to speak on his amendment, \nwe will move to table it unless we can secure the unanimous-consent \nagreement we have been looking for.\n  I plead with our colleagues to try to do this in an orderly fashion. \nThis is not the end of the bill. We are only attempting by tomorrow to \nfinish up dealing with the subject of punitive damages.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I think the Member who \nhas been waiting here the longest time to speak is the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a second. I wonder if the \nSenator from Wisconsin can give us some idea how long he may wish to \nspeak, and then the Senator from North Dakota, I understand, wishes to \nspeak, too, on his amendment?\n  I would say before they respond, I share the views just expressed by \nthe Senator from Washington. We had thought we would have an agreement \nwhere amendments would be offered this evening and then tomorrow \nmorning we would start voting on amendments in the order they were \noffered. Apparently we cannot. Agreement has not been cleared on that \nside of the aisle.\n  We are still prepared to negotiate that agreement. That would get us \nfinished with punitive damages on any and all second-degree amendments. \nFailing that, I do not see any alternative than to stay here late \ntonight and dispose of as many amendments as we can between now and 11 \no'clock or midnight.\n  If I could just inquire of the Senator from Wisconsin how long he may \nwish?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I advise the majority leader, about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time does the Senator from North Dakota require?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had hoped we would have a lengthier \nperiod of debate for my amendment. I offered my amendment prior to a \ncouple of presentations and debate recently on the floor. I had not \nanticipated my amendment would be voted on tonight.\n  When I originally discussed this with the Senator from Washington, I \nunderstand they were at that point working on a unanimous-consent \nagreement. I do not know why that unanimous consent agreement has not \nbeen agreed to at this point.\n  But I do know that there are others who wish to speak on my \namendment. I would hope that if, however, you dispose of the Snowe \namendment, that you would provide further opportunity for some \nadditional debate. It is certainly not my intention to stretch out this \nprocess. But, by the same token, I think the Senator would admit that \nwhen you offer an amendment, they come to the floor and suggest we have \na vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. Can we vote at 8 o'clock?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have some other people who would like to speak on the \namendment. But the intention of the Senator from Kansas is to do what?\n  Mr. DOLE. My original intent was to try to get an agreement where we \ncould offer amendments tonight and vote on those tomorrow which I \nthought the Senator from North Dakota was supporting and obviously is \nsupporting. For some reason we cannot reach that. The only other \nalternative we have is to stay here and grind through the amendments \nbecause we are now on the second week on this legislation. It seems to \nme that there may be other things we want to do in the next couple of \nweeks. But I would be prepared if we can reach an agreement. I \ncertainly am not going to shut off the Senator from North Dakota. But \nif we could reach some reasonable agreement upon what time we could \nmove to table the amendment, because we are going to stay here late \ntonight, late tomorrow night, and late the next night if we cannot \nreach an agreement. We do not have any alternative. Would the Senator \nhave any indication of how much time he might need?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I might say to the majority leader, Mr. President, that I \nwould like to visit with some other Members who would like to speak on \nmy amendment. My understanding when I offered the amendment--I \ndiscussed it with the Senator from Washington--was that we were going \nto have a series of votes tomorrow morning. Apparently that has not \nmaterialized, at least in an agreement, at this point. But that was my \nunderstanding when I offered it.\n  My intention is that the proposal I have offered would eliminate the \npunitive damages cap in the underlying legislation. There will be a \nseries of proposals on punitive damages, and there already have been \nsome. And there will be others. This is probably the only opportunity \nthe Senate will have on the issue of eliminating the cap on the \nunderlying bill. I would hate to see a discussion on that issue go by \nin 15 or 20 minutes. I have spoken briefly. I know others would like to \nspeak on the same subject.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am trying to reach an agreement. You say 8 o'clock is not \nenough time. Nine o'clock? Sooner or later we will move to table, if we \ncannot reach an agreement. We do not have any other recourse. We are \nthe majority. We have to move legislation.\n  I think the Senator from Washington has a good suggestion. I think we \nwill proceed and let the Senator from Wisconsin proceed, and then I \nwill be recognized at that point either to make a tabling motion or \nreach an agreement.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair, and I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, I believe my remarks at this point are not only \nrelevant to the whole bill but in particular to the contents of the \nDole amendment and some of the contents of the further amendments of \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to respond to statements made \nduring the debate last week by the senior Senator from Washington that \nsuggests \n[[Page S5987]]  that somehow or another the arguments that this bill \nhas seventh amendment implications is somehow a bizarre argument.\n  In effect, that statement was made by the distinguished Senator from \nWashington on the opening day of this debate, on April 24, following \nthe opening remarks by the Senator from South Carolina. On April 26, \nafter my own remarks referencing the seventh amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, the Senator from Washington described references to the \nseventh amendment in this context as both curious and bizarre.\n  I note that the Senator from Washington was very careful not to \nassert that either the Senator from South Carolina or the Senator from \nWisconsin were making the argument that the pending legislation \nliterally violated the seventh amendment, but rather he stated that we \nwere ``somehow or another implicating the seventh amendment right of \ntrial by jury into this debate and thereby implied at least that the \nbill before us somehow or another restricts that constitutional right \nto trial by jury.'' That is the end of his statement.\n  Mr. President, I find the statements made by the Senator from \nWashington to be somewhat curious for two reasons:\n  First, a number of State courts have already struck down State \nstatutes imposing limitations on amount of damages that juries can \naward as violating State constitutional guarantees of a right to trial \nby jury.\n  There is nothing strange or bizarre about suggesting that such \nlimitations on the ability to recover may violate fundamental right to \ntrial by jury since a number of State courts have already made \nprecisely that determination with respect to similar State laws, and \nsimilar State constitutional provision.\n  For example, in Smith v. Department of Insurance, 507 So. 2d 1080 \n(Fla 1987) a $450,000 cap on noneconomic damager in tort actions was \nfound to violate a right of access to the courts and the right to a \ntrial by jury.\n  In Kansas Malpractice Victims Coalition v. Bell, 757 P 2d 251 (Kan \n1988), a limit on noneconomic damages and on total damages was held to \nviolate the state guarantee of right to remedy and jury trial.\n  In Sophie v. Fibreboard Corporation, 771 P. 2d 711 (Wash, 1989) a cap \non noneconomic damages in tort actions was found to violate the State \nconstitutional right to a jury trial. The Court said in the Sophie case \nthat ``[the state of Washington] has consistently looked to the jury to \ndetermine damages as a factual issue, especially in the area of \nnoneconomic damages. The jury function receives constitutional \nprotection [under the State constitution] which commands that the right \nof trial by jury shall remain inviolate''.\n  There has thus been a series of State cases holding that statutory \nlimitations quite similar to those proposed in the pending legislation \nviolate State constitutional provisions guaranteeing a right to a trial \nby jury.\n  As the Senator from Washington well knows, the seventh amendment has \nnot been held to apply to State court proceedings. Indeed, both the \nSenator from South Carolina and I have been careful not to argue that \nthe legislation violates the seventh amendment as applied to State \ncourt proceedings.\n  However, many State constitutions provide for constitutional \nguarantees for trial by jury in State court proceedings that parallel \nthe seventh amendment, and, as I have cited, a number of courts have \nheld that limitations in State laws similar to those proposed in this \nlegislation which limit the ability of a jury to award damages violate \nthe right to a trial by jury under those State constitutional \nprovisions.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the first reason it is neither bizarre nor \ninappropriate to argue about the right to trial by jury and the impact \nthis legislation may have on it. But there is a second reason, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Second, it is clear that this legislation is an assault upon the \nAmerican jury system and that is precisely what the proponents intend--\nan assault upon the American jury system.\n  Repeatedly, supporters of this legislation have asserted that it is \nneeded because of excessive jury awards in product liability and other \ntort litigation.\n  They have repeatedly argued that the legislation is necessary to curb \nAmerican juries from making these excessive awards.\n  This debate has been full of so-called examples of excessive jury \nawards, starting with the infamous McDonald coffee case.\n  In fact, this is a specious argument.\n  To the extent that jury verdicts have been excessive, courts have \nroutinely stepped in and reduced the awards, using their long-\nestablished powers of remittitur.\n  The infamous McDonald coffee case is an excellent example. The court \nthere reduced the jury award from $2.7 million to $480,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a ``Dear Colleague'' I recently \ncirculated dealing with the myth of excessive jury awards be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this legislation would not only curtail \nthe power of juries to determine the amount of punitive damages to be \nawarded; it would also prevent certain evidence relating to damages \nfrom even being presented to the jury in the first place. That has \nsomething to do with the right to trial by jury.\n  Section 107 provides that evidence relating to the punitive damages, \nfor example, evidence of willful misconduct, would be inadmissible \nduring the compensatory damages stage of the proceeding.\n  That section 107 also provides that evidence relating to a \ndefendant's wealth, which I think is clearly a relevant factor in \nassessing what level of punitive damages should be assessed, could not \nbe presented to the jury, which, in my view, is another serious \nderogation from the right to trial by jury.\n  Other proposals which may soon be added to this measure would do even \nmore of the same.\n  They would prevent juries from making punitive damages awards \nentirely, leaving those decisions not to the jury but to judges alone.\n  All of these proposals, in my view, evidence a clear and very \ndisturbing distrust of the jury system itself. And it looks to me like \na presumption somehow that juries are incapable of reaching good \ndecisions without these kinds of federally mandated restraints and \nconstraints on the jury. That is what this is--a new Federal mandate \nthat constrains and restrains juries.\n  Mr. President, as we debate whether Congress should place these kinds \nof mandates or restrictions on the deliberation of juries, it may help \nactually to take just a few moments to reflect upon the historical \nimportance placed upon the jury system in our Nation.\n  The right to a trial by jury in civil as well as criminal cases was \none of the most important rights that was sought by the framers of our \nConstitution.\n  Indeed, one of the primary grievances of the American colonists \nagainst the British was the extensive effort by the British to shift \nthe adjudication of civil and criminal disputes from the colonial \ncourts, where the local juries traditionally sat, to the vice-admiralty \ncourts and other nonjury tribunals administered by judges who were, of \ncourse, completely beholden to the British Crown.\n  So this is not something that we just came up with recently. This \ngoes back as far as our country's history to the colonial era.\n  This anger over the fact that under the British rule juries were \nbeing deprived of their authority was actually expressed in the \nDeclaration of Independence itself, which cites among the many \ngrievances lodged at the British, ``For depriving us in many cases, of \nthe benefits of Trial by Jury.''\n  Thomas Jefferson described the jury in his writings as ``the only \nanchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the \nprinciple of its Constitution.''\n  Mr. President, in the constitutional convention, the proposed \nConstitution included the right to trial by jury in criminal cases \nunder article III, but the absence of an expressed guarantee of the \nright in civil actions was condemned by the antifederalists as \nsufficient cause to reject the entire Constitution.\n   [[Page S5988]] So the entire Constitution was in some jeopardy \nbecause of that omission. And, of course, it was those kinds of \nconcerns of those who were not entirely happy with the Constitution \nitself that led to our Bill of Rights, specifically their demand for an \nexplicit guarantee for the right of a trial by jury for civil cases, \nthat led to its inclusion in the seventh amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution in our Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, it was included from the first among Madison's \nproposals for the Bill of Rights, noting ``in suits at common law, the \ntrial by jury, as one of the best securities to the right of the \npeople, ought to remain inviolate.''\n  Juries were regarded by the Framers, according to one constitutional \nscholar, Morris Arnold, in a 1980 University of Pennsylvania Law Review \narticle, ``A Historical Inquiry into the Right to Trial by Jury in \nComplex Civil Litigation,'' ``as more than a `mode of trial' they were \ninstruments of local government as well.''\n  I find that very interesting. The 104th Congress, I think, should be \ngiven the most credit on any issue perhaps so far for having dealt with \nthat whole overriding issue of unfunded mandates, of showing respect \nfor the local levels of government.\n  Mr. President, our Framers perceived the jury as one of those local \nlevels of government, one of those institutions that was made up of the \npeople back home not specifically beholden either to this Federal \nGovernment or, before the revolution, the British Crown.\n  Indeed, this view of juries as a critical element of the American \ndemocracy prompted Alexis de Tocqueville to observe in ``Democracy in \nAmerica,'' ``The jury is, above all, a political institution, and it \nmust be regarded in that light in order to be duly appreciated.''\n  More recently in our modern history, Chief Justice Rehnquist \nrecognized the historical role of the American jury in his dissenting \nopinion in Parklane Hosiery Co. versus Shore in 1979, in which our \ncurrent Chief Justice stated, ``The founders of our nation considered \nthe right of trial by jury in civil cases an important bulwark against \ntyranny and corruption, a safeguard too precious to be left to the whim \nof the sovereign.''\n  Mr. President, that is what this bill is all about today. This is the \nsovereign, the Federal Government, choosing to override the right of \nState and local juries to make the decisions about what a jury should \nbe free to do. This is exactly what Chief Justice Rehnquist must have \nmeant.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the fundamental \nimportance of trial by jury, stating in Dimmick versus Schiedt, that \n``Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance \nand occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any \nseeming curtailment to the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost care.''\n  Tort reform, particularly limits on the amount of damages that juries \nmay award, clearly implicates this right to trial by jury, as a number \nof State court decisions have held with respect to State laws and \nconstitutional guarantees to trial by jury.\n  As the Washington Supreme Court found in the Sophie case, statutory \ndamage limits interfere with the jury's traditional function to \ndetermine damages.\n  That case also contains a very instructive discussion of the \ndifference between a trial judge's power of remittitur to reduce a jury \nverdict and a statutory cap, an overall, across-the-board cap, on the \namount of damages a jury can award.\n  The court observed that the judicial finding that an award is too \nhigh in a particular case is fundamentally different from a \nlegislatively imposed ``remittitur'' that operates automatically in all \ncases without regard to the facts and justice of the case.\n  A judge implements remittitur only under well-developed \nconstitutional guidelines that provide that a judge can only reduce a \njury's damages determination when that determination was wholly \nunsupported by the evidence, obviously motivated by passion or \nprejudice, or when in certain cases it actually shocks the conscience \njust for a jury to have given such an excessive award.\n  Mr. President, absent such factors, there is a strong presumption in \nfavor of the jury's determination. And that comes to us all the way \nback from the Framers and the seventh amendment.\n  Finally, the opposing party in cases of remittitur has the choice \ngenerally of accepting the reduction or seeking a new trial. It is not \nnecessarily completely the end of the line.\n  None of these safeguards, as was observed by the court in the Sophie \ncase, is present in one of these across-the-board statutory damage \nlimits that is contemplated by the legislation before us.\n  The system of remittitur thus operates in a fashion very different \nfrom the kind of statutory caps that are being advocated by the people \nwho are presenting the so-called tort reform.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to get into an extensive debate about \nwhether or not the pending legislation violates the seventh amendment \nin practical terms, since the seventh amendment has not, to this date, \nactually been applied to the States through the 14th amendment, \nalthough it is certainly applicable, of course, to proceedings in \nFederal court.\n  It certainly, however, Mr. President, violates the spirit of the \nseventh amendment, which was intended to assure that local juries, \nlocal folks on local juries comprised of one's peers, not just \ngovernmental officials in Washington, would be the ones to makes these \ndecisions.\n  I am advised that this measure, should it be enacted, Mr. President, \nwill be challenged in court before the ink is dry, both on the basis of \nthe seventh amendment and on the basis of last week's decision in \nUnited States versus Lopez, which restricts the right of Congress to \nintrude upon areas which have been traditionally regulated by the \nStates under their own powers.\n  The decision in Lopez states that the scope of constitutional \nauthority under the interstate commerce power ``must be considered in \nlight of our dual system of government and not be extended so as to \nembrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to \nembrace them, in view of our complex society, would effectually \nobliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local \nand create a completely centralized government.''\n  Now that sounds like language, Mr. President, of the so-called \nContract With America--let us not take away the power of the States and \nthe local governments. But, in a very real sense, that is the best \ndescription of this bill I have heard.\n  Mr. President, I am one of the few Members of Congress who voted \nagainst the 1994 crime bill; in fact, one of only two Democrats to vote \nagainst the crime bill. I did it, in part, because I believe it \nrepresented an inappropriate incursion of the Federal Government into \nareas of law enforcement which had throughout our history been within \nthe province of State and local law enforcement agencies.\n  My reasons at the time were based upon policy concerns that the \nFederal Government ought to do a better job with the responsibilities \nthat clearly rested at the Federal level than seeking to usurp State \nand local law enforcement responsibilities.\n  Last week's decision, of course, by the U.S. Supreme Court adds an \neven more compelling argument to the debate.\n  Congress does need to learn to restrain itself from trying to take on \nevery problem that gets a headline in the newspaper. We need to learn \nto say that some problems are better addressed at the State and local \nlevel.\n  That is why I voted for the unfunded mandates bill, and I believe, \nMr. President, if especially the new Senators take a look at this bill, \ntort reform is clearly one of those areas that belongs with the States. \nI do not think the Federal Government knows better than the 50 States \nof this country as to what should be a law in this area.\n  There is often a great deal of rhetoric about what the Founding \nFathers might think about various contemporary problems and how our \nGovernment deals with those problems. All we can do is speculate. It \nwas 200 years ago. But every argument makes us want to know, even \nthough we cannot know for sure, what the Framers would have said.\n   [[Page S5989]] At least one of the proponents of this legislation \nargued last week that if we asked the Framers, they would not have \nwanted juries to consider medical malpractice or product liability \ncases. I do not agree with that at all. I think that would have made a \nlot of sense to them.\n  I, for one, believe that the Framers would be horrified--horrified--\nat the idea of the Federal Government passing legislation like this to \npreempt the powers of State governments, to require State courts to \nfollow Federal law in an area which has been the domain of the States \nand local governments and local juries for 200 years.\n  They would have been horrified to hear the arguments that somehow the \ncommon citizens, the average folk of this country who comprise American \njuries, are somehow out of control and that they need the Federal \nGovernment in Washington to check their powers. That is about as direct \nan offense to the folks back home as I can think of, saying they cannot \nhandle it on these juries, that they are out of control.\n  I think the American patriots who fought against the British attempts \nto take power away from colonial courts, to prevent local juries from \nrendering decisions would turn over in their graves to hear such \narguments advanced in their name and in defense of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is nothing more or less than an \nassault on the American jury system. It is predicated on a belief that \nlocal juries are not capable of rendering fair decisions. It is an \nattempt--a serious attempt--to diminish the role of juries, a role \nwhich our Framers regarded as vital to our democracy and system of \ngovernment, and I think it should be soundly rejected.\n  I just want to raise one last point that actually came out during the \nCommerce Committee hearing, and I think it is worth repeating.\n  Testifying on behalf of the Conference of Chief Justices and in \nopposition to this bill was the Honorable Stanley Feldman, the chief \njustice of the Arizona State supreme court. The chief justice pointed \nout that in many States, we have entrusted juries with virtually all \nmajor decisions, including the decision of whether or not to sentence a \ncriminal defendant to death.\n  In criminal courts, we say to the juries, here are the facts of the \ncase, here is what the prosecution claims the defendant did, here is \nthe defendant's alibi or confession and here is the doctor's \npsychiatric evaluation. We give the juries all of this information, and \nthen we ask them to make a final judgment about whether a person should \nlive or die.\n  As Chief Justice Feldman illustrated, it is almost bizarre that those \nwho believe we should entrust with juries the power to put people to \ndeath also maintain that juries are unable to objectively calculate \nwhat a reasonable punitive damage award should be.\n  I find it unfathomable that we can say that juries are qualified to \nimpose the death penalty on criminal defendants but underqualified and \nincapable to assess monetary penalties against civil defendants. I am \nafraid that says something about what our society has come to value in \nthis day and age.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, this may not literally be an issue of \nwhether the seventh amendment literally applies in this situation. It \nmay, as constitutional interpretation has done with respect to Federal \naspects of this bill. But, obviously, the right to trial by jury has to \nhave some core meaning and, at some point, if you limit what a jury can \ndo to make a person whole or you restrict the evidence a jury can hear \nto make its decision, it has to have an impact on the right to trial by \njury.\n  Maybe we have not reached that point yet in our legislation in this \ncountry, but I believe this bill takes us quite far over the line and \ndoes seriously diminish what I think most Americans would agree is \nproperly the role of the jury, not the role of the U.S. Congress.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Dear Colleague: As the debate continues around the product \n     liability bill, I wanted to address one of the many myths \n     circulating about the need for this legislation: that juries \n     are out of control and they are subject to no restraints \n     under current law. Quite simply, I believe this attack upon \n     the jury system is unwarranted.\n       For over two hundred years Americans have valued the jury \n     box as much as they have valued the ballot box. Perhaps there \n     is nothing more symbolic of or distinguishing about the \n     American judicial system--the greatest judicial system in the \n     world--than the principal of trial by jury.\n       The one distinguishing characteristic about American jurors \n     is that they have no distinguishing characteristics. A juror \n     could be the waitress that served you breakfast this morning. \n     It could be the person who delivers your mail. It could be \n     your doctor, a family member or even your favorite celebrity. \n     And we must remember that jurors today are just as capable of \n     administering fair and equal justice as were jurors in 1791, \n     the year the Seventh Amendment and the Bill of Rights were \n     ratified.\n       Unfortunately, the powerful supporters of S. 565 have run \n     an effective campaign of misinformation about jury verdicts \n     in recent months. They have tried to convince this country \n     that jurors are determined to drive American manufacturers \n     and corporations into bankruptcy. Of course, nothing could be \n     further from the truth.\n       A well-known study by Professors Michael Rustad and Thomas \n     Koening--referred to by the Supreme Court as the ``the most \n     exhaustive study'' ever on punitive damages--found only 355 \n     punitive damages awards in federal and state courts for \n     product liability cases between the years 1965-1990. Not \n     counting the cases that related to asbestos, that is an \n     average of about 10 punitive damage awards a year--hardly a \n     situation of vindictive juries running amok in America.\n       Does this mean that juries are inhuman and incapable of \n     mistakes? Does it mean that jury decisions should be absolute \n     with no checks or limits? Of course not. In fact, just last \n     year the Supreme Court affirmed in Honda Motor Company v. \n     Oberg that judges have a clear authority and obligation to \n     limit punitive damages awarded by juries. As Justice Stevens \n     wrote in his majority opinion, ``. . . judicial review of the \n     size of punitive damage awards has been a safeguard against \n     excessive verdicts for as long as punitive damages have been \n     awarded.''\n       In their study, Professors Rustad and Koening found that of \n     the 355 punitive damage awards in the past 25 years, 90 of \n     these awards--about 25 percent--were either reversed or \n     remitted by the presiding judge. Take the infamous McDonald's \n     coffee case. The jury awarded $2.7 million in that case--the \n     equivalent of two days' worth of McDonald's coffee sales. The \n     judge reduced this to $480,000 or three times the plaintiff's \n     economic damages. Judges can and do reduce these awards.\n       In short, this is reflective of a system of justice in \n     which juries prescribe appropriate sanctions against parties \n     that have been found guilty in a product liability action and \n     at the same time bestows upon judges a necessary oversight \n     role that is exercised with frequency and prudence.\n       The fundamental issue here is this: If an injured consumer \n     sues a manufacturer in a state court, who do you trust to \n     administer justice in that case--the judge and the jury, or \n     Congress?\n           Best regards,\n                                              Russell D. Feingold.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the time has come for us to put some \ncommon sense in our court system. There is no question that we must \nmake sure that every person has a right to go to court if that person \nhas been injured. But we see courts being overcrowded, we see \ndefendants having to settle because it is less expensive to settle than \nto go ahead and try a case. We have seen research, particularly in the \narea of women's health, being shut off because the drug companies and \nthe pharmaceuticals just cannot do it. They cannot do it because of the \nliabilities they are afraid they will incur.\n  This is the eighth consecutive Congress in which the Senate or the \nCommerce Committee has considered product liability. During that time, \nthe need for product liability reform has grown by leaps and bounds. A \nstudy by the Texas Public Policy Foundation found that from the early \n1980's to the early 1990's, the total number of punitive damage awards \nin Dallas County was 14 times greater and the average award, adjusted \nfor inflation, was 19 times higher.\n  In Harris County, which is Houston, total awards were up 26-fold and \nthe average award was up eightfold, and that is from a House Judiciary \nCommittee report.\n  My State of Texas and the State of California have begun to take \nsteps to control this growth. But this is all over the country. These \nthings are happening all over our country, and it is affecting the \nprice of our products and the ability to do research.\n   [[Page S5990]] In a recent letter, Robert Bork, the judge, explained \nhow product liability laws force national manufacturers to plan and \nprotect themselves against lawsuits in the most litigious States. He \nsaid a State like California or Texas can impose its views of \nappropriate product design and the penalties for falling short on \nmanufacturers and distributors across the Nation. He found this to be a \nperversion of federalism. Instead of national standards being set by \nthe National Legislature, national standards are set by the courts and \njuries of particular States. He was making the case that it is \nCongress' role at the Federal level to take control of this situation. \nIt is a matter of interstate commerce. It is something that we must \ndeal with.\n  Today, we are talking about an amendment by the majority leader--and \nI am a cosponsor of this amendment--to provide the same protection from \nexcessive punitive damage awards that this bill provides for \nmanufacturers and retailers, to civic groups, to charities, to \nchurches, and to local governments. Our courts are being misused. \nPeople who have not done anything wrong are being held up for \nsettlements, and now this applies to Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, to our \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America.\n  Congress must take control. We can lower prices, we can lower \ninsurance premiums, we can have new business starts, we can get new \nproducts and drugs on the market, we can increase jobs, and we can free \nthe people who want to volunteer to do that without fear of retribution \nby a lawsuit.\n  We can keep cities and towns from being bankrupted by lawsuits over \nplayground accidents. We can keep volunteers helping the needy by \nmaintaining a proportionality between compensatory and punitive damage \nawards in tort actions. We must expand the product liability bill to \nprotect all Americans from unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits, from \nexcessive damages for injuries they did not cause.\n  This bill, under the leadership of Senators Gorton and Rockefeller, \ngoes a long way in the right direction to try to bring these abuses to \nheel. It is time to end the judicial lottery and put common sense back \nin the courts. If we are going to do that, Mr. President, I think we \nmust apply it to the cities because, after all, it is the taxpayer who \nalways foots the bill when there is a lawsuit that gets an award that \nthe city's insurance does not cover. Who pays? You know. We all know. \nIt is the taxpayers of this country. When it is the Girl Scouts selling \ncookies and they have a frivolous lawsuit because it is just assumed \nthey would have deep pockets, who pays? It is all the good deeds and \nthe leadership qualities that Girl Scouts give that will suffer.\n  It goes on and on, Mr. President. We must take control of the \nsituation. I hope the Senate will not let this bill go by the wayside. \nI hope we do not argue and bicker so that we are not able to get a good \nbill out of this body, so that we can go to conference and work with \nthe House and send something to the President that I hope he will sign. \nIf we can do that, we will be able to reopen research that has been \nleft out of the game right now because people are just not able to \nafford to do it, because they cannot protect themselves from the \nlitigation attempts.\n  So I am hoping that we will take action so that we can open up the \nresearch capabilities and open up our playgrounds and swimming pools. \nPersonal responsibility is a new theme in America that has been \nrejuvenated from the past. I think personal responsibility is part of \nwhat we are about. We are not talking about legitimate issues of a \nperson being injured. We are not talking about the right to have \neconomic damages, some damages for pain and suffering--absolutely not. \nI have heard stories on the floor for the last week that are heart \nwrenching.\n  There is no question that some people are entitled to damages. But we \nhave to curb the excesses. We have to bring common sense back into the \nmix. That is what this bill will do. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Dole amendment so that everyone will have the same coverage as the \ncorporations do. I urge my colleagues to look at the big picture and \ntry to make the decision to get a good bill out of the Senate so that \nwe can send something to the President that I hope he will, in the name \nof responsibility, be able to sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the legislation that we are considering \ntoday has no place on the Senate floor or on the Senate calendar. This \nlegislation is a blatant attempt to eliminate over 750 years of Anglo-\nAmerican common law and to federalize over 200 years of State Tort law \nin this country.\n  I want to return power to the States, not federalize important areas \nof State control. I thought that returning power to the States was a \nmajor part of the philosophical victory of the Republican party, my \nparty, which occurred last fall.\n  Mr. President, our current legal system, based on Anglo-American law, \nhas its beginning in A.D. 1215 when the barons of England forced King \nJohn to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede. The Magna Carta placed the \nKing under the law and put limits on royal power. It also created \nremedies for many of the abuses that were occurring in England and gave \nlegal protection to the English ruling class, which was later expanded \nto all Englishmen. Following the Magna Carta other English legal \ndocuments provided for additional legal protections for British \ncitizens and the concept of rule of law.\n  Ultimately, the Magna Carta has come to stand for the proposition \nthat no man is above the law.\n  English courts, after the Magna Carta, went on to develop a system of \ncommon law to provide legal protection to all men and women, the likes \nof which the world had never seen. Common law, including all Tort law, \nis basically judge-made law. For hundreds of years English judges \ndecided cases which in turn formed the basis for future decisions.\n  Under the Magna Carta, the later laws passed by the British \nParliament, and the English common law, men were for the first time \ngiven certain basic rights in the legal system such as due process, \njury trials, and the right to cross examine witnesses.\n  Mr. President, this system of Anglo-American law was brought to our \nshores by English settlers and was adopted by our Founding Fathers when \nthey wrote the United States Constitution--the single most important \ndocument in our land. Many of the provisions of the Magna Carta \nanticipate rights that were embedded in the U.S. Constitution and \nAmerican law.\n  Our Constitution created a Federal system of Government. Under this \nsystem, that so many in this body appear to want to do away with, the \nFederal Government has certain areas of responsibilities and the States \nhave their areas of influence.\n  As early as 1648 in the Maryland Act for the Liberties of the People, \nAmerican colonists explicitly recognized that they were protected and \ngoverned by the common law. In 1774, the Declaration of Rights of the \nFirst Continental Congress stated that the ``Colonies are entitled to \nthe common law of England.'' After the American Revolution, the \ncolonies, and later the 13 States developed and adopted the common law \nto their own needs and circumstances. Common law, including Tort law, \nhas remained solely a responsibility of the States for over 200 years.\n  Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to the \ntenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the tenth amendment states \nthat:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  For over 200 years, the States have had the responsibility and a \nduty, Mr. President, to develop tort law. They have done so.\n  The bill we are considering today is the first step, I believe, in \ndestroying the States' important role in developing and administering \nrules and laws for the redress and compensation for various torts, \nincluding product liability cases.\n  In addition to eliminating over 750 years of Anglo-American common \nlaw, this bill violates the 10th amendment \n[[Page S5991]]  of our Constitution and the basic principles of \nAmerican federalism.\n  Mr. President, the States have truly served as laboratories of \ndemocracy over the last 20 years in the area of tort reform. Virtually \nevery State in the country has significantly reformed its legal system \nas it relates to product liability.\n  Where there have been problems, the States have examined their legal \nsystems and corrected the problems. As Supreme Court Justice Powell has \nstated,\n       Our 50 States have developed a complicated and effective \n     system of tort laws and where there have been problems, the \n     States have acted to fix those problems.\n  There is no current justification, I believe, Mr. President, for \nfederalizing our Nation's tort system. Under the logic of this bill, if \nwe carry it a step farther, if we federalize all product liability \ncases, why do we not federalize all civil and criminal statutes?\n  The Federal Government can usurp all State power. We know that. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, there are many in this body who see \nfederalizing product liability law and other things as a first step to \nfederalizing all legal matters.\n  This bill will substantially disrupt and may end our country's State \ncommon law system. It will result in additional litigation in both \nState and Federal courts.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will think long and hard \nbefore they go down the path toward ending federalism as we know it and \npreempting all State common law.\n  The Federal Government, including the Congress, I believe, cannot \nsolve all of our society's ills by Federal statute.\n  I find this legislation totally unacceptable, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote and work against it.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 621 to Amendment No. 617\n\n       (Purpose: To provide that a defendant may be liable for \n     certain damages if the alleged harm to a claimant is death \n     and certain damages are provided for under State law, and for \n     other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Gorton amendment \nNo. 620.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be made a second-degree amendment to the Dole amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself and Mr. \n     Heflin, proposes an amendment numbered 621.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS RELATING TO DEATH.\n\n       In any civil action in which the alleged harm to the \n     claimant is death and the applicable State law provides, or \n     has been construed to provide, for damages only punitive in \n     nature, a defendant may be liable for any such damages \n     regardless of whether a claim is asserted under this section. \n     The recovery of any such damages shall not bar a claim under \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have made statements in the past about \nthe negative effects this bill will have on State laws and federalism \nin general. Tonight, I want to be more specific.\n  My State of Alabama has a wrongful death statute whose damages are \nconstrued as only punitive in nature--yes, only punitive in nature.\n  Under the product liability bill that we are considering today in the \nSenate, along with some of the proposed amendments to this bill, people \nwho have committed or are guilty of a wrongful death in my State of \nAlabama, the damages available will be severely limited.\n  In 1852, quite a while ago, the Alabama legislature passed what is \nknown as the Alabama Homicide Act. This act permits a personal \nrepresentative to recover damages for a death caused by a wrongful act, \nomission, or negligence. For the past 140 years, the Alabama Supreme \nCourt has interpreted this statute as imposing punitive damages for any \nconduct which causes death.\n  Alabama believes that all people have equal worth in our society, so \nthe financial position of a person is not used as the measure of \ndamages in wrongful death cases in my State. The entire focus of \nAlabama's wrongful death civil action is on the cause of the death.\n  The amendment that I am offering tonight on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Heflin, will provide that in any civil action where \nthe alleged harm to the claimants is death and the applicable State law \nonly allows for punitive damages such as Alabama, the punitive damages \nprovision of this bill will not apply--in other words, of the Federal \nstatute if it were to pass.\n  Mr. President, I believe there are legitimate reasons to exclude from \ncoverage of this bill actions such as those brought under Alabama's \nwrongful death statute.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important amendment to my \nState.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Shelby amendment.\n  In all of the 50 States, Alabama has a different and unique recovery \nin the event that a decision is made by a court or jury in regard to \nthe death of an individual, whether it be brought by negligence or any \nform of action. Alabama's wrongful death statute is unlike any other \nState's wrongful death statute because its damages are punitive only. A \nperson cannot prove, in a wrongful death case in Alabama, compensatory \ndamages. An Alabama plaintiff cannot show his wages, his doctor bills, \nor anything similar of an economic or noneconomic nature. Alabama's \nstatute is very unique and different from any other State.\n  The language of the Shelby amendment was included in a number of \nprevious bills that were reported out of the Commerce Committee. In the \n102d Congress, in the bill that was reported out, S. 640, and in \nseveral bills that were reported out of the Commerce Committee on \nproduct liability previous to that, they contained the exact language \nof the pending Shelby amendment. This had been worked on, and there had \nbeen several drafts and everybody agreed that it was a proper amendment \nto be included.\n  I suppose since I have opposed the overall product liability, this \nprovision may have been taken out. What I am saying is that the \ncitizens of Alabama ought not to be at a disadvantage in regard to \nrecovery under whatever product liability bill is passed.\n  The language of this amendment was agreed to and was in previous \nbills but has been omitted from this bill. Basically, it allows for \npunitive damages as the element of damages that is allowable. A person \nis not allowed to have compensatory damages. A wrongful death statute \ndoes not allow even for the matters pertaining to loss of wages or pain \nand suffering or anything else. It is strictly a matter left to the \njury on the wrongful death issue, and has been in existence for a long \ntime. The defense bar, the plaintiff bar, have all agreed that this is \na type of damage that ought to prevail, pertaining to wrongful death in \nAlabama.\n  This concept was developed many years ago in what we know as the Lord \nCampbell Act. The Lord Campbell Act was passed because English \njurisprudence realized that a defect existed in common law in that \nthere were questions as to whether or not when someone died, that the \ncause of action survived.\n  Many States passed wrongful death statutes, and following the Lord \nCampbell Act that was passed in England, the Alabama Supreme Court a \nnumber of years ago, well over 100 years ago, interpreted that act as \nbeing punitive in nature only and compensatory damages could not be \nproved.\n  As a result, under the current language of punitive damage provisions \nin the product liability bill, unless the Shelby amendment is adopted, \nthen a person who is killed in my State in a wrongful manner could not \nrecover any damages.\n  I support the Shelby amendment. I think it ought to be adopted. I \nthink if we look back into the past history and those that have dealt \nwith it, we see that everybody at a previous time who worked on this \ncame up with an agreement language, and it is one, I think, \n[[Page S5992]]  that ought to be adopted by the Senate.\n  I want Members to check with various people involved in this, and I \nthink it is a legitimate amendment. It ought to be passed, or otherwise \nthe people in the State of Alabama will be the only State in the Nation \nthat could not recover when an individual is killed by negligence or by \ngross negligence or recklessness or wantonness or any type of proof \nthat is necessary to prove a cause of action.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 617, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 617), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, strike line 12 through line 5 on page 21, and \n     insert the following:\n\n      SEC. 107. PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) punitive damages are imposed pursuant to vague, \n     subjective, and often retrospective standards of liability, \n     and these standards vary from State to State;\n       (2) the magnitude and unpredictability of punitive damage \n     awards in civil actions have increased dramatically over the \n     last 40 years, unreasonably inflating the cost of settling \n     litigation, and discouraging socially useful and productive \n     activity;\n       (3) excessive, arbitrary, and unpredictable punitive damage \n     awards impair and burden commerce, imposing unreasonable and \n     unjustified costs on consumers, taxpayers, governmental \n     entities, large and small businesses, volunteer \n     organizations, and nonprofit entities;\n       (4) products and services originating in a State with \n     reasonable punitive damage provisions are still subject to \n     excessive punitive damage awards because claimants have an \n     economic incentive to bring suit in States in which punitive \n     damage awards are arbitrary and inadequately controlled;\n       (5) because of the national scope of the problems created \n     by excessive, arbitrary, and unpredictable punitive damage \n     awards, it is not possible for the several States to enact \n     laws that fully and effectively respond to the national \n     economic and constitutional problems created by punitive \n     damages; and\n       (6) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n     that punitive damages can produce grossly excessive, wholly \n     unreasonable, and often arbitrary punishment, and therefore \n     raise serious constitutional due process concerns.\n       (b) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, in any civil action whose subject matter affects \n     commerce brought in any Federal or State court on any theory, \n     punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable \n     State law, be awarded against a defendant only if the \n     claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that \n     the harm that is the subject of the action was the result of \n     conduct by the defendant that was either--\n       (1) specifically intended to cause harm; or\n       (2) carried out with conscious, flagrant disregard to the \n     rights or safety of others.\n       (c) Proportional Awards.--The amount of punitive damages \n     that may be awarded to a claimant in any civil action subject \n     to this section shall not exceed 2 times the sum of--\n       (1) the amount awarded to the claimant for economic loss; \n     and\n       (2) the amount awarded to the claimant for noneconomic \n     loss.\n     This subsection shall be applied by the court and the \n     application of this subsection shall not be disclosed to the \n     jury.\n       (d) Bifurcation.--At the request of any party, the trier of \n     fact shall consider in a separate proceeding whether punitive \n     damages are to be awarded and the amount of such an award. If \n     a separate proceeding is requested--\n       (1) evidence relevant only to the claim of punitive \n     damages, as determined by applicable State law, shall be \n     inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \n     compensatory damages are to be awarded; and\n       (2) evidence admissible in the punitive damages proceeding \n     may include evidence of the defendant's profits, if any, from \n     its alleged wrongdoing.\n       (e) Applicability.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States, or by any State, under any \n     law;\n       (2) create any cause of action or any right to punitive \n     damages;\n       (3) supersede or alter any Federal law;\n       (4) preempt, supersede, or alter any State law to the \n     extent that such law would further limit the availability or \n     amount of punitive damages;\n       (5) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (6) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign \n     nation; or\n       (7) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of inconvenient forum.\n       (f) Federal Cause of Action Precluded.--Nothing in this \n     section shall confer jurisdiction on the Federal district \n     courts of the United States under section 1331 or 1337 of \n     title 28, United States Code, over any civil action covered \n     under this section.\n       (g) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) The term ``claimant'' means any person who brings a \n     civil action and any person on whose behalf such an action is \n     brought. If such action is brought through or on behalf of an \n     estate, the term includes the decedent. If such action is \n     brought through or on behalf of a minor or incompetent, the \n     term includes the legal guardian of the minor or incompetent.\n       (2) The term ``clear and convincing evidence'' means that \n     measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of \n     the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth \n     of the allegations sought to be established. The level of \n     proof required to satisfy such standard shall be more than \n     that required under preponderance of the evidence, and less \n     than that required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       (3) The term ``commerce'' means commerce between or among \n     the several States, or with foreign nations.\n       (4)(A) The term ``economic loss'' means any objectively \n     verifiable monetary losses resulting from the harm suffered, \n     including past and future medical expenses, loss of past and \n     future earnings, burial costs, costs of repair or \n     replacement, costs of replacement services in the home, \n     including child care, transportation, food preparation, and \n     household care, costs of making reasonable accommodations to \n     a personal residence, loss of employment, and loss of \n     business or employment opportunities, to the extent recovery \n     for such losses is allowed under applicable State law.\n       (B) The term ``economic loss'' shall not include \n     noneconomic loss.\n       (5) The term ``harm'' means any legally cognizable wrong or \n     injury for which damages may be imposed.\n       (6)(A) The term ``noneconomic loss'' means subjective, \n     nonmonetary loss resulting from harm, including pain, \n     suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional \n     distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of \n     consortium, injury to reputation, and humiliation.\n       (B) The term ``noneconomic loss'' shall not include \n     economic loss or punitive damages.\n       (7) The term ``punitive damages'' means damages awarded \n     against any person or entity to punish such person or entity \n     or to deter such person or entity, or others, from engaging \n     in similar behavior in the future.\n       (8) The term ``State'' means any State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, and any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any of the \n     foregoing.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5976-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5992-S5993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that any votes ordered on or in relation to \nsecond-degree amendments to the Dole amendment, No. 617, occur \nbeginning at 11:15, and that the final vote in the sequence be on or in \nrelation to the Dole amendment, No. 617, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Just a moment. I reserve the right to object.\n  I mean if the final--oh, I see; in the sequence in relationship. So \nit does not mean that that is the final vote of the day or anything \nlike that?\n  Mr. DOLE. No. I wish it were.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that at the hour of 10:15 a.m. there be 1 \nhour for debate to be equally divided between the two managers for \ndiscussion on any of the pending amendments to the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I assume that, in regards to that, it is to the managers, \nbetween the managers. That means that people who are opponents to the \nvarious amendments rather than the managers would be--\n  -- [[Page S5993]] Mr. DOLE. I think that provision is set to \naccommodate the Senator from Alabama. If the Senator from West Virginia \nhas no objection, I can say to the Members in opposition----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia will do it in any way \nthat is equitable.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Why not put it that half of the time be under control of \nSenator Hollings or his designee?\n  Mr. DOLE. Would that be all right with the Senator from West \nVirginia?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That will be fine.\n  Mr. DOLE. So I modify the request, time to be equally divided between \nSenator Gorton and Senator Hollings or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that following the disposition of the Dole \namendment, as amended, if amended, Senator Thompson be recognized to \noffer an amendment to limit the bill to Federal court cases only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. So I say to my colleagues, there will be no votes tonight. \nBut anybody who has a second-degree amendment to the Dole amendment, or \nanybody who wishes to debate, we will be in session as long as that may \ntake.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides for agreeing to this request.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STENNIS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it was my honor, a unique honor and \nspecial pleasure to serve in this body as the State colleague of John \nC. Stennis for 10 years. I deeply appreciated the bond of friendship, \nrespect and trust that developed between us as we worked together to \nrepresent the interests of the State of Mississippi, and its citizens, \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  He had already established a reputation for intelligent leadership in \nthis body when I arrived here, and I considered it my good fortune to \nbe able to learn first hand from him and from his example. We were \nnever rivals. We talked almost every day. He was always friendly and \ncourteous to me, as he was with every other Senator. Although we were \nmembers of different political parties, that did not interfere with or \ndetract from our relationship.\n  Our State has had it share of demagogues, as all other States have, \nand I have deplored their excesses and have been embarrassed by them. \nBut in Senator Stennis we saw a man as pure in heart and deed with less \ninclination to inflame the passions of the voters with exaggerated and \nflamboyant rhetoric as any we have ever elected to public office, and I \nadmired him for that. He preferred to win a debate or an election on \nthe basis of the well argued evidence, rather than to prey upon the \nfears or suspicions or prejudices of the audience.\n  He was the kind of Senator I try to be.\n  During his more than 41 years of service as a U.S. Senator, he was \nsteady, conscientious and extraordinarily successful in every \nassignment and undertaking.\n  From his earliest days to his last days he gave the full measure of \nenergy and his ability to the service of this body and to his State. He \nsaw that as his duty, and he took that as seriously as anyone who has \never served here.\n  Others have recalled in their speeches the positions of \nresponsibility he held and the legislation he authored and caused to be \nadopted. There were many of each, and they are persuasive testimony to \nhis effectiveness as a Senator. I will not try to recount all of them.\n  What may not be as easily measured is the influence he had in the \nSenate by the force of his character. He was the epitome of rectitude, \nof fairness, of decorum. His selection to be the first chairman of the \nSenate's Select Committee on Standards and Conduct was an illustration \nof the view that others in the body had of him, and the confidence they \nhad in him to do what was right and just.\n  That is why he was so admired and appreciated in Mississippi. He got \nthings done that helped our State, and its people, but he was more than \nan effective Senator. He was totally honest and trustworthy.\n  Mississippi will forever honor the memory of John C. Stennis.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I am here to talk about the Medicare \nProgram. In the recent days, I have noticed all kinds of people \nexpressing deep concern for Medicare. That is comforting, because there \nis more than enough reason to be concerned.\n  Let me get right to the point. The Republican leaders in Congress, \nand the chairs of both Budget Committees in Congress, want to balance \nthe budget in 7 years. If they keep their word and leave Social \nSecurity and defense spending completely alone, that will require cuts \ntotaling $1.2 trillion.\n  If they throw in the tax cuts for top income-earners that will \nrequire another whopping $345 billion to finance those cuts. Now here's \nthe key point for anyone concerned about Medicare: as we have seen in \npapers distributed by the Senate Budget Committee itself, this drive \nfor a balanced budget--and presumably some tax cuts--will require cuts \nin Medicare to the tune of $250 to $300 billion in 7 years. Medicaid \nwill also have to help out with $160 to $190 billion in cuts.\n  The recent talk about Medicare is not really saying this. It is all \nabout the need to shore up the Medicare trust fund, because it could be \ninsolvent in 7 years. It is all about the idea of restructuring \nMedicare to save the program. The argument we are hearing is that \nMedicare has to be drained of $300 billion to save the program. A \ncurious argument.\n  Somehow, I think we need to make sure Americans, especially the 37 \nmillion senior citizens and disabled citizens who rely on Medicare, \naren't being sold a bill of goods.\n  The fact is that the terms set by the leadership on the other side of \nthe aisle--balance the budget by 2002, leave defense alone, and throw \nin some tax cuts--may require a raid on Medicare to get the job done.\n  That is why I am here.\n  My basic reaction to all this talk is to urge the Republican leaders \nto simply show us precisely what you mean. I am speaking as someone who \ncast my vote, several times, for a very precise, very specific plan to \nreduce the federal deficit by $600 billion. It included savings in \nMedicare. The 1993 budget and deficit reduction plan was based on the \nsimple concept of shared responsibility, and spread the burden fairly.\n  Along with spending cuts to reduce the deficit, it did important \nthings like expand the tax credit for working families to make sure \nwork is a better choice than welfare in this country.\n  But for all of the fire and brimstone heard this year about the need \nto balance the budget and now ``save'' the Medicare Program, we have \nyet to see a budget resolution, a budget plan, a single detail on just \nhow everyone making the noise intends to achieve these impressive \ngoals.\n  Of course, the President is reacting by saying essentially ``show \nme.'' He submitted his budget on time. He offered a health care plan \nthat tied Medicare savings to comprehensive health care reform. He \nrejected the idea of a constitution amendment on the Republicans' \nterms, and so of course, he is asking for some specifics.\n  I cannot conceive of a budget that meets the conditions of the other \nside \n[[Page S5994]]  of the aisle--stay away from Social Security, do not \ntouch defense, no new revenue, and tax cuts for corporations and the \nwealthy--without huge cuts in Medicare.\n  And make no mistake about it, $250 to $300 billion of cuts in \nMedicare will mean higher deductibles and premiums for seniors, lower \nfees for hospitals and doctors, and a lot worse. If there is such a \nbudget that can side-step Medicare, we are simply saying ``show us.'' \nWe have put our cards on the table for the past 2\\1/2\\ years when it \ncomes to health care, Medicare, and deficit reduction.\n  While all of this talk and born-again interest in Medicare's solvency \ngets sorted out, I am here to lay out proposals that I think are \nbottom-line ways to act in the best interests of Medicare. I do this as \nsomeone who has tried to protect Medicare for a long time, and will \nkeep fighting to do exactly that. I do this as the former chair of the \nMedicare Subcommittee on the Finance Committee, and now the ranking \nmember--the majority leader is the chairman of that subcommittee now.\n  I do this as someone who smells a rat when the same people who have \ntalked for months about stepping up to the plate, with specifics on how \nthe budget can be balanced by 2002 with tax cuts thrown in and defense \noff the table, but now suggest that the $300 million in Medicare cuts \nthey are talking about is their new plan for saving Medicare. Something \nis not quite right about this picture, I suggest. I agree that Medicare \nhas to be put on better financial footing. But that effort should not \nbe a smokescreen for using it to finance other agendas like tax cuts \nfor corporations.\n  First, I am introducing legislation to create a National Commission \non Medicare modeled after the National Commission on Social Security \nReform that President Reagan chartered in 1981.\n  The charge given to the Social Security Commission was to propose \n``realistic, long-term reforms to put Social Security back on a sound \nfinancial footing; and to forge a working bipartisan consensus so that \nthe necessary reforms can be passed into law.''\n  We need this kind of bipartisan process to shore up Medicare. We need \nto jump off the current rhetorical, budget-driven track to one where we \ncan resolve the real question: how best to keep Medicare dependable for \nseniors over the next generations.\n  If Medicare is cut by unprecedented amounts of money to pay for \nanything but Medicare, the consequences will be disastrous for health \ncare providers and beneficiaries. Rural hospitals will close in droves. \nDoctors will be forced to turn away the elderly. Medicare will no \nlonger be reliable insurance for seniors in West Virginia.\n  As my second proposal, I will offer an amendment to the budget \nresolution when it comes to the Senate floor that will put Medicare in \na lock-box to protect it from looting.\n  This isn't the blueprint we need to get Medicare back on solid ground \nfor the long term, but it will buy a few more years of solvency and \nensure it will not be used for anything but the promises made to senior \ncitizens. Medicare is not a slush fund to finance tax cuts or other \nGovernment programs.\n  I will tell you why I am concerned about Medicare. I am worried its \ntrue purpose is getting lost.\n  It is a promise, a pledge, to the American people that they will be \nable to live their lives in dignity and security past their working \nyears. Instead of treating Medicare like a checking account in this \nbudget process, we need to remember it is an investment.\n  The Medicare trustees sounded the alarm about the short-term \ninsolvency of the Medicare Program more than 3 years ago.\n  In fact, the Medicare trustees urged action on comprehensive health \ncare reform to address the country's systemic problem of rising health \ncare costs that are draining the Medicare hospital trust fund and the \npockets of American families and businesses.\n  But comprehensive reform was rejected by the Congress last year. I \nshould note that up until very recently, the Medicare Program \noutperformed the private sector in holding down its costs. Over the \npast 2 years, Medicare costs have been slightly higher than the private \nsector costs.\n  But, and this is a big ``but,'' the private sector is insuring fewer \nand fewer people, while Medicare's enrollment is increasing; and \nMedicare pays for home care services and skilled nursing home care, \ntypes of services that are not normally covered by private insurance \npolicies.\n  Mr. President, I have heard lots of talk about needing to move the \nMedicare Program into the 21st century by ``restructuring'' it so it \nlooks more like insurance in the private sector.\n  So far, I just cannot share in the enthusiasm for copying something \nthat is leaving out so many hard-working people and families from any \nkind of health care security. In fact, Medicare was first established \nbecause the private insurance industry had failed so miserably to \nprovide affordable insurance to senior citizens. While many of my \ncolleagues like to talk about the ``miracles of the marketplace,'' I \nstill see cherry-picking and redlining, medical underwriting and policy \ncancellations, job-lock, and families paying more and more money for \nfewer and fewer health benefits.\n  Just think about sending 37 million people with pre-existing medical \nconditions to the private insurance market with vouchers called choice-\nclerk and medi-check. High administrative costs in the private sector \nwill eat up the value of Medicare benefits right off the bat. Will the \nsenior citizens living in small towns across West Virginia end up \npaying more of their own money for their health care or be forced to \njoin an HMO--if one is even available in the area?\n  To ``save'' Medicare we need comprehensive proposals to address these \nissues, not just blind cutting of Medicare. Last year, we offered \nproposals to fix these myriad problems. Republicans disagreed with our \napproach, and celebrated the defeat of our proposals. Our opponents' \ntelevision ads stated again and again that there's ``a better way.'' \nSlashing $250 to $300 billion out of Medicare is not a better way.\n  Mr. President, cutting $250 billion out of Medicare over 7 years is \nnot the way to guarantee the long-term solvency of the Medicare \nHospital Trust Fund. It might add a few more years of solvency--5 to 8 \ntops, CBO thinks--to the trust fund. We need to rise to the challenge \nmet when Medicare was created and Social Security was rescued, and \nchart a long-term prescription for Medicare's health over the next 25 \nyears of more.\n  I make my two suggestions as a way to get started.\n  Protect Medicare from raids to pay for anything, especially tax cuts, \nbut what its intended for--the promise of health care security for the \nseniors of West Virginia and the country. And while we know Medicare is \nsafe, let us replicate the approach used to save Social Security and \nreally prepared Medicare for the challenges of the next century.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself and Mr. \n     Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 622 to amendment No. \n     617.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 23, strike ``loss.'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof: ``loss;\n\n     ``except that if the award is against an individual whose net \n     worth does not exceed $500,000 or against an owner of an \n     unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, \n     association, unit of local government, or organization which \n     has fewer than twenty-five full-time employees, that amount \n     shall not exceed $250,000.''\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Abraham and myself. It really is an amendment that is a small \nbusiness amendment.\n  I expressed yesterday on the floor a concern, a twofold concern: One, \nthat we make sure that the cap was sufficiently high so that larger \nbusinesses would in fact be deterred by the proper awards juries would \nmake in regard to punitive damages, and that we not lose that deterrent \neffect; but I also expressed a concern that small business not be \nunduly penalized by punitive damages.\n  I have talked to small business men and women throughout Ohio who do \nhave this very legitimate concern and who really live in fear literally \nevery day of something happening where they would have a huge award \nthat would literally put them out of business; that what would become a \npunitive damage award which, for a big business, might, in fact, be a \ndeterrent, might, in fact, be for a small business actually the death \npenalty.\n  This particular amendment provides an exception for small business. \nAnd small business is defined in the amendment as any business that has \n25 or fewer employees or has a net worth of not over one-half million \ndollars. If this amendment is agreed to, a punitive damage award could \nnot exceed $250,000.\n  I think this amendment makes a great deal of sense. I think it will \ntake care of one of the problems that we have today, a problem \nexpressed to me many, many times by small business.\n  I hope that tomorrow it will, in fact, be adopted.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside for the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 623 to Amendment No. 617\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 623 to amendment No. 617.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4 line 11 strike the semicolon after the word \n     ``awarded'' through line 15 and insert a period.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment will, I believe, clean up \nthe bill and it will finish a process that was begun several days ago. \nThat was a concern that I expressed on the floor yesterday in regard to \nthe way the bill was originally drafted, which said that juries no \nlonger could consider the assets that a corporation had when that jury \nmade its decision about what was the appropriate level of punitive \ndamages.\n  As I indicated yesterday, that type of preemption of State law makes \nabsolutely no sense because punitive damages have always been intended \nto do basically two things: One, to serve as punishment and, second, to \nserve as a legitimate deterrent.\n  A jury cannot make that determination unless the jury knows all the \nfacts. One of the pertinent facts has to be what the assets of the \ncorporation might be, and other relevant financial information.\n  The danger of the way the bill was written was not only that we might \nlose that deterrent effect. Because a jury would not really know what \nassets the company had, it might have just the opposite effect. You \nmight have a jury assuming that a company had a great deal of assets \nand the company did not have those assets. The jury then would make a \ndisproportionate award. And so it could hurt really on both sides.\n  What this amendment does is really complete the process that was \nstarted several days ago, by providing and taking out of the bill that \npreemption. So if this amendment would be passed, we would be back to \nwhere we were before in regard to what juries could consider in regard \nto making their decision about punitive damages; namely, we would be \nback to State law, which I think is where we need to go.\n  So, in this case, I hope that tomorrow, when we vote on this \nparticular amendment, we will agree to it. I think it is only equitable \nand fair. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5994-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, the Op-Ed page of Friday's Washington \nPost featured an irresistible account by Philip Geyelin, ``When I \nDanced With Ginger Rogers.'' The occasion was the Gridiron Club dinner \nof March 28, 1981. With the advent of Ronald Reagan's presidency \n``Hooray for Hollywood'' was the evening's theme, and Miss Rogers its \nmost illustrious guest. It happens I was the Democratic speaker that \nevening, and I had the inexpressible joy of sitting next to Miss Rogers \nat the head table in my white tie and tails. I took the liberty of \nexpounding, as best I was able, Professor Joseph Reed's theory of the \ndramatic import of Miss Rogers' abrupt decision to dance with Astaire \non that lovely day they were caught in the raid in Regents Park. She \nconfided to me that she had to slip off to dance, that night, with \nGeyelin. She returned to pronounce him divine!\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the above \ncited article be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 28, 1995]\n\n                    When I Danced With Ginger Rogers\n\n                          (By Philip Geyelin)\n\n       That was a nice piece Tom Shales wrote about Ginger Rogers \n     [Style, April 26]. He had it just right, except maybe the \n     part about how she made it look effortless but ``not for a \n     minute did it look easy.'' I would have put it the other way \n     around: It wasn't exactly effortless for me when I danced \n     with Ginger Rogers, but she certainly made it look easy.\n       You heard me: When I danced with Ginger Rogers. I am not \n     dreaming this up. Rather, I'm setting out to describe the \n     realization of a dream of, oh, let's say close to a half-\n     century. From the first time I saw a Fred Astaire-Ginger \n     Rogers movie, I had nurtured the fantasy. And then, \n     unbelievably, there I was 14 years ago standing on stage with \n     Ginger, before an audience of more than 600 swells, waiting \n     for the beat that would send us gliding off to the music of \n     ``Isn't This a Lovely Day.''\n       It was March 28, 1981, at the spring dinner of what The \n     Post's Style section describes with relentless redundancy as \n     the ``exclusive Gridiron Club.'' By ``swells'' I mean that \n     when you peer across the footlights on these occasions, you \n     dimly see a head table that starts with the president and the \n     vice president and their wives, most of the Cabinet, maybe \n     three justices of the Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs and a \n     gaggle of ambassadors. The ballroom is wall-to-wall \n     governors, members of Congress, CEOs, TV talking heads, other \n     assorted celebrities and the publishers and editors of the \n     newspapers whose Washington correspondent make up the \n     Gridiron Club's membership.\n       So much for the setting. A dance story should be taken step \n     by step. It was the first year of Ronald Reagan's presidency. \n     A Hollywood touch was in order. An invitation was extended to \n     Ms. Rogers through the good offices of Godfrey ``Budge'' \n     Sperling Jr. of the Christian Science Monitor. She not only \n     accepted but agreed in principle, to a surprise appearance on \n     stage. In my capacity that year as music chairman (producer), \n     I was in a position to claim the right to be Ms. Roger's \n     partner if there was to be any dancing. I did so at the cost \n     of what may be the earliest onset of stage fright ever \n     experienced by anybody.\n       The plot was that Ms. Rogers, who was seated at the head \n     table, would actually proceed directly backstage and appear \n     in the opening number of the show, which, in another bow to \n     the Gipper, was to the tune of ``Hooray for Hollywood.'' The \n     cue for her to step from the wings would be the line: \n     ``Hooray for Fred Astaire--Miss Ginger Rogers made him walk \n     on air''--whereupon there she would be, the real thing, at \n     the microphone, singing a satiric put-down of the Gridirons: \n     ``Isn't this a lovely way, to be meeting the press ...?''\n       Not bad, showbizwise, wouldn't you say--for amateurs? With \n     only mild trepidation, I called Ms. Rogers. I told her my \n     name was of French origin. She said her favorite husband was \n     French. It was going well. Then I got to the part of the \n     briefing that had to do with ``Hooray for Fred Astaire,'' and \n     the stories that she didn't much like running as an entry \n     turned out to have some truth to them. ``Let's stop right \n     there,'' she said. While I was mumbling my confusion she cut \n     in to make her meaning clear. ``If you were Abbott,'' she \n     asked, ``would you want people to be always asking. `How's \n     Costello'''? The mention of Astaire, I said quickly, will be \n     excised.\n       She arrived in Washington the Friday night before the \n     dinner, and on Saturday I sent flowers to her room, thinking \n     that to be the Hollywood way, with the lyric tucked in among \n     them. At an appointed hour we met, and she handed me the \n     lyric with some pencil editing. Recklessly, I questioned \n     whether her changes would scan, noting modestly that, while I \n     was tone deaf and usually urged when singing as a member of \n     the chorus not to get too close to the microphone, I did have \n     some experience as a lyric writer.\n       ``Honey,'' Ms. Rogers replied gently, with no hint of any \n     awareness of what that salutation meant to me, ``I've been \n     singing that song longer than you've been writing lyrics for \n     the Gridiron Club.''\n       With only three hours to go before curtain, we repaired to \n     the empty ballroom, where a piano player and the club's dance \n     director put us briefly through what were, mercifully, pretty \n     elementary paces. We parted to change for dinner, she to a \n     ball gown, me to--you guessed it--white tie and tails.\n       We met again backstage and warmed up with a few practice \n     twirls. Her introduction went precisely as planned; the song \n     was a smash. We were perfectly poised to begin the dance, but \n     somehow, with a full orchestra, the bar of music that was our \n     cue didn't come through. I froze. Now, I'm not saying Ms. \n     Rogers also missed it. But she knew what to do. Stepping to \n     the mike, she said: ``Let's try that again--We only had 20 \n     minutes to rehearse.''\n       The second effort was--how shall I put it?--pretty close to \n     perfection, or at least relatively close. Things are relative \n     when you have been contemplating the real possibility of \n     stumbling off stage into the orchestra pit and taking Ginger \n     Rogers with you.\n       My sigh of relief, however, was cut short. Ms. Rogers, was \n     back at the microphone. ``Let's see,'' she was saying, ``if \n     this guy can do it one more time.'' I did, or I should say \n     that we did. She was then 69, but to dance with she was going \n     on twenty-something, and she made it easy--so much so that \n     when she graciously consented to stay over for the usual \n     Sunday afternoon reprise of the Saturday night show, it was \n     becoming very nearly effortless.\n       A few years later, she sent a message saying she was \n     writing her memoirs and would appreciate a memorandum on some \n     of the details of that night at the Gridiron. Ignoring my \n     effusions on what the evening had meant to me, she wrote in \n     her book that the dance ``had brought the house down but not \n     because of me; the audience couldn't get over Mr. Geyelin's \n     dancing.''\n       A classy dividend, I thought, from a classy lady who made \n     the lifelong dream of an ink-stained wretch come true.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5996-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          CARTNEY KOCH McRAVEN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn the news last \nnight that rescue workers in Oklahoma City discovered the body of \nCartney Koch McRaven amid the rubble that once was the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building.\n  Cartney Koch McRaven was one American--not ordinary--extraordinary.\n  Cartney graduated from Spearfish High School in 1993. She enlisted in \nthe Air Force, whose members believe that the protection of freedom is \nthe highest, most important public service. With devotion and honor she \nserved her country. Her action was a tribute to the core values that \nmake this country great.\n  Cartney was only 19 years old. Newly married on April 15 to Shane \nMcRaven, a fellow airman in the U.S. Air Force. She was stationed at \nTinker Air Force Base. She had traveled to the Murrah Federal Building \nto register her new name on Federal documents. A new name. A new \nhusband. About to start a new life. A life that will never be. A life \ncut short by the savagery of domestic terrorism. By murderers who kill \ntheir fellow citizens.\n  Cartney had a beautiful life ahead of her. On behalf of the people of \nSouth Dakota, my wife Harriet and I extend our condolences to Cartney's \nfamily, friends, and loved ones.\n  For Cartney and the other victims of the Oklahoma City tragedy, we \nmust not let our commitment to freedom waiver.

Mr. President, later this month, Ralph Neas will step \ndown from his position as executive director of the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, after 14 years of extraordinary service as \na champion of the basic rights of all Americans.\n  For nearly half a century, the Leadership Conference has been the \nNation's conscience in meeting the fundamental challenge of protecting \nthe civil rights of all of us. Ralph Neas joined the Leadership \nConference in 1981, following 8 years of outstanding \n[[Page S5997]]  service to the Senate on the staffs of our former \ncolleagues, Senators Edward Brooke and David Durenberger.\n  During Ralph's tenure, the Leadership Conference fought some of its \nmost difficult battles, and achieved some of its most important \nvictories. Time and again, when the forces of reaction sought to turn \nback the clock on civil rights, Ralph Neas rallied the coalition, and \ncivil rights prevailed.\n  When the Reagan administration sought to block extension of the \nVoting Rights Act, Ralph Neas helped to put together a broad bipartisan \nmajority in Congress to renew it.\n  When the Supreme Court in the Grove City case carved a hole below the \nwaterline in laws banning discrimination in Federal programs, Ralph \nNeas played an indispensable role in developing\n the two-thirds majority needed to pass the Civil Rights Restoration \nAct of 1988 over President Reagan's veto.\n\n  When President Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme \nCourt, Ralph Neas assembled and led an extraordinary nationwide \ncoalition which successfully opposed the nomination because of Judge \nBork's hostility to protecting the constitutional rights and liberties \nof all Americans.\n  When the Supreme Court in 1989 issued a series of rulings severely \nreducing protections for job discrimination, Ralph Neas worked closely \nwith Republicans and Democrats to fashion legislation to restore the \nprotections, and after one unfortunate veto by President Bush, Congress \nenacted the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  Under Ralph Neas' leadership, we gained ground on several other \nimportant fronts during those years as well. In 1988, Congress passed \nthe Fair Housing Act Amendments to strengthen the law banning housing \ndiscrimination and extend its reach to ban discrimination against \nfamilies with children and persons with disabilities.\n  In 1990, we enacted the landmark American With Disabilities Act, \nproviding comprehensive new protection for the rights of 43 million \ndisabled Americans. Because of that law, fellow citizens across the \ncountry are finally learning that ``disabled'' does not mean \n``unable.''\n  Ralph Neas' enormous energy, and his extraordinary talents as an \nadvocate, strategist, and spokesperson, helped make each of those \nvictories possible. Now he is leaving the Leadership Conference to \npractice law and to serve as a visiting professor at Georgetown \nUniversity Law School.\n  Ralph Neas is being honored at a gala dinner tomorrow evening, when \nhe will receive the Hubert H. Humphrey Award for his outstanding \nachievements in making America a better and fairer land. Every citizen \ncommitted to the constitutional ideal of equal justice under law owes \nRalph Neas a debt of gratitude for his brilliant public service.\n  Truly, through all these years, Ralph Neas has been the 101st Senator \nfor civil rights. As he leaves the Leadership Conference, I \ncongratulate him on his outstanding accomplishments, and I extend my \nbest wishes to Ralph and his wife Katy for continuing success in the \nyears ahead.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5996-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     U.S./CUBA MIGRATION AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today President Clinton has announced the \nconclusion of a new migration agreement with the Government of Cuba. \nThis new agreement treats the more than 15,000 Cuban migrants currently \ndetained at Guantanamo in a very humane manner, while putting in place \nsafeguards to ensure that a similar flood of migrants is not encouraged \nat some future date. I want to commend the President for his decision \nto enter into, what I believe is a fair and balanced approach to \nhandling the Cuban migrant issue.\n  Under the terms of the agreement, Cuban migrants currently being \ndetained at Guantanamo will now be eligible to be paroled into the \nUnited States, provided they qualify under United States immigration \nlaws. Those paroled from Guantanamo will be counted in the annual \n20,000 migration ceiling set last September in the context of the \nresolution of last year's Cuban migration crisis. This will mean that \npeople at Guantanamo who have been in limbo since last year will now \nhave the possibility of getting on with their lives. To continue to \ndetain these people indefinitely was really inhumane, but nothing else \ncould be done for them until this new agreement was reached with the \nGovernment of Cuba.\n  In contrast to the treatment of those currently at Guantanamo, any \nfuture Cuban rafters intercepted at sea will be returned to Havana. \nCuban authorities have committed to accepting these migrants back \nwithout reprisal, and will allow for the monitoring of such individuals \nto ensure that this is the case. Obviously, any individual who might \nqualify for refugee status will be able to apply for asylum at the U.S. \nInterest Section in Havana.\n  Finally, those Cubans who may successfully evade interdiction and \nreach the United States will be subject to the same deportation \nprocedures any other alien would face upon entering the United States \nillegally.\n  Mr. President, as you know I am in profound disagreement with our \noverall policy toward Cuba. I have said many times in the past that I \nbelieve that policy is outdated and ineffective and should be altered \nto enhance communications and contacts between the Untied States and \nCuba. In my view this is the best way to facilitate the peaceful \ntransition to democracy on that island.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has not yet decided to alter the \noverall framework of our policy toward Cuba. However, I believe that \nthe agreement announced today is one step in the right direction toward \na more enlightened Cuba policy. I hope there will be many more steps in \nthat same direction in the very near future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5997-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement after \n35 years as editor-in-chief of Commentary magazine, I would like to \noffer my concurrence with the sentiments expressed in this morning's \nNew York Post, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Times honoring the \ncareer and the person of Norman Podhoretz. As a New York Post editorial \nnotes: ``the ideas advanced in Commentary--thanks to Podhoretz's \neditorial gifts--make it a forum for the key policy questions \nconfronting the Nation.'' David Brooks of the Wall Street Journal, \noffers a similar accolade:\n\n       If there is one thing Mr. Podhoretz and his magazine have \n     stood for all these years, it is the joy and value of ideas.\n\n  Thirty-four years ago, I first appeared as a contributor to \nCommentary. The article, entitled ``Bosses and Reformers,'' dealt with \nconflict within the Democratic Party--a subject still alive and well \ntoday.\n  Norman Podhoretz and Commentary have contributed much of value to \nmodern political discourse. We owe them both great thanks. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the above \ncited articles be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       [[Page S5998]] [From the Wall Street Journal, May 2, 1995]\n\n               Norman Podhoretz, Never Retiring, Retires\n\n                           (By David Brooks)\n\n       Hundreds will gather tonight in a New York hotel ballroom \n     to honor Norman Podhoretz, who is retiring after 35 years as \n     editor of Commentary. There will be toasts from Henry \n     Kissinger, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Cynthia Ozick--and if \n     the thing were done in true Commentary style, then there \n     would be rebuttals and the whole ballroom would break into \n     discussion groups, debating until morning ``The Podhoretz \n     Question.''\n       If there is one thing Mr. Podhoretz and his magazine have \n     stood for all these years, it is the joy and value of serious \n     discussion. He develop a prose style, instilled in the \n     magazine, that is decisive, clear and authoritative, the sort \n     of style that begs for response. Commentary has a letters \n     section that is rivaled in length only by Penthouse and in \n     quality by no American magazine. The monthly can be seen as \n     an effort to create an ideal community, a group of people who \n     are prone to sitting up late at the kitchen table, wrapped up \n     in discussions about politics, culture or Judaism.\n       This is the sort of community that Mr. Podhoretz entered as \n     a young man, having studied literature at Columbia and \n     Cambridge. He called it The Family, the group of New York \n     intellectuals centered around Partisan Review in the 1950s--\n     Mary McCarthy, Sidney Hook, Saul Bellow. They were on the \n     left, but anti-communist for the most part, which meant they \n     were tough-minded and disputatious, because the verbal \n     battles against American communists were like hockey games--\n     every few minutes people would throw off the gloves.\n       Mr. Podhoretz was a young star, published in the New \n     Yorker, editor of Commentary when he was 30, close friends \n     with such leading writers as Norman Mailer, James Baldwin and \n     Lionel Trilling. He drifted to the radical left in the early \n     1960s, publishing in Commentary the work of Paul Goodman, who \n     laid out what would later become the standard New Left \n     critique of American life. Mr. Podhoretz was an early \n     opponent of the war in Vietnam.\n       But as the decade wore on, he discovered that the ideas \n     that were provocative and subtle in Commentary in 1961 turned \n     dumb and platitudinous when turned into cliches by Tom Hayden \n     and the student radicals. Also, he discovered that teachings \n     about Vietnam were not the sort of serious discussions that \n     he cherished, but rather occasions for shouting down anyone \n     who was deemed insufficiently outraged. In 1967, as he was \n     turning away from the left, he published ``Making It,'' \n     which, typical of his writings, was a book that made \n     everybody talk, not always in calm tones.\n       ``Making It'' is a memoir about life in The Family, but \n     with a point--that literary people are not motivated simply \n     by a desire for truth but by a passion that dare not speak \n     its name, worldly ambition. Look at me, he said: I am \n     successful because I am ambitious.\n       The New York intellectuals expended a lot of typewriter \n     ribbon on the subject of the American identity. Not only were \n     many of them, like Mr. Podhoretz, poor Jewish kids from \n     Brooklyn, but they were also intellectuals, not a profession \n     featured often on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post. But \n     the thinkers in the Podhoretz camp decided that they approved \n     of and identified with American culture, and were attacked by \n     others for not being sufficiently alienated. ``Making It'' \n     can be read as an attempt to show that just because its \n     author is an intellectual doesn't mean he is not involved in \n     the central activity of American life, making it.\n       Apparently there were no celebrations in Topeka, Des Moines \n     and Fort Worth when the Partisan Review crowd announced it \n     approved of American life: ``Look, Eloise--They approve of \n     us!'' But it turned out to be important. Because those who \n     like Mr. Podhoretz did approve turned out to be essential to \n     the growth of the conservative movement, bringing to \n     conservatism, when they made the jump in the late 1970s, an \n     intellectual self-confidence that had been in short supply.\n       It's usual to say that Mr. Podhoretz and Commentary started \n     out on the left and ended up neoconservative. But that's not \n     quite right. Mr. Podhoretz has been consistent in his love \n     for rigorous argument (and so was appalled by the Dionysian \n     tone of the radical left). He has also remained consistent, \n     for the most part, in his sympathy for mainstream American \n     life, and in his staunch anti-communism. Furthermore, neither \n     Commentary nor Mr. Podhoretz has reached a resting point. \n     Neoconservatism looks lie a transitional phenomenon that may \n     even today be extinct.\n       The term was once used to denote those who were hawkish in \n     foreign policy but were sympathetic to the current structure \n     of the welfare state. But Scoop Jackson has passed on, and \n     the so-called neoconservatives are now among the most \n     devastating critics of the welfare state. In what sense, for \n     example, are William Bennett and Jeane Kirkpatrick \n     neoconservative? Both made their reputations in the pages of \n     Commentary but are now mainstream Republican figures.\n       These days, the people who seem most insistent on \n     preserving the distinction between neoconservatives and \n     regular conservatives are certain liberals on either coast. \n     Possibly, that is because they see people like Norman \n     Podhoretz and Irving Kristol--who are urbane, literate, and \n     have wives who are equally accomplished--and they insist \n     there must be a huge gulf between this sort of person (who by \n     cultural measures looks like a liberal ideal) and the yahoos \n     who they know (for they have read about it) make up the rank \n     and file of American conservatives.\n       One of the legacies of Commentary in the Podhoretz era was \n     that it enhanced the intellectual respectability of \n     conservatism. In the 1960s, conservatives were shooting up at \n     the liberal agenda. Now, liberals tend to be shooting up at \n     the conservative agenda. Thanks to the passion and urgency of \n     those earlier fights, those who travel in Mr. Podhoretz's \n     footsteps can afford to be a little more benign.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the New York Post, May 2, 1995]\n\n                        Norman Podhoretz Retires\n\n       At a gala dinner tonight in New York, Norman Podhoretz will \n     be honored on the occasion of his retirement after 35 years \n     as editor of Commentary magazine. A monthly long published \n     under the auspices of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), \n     but without AJC editorial control, Commentary established \n     itself under Podhoretz as America's leading journal of ideas.\n       Its circulation has never been large and it doesn't make a \n     profit. But the core readership consists of influential \n     Americans, and the ideas advanced in Commentary--thanks to \n     Podhoretz's editorial gifts--make it a forum for the key \n     policy questions confronting the nation.\n       Norman Podhoretz's tenure saw him start out as a seminal \n     figure on the left during his early days at Commentary. But \n     by the late 1960s, Podhoretz had moved significantly \n     rightward. And he'd taken Commentary with him.\n       His decision to ``Break Ranks,'' as he described the \n     phenomenon in a late '70s memoir--Podhoretz's early \n     intellectual compatriots remained wedded to the left--made \n     Commentary a leading American voice for foes of Soviet \n     communism, for advocates of a strong national defense, for \n     critics of affirmative action and for supporters of Israel's \n     security.\n       The pages of the magazine were filled with essays by then-\n     U.N. Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan--who called on the \n     U.S. to conduct itself as an opposition party functioning \n     within a hostile international arena--and by then-Georgetown \n     Professor Jeane Kirkpatrick, who deplored the Carter \n     administration's tendency to employ ``double standards'' in \n     dealing with left-wing dictatorships (toward whom it showed \n     some sympathy) as distinct from rightist authoritarian \n     regimes.\n       Commentary--under Norman Podhoretz--played a central role \n     in arguing the need for an aggressive posture vis-a-vis \n     Soviet expansionism, for a re-evaluation of failed Great \n     Society programs and for a recognition of ``anti-Zionism'' as \n     the principal contemporary manifestation of international \n     anti-Semitism.\n       In the last analysis, the most striking fact about \n     Commentary consists in the fact that over the last 35 years--\n     thanks to Norman Podhoretz's leadership--the magazine has \n     always been important to the national intellectual discourse. \n     That's a claim few journals can make for anything like that \n     duration.\n       Eventually, many followed Podhoretz's rightward lead, \n     resulting in a circumstance where the magazine he edited came \n     to speak for a whole movement: neo-conservatism, an important \n     intellectual tendency that can be defined loosely as the \n     conservatism of people who were once liberals.\n       Norman Podhoretz, we're certain, has much left to say--as \n     his magazine goes forward, he'll undoubtedly produce \n     important books and articles. But it seems appropriate to \n     pause and consider one of the most extraordinary careers in \n     20th-century American intellectual life. Podhoretz will \n     deserve the tributes he receives tonight from Henry \n     Kissinger, Irving Kristol, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Rupert \n     Murdoch and many others.\n       For some years a columnist for this newspaper, Podhoretz is \n     a man who proved, above all else, that ideas matter. The Post \n     joins in saluting him.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 2, 1995]\n\n              The 35 Remarkable Years of Norman Podhoretz\n\n                          (By Arnold Beichman)\n\n       This is the story of the little magazine that could and \n     still can. Launched as a monthly half a century ago by the \n     American Jewish Committee with a guarantee of editorial \n     independence, Commentary became a magazine of enormous \n     influence. Its articles on politics, particularly foreign \n     policy, and culture over the years have had an enormous \n     multiplier effect.\n       The editor of Commentary for the last 35 years, Norman \n     Podhoretz, has reached the retirement age of 65. He is \n     retiring to his Manhattan apartment-office to figure out with \n     his wife, Midge Decter, author, publicist and editor in her \n     own right, what his next major effort will be. Midge, \n     however, who is semi-retired, has figured out what to do \n     next. She found a neighborhood health club and is doing what \n     she has wanted to do for years and never had time for--\n     swimming every day. It is doubtful that such a future, \n     however temporary, awaits Mr. Podhoretz, \n     [[Page S5999]]  who has just been appointed a senior fellow \n     at the Hudson Institute.\n       While Mr. Podhoretz, whose new title is Commentary editor-\n     at-large, seeks implementation of several inspirations, he is \n     being honored at a farewell dinner tonight--at New York's \n     Hotel Pierre for four hundred friends, contributors, editors \n     of other magazines, relatives and even critics.\n       The remarkable feature of Commentary is that an examination \n     of its issues from the time Mr. Podhoretz took over as editor \n     in 1960 shows the current relevance and readable topicality \n     of so many of the articles published what seems to be so long \n     ago. Here are some of the titles:\n       Was the Holocaust Predictable? Was Alger Hiss Guilty?; The \n     Return of Islam; On Returning to Religion; Vietnam: New Light \n     on the Question of American Guilt; Are Quotas Good for \n     blacks?; The War Within the CIA; Reagan and the Republican \n     Revival; What Happened to the Schools; Totalitarianism and \n     the Lie; Education in Defense of a Free Society; The \n     Political Dilemma of American Jews; AIDS: Are Heterosexuals \n     at Risk?; Against the Legalization of Drugs; How Good Was \n     Leonard Bernstein?; The Professors and the Poor; \n     Intermarriage and Jewish Survival; The Liberated Women; \n     Authenticity and the Modern Unconscious; The Problem of \n     Euthanasia.\n       And the authors--Irving Kristol, Midge Decter, Thomas \n     Sowell, Bernard Lewis, Lionel and Diana Trilling, Gertrude \n     Himmelfarb, James Q. Wilson, Glenn C. Loury and dozens of \n     other leading intellectuals and scholars. Mr. Podhoretz set a \n     high standard for content. That standard obtained in the \n     articles and also in the letters to the editor feature, which \n     was as widely read as the articles. In fact, some readers who \n     never managed to get articles accepted (and paid for) by \n     Commentary got in anyway by writing long letters--for which \n     there was no writer's fee but the satisfaction at least of \n     being published in Commentary.\n       Commentary's overwhelming achievement was its leadership in \n     the world of culture in the fight against communism and the \n     Soviet Union, one undertaken by the magazine's first editor, \n     Elliot Cohen. It is no exaggeration to say that Commentary in \n     time became the scourge of the left, especially in culture. \n     Major analyses of communist foreign policy by writers like \n     Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Sidney Hook, Lexzesek, Kolakowsi, \n     Richard Pipes and other scholars and by Mr. Podhoretz himself \n     filled its pages. They were widely discussed and were read in \n     Congress and the White House. And all this, mind you, by a \n     magazine whose circulation never exceeded 80,000.\n       It is a truism that few editors leave behind successors who \n     deserve the promotion. Mr. Podhoretz, however, is the \n     exception. His successor as editor-in-chief is Neal Nozodoy. \n     He has been the leading member of the team which transformed \n     a Jewish magazine with deep involvement in Jewish and Israeli \n     affairs into a publication which without compromising its \n     cultural and ethnic roots became an important part of the \n     resistance to those who sought and still seek the perversion \n     of Western civilization in the name of new revolutionary \n     slogans.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S5997-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5999-S6000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      AUTOMOBILE TRADE WITH JAPAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the United States-Japan framework \nnegotiations in autos and auto parts accelerate over the next few \nweeks, I want to bring to my colleagues attention a New York Times op-\ned by Thomas L. Friedman published on April 16. Mr. Friedman describes \nthe problems American auto and auto parts manufacturers face when \ntrying to sell their products into Japan's closed market and our \nlimited chances of opening these protected markets unless we are \nwilling to impose reciprocal treatment on Japan's products in this \ncountry.\n  Regarding the likelihood of concluding a market opening deal in the \nframework negotiations with Japan anytime in the near future, Mr. \nFriedman says:\n\n       Don't hold your breath. The Japanese will literally do \n     anything to preserve their domestic car monopoly, even though \n     it is one of the major causes of the massive trade imbalance \n     between the U.S. and Japan that is, in turn, causing the yen \n     to soar in value against the dollar.\n       In fact, the higher the yen goes the less likely Japan is \n     to open its auto market. With the yen rising against the \n     dollar, Japan's cars become more expensive and difficult to \n     sell in the U.S., so Japanese auto company profits are \n     squeezed. That makes it all the more important for Japanese \n     auto makers to protect their home market from competition, so \n     they can charge higher prices there and run up profits they \n     need to cover losses abroad.\n       What the U.S. is seeking is an end to Japan's barriers. For \n     instance, only 7.4 percent of Japanese car dealers, who are \n     manipulated by the manufacturers, sell foreign cars alongside \n     Japanese models. Almost 80 percent of U.S. dealers sell \n     foreign models alongside their domestic brands.\n       The U.S. is also seeking better access to Japan's huge \n     market for replacement auto parts, which has been largely \n     closed to foreigners through Japanese regulations, customs \n     codes and cartels. U.S. manufacturers have 3 percent of \n     Japan's $27 billion replacement parts market, while \n     foreigners have 18 percent of the U.S. replacement market and \n     22 percent of Europe's.\n\n  Mr. Friedman believes we should be willing to take reciprocal action \nagainst Japan in an effort to get Japan to open its markets to United \nStates autos and auto parts. Doing so will not result in retaliation. \nMr. Friedman says:\n\n       Maybe, just maybe, the Japanese need us more then we need \n     them.\n       For starters we should charge Japanese auto manufacturers a \n     distribution tax on every car they sell in the U.S.--a tax \n     that will be reduced in proportion to how many Japanese \n     manufacturers open their showrooms to foreign cars. We should \n     also inspect every Japanese car and part that comes into this \n     country, and take our sweet time doing it, which is just what \n     Japan does.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Hold on, the Japanese will say, that is a violation of the \n     rules of the World Trade Organization. Rules? Did somebody \n     say rules? Does anyone think that Tokyo shrank the U.S. share \n     of the Japanese auto market from 60 percent in 1953 to 1 \n     percent in 1960 by playing by the rules? We'll only win equal \n     opportunity in the Japanese market when we play the game by \n     their rules--which are no rules at all.\n\n  Mr. Friedman has hit the nail on the head. Decades of painful history \nhave proven that Japan will open its markets only when forced to do so. \nNow is the pivotal moment in auto and auto parts negotiations with \nJapan and the administration seems prepared to so what no other \nadministration has done for 25 years: tell Japan that it faces \nequivalent restrictions on its goods if it does not open its market to \nour autos and auto parts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 16, 1995]\n\n                        Where Do Cars Come From?\n\n       Washington.--The other day I was playing the computer game \n     ``Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?'' with my 9-year-\n     old daughter, Orly. It's a wonderful geography-teaching tool. \n     You have to follow clues to different cities to trade down \n     vile criminals. The clues we were given for one trip were all \n     clearly pointing to Detroit. But instead of giving my \n     daughter the answer, I wanted to see if she could figure it \n     out herself, so I asked her: ``Where are cars made?'' And \n     without missing a beat she answered: ``Japan.''\n       From the mouths of babes.\n       Where have I failed as a parent? I guess it's the same \n     place that we've failed as a nation. We have so blithely \n     surrendered so much of the car market to the Japanese that my \n     own daughter thinks cars come from Japan as surely as pizza \n     comes from Italy and babies from the stork.\n       My daughter, of course, was only part right. Roughly 25 \n     percent of cars sold in the U.S. today are Japanese models. \n     But if we were living in Tokyo she would be dead right, since \n     only 1.5 percent of the cars sold in Japan are American.\n       This week U.S. and Japanese negotiators will once again try \n     to work out a deal for opening the closed Japanese auto \n     market. Don't hold your breath. The Japanese will literally \n     do anything to preserve their domestic car monopoly, even \n     though it is one of the major causes of the massive trade \n     imbalance between the U.S. and Japan that is, in turn, \n     causing the yen to soar in value against the dollar.\n       In fact, the higher the yen goes the less likely Japan is \n     to open its auto market. With the yen rising against the \n     dollar, Japan's cars become more expensive and difficult to \n     sell in the U.S., so Japanese auto company profits are \n     squeezed. That makes it all the more important for Japanese \n     auto makers to protect their home market from competition, so \n     they can charge higher prices there and run up profits they \n     need to cover losses abroad.\n       What the U.S. is seeking is an end to Japan's barriers.

Almost 80 percent of U.S. dealers sell \n     foreign models alongside their domestic brands. It's hard to \n     sell a car by mail order. You need a showroom and U.S. cars \n     don't have many in Japan. And the old America-makes-the-\n     wrong-cars line doesn't wash anymore. U.S. companies now make \n     eight different right-hand-drive vehicles tailored for Japan.\n       The U.S. is also seeking better access to Japan's huge \n     market for replacement auto parts, which has been largely \n     closed to foreigners through Japanese regulations, customs \n     codes and cartels.

We're Japan's largest export market and we provide \n     Japan with its security umbrella. We should use both as \n     levers to promote our trade interests. Would somebody get the \n     Pentagon a map. The last time I checked, North Korea and \n     China were a lot closer to Tokyo than Washington. Maybe, just \n     maybe, the Japanese need us more than we need them.

Mr. President, periodically, it is my pleasure to \naddress the Senate on the effective work of the Cooperative Extension \nService and 4-H programs.\n  The Cooperative Extension Service [CES] is at the heart of many \nAmerican communities. Established in 1914 by the Smith-Lever Act, the \nCES has been serving the needs of millions of Americans for more than \n80 years. The CES provides education and one-on-one assistance on a \nwide variety of issues, from agribusiness skills and safe chemical \nhandling to senior nutrition and child care. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture works closely with each State's land-grant university to \nprovide information on these and other programs to participating \ncommunities. The hands-on approach increases productivity and keeps \nthousands of farms and families running smoothly.\n  Local agents tailor CES programs to meet special area needs. In \nsoutheast South Dakota, for example, more than 1,200 producers affected \nby flooding received information on cropping alternatives and financial \nmanagement. In Day and Marshall Counties, CES agents organized more \nthan 450 South Dakota families and businesses in a recycling effort. \nAnother example is the successful Extension Service Indian reservation \nprograms. On the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations, 87 farmers and \nranchers completed training for their private pesticide applicators \nlicense.\n  One unique program run by the CES in every South Dakota county is \nhelping to put welfare recipients back to work. Every recipient of Aid \nto Families With Dependent Children [AFDC] must attend resourceful \nliving classes offered by county extension agents. In these classes, \nwelfare recipients learn basic skills such as household budgeting, and \ninterviewing skills. No other State in the country has such a program \nto establish self-sufficiency.\n  According to the CES, for every dollar invested in CES livestock \nprogramming, $4.60 to $5.80 is realized in the increased value of \nlivestock sold. For every dollar invested in crop programming, the \nvalue of crops sold is increased by $5.90 to $8.62. Thousands and \nthousands of dollars in health care costs are saved through the \nnutrition and child care education offered by CES. Clearly, this is an \nexample of a Federal program with an excellent return on the taxpayers' \ndollar. Why? Because it relies on the common sense participation of \nlocal folks who know the unique needs in their own communities.\n  Another program with a history of common sense result is 4-H. The \nmission of 4-H is to help young people become self-directed, \nproductive, and contributing members of society. 4-H members have the \nopportunity to explore many areas of interest. Their projects can \ninclude raising cattle, hogs, and sheep. Other 4-H projects involve \ngrowing farm or garden crops, forestry and entomology collections, \nbaking, sewing, handicrafts, art, electronics, horse showing, \nphotography, public speaking, and much more.\n  Nationally about 5.5 million young people are involved in 4-H \nannually. I always enjoy meeting 4-H'ers in my Washington office or at \nour State fair. They always give me helpful advice. 4-H has helped\n them to become well-informed and articulate leaders.\n\n  While growing up on a small family farm in my home State of South \nDakota, I was active in a local 4-H club, the Humboldt Hustlers. The 9 \nyears I was active in 4-H helped me develop my personality and better \nfocus myself. That helped me to confidently formulate and pursue my \ngoals. Each 4-H participant learns the value of teamwork, and gains \nknowledge of the community, State, Nation, and world in which he or she \nlives. I was fortunate to have attended twice the 4-H Club Congress in \nChicago and the 1961 World Agricultural Fair in Cairo, Egypt. \nParticipation in such programs by young people is even more vital today \nwith the growing importance of the global community to the United \nStates.\n  The success of South Dakota 4-H is due to a team of very competent, \nwell-informed adult professionals and volunteers who help educate 4-H \nmembers. I remember in particular two professionals who helped me and \nother South Dakota youth. They were Glenn Schrader, who was the \nMinnehaha County agent for more than 30 years, and John Younger, who \nwas the South Dakota 4-H leader for nearly 25 years. Both were \ninstrumental in the development of 4-H within South Dakota, as well as \nnationally. All 4-H participants also appreciate their local 4-H \nleaders for the time, effort, and commitment they volunteer. During the \ntime I was involved in 4-H, I had two leaders: Elmer Anderson and Harry \nStofferahn. They shared the values and spirit of 4-H to me \nand my fellow members, for which I am grateful to this day.\n  With the reported decline in rural communities, my colleagues may \nwonder how these programs continue to serve a useful purpose. The \nExtension Service and 4-H programs are no longer just for rural areas. \nThey have expanded from addressing traditional farm and home economic \nproblems to current issues such as teen pregnancy and violence. In \nfact, nearly one-third of 4-H students now reside in urban areas. They \nhave grown so fast because the lessons and values that are the essence \nof 4-H--head, heart, hands, and health--transcend geography and \ndemography. More important, at a time when thousands of young people in \nurban areas face so many challenges, the lessons and values of 4-H are \nneeded more than ever before.\n  As Federal budgetary pressures grow, it will be tempting for Congress \nto cut funding for programs such as the CES and 4-H. I hope my \ncolleagues will resist this pressure and continue supporting these \neffective programs. The CES and 4-H programs should be permitted to \ncontinue providing support for communities across the United States for \nmany years to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6000-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               CWO-2 PETER A.

He was manager of the \n[[Page S6001]]  bank's corporate sales and services department, which \nincluded national accounts, industrial development, private banking, \nand corporate cash management. He had also served as head of First \nAlabama's marketing division.\n  Prior to joining the bank in 1972, Sheldon was manager of industrial \ntrade development for the Mobile, AL Area Chamber of Commerce. His \ncolorful career also carried him to the Alabama State docks, where he \nserved as public relations director, and to the Mobile County schools, \nwhere he taught. He was in the U.S. Air Force from 1948 to 1952.\n  Sheldon received his bachelor's and a master's degrees from Auburn \nUniversity.

His thesis was selected \nfor placement in the libraries of the American Bankers Association and \nthe Harvard business school.\n  In addition to being an outstanding manager and banker, Sheldon \nMorgan has served his community through a wide variety of civic and \nprofessional organizations, including his service as president of the \nadvisory board of the Providence Hospital School of Nursing; the Mobile \nAzalea Trail Festival; the Mobile Kiwanis Club; Senior Citizens \nService; and the Industrial Developers Association of Alabama, which he \nfounded. He has also served as a member of the Junior Chamber of \nCommerce, the American Cancer Society; and the Mobile Economic \nDevelopment Council.\n  I congratulate Sheldon for his illustrious career and for his many \ncontributions to his community and state.

STENNIS\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today in \nremembering a man who embodied the U.S. Senate perhaps better than \nanyone, Senator John C. Stennis. Known as a Senator's Senator and the \nconscience of the institution, his presence for 41 years in the Senate \nwas formidable, yet comforting and reassuring.\n  While his departure represents the passing of an era and is cause for \nour grief, it is also certainly cause to rejoice, for our friend is no \ndoubt experiencing the rewards of a faithful heart and humble service. \nThe legacy he leaves is one defined by his strength, integrity, and \ncompassion.\n  Growing up in rural Mississippi, John Cornelius Stennis learned the \nlessons that would last him a lifetime. Such lessons molded a man whose \nsouthern courtesy would become a mark of dignity and distinction. After \nreceiving a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1927, young \nJohn Stennis spent 19 full years serving first as a State \nrepresentative, then district prosecuting attorney and finally a \ncircuit judge before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1947.\n  Much in the same manner Senator Stennis took so many of us under his \nwing, upon his arrival in the Senate, it was Senator Richard B. Russell \nwho mentored the like-minded Mississippian. Soon, Senator Stennis' \nsharp mind and unmatched work ethic earned him seats on the powerful \nArmed Services and Appropriations Committees. As chairman of the new \nArmed Services Preparedness Subcommittee, Senator Stennis became a\n watchdog for the Department of Defense and the armed services. His \nfair investigations and scrutiny of these organizations quickly secured \nhim a reputation which would never be tarnished: He was analytical, \ncritical, and he held unwavering convictions.\n\n  The impact John Stennis had over his 41 years in the U.S. Senate \nsurpasses description. Early in his Senate career he courageously spoke \nagainst McCarthyism. While assuring America would have the strongest \nand most capable military on the planet, he demanded accountability for \neach defense dollar spent. While always standing by his commitment to a \nstrong military, he also began to see the growing danger of our Federal \ndeficit and supported necessary defense budget cutbacks. A consummate \nprofessional, Chairman Stennis commented more than once that his work \nwas his play. Indeed, the joy with which he carried out our Nation's \nbusiness was contagious--our Senator's Senator was humorous and \nlikeable, a role model to Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  The trials Senator Stennis experienced during his sunset years in the \nU.S. Senate are almost unthinkable. He was shot twice by a burglar in \n1973, but he returned to the work of the Senate; he lost his wife of 50 \nyears in 1983, but he returned to the work of the Senate; and he lost a \nleg to cancer in 1984, but again he returned to the work of the Senate. \nThrough all this, Senator Stennis remained a commanding presence. As \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Virginia once put it, Senator \nStennis `` . . . had a great spiritual reservoir that came to his \nrescue and served as a solid, strong, foundation\n for him.'' Well, the spiritual reservoir overflowed and served as a \nsolid and strong foundation for the rest of us as well.\n\n  To more than one Senator, John C. Stennis was more than a colleague, \neven more than a mentor. Indeed, I am not the only Senator still in \nthis body who would call Senator Stennis a father figure--a figure \nworthy of our respect and deserving of our love. As long as he was in \nthe Senate, I was his student--especially on the Appropriations \nCommittee. Even when serving as chairman it was his counsel and \nleadership, his spirit and presence which guided me through the many \nhours of committee sessions and floor deliberations. To Senator John C. \nStennis I owe a debt of gratitude that is both professional and \npersonal. Seeing his patient and humble years presiding as chairman and \nas President pro tempore brought me peace of mind as I struggled \nthrough the difficult periods of my own service. And what would Senator \nStennis' response to this tribute be? Well, about 7 years ago, upon his \nretirement, he remarked that he ``* * * was just trying to do what \nlooked like to be the duty and keep it up the best he could.'' He \ncertainly did, and much, much more.\n  In the Book of Ezekiel, the third chapter, God declares the Prophet \nto be a watchman over the house of Israel. Ezekiel is commanded to warn \nthe rebellious Israelities of God's impending judgment. Well, for the \npast several decades, John Cornelius Stennis has been our watchman. He \nhas always cared for, and often admonished, a dignified yet sometimes \nunruly body of U.S. Senators. He has and will continue to represent the \nhistory of this body, to represent the integrity of this body and to \nrepresent the stature of this body. For his years of service, \nleadership, and friendship, I am eternally grateful.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6001-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JEFFERY ALLEN BREAUX\n\n  Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, more than a hundred years ago, Sitting \nBull, chief of the Lakota Sioux Indians, implored Americans: ``Let us \nput our minds together and see what life we can make for our \nchildren.''\n  I thought of that plea again on Saturday, April 22, the 25th \nanniversary of Earth Day.\n  Much has changed since the first Earth Day.\n  More and more, Americans recognize that conserving our natural \nresources and safeguarding a clean environment is in everyone's best \ninterests. It is, as Theodore Roosevelt said, the patriotic duty of \nevery American.\n  Congress has attempted to fulfill that responsibility by passing laws \nsuch as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, \nand the Federal Land Policy Management Act. As a result of these and \nother protections, the water Americans drink and the air we breathe is \ncleaner than it was 25 years ago.\n  We also understand much more about how the delicate Earth system \nworks and about the effects of human actions on the environment. For \nexample, earth scientists have come to recognize that the Earth's \nclimate is changing \n[[Page S6002]]  because of human actions that alter the composition of \nthe atmosphere. Geologists tell us that global climate change could \nincrease the frequency of droughts and floods.\n  We now appreciate that these events can have direct socioeconomic \nconsequences for individuals and communities.\n  We need to build on this knowledge and our successes, not undo them.\n  Clearly, we cannot and will not tolerate laws and rules that \nfrustrate businesses and justify redtape. We must be willing to heed \nthe lessons of the last 25 years and adjust our environmental laws to \nbe more efficient and less burdensome.\n  But, we must not exploit the current frustration with Government to \ngut all laws protecting our environment.\n  Those who claim we must eviscerate environmental rules in order to \nsustain our economy are at best disingenuous. They know--we all know--\nthat we cannot strengthen our economy if we destroy our environment. In \nfact, establishing policies for a sustainable environment is an \neconomic necessity. We must develop policies using balance, reason, and \ngood science.\n  We will debate many important environmental issues in this Congress. \nLet us hold ourselves to those standards: balance, reason, and good \nscience.\n  Pollution does not respect ideological boundaries. So our efforts to \nprevent pollution, to clean up mistakes from our past, and to plan \nthoughtfully for the future on this delicate planet must transcend \nthose boundaries.\n  In my lifetime, the world population has doubled, and the U.S. \npopulation has soared from 150 million to 260 million people. At \ncurrent growth rates, it's projected that the U.S. population will \ndouble--to 522 million people--just 60 years from now.\n  The cold, hard truth is that the Earth cannot supply the resources to \nsustain such a large human population unless we change our consumption \nand conservation practices now.\n  Earth Day reminds us that the Earth is not an infinitely bountiful \ncornucopia. Rather, it is a planet of finite resources from which comes \nthe materials for our food, clothing, and shelter. We must learn to \nlive within its geological and biological limits.\n  Environmental issues are often expressed in by scientists in \ncomplicated, technical terms. But the essential issue is really quite \nsimple and critical for all of us to embrace. President Theodore \nRoosevelt put it best early in this century when he said: ``A nation \nbehaves well if it treats its natural resources as assets which it must \nturn over to the next generation increased--not impaired--in value.''\n  We have an obligation to our children and our children's children to \nsafeguard their future, to preserve the water, soil, air, minerals, \nrivers, and oceans that are the resource base of this diverse planet \nand the many life forms that inhabit it.\n  Last week, students at the Grandview Elementary School in Rapid City \nspoke with me about pressing environmental problems and possible \nsolutions.\n  Let us not disappoint our children. Let us, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, heed Sitting Bull's plea to ``put our heads together,'' to work \ntogether, ``to see what life we can make for our children.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6001-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  SAFE WORKPLACES FOR AMERICAN WORKERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our Nation's history includes too many \ntragic and avoidable workplace accidents that have maimed and killed \nworkers.\n  The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire early in this century, in which \nwomen died because the owner had locked the fire doors to prevent them \ntaking an unauthorized work break, remains one of the most horrifying \nexamples.\n  Twenty-five years ago last Friday, Congress passed the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act. With that legislation, we made a commitment to \nall American workers that the places where they earned their living \nwould not themselves pose a hazard to life or health.\n  Yet it has been just a couple of years since the Hamlet chicken \nprocessing plant fire had a result all too similar to the Triangle \nShirtwaist Factory disaster, and for the same cause--a locked fire \nescape door. Twenty-five working people in North Carolina died in that \nfire.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Act was intended to prevent such \ntragedies, but despite the passage of a quarter century, its work is \nnot yet done.\n  Every year, more than 6,000 workers are killed by workplace injuries; \nmore than 50,000 die each year from occupational diseases.\n  We have made great strides in cleaning up the chemicals and other \ncontaminants that pose a hazard to health in many workplaces. Most \nAmerican employers are anxious to create workplaces that will not cause \ninjury to their own employees.\n  But the number of deaths each year, whether from immediate injury or \nfrom the long-range effects of exposure to hazardous substances, means \nwe cannot say that the work of the Occupational Health and Safety \nAdministration is finished. It is not.\n  It is inconceivable that, with this heavy toll of premature worker \ndeath, there is today a concerted effort to roll back and eviscerate \nworkplace safety provisions that protect workers today.\n  This is a misguided and mistaken approach. We are seeing improvements \nin the rate of workplace safety, with reduced injuries and accidents. \nClearly, the work done by Federal and State inspectors is having an \neffect. It is counterproductive to take an effective enforcement \napproach and seek to weaken it.\n  American workers deserve better. American workers should not have to \nfear that the Congress, which promised to protect their health a \nquarter of a century ago, will today renege on that promise.\n  There are undoubtedly improvements to be made in the enforcement \nfield, but proposals to eliminate the tools of enforcement itself are \nnot improvements. They will do nothing but undermine the ability of \ninspectors to do their job.\n  There are fewer than 2,000 Federal workplace safety inspectors. They \nare already overwhelmed by the scope of their responsibilities. If they \ndon't have the tools with which to enforce safety requirements, the \npromise of a safe workplace will become an empty one.\n  A week after the ultimate workplace tragedy, the bombing in Oklahoma \nCity that took the lives of so many Federal employees as they worked at \ntheir desks, it is worthwhile to remember the tragic and wasteful loss \nof life that goes unremarked in the workplace every day.\n  I commend the AFL-CIO and its affiliates for the continued effort \nthey make, through Workers Memorial Day, to recall to the national \nmemory the lives needlessly lost to preventable injuries and hazards on \nthe job.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6002-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6002-S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this week we commemorate the 80th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide--the death of over 1.5 million \nArmenians and their exile from their homeland.\n  This terrible tragedy marked the beginning of an ugly period in human \nhistory where there have been attempts to systematically liquidate \ncertain ethnic groups. The Nazi Holocaust, the extermination of the \nKulaks by Stalin, and the ruthless murders of innocent Cambodians by \nthe Khmer Rouge are all further examples of brutality against fellow \nhuman beings. Today, people are being killed in the Balkans, Rwanda, \nand Burundi once again because they are members of a different ethnic \ngroup.\n  What can we learn from all these tragedies and especially the one we \ncommemorate today? The first and foremost lesson is to acknowledge that \na tragedy occurred and admit that it is a crime against all of \nhumanity. Then we must never allow the world to forget what happened \nhere and the fate of these people. This is why we mark this date in \nhistory--and why we must continue to do so.\n  In 1915, the Ottoman Empire was in a state of collapse. The Empire \nwas exhausting its last strength in fighting World War I. The economy \nwas in tatters and the Government was in a state of confusion. The \nvictims of this time of upheaval were the Armenian people who were \neither killed or forced to flee their homelands.\n  [[Page S6003]] The Armenian people kept their culture and beliefs, \nand with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Nation of Armenia was \nborn. This birth has been a troubled one.\n  The tragic 7-year conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has cost \nthousands of lives and displaced over a million people. I am very \nencouraged, however, by the cease-fire which has been in place in \nNagorno-Karabakh for 1 year this month.\n  I am also encouraged that Russia decided this past December to work \nwith the Minsk Group of the OSCE to seek a peaceful solution in \nNagorno-Karabakh. The Minsk Group, cochaired by Russia and Finland, has \nbeen meeting regularly to address the needs of all the concerned \nparties. The process is moving along slowly, but there is hope that a \npeacekeeping unit may soon be in Nagorno-Karabakh to ensure the safety \nof all people.\n  The United States is eager to see a lifting of the blockade of \nArmenia and to see a return to the free flow of humanitarian aid in \nthis region. We share the aspirations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the \nother members of the OSCE Minsk Group for a peaceful solution to this \ntroubling problem.\n  We must do whatever we can to solve the situation in Nagorno-\nKarabakh. We must use all available resources to see that the tragedy \nwhich befell Armenians in the first part of this century is not \nrepeated--either in Armenia or anywhere else in the world. On this, the \n80th anniversary of a terrible genocide, we must learn from the past \nand make sure that such a tragedy is never repeated.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6002-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, once again I join my colleagues in pausing \nto reflect upon, and remember the victims of, this century's first \nexample of the horrendous crime of genocide, the Armenian population of \nthe Ottoman Empire. April 24, 1995, marked the 80th anniversary of the \nbeginning of this tragedy. On that day in 1915, some 200 Armenian \nreligious, political, and intellectual leaders were arrested in \nConstantinople and exiled or taken to the interior and executed. For \nthe next several years, Armenians were systematically expelled and \ndeported. Some were killed and others left to die of deprivation. When \nthe horror ended in 1923, 1.5 million Armenians had perished and \nanother 500,000 had fled their homeland.\n  Evidence of the Armenian genocide is available from a number of \nsources, among the most compelling of which is the reporting of our own \nUnited States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau. In a \ncable to the Secretary of State, Ambassador Morgenthau wrote:\n\n       Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is \n     increasing and from harrowing reports of eye witnesses it \n     appears that a campaign of race extermination is in process \n     under a pretext of reprisal against rebellion.\n\n  Some may ask why it is important to take time each year to \ncommemorate an event which occurred over half a century ago. In reply I \nwould recall the reported observation of Adolph Hitler as he \ncontemplated the ``final solution''--``Who remembers the Armenians?''\n  Sadly, as we all well know, the Armenian peoples' tragedy was not the \nlast genocide of this century; there followed the horrors of the \nHolocaust and the extermination of the Cambodians during the brutal \nKhmer Rouge regime. Surveying the world today we unfortunately see many \ntoo many examples of brutal ethnic, religious, or tribal-based \nconflict, from ethnic cleansing in Bosnia to massacres in Rwanda.\n  Today we remember the 1\\1/2\\ million victims of the Armenian \ngenocide. It is not comfortable to remind ourselves of this tragedy, or \nto visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum, or to see ongoing atrocities in \nreal time on our television screens. Let us hope and pray today that we \nnever allow ourselves to become complacent about man's inhumanity to \nman. For in the words of Edmund Burke, ``the only thing necessary of \nthe triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6003-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ARMENIAN COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues today in \ncommemorating one of history's greatest tragedies: The slaughter 80 \nyears ago of more than 1 million Armenians. That brutal assault on the \nArmenian people was an unconscionable effort to deny Armenians basic \npolitical and social rights of self-determination, independence, \ncultural identity, and community.\n  The atrocity could not extinguish the Armenian people's desire for \nfreedom and justice. The Armenian community survives in many places \naround the globe, including, thankfully, the United States of America. \nIn commemorating the immense tragedy which took place 80 years ago, we \nare honoring the achievements and lives of those who perished. We are \nalso paying tribute to the perseverance and vigor of the Armenian \npeople, who have maintained their cultural and historical identity \ndespite oppression and diaspora. They continue to make positive \ncontributions wherever they are, including in the United States and in \nthe Republic of Armenia.\n  Commemorating these tragic events of 80 years ago, we also recognize \nthe need for vigilance and action in the face of ethnic intolerance and \ninjustice. Failure to learn the lessons of such events in history will \nunquestionably lead to future tragedies.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6003-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6003-S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, April 24 was the 80th anniversary \nof the beginning of the Armenian genocide. On that day in 1915, 200 \nArmenian leaders were arrested in Constantinople, now Istanbul, and \ntaken to the Turkish interior, where they were executed. This act \nmarked the beginning of the first genocide of the 20th century.\n  From 1915-1923, 1.5 million Armenians were killed and more than \n500,000 were exiled. By 1923, the entire Armenian population, which had \nnumbered 2 million, 9 years before, was removed from Turkey.\n  During the last years of the Ottoman Empire, the government carried \nout the extermination of the Christian Armenian minority as a matter of \ngovernment policy. The Turks were concerned that the Armenian \npopulation sympathized with the Allied Powers, and were worried that \nthey might side with the Russians in the Turkish-Russian conflict \nduring World War I. The Ottoman Government felt they needed to fully \ncontain the Armenians.\n  All Armenians were equal candidates to be deported or massacred--men, \nwomen, children, the elderly. The Ottoman Empire justified the genocide \nas one of the necessary military operations during wartime.\n  Many Armenians were transferred from their homes and taken to \ndesolate areas to be abused and killed in mass slayings. They were \nmoved either by forced caravan marches or by overly packed cattle car \ntrains, both of which caused massive casualties.\n  The survivors of these deportations were sent to camps in the middle \nof the Syrian desert, where they faced heat, starvation, exhaustion, \nthirst, and disease.\n  In addition to the loss of life, Armenian churches, libraries, towns, \nand other symbols of their culture were razed. The property and \nbelongings of individual Armenians were transferred to the state.\n  The massacres ended only after the intervention by the Great Powers, \nincluding the United States. Henry Morgenthau, the United States \nAmbassador to the Ottoman Empire, organized and led protests against \nthe targeting of Armenians. Congress chartered an organization, Near \nEast Relief, which provided $113 million between 1915-1930 for the \nArmenians' cause. 132,000 Armenian orphans were sent to America and \nplaced in foster homes. The United States' efforts stopped the Turks \nfrom fully completing their plan of extermination. Unfortunately, \nthough, we were unable to protect the majority of the Armenians from \nthat brutal government.\n  Those who were not killed were scattered around the globe. The \nlargest community of Armenians today is in the United States, and \napproximately 25,000 Armenians live in Illinois.\n  I believe it is important to recognize this history of suffering. The \nUnited \n[[Page S6004]]  States should make April 24 a national day of \nremembering the Armenian genocide. We must acknowledge the Armenian \ngenocide for what it was.\n  There is no way we can go back and change history, but we must \nrecount the truth of what happened to the Armenian people between 1915-\n1923 in the Ottoman Empire. We must demonstrate that the attempted \nextermination of an entire people will not be tolerated. We must not \nforget those who suffered and died.\n  I dedicate this statement to those who did not survive the first \ngenocide of the 20th century. They must never be forgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6003-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nArmenian people on the 80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. April \n24, 1915, marked the beginning of the systematic elimination of the \nArmenian people in the Ottoman Empire by the Turks. It is important to \nrecall this horrible chapter in history not only to commemorate the \ncourage, strength, and energy of the Armenian people, but also to \nensure that history does not repeat itself.\n  Beginning in 1915, the Ottoman Empire carried out a genocidal plot \nagainst its Armenian minority. From 1915 to 1923, approximately 1.5 \nmillion Armenian people, including religious, political, and \nintellectual leaders, lost their lives due to starvation, torture, and \ndisease. More than 500,000 Armenians were exiled from their homes and \nby the end of 1923, the entire Armenian population of Anatolia and \nWestern Armenia had been killed or deported.\n  During this bleak period for the Armenian people, hope was \ntemporarily restored on May 28, 1918, when Armenian refugees, with the \nhelp of volunteers from abroad, defeated a Turkish attack and gained \nfreedom. Unfortunately, in 1920 the Soviet Union joined with Ottoman \nEmpire forces to attack and defeat Armenia, whose people were \nsubjugated by these foreign powers for the next 70 years. It was not \nuntil 1991, after the break up of the Soviet Union, that the \nindependence of the Armenian people was restored and the Republic of \nArmenia was born.\n  Although independence has been gained, Armenia's struggle still \ncontinues. There have been many efforts to deny the Armenian genocide \nand to discredit scholarship on this historical event. However, the \nsuffering inflicted upon the Armenian people--one of the oldest \nChristian nations in the world--must not be forgotten or denied. The \nhorror of these events must not be concealed, because only through \neducation and remembrance can the wounds inflicted by this tragic \nincident in history be healed.\n  It is our duty to salute the Armenian people, for it reminds us that \nwe all must work together to discourage prejudice and discrimination, \nto hold steadfast to the view that genocide will not be tolerated, and \nto make certain that it is never again repeated.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of a triple \ncommemoration of horror. April 1995 marked the anniversary of both the \nfirst and the most recent genocide of the 20th century. The first, of \ncourse, was the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915. The most \nrecent was last year's slaughter of the Tutsis of Rwanda.\n  Chronologically between these two grisly events stand the decimation \nof the Ukrainian people by Stalin's collectivization, the Jewish \nHolocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia, and most recently the \nunspeakable ethnic cleansing of Bosnia's Moslems.\n  The precedent for this inhuman chain was the Armenian genocide, the \nworld's failure to prevent it, and the inability to ensure that it not \nbe denied by future generations.\n  From 1915 to 1923, 30 percent of the Armenian people were massacred \nby the brutal hand of the Ottoman Turks, beginning with the Armenian \nintellectual and religious elite on April 24, 1915. Armenian men who \nhad already been conscripted into the Ottoman Army were put into work \nbattalions and then murdered.\n  Other Armenians--mostly helpless, elderly, women, and children--were \ndriven on forced marches into the desert. Many of those who withstood \nunimaginable suffering finally succumbed to starvation or illness.\n  Sadly, the Armenian massacres have been labeled the ``forgotten \ngenocide'' as a result of a concerted effort to rewrite history. Some \nwho should know better assert that the horrid events were merely a \nregrettable sidelight of war, not genocide.\n  Mr. Chairman, we must not let unseemly quarrels over semantics cloud \nour moral vision or distract us from the fundamental point: The world \nmust not allow human beings to be killed because of their race, \nreligion, or ethnic group.\n  It matters little whether or not in every case of genocide in this \ncentury the perpetrators had a master plan for annihilation. The \ncrucial, horrifying truth is that Armenians were killed because they \nwere Armenians; Jews were killed because they were Jews; Gypsies were \nkilled because they were Gypsies; Tutsis were killed because they were \nTutsis; and Bosnian Moslems were killed because they were Moslems.\n  In the 1930's the international community should have been alerted by \nHitler's cynical comment, ``Who today remembers the extermination of \nthe Armenians?'' Just as Hitler saw lack of historical memory of the \nArmenian genocide as a signal that he could carry out with impunity his \ndemented genocide of Jews and Gypsies, so too must the Hutus in Rwanda \nhave been emboldened by the world's failure to stop the vile ethnic \ncleansing in Bosnia.\n  On this 80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide; the 50th \nanniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and other Nazi \ndeath camps; and the first anniversary of the Tutsi genocide, I stand \nhere to tell you that this chain must be broken once and for all.\n  We must not only remember and honor the martyrs, but must also \nsolemnly swear: ``This will never happen again.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6004-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6004-S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last Monday, April 24, marked the 80th \nanniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide. I rise today to \nacknowledge and commemorate this terrible chapter in our history, to \nhelp ensure that it will never be forgotten.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman authorities began rounding up hundreds \nof Armenian political and religious leaders throughout Anatolia. Over \nthe ensuing months and years, some 1.5 million Armenians were killed at \nthe hands of the Ottoman authorities, and hundreds of thousands more \nwere exiled from their homes. For its devastation and barbarism, the \nArmenian genocide stands out as one of the most horrific events in \nhuman history.\n  As the 80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide passes, it is vital \nthat we remember and speak out about the systematic persecution and \nmurder of millions of Armenians by the Ottoman government. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me, the Armenian-American community, and people \nacross the United States in commemorating the genocide and paying \ntribute to the victims of this crime against humanity.\n  Americans, who are blessed with freedom and security, can never allow \noppression and persecution to pass without condemnation. By \ncommemorating the Armenian genocide, we renew our commitment always to \nfight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a message that the \nworld can never allow genocide to be perpetrated again.\n  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the \nliving. Out of the ashes of their history, Armenians all across the \nworld have clung to their identity and have prospered in new \ncommunities. Their strength and perseverance is a triumph of the human \nspirit, which refuses to cede victory to evil. The best retort to the \nperpetrators of oppression and destruction is rebirth, renewal, and \nrebuilding. Armenians throughout the world have done just that, and \ntoday they do it in their homeland as well. A free and independent \nArmenia stands today as a living monument to the resilience of a \npeople. I am proud that the United States, through our friendship and \nassistance, is contributing to the rebuilding and renewal of Armenia. \n   [[Page S6005]] Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian \ngenocide; let their deaths not be in vain. We must remember their \ntragedy to ensure that such crimes can never be repeated. And as we \nremember Armenia's dark past, we can look with hope to its future, \nwhich is bright with possibility.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6004-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6005-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6005-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON RESCISSION PROPOSALS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 43\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975, as modified by the order of April 11, 1986, to the Committee \non Appropriations, to the Committee on the Budget, to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, and to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974, I herewith report three rescission proposals, totaling \n$132.0 million.\n  The proposed rescissions affect the Departments of Justice and \nTransportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to limit \nacquisition of land on the 39-mile segment of the Missouri River, \nNebraska and South Dakota, designated as a recreational river, to \nacquisition from willing sellers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the wild and scenic rivers act amendment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1991 Congress designated a 39-mile \nstretch of the Missouri River from Fort Randall to Lewis and Clark Lake \nas a national recreational river. The purpose of the recreational river \ndesignation is to protect the river and its environment, protect \nlandowner rights, and provide for visitor use.\n  Recreational river designations preserve an important part of our \nNation's natural heritage. This section, along with other segments of \nthe Missouri River, provides critical native wildlife habitat, buffers \nagainst floods, and scenic waterways for recreation including fishing \nand hunting. For these reasons, South Dakotans feel strongly about the \ncare and management of the river.\n  The National Park Service is currently evaluating alternative plans \nfor managing this segment of the Missouri River. The selected plan will \nset goals and mechanisms for the care and public use of the river.\n  Numerous South Dakotans have commented officially on management \nalternatives proposed by the National \n[[Page S6007]]  Park Service. Some favor plans that emphasize the \nprotection of wildlife habitat and provision of a primitive river \nexperience. Others advocate a recreational emphasis with attention \ndrawn to cultural and historical aspects of the river. Most agree on a \nbalanced approach to river management.\n  However, many people who own land adjacent to the river have \nexpressed concerns about the effectiveness of river protection efforts. \nThey worry that recreational facilities developed on either side of the \nriver will threaten the fragile river ecosystem. They are afraid that \nthe Federal Government will take away portions of their land but will \nnot do an adequate job of river protection.\n  I have always believed that ranchers and farmers are the original \nenvironmentalists. They make their living off the land and, therefore, \nknow how the Earth and its rivers work. For farmers and ranchers, a \nhealthy Earth makes for a healthy living.\n  The National Park Service has stated that, at this juncture, it does \nnot believe that land condemnation will be necessary to accomplish the \ndesignation. While I appreciate the sensitivity of the Park Service to \nthis issue, concerns persist among landowners over the potential for \nland condemnation when the final plan is announced. These fears, which \nhave created a climate of mistrust, threaten to impede the designation \nprocess. For this process to move forward in a constructive and \nproductive way, I believe it is important to clarify this issue and \nensure that land condemnation is no longer an option in this process.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing a bill to amend the Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act. The bill will limit acquisition of land on the 39-mile \nsegment of the Missouri River designated as a recreational river to \nacquisition from willing sellers.\n  The bill seeks to ensure that the people who live with the river, who \nbest know its seasonal ebbs and flows, will retain control of the \nmanagement decisions that will affect them and the river. The bill \nguarantees that landowners with river property will not have their land \ncondemned by the National Park Service for the purpose of this \ndesignation.\n  South Dakotans living along this stretch of the Missouri River are \nentitled to be the stewards of their own land. They are eager to \nprotect this stretch of the river and to maintain its natural beauty.\n  In this time when States are clamoring for greater control over their \nnatural environment and the laws that guide its use, it is my hope that \nCongress will provide the degree of control that Americans are asking \nfor along this 39-mile stretch of river. Local landowners must take \nresponsibility for the health and well-being of their natural \nenvironment. This bill, which applies only to the 39-mile stretch of \nthe Missouri River from Fort Randall to Lewis and Clark Lake, will \nprovide that opportunity in this case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. LIMITATION OF ACQUISITION OF LAND ON PORTION OF \n                   THE MISSOURI RIVER DESIGNATED AS A RECREATIONAL \n                   RIVER.\n\n       Section 3(a)(22) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1274(a)(22)) is amended in the ninth sentence by \n     striking ``owner:'' and all that follows through the end of \n     the sentence and inserting ``owner.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 743. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for investment necessary to revitalize communities within \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                commercial revitalization tax credit act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today \nis the Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act of 1995 [CRTC]. This \nlegislation will encourage business investment in economically \ndistressed areas. It will create jobs; expand economic activity; \nimprove the physical appearance and increase property values in these \nareas. My bill would provide a targeted, limited tax credit to \nbusinesses to help defray their costs of construction, expansion, and \nrenovation. Currently, such an incentive is lacking. This credit would \nfill a gap in the range of tools that States and localities need to \nmake declining neighborhoods good places to do business, to work, and \nto reside. Martha Murphree, executive director of the Houston chapter \nof the American Institute of Architects said it very well: This \nlegislation would ``give small businesses leverage to expand and/or \nimprove their facilities, thus adding value to their establishments and \nallowing them to hire more employees.''\n  In fact, the American Institute of Architects is one of the prime \nreasons that this bill came to my attention and I applaud them for \ntaking this initiative.\n  Mr. President, this tax credit will help businesses form a \npartnership with the Government to help revitalize areas of our country \nthat have, in some cases, long suffered from neglect.\n  I firmly believe that we must reduce the size and scope of the \nFederal Government. I also firmly believe that there are compassionate \nways to aid our cities without adding more Federal Government \nbureaucracy. Expanding tax incentives to enable the private sector to \ncreate real jobs in the economically depressed areas of our country is \nan excellent way to combat poverty, crime, despair, and the physical \ndeterioration of our cities. This legislation encourages empowerment at \nthe local level. It builds on the empowerment zone/enterprise community \nprogram that is now unfolding in 109 communities across the Nation. My \nown State of Texas has five of these specially designated areas in \nthese cities: Houston, Dallas, El Paso, San Antonio, and Waco. The \nlegislation could also benefit additional communities which have had \npreviously approved and designated economic revitalization areas and \nwhich now receive Federal funds under the Community Development Block \nGrant Program.\n  I have always been a supporter of the pro-growth ideas that are at \nthe foundation of the enterprise zone concept. But what was enacted in \n1993 did not include the broad based incentives for capital formation \nthat former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp had \nenvisioned. These specially designated zones primarily encourage wage-\nbased tax credits to employers who hire an individual to work for a \nbusiness within the zone. But there is no existing incentive for a \nbusiness within the zone to expand so that larger numbers of people \ncould be hired. Increasing and upgrading buildings and infrastructure \nis a necessary part of improving our cities and combating cycles of \npoverty and crime. This is the part of the equation that has been \nmissing.\n  This is not intended to be a panacea. I do not anticipate that the \ntax credits will be the primary reason for going forward with such an \nexpansion. However, I do think it can be an important, positive factor \nthat would give the business man or woman the push needed to go forward \nwith construction, renovation, or expansion. The credit will mitigate \nthe inherent risk in business decisions to locate in areas experiencing \na variety of social and economic troubles. The credit will provide an \nincentive to invest in these areas, and the result will be new sources \nof tax revenues and new jobs.\n  We have seen how other targeted tax incentives can achieve such \ngoals. Two excellent examples are the historic rehabilitation tax \ncredit and the low-income housing tax credit. The historic \nrehabilitation tax credit provides a 20-percent credit to the owners of \nproperties listed on the National Register of Historic Places to \nrestore their properties for commercial purposes. According to the \nNational Park Service, the credit has definitely created jobs. In \nfiscal year 1994, the credit produced almost 21,000 jobs, among 524 \nprojects, and leveraged $483 million in private investment at a Federal \ncost of $97 million. Over the previous 4 fiscal years, $509 million in \ntax credits leveraged $2.5 billion in private investment. In the 17 \nyears since Congress enacted the credit, it has generated almost $17 \nbillion in private investment, in more than 25,000 projects. Moreover, \nthis credit has preserved thousands of this Nation's most precious \narchitectural treasures. It has also sparked tourism \n[[Page S6008]]  which in turn has generated millions of tax dollars.\n  The low-income housing tax credit is the residential housing \nconstruction and rehabilitation partner to the CRTC. It provides a tax \ncredit of up to 9 percent per year for up to 10 years against the cost \nof developing or renovating housing affordable to low- and moderate-\nincome people. Since its creation in 1986, it has financed 700,000 new \nand rehabilitated housing units. At an annual credit amounting to about \n$320 million, the low-income housing tax credit attracts about $975 \nmillion in private investment a year. According to the U.S. Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, for every 100,000 new housing starts, \n170,000 jobs are created. Of these jobs, 40 percent are on-site and \nanother 20 percent are in trade, transportation, and services that come \nprimarily from local markets. The National Association of Homebuilders \nreported that, for fiscal year 1992, the 92,000 units built or \nrehabilitated spun off more that $1.6 billion in wages and taxes.\n  Clearly, Congress has found that targeted tax credits can serve a \nvaluable public purpose. My proposal will do the same for economically \ndepressed communities struggling to attract new business investment, \njust as the historic rehabilitation tax credit has done for historic \nproperties and the low-income housing tax credit has done for \naffordable housing. According to the National Association for Counties' \nreport on business development incentives, it is important to ensure \nthat tax incentives are crafted to encourage new activity which might \nnot otherwise occur. Also, the credit must be carefully targeted and \nused judiciously. There must be safeguards to ensure accountability. \nThe tax credit must fit within a State or locality's overall economic \ndevelopment policy. It must also be designed to stimulate the local \neconomy, and to promote job growth in economically depressed areas. My \nproposal meets all of those standards.\n  This tax credit will be a cost-efficient instrument of Federal \npolicy. It will require a minimum of Federal bureaucracy. Most of the \nwork will be done by the State, which will allocate the tax credits, \nand monitor projects to make sure that the proposed benefits are \nrealized. It will engage the private sector in addressing the economic \ndevelopment needs of low-income communities. The Government cannot and \nshould not do the job alone. Private sector involvement helps ensure \nsuccess. Because their own funds will be at risk, private investors \nwill rigorously assess the feasibility of ventures before undertaking \nthem. This is not a charity or a Government give away program. The \ncredit will attract additional private lending. Lenders want to see the \nkind of private equity investment generated by the CRTC before they \nwill consider a loan, particularly in an economically distressed \ncommunity. The CRTC is flexible. It will work for a wide range of \nretail, industrial, health care, and other facilities which are crucial \nto making their communities good places to live and to do business. The \nCRTC is based on the principal of paying for performance. Tax credits \ncan be claimed only after the investment is made; the project \ncompleted; the assets remain in use; and income is generated. That \nensures that the taxpayers will get what they are paying for.\n  The tax credit I propose has the following major features:\n  The credit may be applied to construction, amounting to at least 25-\npercent of the basis of the property, which takes place in specially \ndesignated revitalization areas, including enterprise communities, \nempowerment zones, and other areas specially designated according to \nFederal, State, or local law.\n  Qualified taxpayers could choose a one time 20-percent tax credit \nagainst the cost of new construction or rehabilitation. For instance, \nif the expansion of a supermarket in the El Paso enterprise community \ncost $150,000, the tax credit against income would be $30,000. \nAlternatively, the business owner could take a 5-percent credit each \nyear over a 10-year period.\n  Annually, the credit would be allocated to each of the States, \naccording to a formula that takes into account the number of localities \nwhere over half the people earn less than 60 percent of the area's \nmedian income.\n  Localities would determine their priority projects and forward them \nto the State for allocation of credits according to an evaluation \nsystem which the States establish.\n  The CRTC would provide $1.5 billion in tax credits over 5 years, in \namounts as follows: $100 million in fiscal year 1996, $200 million for \nfiscal year 1997, and $400 million each year from fiscal years 1998 to \n2000.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I offer today is designed to attract \nover $7 billion of private sector investment to the most troubled \nneighborhoods and communities of this Nation. It will create jobs, \ngenerate tax revenue, and improve the physical appearance of these \nspecially designated revitalization areas. With a minimum of \nbureaucracy and through a proven tax mechanism, my initiative will make \na difference to the people and the economies of hundreds of communities \nand thousands of neighborhoods across this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 743\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize minors who are under the child labor \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and who are under 18 \nyears of age to load materials into balers and compactors that meet \nappropriate American National Standards Institute design safety \nstandards; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n      the balers and compactors safety standards modernization act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I introduce the Balers and Compactors \nSafety Standards Modernization Act.\n  This bill would make long-overdue revisions to safety standards set \nby the Department of Labor's Hazardous Occupation Order Number 12 (HO \n12).\n  HO 12 is a regulation issued by DOL in 1954 to protect employees who \nare under 18 years of age. In brief, it specifically prohibits minors \nfrom operating more than a dozen different types \n[[Page S6010]]  of equipment in the workplace. I certainly agree with \nthe underlying purpose of HO 12, which is that younger workers should \nnot be allowed to operate certain types of machinery when doing so \nwould place them in harm's way.\n  Specifically, this Safety Standards Modernization Act would address \nproblems caused by DOL's interpretation and enforcement of HO 12, with \nrespect to cardboard balers and compactors that commonly are used in \nsupermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail establishments, for \npreparing and bundling cardboard and paper materials for recycling \npurposes.\n  DOL's current interpretation of HO 12 goes so far as to prohibit \nminors from placing, tossing, or loading cardboard or paper materials \ninto a baler or compactor. Such activities take place during a loading \nphase that is prior to, and separate from, the actual operation of the \nmachine. While such a loading-phase prohibition may have made sense \nback in 1954, when HO 12 was originally issued, such is not the case \ntoday.\n  Technology has brought about significant safety advancements to \nbalers and compactors. Much like a household microwave oven or trash \ncompactor, the newest generation of balers now in use in grocery stores \nand other locations cannot be engaged and operated during the loading \nphase.\n  This important design feature is a result of safety standards issued \nby the American National Standards Institute [ANSI]. An employee is not \nat risk when placing cardboard materials into a baler that is in \ncompliance with ANSI standards Z.245.5 1990, or putting paper materials \ninto a compactor that is in compliance with ANSI standards Z245.2 1992.\n  Nonetheless, DOL treats all balers and compactors the same, and \nconsiders the placement of materials into these machines, if performed \nby a minor, to be a clear-cut violation of HO 12. Each violation can \nresult in a fine of $10,000 against an employer.\n  If DOL could produce injury data showing that workers are at risk \nwhen loading materials into a machine that meets current ANSI \nstandards, I might agree that the current interpretation and \nenforcement of HO 12 is warranted. However, DOL has acknowledged that \nit has no injury data for balers that meet the ANSI standard.\n  Despite the complete lack of evidence that workers are at risk in \nthese situations, DOL has cited numerous supermarkets throughout the \nUnited States and has assessed several million dollars in fines against \ngrocery owners in recent years.\n  It is difficult to understand the logic behind this kind of \nenforcement when, in fact, a review of 8,000 compensation cases \ninvolving injuries over the past 7 years by the Waste Equipment \nTechnology Association failed to find a single injury attributable to a \nbaler that meets current ANSI safety standards.\n  The present, rigid interpretation of HO 12 is bad regulatory policy \nand should not continue. It benefits no one, especially workers. Worker \nprotection is not enhanced by issuing large fines against employers \nthat use balers meeting current safety standards.\n  Such a policy also is clearly inconsistent with the goal of creating \nemployment opportunities for young people. Because so many grocers have \nbeen fined by DOL for loading violations, the industry has become less \ninclined to hire younger workers.\n  Originally, DOL applied this interpretation of HO 12 to cardboard \nbalers. As burdensome and objectionable as this policy has been, \nconcerning cardboard balers, DOL more recently went a step farther and \nnow is applying the same interpretation to compactors, a similar piece \nof equipment that retail establishments use to recycle paper materials.\n  Without the benefit of formal rulemaking and the opportunity for \ninterested parties to file comments, DOL extended the jurisdiction of \nHO 12 to compactors at the beginning of 1994, and employers found \nthemselves subjected to fines when it was documented that a minor had \nplaced materials into a compactor.\n  This is one more example of the ``speed trap'' mentality of Federal \nagencies, and the Department of Labor, in particular. Balers and \ncompactors are both governed by ANSI safety standards and cannot be \nengaged or operated during the loading phase. This means, to re-\nemphasize, that employees loading machines meeting ANSI standards are \nnot at risk.\n  Clearly, DOL's position on HO 12, as it relates to cardboard balers \nand compactors, is not in step with the technology being used in the \nworkplace. In view of the fact that this equipment can not be operated \nduring the loading phase, there is no compelling reason to continue \ntreating the placement of materials by minors a violation of HO 12.\n  The old joke goes that, when something is difficult to accomplish, \nyou compare it to passing an Act of Congress. If there is one process \nmore intractable, it must be modernizing Federal agency regulations.\n  HO 12 needs to be revised so that the placement of paper or cardboard \nmaterials into a baler or compactor that meets its respective ANSI \nsafety standards by an employee under age 18 is no longer a violation \nof the regulation. The loading phase should be completely distinguished \nfrom the operating phase of the machine.\n  While DOL has solicited comments on its child labor regulations, in \ngeneral, Congress does not need to, and should not, wait any longer for \nthis one, simple revision to HO 12. Throughout at least two \nadministrations, DOL has promised to reconsider the rule. Their latest \noffering is the goal of issuing a new, final regulation by February \n1996, even through we have yet to see a proposed revision to the rule.\n  We don't need months of agency hearings and reams of paper. I've seen \nthese grocery store balers operate. What's needed is a simple, common-\nsense change, and the bill I'm introducing today would make that change \nin a simple, straightforward way.\n  The many young people who will not have summer jobs this year under \nDOL's status quo interpretation of HO 12 should not have to wait \nanother year or more for the glacier-like process of regulatory change \nto catch up with technology.\n  By promptly acting on the bill I'm introducing today, we can open up \nthousands of youth summer job opportunities without relying on \ngovernment programs and grants.\n  The jobs are there. The young people are there. All we need to do is \nremove one, unnecessary, regulatory wall between them.\n  This bill would provide a narrow amendment to the Fair Labor \nStandards Act that would overrule DOL's interpretation of HO 12 in the \nlimited and appropriate way I've described. My bill would not change \nthe critically important safety focus of the regulation. In fact, I \nagree that DOL should remain vigilant and enforce the regulation in \ncase when the safety of young workers is compromised by use of \nequipment that does not meet current ANSI safety standards.\n  The bill would provide only that young workers would be allowed to \noperate balers and compactors that meet the current industry standards \nthat ensure complete safety in their operation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the text of my bill \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

for product \nliability litigation, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 19, strike line 12 through line 5 on page 21, and \n     insert the following:\n\n      SEC. 107. PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) punitive damages are imposed pursuant to vague, \n     subjective, and often retrospective standards of liability, \n     and these standards vary from State to State;\n       (2) the magnitude and unpredictability of punitive damage \n     awards in civil actions have increased dramatically over the \n     last 40 years, unreasonably inflating the cost of settling \n     litigation, and discouraging socially useful and productive \n     activity;\n       (3) excessive, arbitrary, and unpredictable punitive damage \n     awards impair and burden commerce, imposing unreasonable and \n     unjustified costs on consumers, taxpayers, governmental \n     entities, large and small businesses, volunteer \n     organizations, and nonprofit entities;\n       (4) products and services originating in a State with \n     reasonable punitive damage provisions are still subject to \n     excessive punitive damage awards because claimants have an \n     economic incentive to bring suit in States in which punitive \n     damage awards are arbitrary and inadequately controlled;\n       (5) because of the national scope of the problems created \n     by excessive, arbitrary, and unpredictable punitive damage \n     awards, it is not possible for the several States to enact \n     laws that fully and effectively respond to the national \n     economic and constitutional problems created by punitive \n     damages; and\n       (6) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n     that punitive damages can produce grossly excessive, wholly \n     unreasonable, and often arbitrary punishment, and therefore \n     raise serious constitutional due process concerns.\n       (b) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, in any civil action whose subject matter affects \n     commerce brought in any Federal or State court on any theory, \n     punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable \n     State law, be awarded against a defendant only if the \n     claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that \n     the harm that is the subject of the action was the result of \n     conduct by the defendant that was either--\n       (1) specifically intended to cause harm; or\n       (2) carried out with conscious, flagrant disregard to the \n     rights or safety of others.\n       (c) Proportional Awards.--The amount of punitive damages \n     that may be awarded to a claimant in any civil action subject \n     to this section shall not exceed 2 times the sum of--\n       (1) the amount awarded to the claimant for economic loss; \n     and\n       (2) the amount awarded to the claimant for noneconomic \n     loss.\n     This subsection shall be applied by the court and the \n     application of this subsection shall not be disclosed to the \n     jury.\n       (d) Bifurcation.--At the request of any party, the trier of \n     fact shall consider in a separate proceeding whether punitive \n     damages are to be awarded and the amount of such an award. If \n     a separate proceeding is requested--\n       (1) evidence relevant only to the claim of punitive \n     damages, as determined by applicable State law, shall be \n     inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \n     compensatory damages are to be awarded; and\n       (2) evidence admissible in the punitive damages proceeding \n     may include evidence of the defendant's profits, if any, from \n     its alleged wrongdoing.\n       (e) Applicability.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States, or by any State, under any \n     law;\n       (2) create any cause of action or any right to punitive \n     damages;\n       (3) supersede or alter any Federal law;\n       (4) preempt, supersede, or alter any State law to the \n     extent that such law would further limit the availability or \n     amount of punitive damages;\n       (5) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (6) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign \n     nation; or\n       (7) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of inconvenient forum.\n       (f) Federal Cause of Action Precluded.--Nothing in this \n     section shall confer jurisdiction on the Federal district \n     courts of the United States under section 1331 or 1337 of \n     title 28, United States Code, over any civil action covered \n     under this section.\n       (g) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) The term ``claimant'' means any person who brings a \n     civil action and any person on whose behalf such an action is \n     brought. If such action is brought through or on behalf of an \n     estate, the term includes the decedent. If such action is \n     brought through or on behalf of a minor or incompetent, the \n     term includes the legal guardian of the minor or incompetent.\n       (2) The term ``clear and convincing evidence'' means that \n     measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of \n     the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth \n     of the allegations sought to be established. The level of \n     proof required to satisfy such standard shall be more than \n     that required under preponderance of the evidence, and less \n     than that required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       (3) The term ``commerce'' means commerce between or among \n     the several States, or with foreign nations.\n       (4)(A) The term ``economic loss'' means any objectively \n     verifiable monetary losses resulting from the harm suffered, \n     including past and future medical expenses, loss of past and \n     future earnings, burial costs, \n     [[Page S6012]]  costs of repair or replacement, costs of \n     replacement services in the home, including child care, \n     transportation, food preparation, and household care, costs \n     of making reasonable accommodations to a personal residence, \n     loss of employment, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities, to the extent recovery for such losses is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (B) The term ``economic loss'' shall not include \n     noneconomic loss.\n       (5) The term ``harm'' means any legally cognizable wrong or \n     injury for which damages may be imposed.\n       (6)(A) The term ``noneconomic loss'' means subjective, \n     nonmonetary loss resulting from harm, including pain, \n     suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional \n     distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of \n     consortium, injury to reputation, and humiliation.\n       (B) The term ``noneconomic loss'' shall not include \n     economic loss or punitive damages.\n       (7) The term ``punitive damages'' means damages awarded \n     against any person or entity to punish such person or entity \n     or to deter such person or entity, or others, from engaging \n     in similar behavior in the future.\n       (8) The term ``State'' means any State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, and any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any of the \n     foregoing.\n       (h) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to any civil \n     action in which trial has not commenced before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 THOMPSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO 618\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Simon) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to amendment No. 596 proposed \nby Mr. Gorton to the bill H.R. 956, supra; as follows:\n\n       In section 102(a)(1), after ``commenced'' insert the \n     following: ``in a Federal court pursuant to section 1332 of \n     title 28, United States Code, or removed to a Federal court \n     pursuant to chapter 89 of such title''.\n       In section 102(c)(6), strike ``or'' at the end.\n       In section 102(c)(7), strike the period at the end and \n     insert ``; or''.\n       In section 102(c), add the following new paragraph:\n       (8) create a cause of action or provide for jurisdiction by \n     a Federal Court under section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, \n     United States Code, that otherwise would not exist under \n     applicable Federal or State law.\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I submit on behalf of myself and \nSenators Cochran and Simon an amendment that would limit applicability \nof the product liability to cases in federal court.\n  As currently before the Senate, H.R. 956 would seriously jeopardize \nthe balance between state and federal governments that the Founding \nFathers established in the Constitution. States have had responsibility \nfor developing their own rules of tort law--free of federal \ninterference--for more than 200 years. In an unprecedented fashion, the \nproduct liability bill would displace state law governing an area \nalways reserved to the states, even when the case is brought in state \ncourt. I am troubled by a Washington knows best approach to product \nliability.\n  Even worse, the displacement of state law is selective. H.R. 956 \nprevents states from providing less protection to defendants, but not \nfrom providing more. This one-size-fits-all bill overlooks both that \nindividual Americans are unique and that states have their own right to \ndetermine the law that should apply to their special situations.\n  The bill raises federalism problems in a very practical sense. \nBecause state law would still govern many aspects of product liability \nlaw under H.R. 956, there would be numerous questions to litigate \nconcerning the relationship between the federal law and existing state \nlaws. New, different, and inconsistent interpretations of the federal \nlaw and the state laws would result. Under the bill, resolution of \nthese issues would be provided from a federal court of appeals. Those \ncourts, not state courts, would ultimately determine the scope and \nmeaning of state law as it interacts with this bill. Moreover, those \nappeals courts would be deluged with litigation at a time when years \nelapse before trial of a civil case in federal court, and when \nAmericans rightly demand that federal courts apply swift and certain \njustice in criminal cases.\n  By contrast, my amendment recognizes that interstate commerce is the \njustification for a federal product liability bill. It is interstate \ncommerce that justifies federal court jurisdiction in cases brought by \ncitizens of one state against citizens of another. I believe that the \nrationale of the bill corresponds precisely with the reasons underlying \nfederal diversity jurisdiction.\n  Despite the claims made, no one truly knows the effect of this bill \non the ability of injured Americans to recover adequate compensation \nfor injuries caused by defective products. Nor will anyone know whether \ncompetitiveness of American business will be enhanced or whether \ninsurance premiums will fall if H.R. 956 is enacted. At the same time, \nthe bill would displace 200 years of law based on actual experience. If \nthe bill failed to achieve its objectives, there would be almost no \nmeans of unscrambling the federalized egg. By contrast, applying the \nbill only to federal court cases would provide an opportunity to \nexperiment. If H.R. 956's ideas work, states can adopt these rules as \ntheir own. Potentially, a preemptive approach might then make sense. \nBut if the bill created numerous practical problems, well-tested state \nlaw would remain undisturbed while Congress acted to fix the problems \nin the federal law.\n  The practical effect of my amendment would be that defendants sued \nout of state in many instances would be able to remove their cases to \nfederal court and obtain the federal rule. Defendants sued in their \nhome state would not be able to remove the case to federal court. Thus, \nthose defendants would be governed by their own state law as applied by \ntheir own state court. I believe this is to be a much more sensible \napproach than the one now before the Senate, and one consistent with \nthe federal system the Constitution created.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 619\n\n  Mr. DORGAN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 617 proposed by Mr. \nDole to amendment No. 596 proposed by Mr. Gorton to the bill, H.R. 965, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       On page 1, beginning with line 3, strike through line 2 on \n     page 8 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 107.

HENRY, MISSOURI SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize Jim Henry as Missouri's Small Business Person of the Year for \n1995. Jim Henry is the president and chief operating officer of the \nR.C. Wilson Co., located in St. Charles.\n  In years to come, we may refer back to 1995 as the year of small \nbusiness owners. More attention is being given to the accomplishments \nof small business persons than at any time since I entered government \nservice. Small businesses will create 66 percent of all new jobs this \nyear. By contrast, large companies with over 5,000 employees will add \nonly 6 percent of the new jobs. Small businesses are the engine that is \nfueling our economy, generating 52 percent of all sales and one-half of \nthe gross domestic product. It is, therefore, very appropriate that the \nSmall Business Administration has set aside this week to honor our \nNation's men and women, like Jim Henry, who own and operate small \nbusinesses.\n  Jim Henry's business, the R.C. Wilson Co., is a collection agency. \nMost of us think of a collection business as one that is insensitive at \nbest. However, since Mr. Henry purchased the company in 1985, he has \nworked hard to establish a level of excellence that is essential for \nsuccess in today's competitive business environment. His business \nphilosophy puts a special emphasis on the dignity of the consumer, and \nprovides professional service and outstanding results while maintaining \nthe fine image of the client.\n  Jim Henry has been an innovator. Over the past 10 years, he has \nexpanded and enhanced the delinquent-account collection services by \nfully computerizing his agency. He added optical-disk storage and on-\nline capability with clients. He has recognized the tremendous changes \nin the work place by adding on-line connections for employees working \nfrom home. His business was the first of its kind in Missouri to add a \ncomputerized dialing system.\n  In 1985, the R.C. Wilson Co. employed 25 people with annual billings \nof $1.25 million. Today, Jim Henry has 114 employees and bills $4 \nmillion a year. His success rate is nearly 50 percent better than the \nindustry average.\n  Jim Henry has succeeded by recognizing the needs of his customers and \nclients, by working hard and by being innovative. Equally significant, \nJim Henry has never forgotten his employees, many have been with the \ncompany for over 20 years. He has shown us how to be an excellent \nbusinessman and employer, and I am proud to recognize Jim Henry as \nMissouri's 1995 Small Business Person of the Year.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6013-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6013-S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE WITTMAN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, true pioneers are rare and \nspecial individuals. They inspire us with their vision, their energy, \ntheir skill and their ability to lead.\n  Today I am sad to report the passing of one such pioneer, the \nlegendary aviator Sylvester Joseph Wittman. Mr. Wittman and his wife, \nPaula, died in an airplane crash on Sand Mountain, in northeastern \nAlabama last Thursday night. They were flying in an airplane that Mr. \nWittman had designed and built from their winter home in Ocala, Florida \nto their home in Oshkosh, Wisconsin when the accident occurred.\n  [[Page S6014]] Many successful people like to go by the book. Steve \nWittman, as he preferred to be called, helped write the book. His life \npractically traced the history of aviation. He took wing in the spit-\nand-bailing-wire era and never stopped contributing to his beloved \ncalling even as we began flying farther, higher, and faster in more \ncomplex machines.\n  He was born in the year after the first powered flight at Kitty Hawk. \nHis flying career began in 1924, when he and a partner bought an \nairplane, and he taught himself to fly. His first pilot's license was \nsigned by Orville Wright.\n  For 70 years, he designed, built and flew airplanes as a barnstormer, \na test pilot and a racer, and he was one of the founders of the \nExperimental Aircraft Association, the Oshkosh-based organization that \ndoes so much to promote the love and the joy of flying.\n  The Winnebago County airport in Oshkosh, which Mr. Wittman managed \nfrom 1931 until 1969, is named Wittman Field in his honor.\n  Buster, a red single-engined midget racer Mr. Wittman built and flew \nis currently on display in the Golden Age\n of Flight Gallery in the West Wing of the National Air and Space \nMuseum. Buster, originally named Chief Oshkosh, raced successfully for \n23 years, beginning in 1931.\n\n  He was a superb pilot, and stories about his skill are legion, even \nthough he was reluctant to tell them himself. One of the more famous \nincidents occurred as he and a friend were flying over Tennessee. A \ntrigger-happy rifleman had put a .22 calibre slug into Mr. Wittman's \ngas tank, and the fumes almost asphyxiated him. He managed to get his \nship down safely, a bit of flying his partner barely completed though \nfully conscious.\n  He kept the slug as a souvenir.\n  Mr. Wittman set several speed records, and it would be hard to find a \nsignificant air racing event he had not entered. It wasn't unusual for \nhim to fly home with the winner's trophy. He entered his last closed-\ncourse pylon race in 1989. At the age of 85, he won one heat, finished \nsecond in another and then came in third in the final race.\n  By the way, he did all this with vision in only one eye. He had lost \nthe other in an accident when he was young.\n  In addition to his brilliant and storied racing career, he also \ncontributed greatly to the common body of knowledge of the aviation \ncommunity. Although he had no formal engineering training, he was often \nahead of the curve in aviation design, and he never stopped looking for \nclues to better performance. He designed a landing gear that has been \ninstalled on over 100,000 airplanes.\n  One of his airplanes, the Wittman Tailwind, is a design that is still \nbeing flown by private pilots all over the world.\n  His self-developed talents were so impressive, he was made an \nhonorary member of the elite Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a \nrare achievement.\n  He had his share of bumps and bruises in crashes along the way, but \nat 91, he was still flying.\n  He did all this with modesty and gentlemanly character, and he was a \nman who enjoyed life at a level most of us never approach.\n  As Tom Crouch, chairman of the Aviation Department at the Air and \nSpace Museum put it, ``If anybody in the history of aviation could be \ncalled a legend, it would sure be him.''\n  Our condolences go out to Mr. Wittman's relatives, friends, fellow \naviators and to all those who were inspired by this true \npioneer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6013-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        AID/U.N. POPULATION FUND\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, as my colleagues and I prepare to go \nto conference on the H.R. 1158/S. 617 Defense supplemental \nappropriations and rescissions bills, I wish to submit a statement of \nsupport for funding for the Agency for International Development [AID] \nand United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA] population assistance \nprograms. I strongly commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member for their focus on \nretaining the option of continued funding for AID and UNFPA population \nassistance programs in S. 617. By allowing the administration to decide \nwhere to rescind AID dollars, rather than agreeing to proposals to \nspecifically rescind UNFPA and other AID population assistance funds, \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee has kept open an opportunity to \nsupport these programs at fiscal year 1995 levels. While AID \nadministers many valuable and significant human assistance programs \nworldwide, its population assistance programs contribute greatly to \nimproving opportunities for economic growth and political stability in \nmany developing countries, and are crucial to the protection of our \nglobal environment. I strongly support the full funding of these \nprograms and urge my colleagues in conference to commit to leaving the \nadministration with the option to meet the United States 1995 \npopulation assistance commitments.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6014-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RICHARD CLARKE\n\n Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, leadership grounded in common \nsense and compassion and elevated by imagination and vision is the \nhallmark of Richard Clarke's 30-year career at Pacific Gas & Electric \nCo. [PG], the last 8 as chairman of the board and chief executive \nofficer.\n  As his retirement nears, I should like to salute him. Over the years, \nfirst as mayor of San Francisco and now as U.S. Senator, I have worked \nclosely with Richard. Not only on questions involving utility service, \nbut on a broad range of community issues, I have known Dick as a person \nwho quickly gets to the heart of issues and directly speaks his mind.\n  Even further, he has been involved in a wide range of charitable and \ncivic activities, and gives meaning and substance to the accolade \n``civic leader.''\n  During his tenure as PG's CEO, Richard Clarke made environmental \nimprovement a company priority and created programs that implemented \npolicies to conserve energy. So effective were these innovations that \nPG received the President's Environment and Conservation Challenge \nAward in 1991, the Nation's highest recognition for corporate \nenvironmental excellence. In that same year, then President Bush named \nhim to the President's Council of Sustainable Development.\n  At the same time, Richard, as chair of the Bay Area Council and the \nCommittee on Jobs, worked to bring together other business leaders of \nSan Francisco business and focus their collective knowledge and talents \non ways to make government more efficient and the economy stronger.\n  Under Richard Clarke's guidance, PG has won national recognition \nfor improving the workplace by establishing child day-care centers for \nemployees and advancing opportunities for women and minorities.\n  His sense of community concern and compassion is reflected in his \neffort of such worthwhile efforts as Francisco Food Bank and Project \nOpen Hand, which provides nourishing meals to people living with AIDS, \nto United Way and the San Francisco Symphony, where he serves as a \nboard member. He personally developed and championed programs that \nencourage PG employees to become mentors to disadvantaged young \npeople and to provide guidance to small, developing businesses in the \ninner city.\n  As he retires, Richard Clarke leaves behind a remarkable record of \naccomplishment--success in business and community affairs. He takes \nwith him the admiration and respect of all those who have worked with \nhim, and who wish him all the best in retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6014-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6014-S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE 1995 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON AGING\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today begins what I anticipate \nwill be a productive and useful week for the more than 2,200 delegates \nhere in Washington for the fourth White House Conference on Aging. I \ncommend President Clinton for convening the first White House \nConference on Aging since 1981, and want to take this opportunity to \nwelcome all of the participants in this important policy conference, \nespecially those from my own State of Maryland.\n  In the spirit of the first White House Conference on Aging \nestablished by President Kennedy in 1961, this week's \n[[Page S6015]]  Conference will address common problems facing all \ngenerations of Americans and seek to increase public awareness of the \ninterdependence of generations and the essential contributions of older \npeople. It will also facilitate the development of public policy \nrecommendations to maintain and improve the well-being of the aging. \nMr. President, this is an important and full agenda and I applaud all \nwho are participating in this timely Conference.\n  Senior citizens today comprise more than 12 percent of the country's \npopulation and by the year 2000, that number is expected to surpass 16 \npercent. Maryland seniors comprise 15.6 percent of the State's \npopulation, a figure expected to increase to just over 16.2 percent by \nthe year 2000. This demographic transformation poses significant \nchallenges and opportunities and the White House Conference on Aging \nprovides an excellent framework through which the participants may \naddress these issues.\n  The considerable participation and interest in the White House \nConference on Aging clearly illustrates what I have always believed and \nexperienced--older Americans want to contribute. They want to work, to \nvolunteer, and to participate in improving their communities and their \nNation. It is critical, in my view, that we recognize and utilize the \nvaluable insight, experience and wisdom that senior citizens bring to \nall aspects of life.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed strongly in the potential of \nthis significant and growing population to contribute to the \ndevelopment and implementation of policies that affect all Americans \nand I expect that the coming days will confirm my belief. I want to \nagain commend all of the delegates from across the country and wish \nthem well as they participate in the fourth White House Conference on \nAging.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/02/senate-section/article/S6014-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1995\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
