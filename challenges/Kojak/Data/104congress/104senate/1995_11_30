Thank you, Mr. President. I do not intend to take the \nhour.\n  We did set aside some time, however, and I hope to be joined later by \nsome of my colleagues from the freshman class who have sought to come \nto the floor from time to time to talk a bit about what, in our view at \nleast, our collective view, we are seeking to do during this session of \nCongress. What we have sought to do, of course, along with the other \nSenators in this body, throughout this year, is to make some \nsubstantial changes.\n  I think those of us who have just come this year perhaps feel more \nstrongly about making changes, more strongly because we are not as \nwedded to the operations that have gone on here for 30 years as some \nmay be. I think we are probably more sensitive to voters, having just \ncome fairly recently off an election, an election in \n\n[[Page S17832]]\nwhich most agree that people said we have too much Government, it costs \ntoo much, we need to be as fiscally and financially responsible as a \ncountry as you and I expect to be as individuals in our families and \nour homes and our businesses.\n  So we feel very strongly about that. Balancing the budget has been \nand continues to be the prime issue, I think, for a number of reasons, \nnot only because of the arithmetic, not only because for 30 years this \nCongress has not balanced the budget. We have spent more than we have \ntaken in for a very long time. In order to do that, we have maxed out \nour credit card. We have charged it to our children and to our \ngrandchildren and continue on at that rate, continue on to add to the \ndebt to where we now have a $5 trillion debt, which is more money than \nmost of us can imagine. Maybe even more directly, we have an interest \npayment every year we must make of $260 billion, probably next year the \nlargest single line item in the budget, one that, of course, cannot be \nadjusted or changed. If it continues to grow at the rate it has, it \nwill absorb more and more of the available funds.\n\n  So, balancing the budget is something that we have not paid a lot of \nattention to, collectively, over the years. The deficit sort of \nhappened. Nobody felt much pain, and we continued to do that. It is \nfinancially irresponsible. As we look to moving into a new century we \nmust ask ourselves, I think, what kind of a Government, what kind of a \ncountry do we pass on? One that is continuing to grow a $5 trillion \ndebt, adding on every day? Or do we, in fact, want to make some changes \nthat will bring about different results?\n  In addition to that, however, balancing the budget has some other \nfundamental changes. It has to do with spending. I suppose you can \nbalance the budget by raising income, raising taxes, raising revenue, \nwhich of course was what the President did in 1993. It was the largest \ntax increase the world has ever known. It did, to some extent, reduce \nthe deficit. I guess you can do that. The real issue, however, is what \ndo you want to do about spending? If, in fact, the message was that \nGovernment is too big and spends too much, then in addition to \nbalancing the budget, you also have to balance it on the basis of \nholding spending, or at least reducing the increase in spending, which \nhas an impact on Government. If you have too much Government, if you \nhave too much regulation, if Government is too intrusive in your life--\nas many people believe it is, as I believe it is--then balancing the \nbudget and the level of spending have something to do with that.\n  I have a hunch that one of the rules of nature or science or whatever \nis that government grows to the extent possible by available funds and \navailable debt. Until you do something about that, it continues to \ngrow. So this has been the pivotal issue and continues to be. We have \ndone a number of things this year with respect to it. One of the early \nones was to seek to have a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I support that idea. Some do not. Some say you do not \nneed to do it. You do not need to tamper with the Constitution. You \njust do it.\n  The evidence is that does not work very well. We have been saying \nthat for a long time. It has not happened. It has not happened. Others \nsay we just have to get at it. I am for a balanced budget amendment, \nbut that proposal died by one vote here in the Senate. I believe it is \nnecessary, frankly, to have a constitutional amendment to provide some \ndiscipline. Public bodies are awfully hard to discipline. Everyone \ncomes from a constituency. Everyone has a constituency that needs a new \nbridge or new road or whatever. So it is very difficult to have the \ndiscipline to say no to some things, to live within a budget. The \nconstitutional restraints help do that. I come from a State that \nrequires a balanced budget in the State constitution. And no one thinks \na lot about it. We know that you cannot spend more than is available, \nmore than you take in. So you have to make adjustments. I think it is a \ngreat idea.\n\n  One of the problems with spending in this country is that we are over \nhere talking about the benefits of spending but we do not then relate \nit to the cost of paying for it. One of the simplest and most direct \ncost-benefit ratios comes from the local school district. You say to \nthe constituents that we need a new junior high, and it is going to \ncost you $220 a year on your property tax. So you say to yourself, OK, \nis it worth $220 a year? Then you go vote, and you decide based on what \nthe benefits are of the school based on what it is going to cost. We \nare too far removed from that on the Federal level. So spending is over \nhere. You pay for it over here, and the two never come together in \nterms of a cost-benefit ratio. That is not good for government.\n  So we did not get a balanced budget amendment. So then we set about \nto balance the budget over a period of 7 years by doing it through \nappropriations, and beginning to decrease the growth of spending in \nappropriations. And we have worked on that all year and have not yet \nfinished, as a matter of fact.\n  I introduced yesterday a bill that would provide for a biennial \nbudget, thinking we would be much better off if we had a 2-year budget \nso that at some time, when we would get through doing appropriations, \nwe would have time to do other things like health care, and \nenvironmental issues, and have oversight of the spending that we have \napproved. At any rate, that is another matter. We are still working on \nit. It is not finished.\n  We still have out of the 13 appropriations bills I think 7 that are \nnot completed. That is what brought us, of course, to the shutdown of \nthe Government several weeks ago and to the controversy over that which \nallows for the potential of another one on the 14th or 15th of December \nwhen this continuing resolution runs out.\n  Some folks in the media have said, ``Oh, my gosh. That is just an \nadolescent food fight going on in Washington. These guys ought to grow \nup.'' It is not that, Mr. President. It is a very fundamental \ncontroversy over the direction of this Government--whether you are \ngoing to continue to spend more and more, or whether you are going to \nreduce the level of spending and come to a balanced budget. That is \nwhat it is about.\n  You will recall in the last one the confrontation between the \nRepublicans and the Democrats and the administration, which turned out \nto be a continuing agreement that said, yes, we will have a balanced \nbudget. We will participate in putting together a balanced budget. We \nwill commit to a balanced budget. We will commit to a balanced budget \nin 7 years, and we will commit to a balanced budget that is based on \nreal numbers, in this case the Congressional Budget Office numbers. \nHowever, there were some other words added--some words that are a \nlittle less easy to define, such as we are going to protect Medicare, \nwe are going to protect Medicaid, we are going to protect farmers, and \nwe are going to protect the environment. I do not know what that means. \nI suppose protection of those things can be interpreted to mean many \nthings. So that is where we are.\n  In addition, of course, to the appropriations comes a balanced budget \nbill which makes the changes in programs necessary to over 7 years \nbalance the budget. The toughest ones are entitlements. Congress really \nhas very little to do with the amount of money spent on entitlements. \nYou set up an entitlement. If you qualify, you get paid. Welfare is \none. So if you really want to do something about the rate of growth, \nyou finally have to do something about entitlements.\n\n  That is what this is about--and welfare, to make block grants to the \nStates so that they can, indeed, find growth that fits. My State of \nWyoming has different needs than Pennsylvania or New York. So the block \ngrants would allow for States to have the flexibility to put together \nprograms that do work.\n  Medicare--to change Medicare so that it does not go broke in the year \n2002, and, if we do not change it, it will. The question is not whether \nyou do something. The question is what do you do if you want to \ncontinue to have health care for the elderly.\n  So what has happened is that I think some have taken the position \nthat we need to make the changes needed, that you are going to have \ndifferent results, and you have to do some things differently. Others \nhave said, ``Well, I really do not want to do that. We can talk about \nbalancing the budget, but I am not sure I am for that today.'' Everyone \nwho stands up starts by saying, \n\n[[Page S17833]]\n``I am for a balanced budget'' and then goes on for another 30 minutes \nannouncing why he cannot, and becoming a defender of those programs \nwhich are kind of scare tactics. Some have called it mediscare, and \nsomehow you are going to do away with the benefits. It is not true, of \ncourse. We reduce the growth rate from 10.5, to 6.5. We reduce the \namounts available per beneficiary that will grow $4,700 to $6,700 over \nthis 7-year period.\n  So they say, ``Gosh. This is radical stuff. And you are tearing it \nall apart.'' Let me see how radical you think some of this is.\n  Mandatory Medicare spending will increase each and every year from \n$178 billion in 1995 to $289 billion in the year 2002. That is a 62-\npercent increase. That is radical reduction? Overall mandatory \nspending--overall mandatory spending would increase in each and every \nyear from $739 billion in 1995 to $1.93 trillion in 2002, a 48-percent \nincrease. Overall, Federal outlay--listen to this--will increase every \nyear from $1.518 trillion in 1995, what we spend now, to $1.856 \ntrillion in 2002, a 22-percent increase in total spending. But if you \nlisten to some of the Members of this body, if you listen to the media, \ndraconian cuts are taking place. And we are going to do something about \nit.\n  Here is what the minority leader said:\n\n       So, if we cannot get the Republicans to come off those \n     extreme positions, then I think we are advantaged in not \n     reaching an agreement.\n\n  Mr. President, reaching an agreement is I believe our responsibility. \nI believe it is the thing that we have to do.\n  I forgot to mention, of course, that what is going on here is the \nPresident has submitted two budgets, and neither of them balance. \nNeither of them were accepted. Neither of them have gotten any votes in \nthis Senate.\n  So we have to say, Is there a real effort made to do this? I hope so. \nI hope so. Collectively, for this country we need to make a move to \nbalance the budget. We have the best chance we have ever had. We are on \nthe way to doing that. We can do it in 7 years. We can do it with real \nnumbers. We can do it, and provide the benefits that need to be \nprovided. We simply need to have the will. Frankly, we need to have the \nwill to come to the snubbing post, and say, ``Here is what we need to \ndo.''\n  Now the notion is that it is all pain. Let me tell you it is not. A \nbalanced budget will bring a good deal of stability to this country \nthat will help the markets, that will reduce interest rates so that on \nyour home, as some have suggested, it could be up to $2,000 a year in \nsavings in interest on a long-term date.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been listening to the Senator from Wyoming. He hit \nupon something here I do not think people are fully aware of or \nsensitive to, and that is the effect what we are doing here is having \non the markets. We keep hearing if something happens, that there is an \nimpasse, it is going to have a deteriorating effect. The markets have \nbeen very good. Interest rates are low. Things are going very well \nright now mostly because of the anticipation of the fact we are going \nto have a balanced budget.\n  I can remember so well, as the Senator can remember, when we had the \ndiscussion on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and we \nlost it by one or two votes and what happened to the markets after that \nand the devaluation of the dollar against the yen and the mark. The \ndeterioration was unprecedented. And so I would suggest that what the \nSenator from Wyoming says is true. There is nothing we could do that \nwould enhance the optimistic future of the economy than to go ahead and \ntake this Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and pass it.\n  I do not think most people are aware, Mr. President, that we have \npassed a Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which essentially does what the \nPresident committed to do during the last continuing resolution. It \ndoes provide for a balanced budget, and it uses real numbers, CBO \nnumbers, those numbers that come from the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich the President stood before a joint session of the legislature and \nsaid is the most reliable source that we can use, so we can end smoke \nand mirrors and we can handle what is out there.\n  The thing that concerns me more than anything else, and I ask the \nSenator from Wyoming if he agrees, is that we have passed a budget. It \ndoes what the American people asked us to do in November of 1994. And \nthe President does not have a budget. So while I am not in on the \nnegotiations, how do you negotiate when you have a budget and the other \nside does not have one? I wondered if the Senator had figured that out \nyet.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma asks a difficult \nquestion. I do not know, nor am I in on the negotiations. If there is \nbona fide negotiations, both sides need to put their proposals on the \ntable and find some common ground and there can be some adjustment.\n  I think the key feature to the Republican proposal to balancing the \nbudget is to have a spending limit. Within that spending limit, there \nare choices, priorities of how you do that. The key is to be able to \nhave projections out into the future using CBO numbers with the \ncontribution of the OMB and whoever else has knowledge, to have that \nprojection and use the same numbers so that you are not using smoke and \nmirrors. Most anybody can balance the budget if they find some numbers \nthat show revenues increasing out all the time and then it does not \nmaterialize. We have done some of that before. On the contrary, we \nought to use the more conservative number so if we are wrong, we will \nerr to have more surplus rather than less and add that to the reduction \nof the deficit and keep spending down.\n  So the Senator from Oklahoma is exactly right. If there is going to \nbe bona fide negotiation, you need to come to the table with some \nideas. And we are dedicated to doing that. So I hope that we do.\n  Let me yield the floor so that my friend from Oklahoma may proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17831-8", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17833-S17836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CRITICAL TIMES IN AMERICA\n\n\n                        The Budget Negotiations\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly agree with the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. I have to say also that the people of Oklahoma, a lot of \ntimes--say you are reading these polls, and people are saying, well, we \nreally do not want to balance the budget yet; let us wait until the \nPresident gets back; we do not want to be too harsh. There is a myth \nthat is floating around that we are going to be cutting Medicare when \nin fact we are saving Medicare, and without our doing that, according \nto his own board of trustees, Medicare would go under.\n  I believe that when I go back, as I do every weekend, to Oklahoma and \nI talk to what I refer to--and it has offended several people in this \nChamber--as real people, they tell me that they do not want us to back \ndown. They say that this is our opportunity to have a balanced budget.\n  I can stand on the floor of this Senate and say in my honest opinion \nthis is the last opportunity probably in my lifetime that we will have \nto have a balanced budget. And if we cave in now, we are not going to \nbe able to have it. I do not think we will have another chance. And I \nthink the President has every intention of having us cave in because he \nhas a lot of discretionary programs he wants to keep funding. He is \nholding on to the past with white knuckles, to the last 30 years of \nreckless spending that has brought us where we are today, and he is \ntrying to use the very sensitive argument that we cannot do this to all \nthese people, that there are all these programs that are going to be \ncut, which are not going to be cut.\n  I would say that if you want to make a moral issue out of this, the \nmoral issue is to go ahead with this, with the Balanced Budget Act of \n1995, which passed in this Chamber and they passed in the House of \nRepresentatives, and get this passed because if we do not do it, we \nknow what we are subjecting our future generations to. Many Members in \nthis body are much younger than I am, and they have young families. I \nhave grandchildren coming up now. One is due any minute now. If we do \nnot change the trend that we established in the 1960's and that has \ncontinued until today, a person born today is \n\n[[Page S17834]]\ngoing to have to pay 82 percent of his or her lifetime income just to \nservice the Government.\n  I do not think that is what we want. I know that is not what the \nAmerican people want. But some people just do not want to change. Some \npeople refuse to look at the elections and the postelection analyses \nand polls that said very distinctly that the American people in \nNovember 1994 voted for a change, a change from the Great Society \nprograms of the 1960's that have been perpetuating themselves and \ngrowing ever since then. So I think this is the last chance we have.\n  This is our last stand. I encourage the negotiators to keep that in \nmind. I am talking about Republicans and Democrats. It is too important \nto future generations.\n\n\n                         U.S. Troops in Bosnia\n\n  It is ironic now that we have two things that are going on that are \nvery, very critical to all of America, not just this budget matter that \nwe have been talking about--and the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \nis right when he draws the attention to the significance of what is \ngoing on--but something else is happening, too. My frustration, which I \nhave expressed in the Chamber every day for the last several days, is \nthat while the President is out rejoicing in his new posture of being \nthe international peacemaker in Belfast and other places, time is going \nby and American troops as we speak are being sent to Bosnia. It goes \nall the way back to 2\\1/2\\ years ago when this President made a \ndecision to do airdrops into Bosnia. I can remember serving in the \nother body at that time and asking the question: You are doing \nairdrops. How do you know that the stuff you are dropping is going to \nthe good guys instead of the bad guys? And the response in that \ncommittee meeting was: ``Well, we do not know.'' There was a \nhesitation. This was the military talking: ``I am not sure that we know \nwho the good guys and the bad guys are.''\n  I think if you take any snapshot in the history of Bosnia over the \nlast 500 years, you could come to the conclusion legitimately that the \nSerbs are the bad guys or the Croats are the bad guys or even the \nMoslems are the bad guys. If you look at what has happened in the last \nweek over there, people have been killed, tortured; there have been \nuprisings. I read from several articles yesterday of the hostile area \nand what is happening over there.\n  The mayor of a town not far from where the Senator was when he was \nover there said, speaking in behalf of the people--we hear a lot of the \nmilitary, of the three known factions and of the rogue groups that are \nover there but these are civilians--he says, ``We will still fight, and \nif the multinational force tries to drive us from our homes or take \naway our right to defend ourselves, there will be no authority on \nEarth, including the Serbian authorities, that can stop us. We will not \nleave, we will not withdraw, and we will not live under Moslem rule.''\n  This is coming from an area that is going to be under Moslem rule if \nthis initial peace accord would take place. And you have another big \ngroup, too, not just those who have found happy homes and feel that \nthey ought to be able to stay in those homes. You also have what I have \nbeen stating as 3 million, but I know the conservative figure is 2 \nmillion, refugees that we can identify in those areas, and they are \nscattered throughout Bosnia. We have heard from all of the sources--our \nEmbassy people, the military people, U.N. people, Gen. Rupert Smith, \nthe British general who is in charge of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, as \nwe speak--that more than 50 percent of these 2 million refugees, under \nthe plan that we have here, will not be able to return to their homes.\n  What does a refugee want to do? If you have peace, it means you get \nto go home. More than half of these will not get to go home. So you are \ngoing to have new rogue elements rising up.\n  Just this morning in the newspapers--I will just read one part of an \narticle here that said, ``The worst problem though is likely''--keep in \nmind this is an article that showed this morning 10 more American \nsoldiers showed up. There are only 10. I understand that is not a very \nlarge number. But tomorrow it will be 10 more, the next day 10 more; \nthen larger and larger numbers will be coming because that is the \nPresident's plan, as he hides over in Europe and allows more and more \nof our soldiers to go over to put us in a position where we have to \nsupport him to send ground troops in.\n\n       The worst problem though is likely to be minefields. There \n     are believed to be millions of mines of all shapes and sizes \n     in the Tuzla region. There are mines everywhere. And neither \n     side has maps. We have to move one centimeter at a time.\n\n  This is a quote from the lieutenant colonel who works directly under \nGeneral Haukland, the Norwegian general that I talked to in Tuzla. He \nalso said that in the past 3 weeks his men have demined nearly 300 \nyards of road. Heavy snowfall will only complicate the problem. This is \nthe very ground that I stood on 3 weeks ago in the Tuzla area. There \nare only two Members of Congress who went up into that area, Senator \nHank Brown from Colorado and myself. We stood there. And I can tell you \nthat there are mines there. These reports are accurate. That is where \nwe are going to be having some 25,000 Americans up in that region.\n  Yesterday we showed a map--and I said, I do not know who did the \nnegotiating for the United States of America--where we ended up with \nthe northeast sector, the most hostile area. But that is where we are. \nAnd we are there very clearly today.\n  So, that is what we are faced with. And I think it is time to draw \nsome other lines, too. I know that the President is over in Europe \nright now, believing that we are going to end up being able to vote to \nsupport his program.\n  Let me just serve notice to the U.S. Senate at this time, there are \nnot going to be any free rides on this deal. A lot of people are \nsaying, well, let us have a weak resolution or wait until we have so \nmany troops over there and say we are going to support our troops. Sure \nwe are going to support our troops. But now is when we can make a \ndecision and say, ``Mr. President, you are wrong. We do not want you to \nsend ground troops into Bosnia.''\n  There is going to be a recorded vote. We might as well know it. By \nthe way, I went back and did some research just this morning. If you \nremember back in 1991, when George Bush was President of the United \nStates, George Bush wanted to send troops into the Persian Gulf. We all \nrecognized that we did have strategic interests in the Persian Gulf. \nOur ability to fight a war was dependent upon our protecting those \ninterests in the Persian Gulf.\n  There are no strategic interests in Bosnia. But I would like to read \nsome things. I am reading this for one reason; that is, that there was \na lunch that took place just a couple days ago where the President \ntalked to the Democrats of this Senate. And the word I got is they are \nall going to line up, that they all agreed that they would support the \nPresident in sending ground troops in.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. This has been an interesting process. Certainly everyone \nsubscribes to the notion that the President has some authorities--in \nthe case of emergencies and in the case of war. But it seems to me that \nthe Congress also has some responsibilities as representatives of the \npeople. It seems to me what has happened is when we get into these \nsituations, like in Bosnia--it has been going on now for 3 years--and \nthen there comes, ``Well, we're going to have a peace agreement, so we \ncan't talk to you about it until we get a peace agreement. We don't \nwant you to get involved here until there's a peace agreement.'' Then \nwhen there is a peace agreement, the answer is, ``Well, we've already \ngot a peace agreement, so there's nothing for you to do.''\n  Does it strike the Senator that we are essentially being left out of \nany decisions, those of us who represent our States?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly what is happening, I would respond to the \nSenator from Wyoming. I am particularly sensitive to this because I \nserve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Let us take this out of a \npartisan realm, because I opposed--it was George Bush, not Bill \nClinton, who originally sent troops into Somalia. I was opposed to it \nat that time. It was supposed to be, as I recall, a 45-day humanitarian \nmission to open up the routes so we could send humanitarian goods in. \n\n[[Page S17835]]\n\n  Then, of course, he went out of office. President Clinton came in. \nAnd each month--and the Senator from Wyoming will remember this because \nhe and I were both serving in the other body when this happened--each \nmonth we sent a resolution to the President saying, bring back our \ntroops from Somalia. We did not have any strategic interest there that \nrelated to our Nation's security. And he did not do it. And he did not \ndo it. And he did not do it. It was not until 18 of our Rangers were \nbrutally murdered in Somalia and their corpses dragged through the \nstreets of Mogadishu that the people finally stood up and said, ``We \nhave had enough,'' and we brought them home.\n  I do not want that to happen in Bosnia. But the Senator is exactly \nright, the President sends these troops all over the world. Then he \ncomes back for an emergency supplemental. That puts us in the position \nthat, if we do not vote for the emergency supplemental which might \nviolate everything we are trying to do with our budget balancing \neffort, he will take the amount of money out of the existing military \nbudget, which is already down to the bare bones anyway. We went through \nthis in this Chamber just a few weeks a ago, a $1.4 billion emergency \nsupplemental to take care of all these Haiti and Somalia episodes.\n  Now there is some talk about the cost of this war in Bosnia. They are \ntrying to say it is between $1.5 and $2 billion. The cost figures that \nI get are far greater than that. There have been many people who have \nevaluated that and come up with figures from $4.5 to $6 billion. So \nthere is a dollar consideration here as well as a human life \nconsideration.\n  The Senator is exactly right, we are being put in a situation where \nthe people of this Nation cannot be heard in decisions as critical as \nrisking American lives in a war-infested place like Bosnia. We are \nirrelevant. It does not matter what we say or do. This is what the \nPresident apparently is telling us.\n  But I was going to go back in history to 1991 just for a moment to \nread some of the arguments that I heard from the other side of the \naisle. I repeat again, there are not going to be any free rides on this \nthing because we are going to have recorded votes. I will not mention \nthe names of all of them because I do not think doing so would serve \nany useful purpose, but these are mostly in the leadership of the \nDemocrat side, those who I understand are going to be supporting the \nPresident in his effort to send 25,000 or more troops into that war-\ninfested area.\n  ``Some argue that we must go''--this is 1991. This is when we had \nsecurity interests in the Persian Gulf. ``Some argue that we must go to \nprevent a coalition from falling apart. I disagree. The use of American \nmilitary should not be a substitute for the weakness of any coalition. \nAmerica is not 911 for every problem.'' I would say there is no more \naccurate statement that could describe what has been happening up in \nDayton, OH, for the last several weeks.\n  Here is one here. It says, ``The worst-case scenario''--again 1991, \nDemocrats arguing against sending troops into the Persian Gulf. ``The \nworst-case scenario could have us losing thousands and thousands of \nyoung Americans. The worst-case scenario could have us bogged down for \nmonths and months and maybe years. This is not an easy war to be \nfought. And this is not a war that ought to be fought.''\n  If there is any war that should not be fought, it is the war in the \nBalkans. We do not even know who the good guys and the bad guys are. If \nthis were a snapshot in history, 50 years ago it would be the Croats, \nnot the Serbs, that would be the bad guys. And you could go to any \nother time in history and find that to be true.\n  This is another prominent Democrat who made this statement on the \nfloor of this body. ``I cannot back a policy I believe is ill-advised, \nwhen Americans' lives hang in the balance, just for the sake of \ndisplaying a united front.''\n  Is that not the argument we have been hearing? We have to have this \nunited front, we have to protect the integrity of NATO at any cost, \nparticularly American lives, at any financial cost. We heard yesterday \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska talking about that so far we have \nfunded 70 percent of the cost of the efforts over there in the Balkans, \nand yet we are farther away than anybody else in the alliance.\n  Here is one that I think is one of the best. It says, ``But do these \ngoals''--1991--``qualify as a sufficient reason to suffer the tragic \nloss of American life, especially before we have exhausted every \navailable alternative? My deep conviction is no, no they do not. I \ncannot look my 17-year-old son and my 19-year-old daughter in the eye \nand say, `Moving Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, obtaining the necessary \noil from the Persian Gulf, protecting our allies or saving jobs is \nworth your life.' I cannot say that. If at this time I cannot say that \nto them, how in good conscience can I say it to a mother or a father? \nHow can I say it to a sister or brother?''\n  I came back from that northeast sector of Bosnia, around the Tuzla \narea, and I stopped on the way back at the 1st Armored Division \ntraining area in Germany, where I think the Senator from Wyoming has \nbeen. And he probably talked to some of the troops, as I did.\n  I went by and had breakfast in the mess hall with these guys and gals \nwho were being trained in that 12-by-6 mile box that they said is \nsupposed to emulate the terrain of Bosnia. It did not look anymore like \nthe terrain of Bosnia than the hill around Washington, DC does. But \nthey are out there training. They are getting good training. They are \npreparing themselves mentally to be deployed, but they are saying: ``We \nhaven't been told yet why we're going.''\n  I think in all fairness to the officials and those officers who are \nin charge over there--and I have the utmost respect for General Yates \nand General Nash--that they themselves do not have a clear \nunderstanding of what their mission is.\n  The President, in his very eloquent, persuasive speech 3 days ago, \nsaid we have a clear and concise mission, but he never told us what \nthat mission was. He never told us what the rules of engagement were. I \ndo not think--I suspect--our own troops, the ones over there today, do \nnot really have a well-defined understanding of what our rules of \nengagement are.\n  We hear about the conditions under which we can withdraw, like 12 \nmonths, a time condition, systemic violations. What is a systemic \nviolation to a corporal out in the field who gets fired upon? Does that \nfirepower come from a Serb element or from a Croatian element, or maybe \nfrom one of these rogue elements or a Moslem element? He will not have \nany way of knowing, and yet that could, in fact, be a systemic \nviolation, because a systemic violation--which they have not yet \ndefined--I have to assume it is something systemic, meaning the entire \nelement is acting as a group--whether it be the Croats, Serbs, or \nMoslems--and are breaking the peace accord.\n  Well, I do not think there is any way of determining how that could \nbe enforced.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I was struck by your quotation on the necessity to \nmaintain the alliance. I was, as you pointed out, in Bosnia about a \nmonth ago. Seven of us went to Sarajevo. We also met in Brussels with \nthe NATO group, and all 16 of the Ambassadors were there, as a matter \nof fact. Each of them stood up in order and almost as if by pushing a \nbutton said, ``Why, we just can't do this without the leadership of the \nUnited States.''\n  The President is now in Europe. I guess I would say, what would you \nexpect Europeans to do with him there? Of course, they will applaud the \nUnited States taking the burden, paying the major part of the bill and \nthe major part of having troops on the ground. I think it is a very \nthoughtful way of promoting this idea.\n  We were also struck about this very same question. Here are our U.S. \nsoldiers. They are going in there, according to the plan, to be \npeacekeepers. So then what happens if you are attacked by an armed \ngroup and you respond? The notion is, and I think properly, that you \ncan respond to defend yourself. We asked the general of the European \ngroup what happens if there is an organized effort. ``Well, then we \nleave, because we are not there to fight the war.''\n  It is very indecisive in terms of what they do. And I agree with the \nSenator \n\n[[Page S17836]]\nthat certainly you can say that the goal is well defined but, in fact, \nit has not been well defined.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator from Wyoming, since he was in the Sarajevo \narea, I am sure observed the same thing I did. Keep in mind, this is \nthe area where there has been fighting only in the last week, since \nthis accord, if that is what it is, has been initialed.\n  The problem that I see over there is that there is no way to define \nwho the other side is in Sarajevo. In Sarajevo, we have a convolution \nof parties that have come in and taken up the vacuum that has been left \nby the pounding of the various dwellings--the single-family dwellings \nand apartment buildings--in Sarajevo. The true inhabitants of those \ndwellings, those wonderful people who were there during the winter \nOlympics, are not there anymore, and the ones who are in there now are \nrefugees. We do not know where they came from. We do not know if they \nare Serbs, Croatians, or any other, perhaps rogue, element. So it makes \nit that much more difficult.\n  Before yielding to the Senator from Georgia, let me just make one \nother comment about something that the Senator from Wyoming said. He \nused the term ``peacekeeping.'' I suggest to you now that they are not \nusing peacekeeping. If there is ever a classic area for mission creep, \nthis is it, because we have already crept from peacekeeping to peace \nimplementation.\n  There is a big difference between peacekeeping and peace \nimplementation. Peacekeeping is an assumption that there is peace to \nkeep. We know there is not peace to keep. The President stood and he \nsaid the war is over, we are in a cease-fire. I stood in Tuzla and \nheard areas where the war is not over. There is firing up there. The \nPresident has not been there so perhaps he does not know and perhaps \nhis advisers are not adequately advising.\n  Before we go back to a budget discussion, I want to state again what \nI stated yesterday. I may be one last Senator standing alone, but I am \ngoing to fight with every fiber of my being to stop the President from \nthis obsession he has been living with for a year and a half, and that \nis to send American troops on the ground in Bosnia.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I am very concerned with the discussion we were having earlier about \nwhat is happening in our budget battle. I guess I will sign off by \nstating at least my position.\n  We passed a good bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, through this \nbody and through the other body. It is one that is consistent with the \nmandates of the election of 1994, and I do believe that we have done a \ngood job.\n  I certainly encourage the President to use the guidelines he \ncommitted to during the last CR--that is, a balanced budget in 7 years \nusing real numbers--and come up with something that is acceptable.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator should be aware, under morning business, the Senator has \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Unanimous consent is approved for 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17833-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17836-S17837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PUT THE FISCAL HOUSE OF GOVERNMENT IN ORDER\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to respond to the remarks of the \ngood Senator and my colleague from Oklahoma who has closed his remarks \nby talking about the importance of a balanced budget. Let me take just \na minute to frame where we are.\n  It has been a rigorous year, and both the House and the Senate have \nnow passed a Balanced Budget Act, just before Thanksgiving. This is the \nfirst time that this has happened in nearly three decades--a Balanced \nBudget Act in response to the American people. The American people have \nsaid over and over to put the fiscal house of their Government in \norder, like they have to do at home.\n  We have done it. We came here with a promise, and we have passed a \nbalanced budget. We are sending it to the President. This balanced \nbudget balances it in 7 years, reforms welfare, saves Medicare and \nlowers taxes. That is our plan.\n  There are currently meetings underway with representatives of the \nSenate and the House and the administration. They have not been \nproductive as yet, because there is no balanced budget proposal from \nthe President.\n  The President says he is going to veto this first balanced budget \nthat the Congress has sent him. He said, ``I will not accept it.'' That \nis his prerogative, but my question to the President is this: Where is \nyour plan?\n  We have done our job. We have made our best faith effort. We have \nsent a rational and reasonable plan to the President. With all the \ndebate and discussions in Washington, you almost have to step back from \nit to measure the reasonableness of it because all the financial \nmarkets in America are responding positively. The stock market is up. \nInterest rates are dropping. The people in the real world, the people \nrunning businesses and running families all across the land, are \nresponding positively to what we have done.\n  It is time for the President to tell the country and to tell these \nconferees what his plan is.\n  Back when I was in high school, they would say, ``The jig is up.'' We \nhave done our work; we have laid the plan before him. He says it is not \nacceptable. Give us your plan, Mr. President. Then we can work the two \nplans together. But this business of criticizing our plan while you \nhave none of your own cannot go on, and America will not accept it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk just a moment about what our plan \ndoes and why it is so reasonable. Take Medicare. The trustees told us \nthat Medicare will go out of business in 6 years--broke, bankrupt. It \nsaid that the Congress and the President need to step forward and do \nsomething about it. Our balanced budget plan does just that. It expands \nMedicare because it expands the investment in it over the next 7 years \nby 65 percent. It grows 65 percent larger under our plan. It takes the \nsolvency of it and expands it from the 6 years that are left and pushes \nthe solvency of the plan out almost a quarter of a century. And it \nexpands the choices people can make about the kind of coverage they \nwant.\n  We increase Social Security spending 44 percent. We increase the size \nof Medicaid 65 percent. We increase overall Federal outlays 22 percent. \nThe U.S. economy, we are told, will grow $32 billion in new disposable \nincome. We will create 6.1 million new jobs. We will have $66 billion \nin new purchases and 100,000 new housing starts. Ten million more \nAmericans will be able to purchase their first home. We will lower \ninterest payments on the average family's mortgage by $1,500 to $2,000 \nper year. We will lower the interest payments on their car $200 per \nyear. We will lower the interest payments on their student loan or the \nback porch another $200 a year. Because of the tax credits of $500 per \nchild, in the average family we are going to add another thousand \ndollars of disposable income.\n  The bottom line here is, we are creating new jobs, new businesses, \nnew homes, and we are putting between $2,000 and $3,000 of new \ndisposable income on the kitchen table of every average American \nfamily. We depend on the family to nurture and grow America, to house \nAmerica, to educate America. That is where we need to put our \nresources--on the kitchen tables in Hahira, GA, Denver, CO, or Keokuk, \nIA. That is where the resources need to be, not sent to Washington and \nredistributed by a bunch of policy mongers. We will help local \ngovernment.\n\n  In my State alone, the balanced budget amendment will create $333 \nmillion over 7 years--$333 million; that is a third of a billion \ndollars--in lower interest payments for the State government of \nGeorgia. In my capital city, Atlanta, we will save $100 million over 7 \nyears in lower interest payments. That is a boon to a city putting on \nthe Olympics next year, which is pressed from every corner to meet its \nneeds. And $100 million would be saved. In all, $29 billion will be \nsaved by local governments over the next 7 years--$29 billion--because \nwe have balanced our budget. \n\n[[Page S17837]]\n\n  A lot of people, including the President, who talk about the balanced \nbudget, talk about it as if it is a painful exercise, a dreadful \nexperience that we have to drag America through. It is the exact \nreverse. By taking charge of our budget, by managing our affairs, we \nstrengthen every quadrant of America, and we keep the country strong \nand healthy so that it can keep on taking care of those who fall \nthrough the safety net.\n  Mr. President, this is history in the making. We have done our job. \nWe have put forward a really solid plan to take charge of America's \nfinances, to help every family in the country and to make America \nstrong as it comes to the new century. Now it is on the President's \ndesk. He promised America he would balance the budget in 5 years. He \npromised America the other day that he would join us in balancing it in \n7 years. It is time for him to fulfill that promise to the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17836-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be brief. Mr. President, I rise to \nspeak along the same lines as the Senator from Georgia and talk a \nlittle bit about our apparent budget impasse. We are told--and I read \nin the media--that political advisers to the President have urged him \nto resist negotiations, to allow an impasse to continue, to \ntheoretically take the impasse to the American electorate a year from \nnow. That has resulted, as far as I can tell, in very limited \ndiscussions so far, limited efforts on the part of the administration \nto negotiate, and no plan by the administration with respect to \nbalancing the budget, protecting Medicare, or any of the other vital \npriorities in this country.\n  I do not know what the President's decision will be. I do know what I \nread to be the advice he is receiving from his political counselors. I \ndo not know, he may well decide to take the politically expedient \ncourse here, Mr. President. Before he does, I hope the President will \nconsider the implications of taking the advice of the political experts \nas to what is good for next year's election and understand the \nconsequences of doing that, because if an impasse continues for a year, \nif the President is responsible for there not being a balanced budget \npassed, it means a lot of very critical, I think, things for the \nAmerican people. It means, number one, that we will not deal with the \nproblem of Medicare insolvency that is staring this country in the \nface.\n  As the Senator from Georgia has already indicated, we stand on the \nbrink of having part A in the Medicare trust fund bankrupt in just 6 \nyears. If the President does not negotiate in good faith, if he plays \nthe political card his advisers are recommending, then he will not \nsign, next week, the bill that would protect Medicare and keep the \ntrust fund solvent.\n  If the President continues the impasse, if the advisers, the \npolitical folks at the White House, are successful, it will also mean, \nI believe, very detrimental things for our economy. We have been very \nfortunate in recent weeks, as we have seen the stock market go up and \ninterest rates go down. There is a very clear reason for that, and the \nanalysts on Wall Street and elsewhere in this country all say the same \nthing. They say that the economy and the markets are reacting to the \nbelief that we will have significant deficit reduction when this budget \nprocess is over.\n  Mr. President, if they conclude that the President prefers an impasse \nfor political reasons, then I think the robust stock market and the \nlower interest rates will be short-lived. Then the President will have \nto explain why interest rates are going back up again and why the \nmarket is going down.\n  But most important, if the President heeds the advice of the \npolitical counselors, instead of doing what is right for this country, \nthe impact will be felt greatest by the families of America, because if \nwe fail to take advantage of this unique opportunity we have right now, \nMr. President, to bring the budget under control and to put us on a \npath toward balance, what it means for the families, as the Senator \nfrom Georgia just indicated, is very, very considerable.\n  It means continuing interest rates at levels beyond what they need to \nbe. It means people paying more for their mortgage, more for their car \npayment, more for their student loans than they need to make. It means \nWashington continuing to make more money and keeping it here and making \ndecisions for the families of America that they ought to make \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, I hope when the President returns from his trip to \nEurope that he will reject the opinion of the political advisers, \nreject the notion of allowing a long impasse to continue, reject the \nnotion of refusing to negotiate upfront in good faith and with his own \nplan, and instead come to the table, begin the discussions that I think \nare necessary for us to bring about the kind of balanced budget that we \nhave passed here in the Senate and the Congress and for the American \npeople, the first balanced budget in a quarter of a century.\n  I hope that the President decides that the political advisers are not \nwhat matters and that next year's election is not what matters, but it \nis the future of this country, the future of our children that matter.\n  If he does, he will join the Republicans in seeking to balance the \nbudget, seeking to end the impasse, and most importantly, seeking to \nprotect future generations.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I want to rise to speak, as many of my \ncolleagues have, on two very important issues that the Senate is facing \nright now.\n  I think there are great differences between the administration's \nposition and the position of Congress. The first, of course, is the \nbalanced budget. We are trying to keep the promise we made to the \npeople that we will have a balanced budget in 7 years. The President \nhas altered his position, starting in his campaign with a 5-year \nbalanced budget, but then after he was elected saying, ``Well, 10 years \nis good enough, 9 years, 8 years.''\n  Now he has committed to a 7-year balanced budget. The only problem is \nthe President is doing what he has been doing for the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, and that is giving lip service now to a 7-year balanced budget, \nbut his offer on the table is, ``I need $7 billion or $8 billion more \nin spending.'' Fine, Mr. President. Where are we going to take that \nspending from? Silence from the White House.\n\n  That is not the kind of leadership that we need if we are going to \ntruly sit down with a commitment to a 7-year balanced budget and say, \n``All right, here are the parameters, here are the spending limits. Now \nlet's negotiate within these parameters.'' You cannot say, I need $7 \nbillion out of the sky, but yes, I am committed to a 7-year balanced \nbudget, but I am not going to suggest where we would take it from. That \nis because the tough decisions are always the decisions on where you \nhave to cut or slow spending or eliminate programs that do not work.\n  When it comes to the rubber meeting the road, we have to cut \nspending. That is how we are going to meet the test. Mr. President, $7 \nbillion more to spend, without saying where it is going to come from, \nis always the easy position.\n  I would love to spend the money on these programs. There is probably \nnot one of them that is not a good program. But does it meet the test \nof our taxpayers feeling that it is worth their hard-earned dollars to \nput money in these programs rather than live within our means, like \nevery household and every small business in this country must do. That \nis the question, and that is the test we are facing right now.\n  When I am home, people say to me, ``Don't blink.'' I am here to say, \nwe are not going to blink. We are going to do what is right for this \ncountry. I hope the President will come to the table and say not only \nwhere he would like \n\n[[Page S17838]]\nto spend more money but from where he believes we should take it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17837-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The second point I want to make, Mr. President, and \nit is very much in the forefront right now, and that is the situation \nwhere the President has asked for our support to send troops to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we should send troops to Bosnia, and I \ndo not feel that the President has made the case, made the difference, \nshown the difference, between a national interest and a national \nsecurity interest that would warrant the loss of our precious American \nlives.\n  Our young American men and women that signed up to be in the military \ndid sign up knowing that they might be put in harm's way. They did that \nwillingly because they believed that they should be able and willing \nand ready to fight for our freedom, and to protect the freedom and \nstrength of the United States of America.\n\n  There is one thing implicit, Mr. President, in that decision. That is \nthat we would have the judgment to send them where our national \nsecurity interest was at stake. I do not think our national security \ninterest is at stake, Mr. President.\n  That is why I am so strongly urging that the President reconsider, \nthat the President look at what is happening right now. People talking \nabout changing the agreement in Paris that has been already initialed \nin Dayton; Serbs talking about not thinking Americans are neutral in \nthis; talking about throwing rocks at Americans when they come in.\n  Mr. President, can we be thinking of the security of those troops as \nwe are wondering if this is a national security issue that should \nwarrant the loss of their lives? Mr. President, I do not think the case \nhas been made.\n  I am going to fight it in every way that I can. I think we have other \noptions to support the people of Bosnia. I do want to support those \npeople. They have suffered greatly. I want to help them. There are many \nways that we can.\n  I do not think American troops on the ground should be the only test \nto show that we are committed to the people of Bosnia. We are \ncommitted. We can show it in many other ways.\n  I want to keep our troops home. I want to save our troops for when \nthere is a security threat to the United States.\n  We can go out and help the people of the world who are not as \nfortunate as we are, and we are a generous people and we will do that. \nBut giving our lives in those causes is not what I think is necessary, \nnor is it the responsible role of Congress to let it happen. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17838-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17838-S17839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, obviously the issue of Bosnia has the \nattention of America, as it well should because American soldiers are \nbeing put in harm's way. We as a nation should equally focus on the \nissue of these negotiations that are going on between Congress and the \nPresident over how we reach a balanced budget, because as our soldiers \nare in harm's way in the immediate sense, as they move into Bosnia, our \nNation is clearly in harm's way as a result of the continued deficits \nwhich we run and the fact that we are putting our children's future at \nrisk by presenting them with a nation that is bankrupt if we do not get \nunder control our national debt.\n  So I think it is important to review where we stand and try to \nreflect on what the two sides present. Where we stand is that about a \nweek and a half ago, this Nation's Government essentially came to a \nstandstill, stopped, because we could not agree on whether or not we \nshould reach a balanced budget.\n  The Republicans had put forward a balanced budget bill and we passed \nit. It says that we should reach a balanced budget in 7 years. That is \nnot an excessively short amount of time. In fact, it is probably too \nmuch time. We should probably be reaching a balanced budget sooner. But \nwe agreed to 7 years because we felt that was something that could be \nattained and which was reasonable.\n  The administration, the President specifically, had said, over a \nperiod of time, they were for a balanced budget also. He said \nspecifically he was for a balanced budget, at one time in 5 years. He \nhad said he was for a balanced budget in 6 years. He had said he was \nfor a balanced budget in 7 years. He had said he was for a balanced \nbudget in 8 years. He had said he was for a balanced budget in 9 years. \nAnd he had said he was for a balanced budget in 10 years. We chose 7 \nyears. We thought that was right about in the middle of the different \nproposals he had put forward and we hoped he would be comfortable with \nit.\n  As a result of the closure of the Government, there was an agreement \nfinally reached and the administration has now stated they are \ncommitted to balancing the budget in 7 years and that they are \ncommitted to doing that using, as an independent scoring agency to \ndetermine the fairness and accuracy of the numbers, the Congressional \nBudget Office. That is a major step forward, obviously, in the process.\n  It is unfortunate that it took a shutdown of the Government to \naccomplish that. We, as Republicans, remember, were willing to go \nforward to reach a balanced budget. We had actually passed the \nresolution to accomplish that with specifics, without requiring that \nthe Government be shut down. It was the administration which would not \ncome to the table until there was a Government shutdown, which would \nnot agree to a balanced budget until there was a Government shutdown.\n  So, as we move into the process of revising the history books, which \nalways seems to occur after events take place, let us remember that \nRepublicans had already committed to a 7-year balanced budget prior to \nthe shutdown and that the shutdown--the outcome of the shutdown was \nthat the administration also agreed to a 7-year balanced budget. So, \nsomething was accomplished by the shutdown. It was unfortunate it was \nnecessary. But what was accomplished was that this administration \nfinally settled on a number, 7 years, for a balanced budget. Now we \nproceed with the negotiations as to how we get there.\n  I have to say, I have been watching these negotiations, as I suspect \nmany of us have--although we have been distracted, clearly, by the \nBosnia situation--and I have become concerned because, while we have \nput forward a plan, the Republicans have put forward a plan which is \nvery specific and which in real terms accomplishes what is necessary to \nget this country's fiscal house in order so we will be passing on to \nour children a nation which is financially solvent rather than a Nation \nthat is bankrupt, we have, as yet, seen nothing from the administration \nin terms of specifics.\n  Where is their budget plan that gets us to balance? We have ours on \nthe table--3,000 pages. In fact, the other side of the aisle had great \nentertainment, making fun of the length of our proposal. It is a \nlengthy proposal because it is a specific proposal and a real proposal. \nWhat we need to see from the administration are specifics as to how \nthey wish to get to a balanced budget. It is very difficult, I suspect, \nfor those negotiating in this process to be negotiating without one \nside being willing to come forward and say what they are willing to do.\n\n  So I think it is incumbent on the folks who follow this process, \nrecognizing we are all a bit distracted, and rightly so, by what is \nhappening in Bosnia and the immediate threat to our American soldiers--\nbut, even in the context of that I think it is incumbent upon all of us \nin this country to be asking the question, ``How does this President \nintend to get to a balanced budget in 7 years? What are his \nproposals?''\n  We saw his budget that he sent up here in June. That was a 10-year \nbudget. It did not get to balance. In fact it had deficits of $200 \nbillion for the entire 10-year period, each year for the 10-year \nperiod. For this administration to get to balance, they must come \nforward with proposals which slow the rate of Federal spending by \napproximately $750 billion over the next 7 years. We have come forward \nwith proposals that do that. Where are the administration proposals? \n\n[[Page S17839]]\n\n  My sense is that they do not want to come forward with proposals \nbecause they are not sincere, to be quite honest. I do not believe they \nare sincere. If they were sincere they would come forward with these \nproposals. But the fact that they have not raises serious doubts as to \ntheir sincerity in their efforts. I hope I am wrong but, as of right \nnow, I think the facts show I am right. I think the American people \nshould start asking themselves what type of administration, what \nphilosophy of Government allows the executive branch to agree to a 7-\nyear timeframe for reaching a balanced budget but refuses to come \nforward and define how they are going to get to that balanced budget? \nWhat is the philosophy of an administration that does that?\n  I do not believe it is a philosophy that is sincerely committed to a \nbalanced budget. I believe it is a philosophy that is more involved in \nthe politics of the issue than the substance of the issue. That is the \nproblem. We cannot afford, as a nation, any longer to be involved in \nthe politics. We need to be involved with the substance of the balanced \nbudget. In order to get involved in the substance, we need to have this \nadministration come forward and state specifically how it intends to \nget to a balanced budget in 7 years. We have done it. The reason we \nhave done it is because we understand that, if this is not \naccomplished, and not accomplished at this time, at this moment in \nhistory where the opportunity is so ripe, that we may not have a chance \nat any later date to do it again. And, if we do not do it now, if we do \nnot put in place now the decisions that are necessary to change the \nspending patterns of this Government in the outyears so we reduce its \nrate of growth--we are not talking about cutting the Federal \nGovernment, we are talking about reducing its rate of growth. In fact, \nin the Medicare area we are talking about adding $349 billion of new \nspending to Medicare and allowing it to grow at a rate that actually \nexceeds what the President projected in one of his budgets that he sent \nup.\n  But, if we do not make the changes necessary to reduce the rate of \ngrowth in the Federal Government and make those changes now by changing \nthe programs which drive spending, specifically the entitlement \nprograms, then we are going to end up, as a nation, passing on to our \nchildren a country that is bankrupt. That is an extremely cynical act \nto have occur at the time when all the parties have formally stated \nthat they are opposed to having that occur. That is the irony of this. \nAll the parties have now formally stated they are willing to reach a \nbalanced budget. Yet one of the parties has been unwilling to state how \nit is going to get there. Thus, you have to question their sincerity.\n\n  The fact is, if we do not do this now, if we do not make these \nchanges now which accomplish a balanced budget--and we do not have to \nfollow the plan laid out by the Republicans. We would be happy to see a \nplan from the other side of the aisle, specifically from the \nadministration, or a joint plan worked out. But we need to have the \nfacts from the administration first and the proposals from the \nadministration first. If we do not follow such a plan and put such a \nplan in place now, we are not going to be able to accomplish it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are not going to be able to accomplish what is that \noverriding, absolutely essential goal which is that we get this budget \nin balance so our children have a nation which is solvent.\n  So, as we move down this road, recognizing there is a tremendously \nlarge amount going on in this world today which distracts the attention \nof Americans, recognizing our first concern and interest must be for \nour soldiers who are going into Bosnia, I do hope we will not lose \nfocus on the fact that the future of our children is being decided \ntoday on the issue of whether we get to a balanced budget. We are not \ngoing to be able to get from here to there unless this administration \nstarts putting forward some honest proposals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is certainly not thoughtful. \nBut, rather, it is thoughtless for anyone to come here and suggest that \nwhat the President is doing at this point in Europe--dealing with the \nissue of peacekeepers in Ireland, and so on--is that the President is \nhiding out. I did not intend to come to the floor to speak on this \nissue today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17839-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17839-S17840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been asked to be one of the \nnegotiators in the budget negotiations. So I and Senator Exon, \nrepresenting the Democratic side in the budget negotiations, are \nspending a lot of time and will spend a great deal of time on this \nissue. I do not need, nor do I think the President nor anyone else \nneeds, to have their sincerity questioned about whether or not they \nwant a balanced budget. I believe it is in this country's interest to \nhave a balanced budget. I believe that is a goal that represents a \nlegitimate and important goal for this country. It is one goal. There \nare others.\n  Do we care and should we do something about making sure we have the \nbest schools in the world? Yes. That is another goal. Do we care that \nwe have clean air and clean water and a decent environment in the \ncountry? Yes. That is a third goal. Do we care whether low-income \nsenior citizens have access to health care? Do we care whether children \nhave access to good nutrition? Do we care whether poor children have \naccess to health care? Those are other goals. It is not a case where \nthere is only one goal in this country. We have a number of goals we \nmust meet.\n  It is true the Republicans put together a plan. It is also true that \nplan is dead, gone. The President will veto it. There are 34 people who \nwill sustain the veto. And that plan does not exist at that point. Then \nwhat is true is Democrats and Republicans sit down at the table and \ndecide together, how do we balance the budget in 7 years? That is going \nto take a substantial amount of effort and good will. And it is not \njust how do you balance the budget in 7 years, but it is how do you do \nthat in a responsible way for the long-term interests of this country?\n  Those who paraded in here this morning had a plan that would balance \nthe budget in 7 years by, among other things, providing--let me give \nyou a couple of little examples--that we repeal most of the alternative \nminimum tax for corporations so 2,000 corporations will get $7 million \neach in tax breaks because of the reduction in the alternative minimum \ntax. I do not know whether everyone who voted for that knew that was in \nthere. But those who voted for it and believe that should happen do no \nservice to this country. That is not good public policy.\n  I wonder whether those who voted for this plan they are so proud of \nunderstand that what they did was increase the tax incentive for people \nto close down their plants in America and move their jobs overseas. \nThat is in the plan. It says, by the way, if you do that, we will give \nyou a bigger tax benefit. Just move the American jobs you have overseas \nand we will give you a benefit. I do not know whether anybody is proud \nof that or whether they want to come here and boast that was in their \nplan.\n  There are a series of very large policy areas that we must address--\nMedicare, Medicaid, education, environment, and others. On the issue of \nMedicare, the majority party plan, which is now going to be dead when \nthe President vetoes it, calls for $270 billion in budget \n\n[[Page S17840]]\nsavings for Medicare. Many of us believe that is too much. There needs \nto be a compromise in that area. The same plan provided for $245 \nbillion in tax cuts.\n  I offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate that I believe \nevery single Republican voted against. It was very simple. I said, if \nthere is going to be tax cuts--I do not think there should be at this \npoint. I think we ought to balance the budget first. Then we ought to \ndecide after the budget is balanced how to change the tax system, and \nwhere to cut taxes. But if there will be tax cuts, I said, let us at \nleast decide this. Let us decide that those tax cuts shall be limited \nto people whose incomes are below a quarter of a million dollars. Can \nwe not at least agree that we will provide the tax cuts only to those \nwhose incomes are below a quarter of a million dollars a year and use \nthe savings from that, somewhere around $50 billion in 7 years, to \nreduce the reductions in Medicare, reduce the hit on Medicare \nespecially for low-income elderly?\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I posed the question in an amendment. Should we not, if \nwe are going to do that, at least limit the tax cuts to those whose \nincomes are a quarter of a million dollars a year or less and use the \nsavings from that limitation to reduce the hurt that is going to be \ncaused to low-income senior citizens on Medicare? The answer was no. \nThey said no. We insist that people above $250,000 get a tax cut. Some \nwill get an enormous tax cut from this legislation.\n  So those who come here and bust their suit buttons boasting about \nwhat they have done, what they have done was unacceptable to a lot of \nfolks. Not that they have balanced the budget. That is not \nunacceptable. It is the way they have done it that is unacceptable. I \nwant to balance the budget. I want to spend a lot of hours in the room \nwith negotiators and try to balance the budget. I am not going to come \nout here and question their sincerity. I do not think they ought to \ncome out here and suggest the President is hiding in Europe. It does no \nservice to try to advance an opportunity to reach agreement on these \nissues.\n  We are talking, after all, about a 7-year spending plan for this \ncountry, a 7-year spending plan created in such a way that put this \ncountry's books in balance. That is a worthy goal--put the books in \nbalance in a way that also recognizes the need for investment in \ncertain areas, education; the need for protection in certain areas, \nhealth care for low-income elderly, and others. We can do that. I am \nconvinced we can do that. But we cannot do it if we keep shouting \nacross the aisle that we are the only ones that had a plan, that we are \nthe only ones on the right track, and that all the rest of you folks do \nnot believe in it. We question your sincerity. You are hiding.\n  What kind of nonsense is that? That is not thoughtful. That is \nthoughtless political pandering. And I think that we will all be better \noff if we decide--yes, the goal is worthy. The plan that was advanced \nwas not acceptable.\n  So let us have a rectangular table where we sit down and in good \nfaith decide how we balance the budget and to do it in the right way. I \nwant to do that. It is good for this country. The motives of the other \nside are, in my judgment, good motives. But some of the language makes \nno sense. Let us decide to work together in a spirit of cooperation, \nand fix what is wrong in this country and do it the right way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his comments. I believe they are right on. They are \nhelpful, and I think they are positive.\n  It is my belief that the budget debate could be settled in 20 \nminutes, if both sides really sat down and did it. I think the Senator \nfrom North Dakota clearly gave the main kernel of a solution. The tax \ncuts that are in the bill--no one benefits from those tax cuts more \nthan my own family does. My husband is an investment banker. The \ncapital gains clearly benefits him. He would love to have those \nbenefits. It would be a nice thing to have, and many Americans feel \nthat way. However, to have those benefits by making deeper cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid--in my own State the Medicaid Program pays half a \nmillion of the poorest Californians' premiums and copayments whose \nMedicare would be done away with. We do not need to do that in this \nbill. You do not need to have the depth of the cuts to balance the \nbudget in 7 years.\n  The issue is not balancing the budget in 7 years. We have all agreed \nthat is now going to be the case. The issue is do we need to have a \nmajor tax reduction benefiting largely upper-income people by taking \nthose dollars, by making the cuts deeper in Medicare and Medicaid and \nsocial programs that are important to the well-being of this Nation? I \nthink the answer to that, for anyone that looks at this from a moral \nperspective, clearly has to be no. So my own view is that this thing \ncan be settled very quickly, and that the Senator from North Dakota \nclearly put forward a kernel of that solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17839-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17840-S17841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nBosnia.\n  Three nights ago the President of the United States went before the \nAmerican people to make the case for sending 20,000 American soldiers \nto help implement the peace agreement that was recently drawn up and \ninitialed in Dayton.\n  I listened, as did millions of other Americans, and I heard the \nPresident lay out his reasons for doing something no one really wants \nto do, not even he. The decision that he made was not an easy one. As \nwe have come to know all too well over the past few years, there are no \neasy answers to end the bloody conflict in Bosnia that has consumed so \nmany lives.\n  Over the past 72 hours all of us have weighed this question, and \ndiscussed the options before us with the administration, with our \nconstituents, and deep within our own conscience. I submit to you that \nwhen push comes to shove this is going to be a vote of conscience, a \nvote of conscience here in the Senate, and a vote of conscience in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  While the details of the implementation plan have not yet been \nfinalized, and as the President noted, there are critical questions \nthat still need to be answered about how this mission can be \naccomplished effectively and with the greatest attention to troop \nsafety, it is now clear to me that the American people and the Congress \nmust and should support the President.\n\n  To do otherwise, I believe, is to show a divided nation and send a \nsignal throughout a world where 30 wars are now in progress that the \nAmerican people forfeit our leadership role as the moral force for \nfreedom and responsibility in the world.\n  Over the past 4 years, while America and our European allies have \nquibbled about responsibility, the war has continued unabated. Amid the \noften self-inflicted charges of hand-wringing and finger-pointing as to \nwhose war is it, who should lead, whose backyard is affected, two \ninescapable facts come home to me. One is something that the British \nstatesman Edmund Burke said two centuries ago. We should all listen to \nwhat he said.\n  I quote: ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for \ngood men to do nothing.''\n  And, second, in the words of George Santayana, ``Those who forget \nhistory are doomed to repeat it.''\n  Mr. President, it is time for good men and women to stand up, and \nAmerica must lead.\n  To those who know history, this area of the world is no stranger to \nconflict. In 1878, 117 years ago, Benjamin Disraeli said in the House \nof Lords in Great Britain:\n\n       No language can describe adequately the condition of that \n     large portion of the Balkan peninsula--Serbia, Bosnia, \n     Herzegovina, and other provinces--political intrigues, \n     constant rivalries, a total absence of all public spirit . . \n     . hatred of all races, animosity of rival religions and \n     absence of any controlling power . . . nothing short of an \n     army of 50,000 of the best troops would produce anything like \n     order in these parts.\n\n  Disraeli's observation is as astute today as it was in 1878, but over \nthe past 4 years the war in Bosnia has taken an enormous toll: a \nquarter of a \n\n[[Page S17841]]\nmillion people dead; the systematic rape and torture of thousands; \nethnic cleansing; concentration camps; over 300 graves with more than 1 \nbody in them; war crimes; thousands still unaccounted for; 2 million \nhomeless; and the fear of a spreading conflict.\n  Not since Adolf Hitler has the world seen such atrocities.\n  When our children and grandchildren look back on this day, they \nshould not have to ask, Why did we not act when we had a chance to make \na difference? Why did we not learn from the lessons of the Holocaust?\n  America is the strongest nation in the world. As new nations fight \nfor survival, as ethnic groups fight for their rights, as the leaders \nof fledgling nations fight for democracy and as people suffer \natrocities, we must be careful as to how and when and where we make a \ndifference. But if we can make a difference, and if it is important to \nour interests, I believe we should.\n  We have an interest in this peace. Some might say we did not have \nsuch an interest before Dayton, but post-Dayton we most certainly have \nan interest in this peace. We have brokered this peace. We have a \nchance for peace to succeed. We cannot turn our backs because if we \nturn our backs on a chance for peace, what we are going to go back to \nis the systematic torture and rape and ethnic cleansing and atrocities.\n  When the assault took place on Srebrenica, the moral argument truly \nhit home. And after all, there are still thousands of men and boys \nunaccounted for since the Serbs took over Srebrenica.\n  I have used this picture standing next to me in this Chamber before. \nToday I use it again. This young Bosnian woman from Srebrenica looks \nvery normal--her skirt, her sweater--with one exception: She has hung \nherself. She is hanging from a tree. Rather than further endure the \natrocities, the rape, the torture, the mayhem, she hung herself.\n  What we stand for as a nation is not letting things like this happen. \nWhat we stand for is doing something about it. And we have done that \nbefore. Our men and women have fought two wars in Europe--World War I \nand World War II. America was not threatened then, but we fought for \nsome of the same reasons that we brokered a peace in Dayton that now \nhas an opportunity to succeed, if we have the will, the unity, and the \ndisposition to see that peace succeeds.\n  So my argument today is really the moral one. We can have a peace \nsucceed at this time if we have the resolve as a free, strong country \nto see it through.\n  Once again, I would recall what Edmund Burke said many years ago and \nparaphrase it: Bad men flourish when good men refuse to stand up.\n  It is true, as many have said, and there is no question that there is \na price to pay. The question is, Should we pay that price? And what \nhappens if we do not?\n  Let me begin with what happens if we do not. If we do not, we know \nthat our allies will not go in. Since the arms embargo has just been \nlifted by the U.N. Security Council, we know that all sides will have \ngreater access to arms. The Bosnian Government most probably will get \narms from Moslem nations, and possibly from the United States as well. \nAnd the Bosnian Serbs will gain arms from Serbia and quite possibly \nfrom Russia.\n  There is a significant danger that what has been a largely self-\ncontained conflict could spread, drawing in Croatia and Serbia as full \nparticipants--and we have seen the might of the Croatian Army--and then \nto nearby nations, such as Macedonia and Albania. From there our NATO \nallies, Greece and Turkey, could find themselves drawn in. And the \nthreat of a major European conflict will be drastically increased.\n  The mission that has been proposed is not without risk and it is not \nwithout cost. No military mission ever is. But it is a risk, I think, \nthe leader of the free world must take.\n  My continued support for the President's plan will be contingent upon \nthe details of the mission. And I want to go into that for a moment.\n  Our task over the next few weeks is to ensure that this mission is \nachievable, and that our troops are given everything they need to allow \nthese highly trained forces--and they are very highly trained--to do \nwhat we know they are capable of as the strongest, best-equipped, best-\ntrained military force in the world.\n  There are certain aspects of this plan that are fundamentally \nnecessary to ensure success. First, as I have said, the United States \nwill take the lead, but we will not be alone. We will provide one-third \nof the troops; our allies will provide two-thirds.\n  Second, the command will be unified and straightforward. U.S. and all \nother troops will operate under the command of an American general, \nGeneral Joulwan, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. This mission--\nOperation Joint Endeavor--will be an exclusively NATO-led mission. The \nUnited Nations will not play a role.\n\n  Third, our forces will be operating under robust rules of engagement. \nThey will respond with immediate and overwhelming force to any threat. \nAnyone who threatens our forces will not receive a proportional \nresponse. They will, quite simply, be taken out.\n  Here I want to commend the President for his clarity and strength. I \necho his words that if anyone threatens U.S. troops, ``We will fight \nfire with fire--and then some.''\n  Tomorrow, the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, \nwill hold hearings on the plan to implement the peace agreement. The \nArmed Services Committee will also have an opportunity. Today, the \nHouse International Relations Committee is having that opportunity.\n  We will have an opportunity to examine the terms of the peace \nagreement in depth, and to discuss the commitment of the parties to the \nagreement. President Clinton has made it clear that there will be no \npeace implementation force unless all parties sign the peace agreement.\n  There are other concerns that also must be thoroughly addressed: the \nprecise definition and limits of the mission; the avoidance of mission \ncreep; a well-thought-out exit strategy, and the President has \nindicated four areas which will be used as the determining factors of \nwhen the mission has been successfully completed; the relocation of an \nestimated 2 million refugees; how to deal with anonymous sniper fire.\n  We now know that there will be an international police task force set \nup, separate from the peace implementation force, to handle policing \nduties. There will be a body set up to handle the relocation of \nrefugees. And we now know that the parties themselves will participate \nin efforts to remove the large number of landmines.\n  All of these questions, though, must have more answers, and I believe \nthey are in the course of being presented.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted in recent days, the President has \nthe constitutional authority to deploy these troops without \ncongressional approval. The President, however, is seeking the support \nof the American people and of Congress for this mission. We must work \nwith him to ensure that this mission is successful, but we can do no \nless than to support him.\n  Three weeks ago, as Bosnian, Serb, and Croatian leaders hammered out \nthis peace agreement, in another part of the world a great peacemaker \nand world leader was felled by an assassin's bullet. I was very sobered \nby the fact that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave his life for peace. \nMore than anything else, I think this shows the risk that making peace \nin a historically troubled area carries with it. And so his death \nserves as a reminder that leadership in the search for peace has a \nprice.\n  I remember something that President Kennedy once said, that ``America \nwould pay any price, bear any burden, and suffer any hardship in the \ncause of liberty and peace.'' I think that really says it all. We have \nan historic opportunity to help achieve peace where there has been far \ntoo much war. We cannot pass up this chance for peace.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17840-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17841-S17844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SENDING UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am not quite sure I can speak with the \npassion of the Senator from California, but I, too, feel a great \nconcern for the situation in which this President has now in a \nfoursquare way placed this country. \n\n[[Page S17842]]\n\n  The President's speech this week was probably the most important \nspeech of his Presidency. It was an address that outlined a decision, a \nvery critical decision that only a President can make, and that is to \ndeploy United States troops, in this instance United States troops, to \nbe peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavian Republic. I was looking for a \nnumber of answers in his message, such as a very full articulation of a \ndefined goal or mission, strategy for achieving that goal, an exit \nstrategy, and that of our national and security interests for our \ncountry.\n  I do not, in any way, bow from the moral imperative argument. That \nhas been clear from day one. It is certainly an argument that this \nNation has not walked away from. We have invested millions of dollars \nand lots of our manpower in air support, in sea support, in logistics. \nWe have been involved.\n  So it is not a question of now versus then. I am sorry, Mr. \nPresident, if you only caught the sails of the current moral \nimperative, the slaughter in the former Yugoslavia has been going on \nfor 4 years. We have all witnessed it, and the Senator from California \nhas spoken to it on the floor. So that is something that has not missed \nAmerica. What has missed America is how do we become engaged, engaged \nin a way that we can control a situation and environment and an emotion \nthat is well 300 years old in the making, where other nations, great \nand small, have chosen to at least stand aside for the very risk of the \npeople, their own people, that they might chose to engage in a \nsolution.\n  So that becomes the issue. It is the issue that we, in this Senate, \nwill have to face, because ultimately what is the President's decision \ncan become our responsibility. I will not judge it on a moral \nimperative. I cannot judge it on that basis. I have to judge it on \nwhether we can do it in a way in which we can go in, solve a problem, \nstabilize the situation, minimize the risk to our people, our sons and \ndaughters who have gone in service to this country and its security, \nand then is there a way out. That is what I think we ought to be \njudging here.\n  There is no question about the loss of human life that has gone on \nover there. And we have all spoken to it with a great sense of urgency. \nBut it is not now only to be discovered. We have known it for a long, \nlong while.\n  What is at hand now is an issue that this President for justifiable \nreasons has attempted to bring to this country, and by his decision, \nand by the initialing of the agreement in Dayton, has clearly brought \nit foursquare. But, Mr. President, my frustration is very simple. The \nPresident of the United States cautioned us not to debate the issue \nuntil there was a decision, not to debate the issue until there was a \nplan. And we chose not to. I think we chose improperly, but we chose to \ngive him the time.\n  And now that he has a plan, or at least now that he soon will have a \nplan that we can look at with some detail, he has put us in a very \nunique situation. He almost has the opportunity, if we chose not to \nsupport him, to turn to us and say, you are breaking the peace \nagreement, you are putting at risk the men and women of the former \nYugoslavia, and the children. Mr. President, not so, simply not so. \nThey have been at risk for a long time. And this Senate and the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives has for many years contemplated alternatives. \nWe have asked for a variety of approaches, only to be denied those, to \ncreate equity and balance with the warring factions over there, only to \nbe denied that, to clearly create a one-sided war that by the very \nnature of its history would spell out human slaughter, and it has.\n  And now finally, after all of those long denials, this President has \nsaid, ``Here is a solution. And here is what I propose to do. And here \nis what I am going to do.'' And that can result, not only in the \nplacing at risk of 20,000 of our armed services people on the ground, \nclearly in foursquare risk, but it also places a good many more--\nbecause of the 4-to-1 ratio, we are not just talking about 20,000 \nAmericans on the ground over there, we may well be talking 50,000, or \n60,000, or 70,000.\n  Is it going to go on for a year? Well, Mr. President, I do not think \nyou know that, and we certainly do not know that. So it is with these \nconcerns that I come to the floor today, Mr. President, because of the \nconstitutional role that our President has, the right that he has under \nthe Constitution to do what he is doing today, and at the same time to \nrecognize that we have a responsibility. And, as I have said very early \non, my responsibility rests with Americans first and the ability to \nunderstand how they can best be involved and safeguarded. Our \nresponsibilities also rest in whether we appropriately fund these \nactions and if the mission is effectively carried out.\n  So there are a lot of questions yet unanswered. I have asked the \npeople of Idaho to speak to me and our delegation on this issue because \nthe Senator from California is right, this is a tough one. There is no \nquestion about it that we will all consider this with great, great \nconcern, great passion, a great aching of the heart, not only for what \nhas gone on over there but for what we might be putting our men and \nwomen at risk in doing.\n  And so in asking that, my phone, like I think most of the phones of \nmy colleagues, has been filled with phone calls from our citizens \nexpressing with more passion than I have heard expressed in some time, \na concern about what we are about to do as a country. My phone calls \nare running 100 to 1 in opposition to what my citizens now know at \nleast of what our President plans to do. And they are hoping that I can \nblock him from doing that. And I must tell them that I cannot, that \nunder the Constitution, as Commander in Chief, he has that kind of \nauthority.\n  But I do hope that this Senate will speak out very clearly as to \nwhere we stand and what we stand for. I do not think that our message \nin any way can be garbled nor can we avoid just passing it by, just \nletting the President free rein this. Not at all. And I hope that we \ncan develop a resolution that speaks clearly to our concerns that those \nwho openly and aggressively support the President in this issue can \nhave a right to express that, those of us who have very real questions \nat this moment who more than likely will strongly oppose the President \ncan also have that opportunity to speak clearly to it.\n  That is the responsibility of the Senate and the Congress, not just \nto this President, but to the citizens of this country, because we, in \nGovernment here, have this unique responsibility among all, and that is \nwhether to engage this Nation in war or police actions and ask our \ncitizens not only to support us in this but to take up arms for the \npurpose of these actions.\n  The President has raised three concerns to justify U.S. participation \nin implementing the peace accord: The potential spread of the conflict, \nour leadership in NATO and the international community, and the need to \nend the carnage in the Balkans. I do not question the concerns raised \nby our Commander in Chief. However, I do reserve my support for his \nactions at this time.\n  Mr. President, we would like to respond to what I will refer to as \nthe ``moral imperative,'' that President Clinton outlined in his \nspeech.\n  The devastation and human suffering in the Balkans has left us all \nwith a feeling of frustration. These feelings are not new, however. \nFour years ago, I was contacted by a Croatian-American constituent of \nmine, when the conflict first raged between the Serbs and Croatians. \nThis gentleman was in regular contact with my office, and his fears and \nfrustrations were very real to me. The moral imperative existed back \nthen. However, then, like now, our options for involvement are very \nlimited, and we still face the fundamental difficulty of trying to make \nthe peace a greater victory than winning the war.\n  Mr. President, while we all understand and agree with the moral \nimperative, we have yet to hear why this action would serve our \nnational interest or security needs.\n  In the coming days, when details of the mission are made clear, I \nwill look and I will listen, but I have very grave concerns and \nreservations about this proposed action.\n  I must admit, President Clinton has put the Congress in a bad \nposition by bringing us into the picture after the Bosnian peace \nagreement has been initialed.\n  He has put the Congress at the disadvantage of being the breakers of \npeace, if we withhold support. Even so, Congress has no choice but to \nspeak. Regardless of the outcome, I want to \n\n[[Page S17843]]\nmake one point very clear: If Americans are deployed to defend the \npeace, I will support our troops.\n  Mr. President, I have great concern about sending Americans into the \nBalkans to implement and enforce a peace agreement that was hammered \nout in Dayton, OH.\n  My concerns stem from the fact that despite their sincerity and good \nintentions, the negotiators may not be able to deliver on their \npromises.\n  One of the great problems with the situation in the Balkans--and one \nof the reasons we have had approximately 30 failed cease-fires--is that \nthere is an inordinate number of people who are often referred to as \n``irregulars.'' In Idaho, we would probably call them vigilantes.\n  The bottom line is that this kind of disorder, combined with \nextraordinary tensions and emotions, is a recipe for disaster.\n  Mr. President, as outsiders, we cannot impose peace under these \ncircumstances. We may not even be able to serve as the conduit of \npeace.\n  There has been some discussion about the need for detail in this \npeace agreement. The Dayton agreement has detail, but there are people \nwho wield power, such as Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who were \nnot at the negotiating table.\n  With the ink barely dry on the agreement, Karadzic announced that \npeace in the capital would be difficult to ensure and that the transfer \nof Serb-held neighborhoods was not final. Karadzic, who was not at the \nnegotiation table, but represented by Serb President Slobodan \nMilosevic, is committed to making changes to the peace agreement. \nHowever, it is my understanding that negotiators in the agreement have \nrebuffed the idea that Bosnian Serbs could restructure the agreement.\n  In an interview with NBC, U.S. negotiator Richard C. Holbrooke said, \n``Dayton was an initialing. Paris will be a signing. There will be no \nchange between Dayton and Paris.''\n  Defense Secretary William J. Perry on ``Face the Nation,'' \nreconfirmed that position by saying,\n\n       . . . I want to make clear: We're not going to renegotiate \n     this agreement. This agreement is the agreement, and that's \n     what we're proceeding on.\n\n  Karadzic does not appear stonewalled. It is my understanding from \nreports I have read, that he is mobilizing community leaders from the \nsuburbs around Sarajevo, to force changes in the agreement, prior to \nthe signing date on December 10. While we may dismiss Karadzic's power \nwith the Serbian people, there is one thing that cannot be overlooked: \nHis message strikes a chord with many Serbians who have fought for \ngains that are now being signed away, in the name of peace.\n  The issue at hand may be peacekeeping, but we cannot ignore the fact \nthat peace will only come with a high price:\n\n       What is wrong with the Dayton agreement [is that it] has \n     created a new Beirut in Europe. It is going to bleed for \n     decades.\n\n  Radovan Karadzic, from a Washington Post article November 27, 1995.\n  While Karadzic's rhetoric may be just rhetoric, it is aimed at \ndestabilizing this agreement. It is also a message that many Serbians \nwant to hear. From what I have seen happen in this conflict over the \nlast few years, he will likely be a formidable opponent to peace.\n  Reports on comments from both Bosnians and Serbs in Sarajevo don't \nbode well for peace. The bitter depth of anger in this conflict and the \nlack of trust on both sides has not created the kind of atmosphere this \npeace agreement needs to be successful.\n  In short, Mr. President, citizens marching in protest of the peace \naccord are not likely to swallow the hatred they have harbored in order \nto bring about peace.\n  So, what exactly does this agreement say that is so hotly contested \nby some Serbian factions? Mr. President, under the agreement initialed \nlast week, the enforcement of peace will be the responsibility of a \nNATO-led peacekeeping force of 60,000 troops, with as many as 20,000 of \nthem being Americans. Bosnia would be split between a joint Moslem-\nCroat Government, which would have jurisdiction over 51 percent of the \nterritory, and a Serb republic, which would control 49 percent.\n  Sarajevo will fall under control of the Moslem-Croat Federation, \nalong with its Serb-held suburbs.\n  Needless to say, the apportionment does not sit well with many of the \nSerbian people.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncomment on the war powers resolution. Many of my fellow Idahoans have \nraised concerns about who has the power to deploy troops in the kind of \nsituation we are facing in Bosnia.\n  The Constitution provides authority to both the President and the \nCongress with respect to the use of our military. Our Constitution is \none of the greatest documents ever written. The role of Congress and \nthe Presidency in the use of our military is a case in point. Our \nConstitution reflects the desire to have the collective judgment of \nboth the Congress and the President when making decisions on the use of \nforce.\n  Under article II, section 2, of the Constitution, the President has \nthe authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces to deploy and \ncommand our Armed Forces.\n  On the other hand, article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives the \nCongress the power to declare war. We can all look at these powers, and \nsee the clear differences. However, lines can become fuzzy when those \nprinciples are applied to a specific situation, such as the one before \nus in the Balkans.\n  The War Powers Resolution, which passed over President Nixon's veto \non November 7, 1973, was designed to provide a functional framework \nthrough which to clarify the two roles and to maintain the intended \nbalance of power.\n  Compliance with the resolution becomes an issue when troops are \ndeployed to a location where they face hostilities or imminent \ninvolvement in hostilities.\n  The criteria required for compliance with the War Powers Resolution \nare very clear. The President must consult the Congress, fulfill \nreporting requirements, and then seek congressional approval for \ncontinued deployment beyond a specific number of days--60 or 90 \ndepending on the situation.\n  If these steps are not fulfilled. Then the Congress is left with \nusing it's power of the purse. Terminating the funds necessary for the \ndeployment provides the Congress the ability to curb the President's \npowers as Commander-in-Chief. This step is not an easy one, given that \nthe Congress would have to override a presidential veto with a two-\nthirds vote.\n  Mr. President, I would like to explore one final point in this whole \nsituation that has consumed my concerns. The war in the former \nYugoslavian republics is not new; it is a continuation of an age-old \nconflict. These people have fought and suffered atrocities, especially \nover the last 4 years, that we cannot comprehend, for a goal that we do \nnot understand. Yet, when cease-fires were achieved they were short-\nlived, because winning the war or conflict was valued more highly than \ncoexisting in peace. All sides in this conflict have had one goal: to \nwin. To win, is to survive.\n  However, through our efforts to contain the conflict by placing the \ninternational embargo on Yugoslavia and maintain it on Bosnia, the \nconflict became very uneven. The Serbians took hold of that advantage, \nand have taken hold of every subsequent advantage in their efforts to \nwin.\n  I do not see the average person, whether Serb, Moslem, or Croatian, \nbeing prepared to accept peace without a fight. A Washington Post \narticle on November 27, quoted what I would call an average man who has \nlived through this conflict:\n\n       ``It's pathetic,'' said Milorad Dugovic, a car mechanic who \n     keeps an automatic pistol tucked in his waistband. ``What \n     were we fighting for in the past four years? * * * we will \n     continue to fight. We'll fight even NATO. What's ours will \n     remain ours.''\n\n  I do not see the Serbian people being willing to snatch defeat from \nthe jaws of victory. Peace under this agreement is not a done deal. Let \nus not deceive ourselves into thinking that our troops will only be \npeacekeepers. If actions fit rhetoric, and fighting begins again, our \ntroops will be in the middle of this bloody civil war. then peace will \ncome only if we become the peacemakers by using force to settle this \nconflict.\n  Mr. President, I remain opposed to the proposed deployment of United \nStates troops into Bosnia as part of this peace agreement at this time. \nI emphasize ``at this time,'' because it is imperative that we all \nfully understand what is at stake.\n\n[[Page S17844]]\n\n  In my view, our national and security interests have not yet been \ndefined. Before I can even entertain the thought of sending American \nmen and women into this situation, these interests must be real, and \nthey must be defined.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17841-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17844-S17845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SHOULD WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE INDIGNANT?\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, during an appearance on ``Nightline'' \nlast week, I got quite disturbed with the Secretary of the Interior. He \nsaid that the Alaska delegation had been sneaky about, as he said, \nsticking in provisions to allow exploration and development of the \nAlaska oil reserve in the budget bills without honest debate. And he \nfurther said that we had done this in the dark of the night.\n  I came a little unglued at that, the idea that a Cabinet officer who \nis under oath--and I believe we are always under oath as Members of the \nCongress--will make statements that are just not true. I did not have \ntime really to explain--in the context of that type of experience--the \nsituation. So I have decided to come to the Senate and take 5 minutes \nto do it today.\n  This is a map of my State. It depicts what happened in 1980 at the \ntime the Congress withdrew all of those areas that are outlined in blue \nand set them aside as preservation areas, national parks, national \nwildlife refuges, wild and scenic rivers, wilderness.\n  This area up here, the Arctic National Wildlife Range, was expanded \ninto what is known now as Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But one \narea, 1.5 million acres on the Arctic Slope, is the only area touched \nby that 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that the \n1980 act allowed for continued utilization for development. This is \ncalled the 1002 area, because that is the section, 1002 in the 1980 \nact. It abuts the Arctic Ocean of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nIt is in the coastal plain. That area we have sought to proceed with \nleasing as was contemplated by the 1980 act now for 15 years.\n  What has happened this year that did not exist before this year was \nthat the President requested and Congress has granted a change in the \nlaw with regard to scoring of Federal actions under the Budget Act. \nPrior to this year, the leasing of land, which brings about sizable \nbonus bids, would not score as a Federal revenue raiser even though it \nwould bring money into the Federal Treasury. There was a bid for one \narea right offshore of the Arctic oil reserve, this part of ANWR, as we \ncall it, $2 billion just for the right to look to see if there was oil \nand gas in the area. It was dry. We expect bids in this area of over $5 \nbillion when the land is leased. More conservative estimates suggest \nthat bids will be about $2.6 billion, with $1.3 billion coming to the \nFederal Treasury. That is what the Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid.\n  The President has asked for, and we granted, the right to score \nsales, and leasing is a sale of a right to use land for a period of \ntime. Those are now scoreable so they can get in the Budget Act.\n  Going back to 1980, we have tried since then to get this leasing to \nproceed, but we have not been able to have it done.\n  This year in the budget reconciliation, what we're now calling the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995, there was a vote in the Senate Energy \nCommittee of 13 to 7 to include this area in the budget reconciliation. \nIt came to the floor.\n  There have been three rollcall votes on the Senate floor this year \ndealing with the issue: May 24, to prohibit the asset sales in the \nbudget resolution; again on May 24, to strike this amendment that had \nbeen inserted in the budget resolution by my colleague, Senator \nMurkowski; and in October, during the budget reconciliation process, we \nvoted on Senator Baucus' amendment dealing with the Arctic oil reserve. \nWe tabled each of these motions. We were sustained in our position that \nthis belongs in the budget bill.\n  In response to another of Secretary Babbitt's assertions, we have not \ndone this in the dark of the night. There was not anything sneaky about \nit. As a matter of fact, we have had, since 1987, 26 days of hearings \non this issue in the House of Representatives, 14 days of hearings in \nthe Senate, and there is no question that this has all been done in the \nlight of day.\n  We have not done anything sneaky in the dark of the night. To have a \nCabinet officer accuse Members of the Congress of taking such action is \nreally, I think, an extreme position. The interesting thing is the news \nmedia have picked this up and now they are bashing me over the head \nagain, because I got disturbed at him for making such statements. It is \nappalling to me that we cannot require honesty and truthfulness out of \npeople dealing with issues such as this.\n  We seek only to proceed with leasing, as was contemplated in 1980. As \nI said, this is the only area of Alaska in which that act allowed \ndevelopment. Look at the rest of it. Over 100 million acres of Alaska \nset aside. We cannot use them. This one area we can use, and we have \nbeen blocked by filibuster since 1980 to proceed as contemplated.\n  Now, the President asked for the change in the law, and asset sales \ncan be included in the budget resolution. We can put this in the Budget \nAct, and we have put it in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. It is a \nconcept that we should, I think, consider.\n  Mr. President, it means over 735,000 jobs for Americans. It means we \nwill be able to produce oil from that area as was contemplated. It is \nprobably the last greatest oil reserve on the North American Continent \nthat has not been produced.\n  We have had provisions to allow the leasing of the coastal plain in a \nwhole series of bills. At one time, we had a six-vote margin on a \nfilibuster vote to break the filibuster. We did not have 60 votes, and \nwe were not able to bring this up in past Congresses. President Bush's \n1993 budget proposed this area be leased. Leasing of the coastal plain \nwas part of his proposal to balance the budget by leasing land such as \nthis and getting the bonus bids and getting the royalties that would \ncome to the United States if leasing and development came about. He \nspecifically provided, as a matter of fact, that the revenues would be \nshared equally between the Federal Government and the State of Alaska, \nwhich would mean a change in the law to accomplish that.\n  I come to the floor and I am going to come back again and again. I am \ngoing to ask the Senate to analyze the statements made by this Cabinet \nofficer and let the public decide: Should we have the right to be \nindignant when a Cabinet officer makes statements on national \ntelevision that are not true, that we try to mislead the public in \nterms of what is going on here in Congress? Is it sneaky to put a \nprovision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 that does the same thing \nthe President of the United States wants to do with the helium reserve, \nwith the Teapot Dome area, and with the naval petroleum reserves? He \nwants to sell them. If they are sold, they are scored. We put it in the \nBalanced Budget Act. These actions have never been able to proceed \npassed because they were not in those bills either. They did not have \nthe capability of getting a vote to avoid a filibuster in the Senate.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, it is very difficult to represent a State that is \noffshore, that is one-fifth the size of the United States, and that has \nso many varied issues that involve Federal lands and Federal actions, \nand to deal with the person who is Secretary of the Interior, who is \nunwilling to properly present the issue to the American public. I \nbelieve--and there has been a recent poll that will be announced \ntoday--the American public, when fully informed about this issue, will \nagree with us, that leasing should go ahead, as contemplated in 1980, \nand the revenues that will come from that area should come to the \nFederal Treasury, and some to the State. But the jobs that would come \nfrom developing our oil reserve should be available to Americans. We \nshould stop importing so much foreign oil.\n  There are a great many more things that were said by the Secretary of \nthe Interior in that statement when we appeared together on \n``Nightline.'' I will come back again and again, because all I am \nasking for, Mr. President, is an honest debate, to tell the truth and \ngive the facts and let the judgment be made. But when people are trying \nto \n\n[[Page S17845]]\ntwist the information so that it casts us in a light of being people \nthat sneak around in the night--can you imagine that, saying we did \nthis in the ``dark of the night,'' that we were sneaky, when we have \nhad so many days of hearings, so many public statements on the floor, \nso many votes both here and in the House?\n  I think there is just no question that a Cabinet officer who does \nthat should be called to attention, and we should ask: Is this the \nconduct that this administration believes should be the conduct of a \nCabinet officer? When he raised his hand and said he would support the \nConstitution, as you and I did, Mr. President, does that not mean we \nwill be truthful in the conduct of our business, the public business?\n  We do it out in front of everybody, right here on the floor. We did \nour action of putting this amendment in the bill, by a vote of the \ncommittee. We have had three votes on the floor this year. We have been \nhere for 15 years now trying to get this Congress to proceed as was \ncontemplated in 1980. I do not think it is proper to call us \n``sneaky,'' or to say we are doing it in the dark of the night.\n  I hope more and more people in America understand that those who make \nallegations like that have something to hide themselves. I am going to \nfind some way to bring to the American public the truth in these \nstatements that are being made by the Cabinet members of this \nadministration.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to talk just a few minutes now. \nI understand that the unanimous-consent agreement that has been \npropounded and accepted limits Senators to 5 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent to extend that to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would have to object, Mr. President. We, of course, \nhave no objection if the Senator wishes to be recognized for the second \ntime. But in the interest of fairness, we have set 5 minutes per \nSenator. If there is another Senator to speak at the end of that 5 \nminutes, he should be recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is not an unfair response. Perhaps at the end of \nthat time, I will call on using leader time, which I understand has \nbeen made available to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Democrat and Republican \nnegotiators sit down and try to work out a final budget, I want to urge \nthe negotiators to begin their discussions by agreeing on a fundamental \nprinciple. The principle is critical to Democrats like me and to the \noverwhelming majority of Americans. The principle is this: Congress \nshould not cut Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, the current Republican budget, which has yet to be \nsent to President Clinton, violates this basic principle because the \nheart of the Republican plan cuts Medicare by $270 billion, and it is \ngoing to be used to pay for $245 billion in tax breaks. The President \nhas made it quite clear that these Medicare cuts for tax breaks are a \nquid pro quo and totally unacceptable. It is a basic matter of \nprinciple.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues about some of the other \nobjectionable provisions in the Republican reconciliation bill. The \nbudget proposed by the Republicans also cuts Medicaid by $163 billion. \nThis will mean huge cuts in nursing home care for seniors and care for \nthe disabled.\n  The bill includes a $23 billion cut in the earned income tax credit, \nand this means that 17 million working families, who make less than \n$30,000 a year, will have to pay more in taxes. They will get a tax \nincrease because the earned income tax credit, which helped them \nsustain themselves, will no longer be available. At the same time, the \ntop 1 percent, who make over $350,000 a year, will get an $8,400 tax \nbreak. It is unnecessary and, frankly, it is unconscionable.\n\n  The bill also tears apart the safety net for poor children. Under the \nRepublican so-called welfare reform provisions, between 1.2 and 2.1 \nmillion children will be thrust into poverty, potentially going hungry.\n  Mr. President, the basic thrust of this legislation is to balance the \nbudget on the backs of working families and senior citizens, while \nhanding out billions in tax breaks for the rich and powerful. It is an \nextreme approach. I know that Speaker Gingrich and his followers \nbelieve in it strongly, but, in my view, it is fundamentally wrong.\n  Mr. President, when you get right down to it, the Republican budget \nforces all of us to answer a simple question, one that I have discussed \nmany times here. It is very directly saying: ``Whose side are you on?'' \nThat is the question being asked. Are you on the side of the rich and \nthe powerful and the special interests? Or are you on the side of those \nwho go to work every day worrying about how they will pay their bills, \nget their kids to college, sustain a lifestyle they have worked so hard \nto get, and worry about what happens in their later years? Or are you \non the side of those who do not need help, but who have influence down \nhere, who get to talk to a lot of people in Government, those who make \nthe decisions?\n  That is the fundamental question that we are discussing as we \nconsider the budget. The Republican reconciliation bill is pay dirt for \nthe rich and the special interests, while senior citizens and working \nclass families get stuck footing higher bills. This is an outrage.\n\n  We Democrats are going to continue to resist it as a basic matter of \nprinciple. We saw what happened with the continuing resolution when the \npublic caught on to this scheme.\n  Under the spotlight, our friends on the Republican side blinked. They \nretreated. They ran away. They wanted to escape the public wrath and \nquickly abandoned their deep principles for political cover. They \nquickly backed off their large increases in Medicare part B premiums.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget makes the biggest cuts in the \nhistory of Medicare. I have heard the case made, ``No, we are not \nmaking cuts. What we are doing is increasing the pot.'' Yes, but there \nare a lot more people who are aging and who will be part of the \nMedicare population, and on a per capita basis they get hit very, very \nhard.\n  Republicans build their case around a false premise. They argue that \nin order to save Medicare they want to destroy its fundamental mission. \nThat is not true. They ought to be frank with the American people about \ntwo major Republican misstatements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey wish to \nrequest additional time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The first misstatement that our Republican friends \nmake is we need $270 billion to save Medicare. That is simply untrue.\n  The Republicans are using this $270 billion, as I said before, to \nfinance their $245 billion in tax breaks for the rich folk. It is no \ncoincidence that Medicare cuts are $270 billion and the tax breaks for \nthe wealthy total $245 billion.\n  These figures are remarkably similar because one is being used to \nfinance the other. They are taking from our senior citizens who paid \nthe bills, signed the contract, worked hard and weathered the storm, \nand they are giving it back to the wealthy and the special interests.\n  The second Republican falsehood is that we need to cut $270 billion \nto make Medicare solvent. Not true. The chief Health and Human Services \nMedicare actuary has said that we only need $89 billion in savings to \nmake Medicare solvent until the end of the year 2006.\n  Let me give some examples of what kind of tax breaks these Medicare \ncuts are paying for: Under this bill, approximately 2,000 large \ncorporations will get a tax break of $2 million apiece because of \nchanges in the alternative minimum tax calculations; the bill also \ngives an $800,000 tax break to people with estates over $2.5 million to \nbe able to pass on to their heirs an additional $800,000 tax break. It \nis not fair. It is not right.\n\n  Additionally, this bill contains hundreds of millions of dollars in \ngiveaways to the oil companies. \n\n[[Page S17846]]\n\n  Finally, the capital gains tax cut included in this bill is a tax \nbreak for the superrich. Anyone can claim this tax break. We saw that \nin a vote here. Even those who make more than $1 million a year can get \nthis tax break.\n  Mr. President, I tried to draw a line in the tax sand, to use the \nexpression, and put the money back into Medicare and Medicaid. I \noffered an amendment when we discussed our reconciliation bill that \nwould have precluded the tax breaks from going to those who make over \n$1 million in a single year. That is one-tenth of 1 percent of all our \ntaxpayers. This small group, I felt, did not need a tax break--making \n$1 million a year, that is a lot of money.\n  I thought this amendment could pass substantially. Maybe even \nunanimously. I thought that people here would finally say, ``No, we \nthink that is fair, that people who make over $1 million a year ought \nnot to get an additional tax break.'' I thought we could all agree that \nmillionaires, billionaires, do not need a break when we are cutting \nMedicare, especially when 75 percent of all the Medicare recipients \nearn under $25,000 each year.\n  However, 52 of 53 of the Republican Senators voted against my \namendment. In essence, they said their preference is cut Medicare, cut \nMedicaid, and we will keep on giving tax breaks to those millionaires \nand the billionaires--show them what good guys we are.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is not just a health insurance program. \nMedicare is a contract. It is a commitment we made to our citizens. It \nis a promise for those who worked hard for their entire lives that your \nhealth care needs will be taken care of when you retire. They paid for \nit.\n  This Republican budget uses the Medicare Program as a slush fund for \nthe tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Republican leadership will give up \ntheir plan to cut Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the rich, give up \ndeep cuts in Medicaid, give up tax increases on working families, give \nup the destruction of the safety net that will put millions of children \ninto poverty, give up the huge cuts in education and the environment. \nIt is time to start over.\n  If the Republicans are serious about moving towards the balanced \nbudget, they will give up on these draconian cuts, those cuts that hurt \nso much. They will honor a basic principle that declares whose side \nGovernment is on, that no Medicare cuts will be used to pay for tax \nbreaks for the rich, that they will confirm that the Government is here \nto help give assistance to those who need help the most. Those who are \nwealthy do not need special assistance from the Government.\n  It is time to start over, Mr. President, and put together a budget \nthat protects Medicare and Medicaid and working families, poor \nchildren, provide education to help get the population to lead our \ncountry into the next century, to provide the kind of leadership that \ncan make us more competitive, to continue the kind of position that the \nUnited States of America has had for so many years, and to provide our \nfuture generations with a decent and clean environment.\n  I hope that will get consideration, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17845-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17846-S17847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed S. 1316, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. I did not have the opportunity to speak on it \nwhile it was under consideration and I want to point out some things in \nthat bill that I believe are very constructive.\n  I will call to the attention of my colleagues that I think we passed \na piece of legislation that will enhance voters' confidence, citizens' \nconfidence, that we can, in fact, take a law that has accomplished a \ngreat deal.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act has improved the quality of life in \nAmerica considerably, and has been a great success story, but it needed \nto be changed. There was an urgent need to change the legislation. We \npassed it last year in this body. The House was unable to pass a piece \nof legislation, and as a consequence it died.\n  I want to thank Chairman John Chafee. He was very instrumental. \nWithout his leadership this bill would not have passed. Chairman \nKempthorne, as well, was very diligent and determined to pass the \nlegislation. Senator Baucus, Senator Reid, both from rural States, \nunderstand the importance of changing this legislation. They, like me, \nhave heard from local communities talking about if we are going to \nmaintain the consent to regulate safe drinking water that we have to \nchange the current law.\n  I will talk about a few issues, Mr. President. I will go through them \nreal quickly. First is the issue of radon in the drinking water. Under \nthe current law, the EPA was required to promulgate a standard for \nradon by a court-ordered deadline.\n  Unfortunately, that standard was a much higher standard than any \nscientist said was necessary to protect the people. There is no dispute \nhere. This is not a situation where we have anybody coming forward and \nsaying that the standard that was required under this rule was too low.\n  This standard was set so high that it was going to cost rural \ncommunities, in some cases, $5,000 per user to implement. We had \nwithheld the appropriations for several years to promulgate this rule, \nand this piece of legislation now will take the appropriators off the \nhook. It changes the law. It gives EPA the authority to promulgate a \nrule of 3,000 picocuries per liter, which is what all science is saying \nis needed. It will save rural providers of water in Nebraska nearly $1 \nbillion over a 7- to 10-year period. It is a substantial amount of \nmoney that is at stake.\n  The second issue is the current law, that is the issue of sound \nscience and using sound science in evaluating both the risk and what we \ndo. In the 1986 amendments, we decided we were going to regulate 25 \ncontaminants every 3 years whether those contaminants needed to be \nregulated or not. This strict method of establishing standards caused \nsome contaminants to be regulated without a sound scientific basis. It \nis an issue that is very irritating when you are, again, at a local \nlevel and are required to spend money looking for a contaminant that \nhas never been there. It has never been in the water. Nobody expects it \nto be in the water. Nobody has any reasonable basis to believe it is \ngoing to be in the water. But because of this strict standard, we were \nrequired to regulate it anyway.\n  The new law authorizes EPA to use $10 million from the State \nrevolving fund on health effects research. EPA is to establish a \npriority risk of unregulated contaminants and gather health effects and \noccurrence information on the listed contaminants. The Administrator of \nEPA must consult with the Centers for Disease Control as it does this \nanalysis. In other words, it cannot just come to a regulatory \nconclusion without some reference to what our scientists, particularly \nour health scientists, are telling us about what is going on with \ndrinking water. The States are to monitor for up to 20 unregulated \ncontaminants to collect information for future standards.\n  The next issue is the standard setting itself. Under current law, EPA \nhas established standards for more than 80 drinking water contaminants. \nThe 1986 amendments required EPA to promulgate 25 new standards every 3 \nyears. The cost to small communities, again, are not considered at all \nwhen these standards are set. This legislation, this change in the law, \nrepeals the ``25 every 3 years'' rule and establishes a new mechanism \nto identify contaminants for future regulation by consulting with the \nCenters for Disease Control.\n  Again, if we are trying to have safe drinking water, it seems to be \nreasonable to reference those individuals who have the responsibility \nfor telling us what is causing Americans to get sick from drinking our \nwater. EPA is to conduct a benefit-cost analysis for each new standard \nbefore it is promulgated, and if EPA determines the benefits of a \nstandard issued under current law would not justify the cost of the \nsystems that must comply with the standard, EPA must issue a less \nstringent standard that maximizes health risk reduction at a cost that \nis justified.\n  I have heard people come and say we are weakening standards. We \nunquestionably are not. This is a change that will allow us, again with \nreference to what is causing Americans to get sick, if there is a \nhealth problem that the Centers for Disease Control--Mr. President, is \nthere a limitation on time? \n\n[[Page S17847]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 5-minute limitation and the Senator \nhas consumed slightly over 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this was a particularly difficult and \nimportant issue. The Nebraska League of Cities sent me a petition with \n60 signatures, which specifically asked the Senate to ``include \nprovisions that changed the current process for setting standards to \ninclude public health benefits and costs as factors in determining new \nrequirements.'' I will guarantee these local community leaders are not \ngoing to send me a letter asking me to do that if they did not have the \nsupport of their community to get it done. Many people have said I am \nselling out, weakening standards. You are not weakening the standards \nif the people at the local level say, ``This is what we want done.'' As \nI said at the beginning, I think there is safe drinking water \nlegislation that has been a great success. But we keep getting example \nafter example after example of citizens saying, ``Change the law to \ngive us the flexibility so we can make more of our own decisions. We \nwant to reference science. We want to reference the health people. We \ndo not want to make our people sick. We want them to be able to drink \nthe water and know that water is safe. But we have to have some \nflexibility to be able to do that because we are paying for this with \nproperty taxes.'' Most of these smaller communities are up against \nimposed lids and they have a tough time getting that job done.\n  The next issue was the issue of monitoring. One of the largest costs \nof compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act is monitoring. Again, it \ncomes out of the local property tax base, typically, to get this done. \nAll Nebraska communities have asked that the current system be revised \nto let them test for contaminants that exist in Nebraska. Again, all. \nThis is not one where there is any dissent. Every single community is \nasking that they be allowed to test for contaminants that exist in \nNebraska.\n  We may have some contaminants that Missouri does not have, and you \nmay have some we do not have. You do not want to test for ours, and we \ndo not want to test for yours, because it costs money. If we require \nthem to test for contaminants that do not exist, again, it just \nundercuts the citizens' confidence you could ever get into an \nenvironment where Government can regulate, where we can collectively \nregulate for the purpose of improving the capacity of our lives.\n  Let me go through this a bit. Under current law, States go through a \nwaiver process to get some monitoring requirements changed. But this \nprocess is very expensive, it is very time consuming and it has been \nvery frustrating for people at the local level. The benefits accrue to \nthe local system while the costs are incurred by the States. The States \nthat do have waivers have seen huge decreases in monitoring costs. \nThese potential savings should be spread to all States, according to \nthe example that has been set by those who have been granted the \nwaivers.\n  The bill says we revise the current monitoring rules for at least 12 \ncontaminants within 2 years. It allows the States to establish their \nown alternative monitoring requirements that may be less stringent than \nFederal monitoring requirements, provided they ensure compliance and \nenforcement of Federal health standards.\n  There are other changes in this legislation having to do with ground \nwater disinfection. The current law requires the promulgation of a \nmandatory ground water disinfection rule, requiring all systems to \ntreat their water. This bill delays the enactment date of this rule to \noccur at the same time the States do a rulemaking as established for \ndisinfectants and disinfection products.\n  This legislation also helps us by authorizing some additional new \nprograms: $1 billion for State revolving funds for safe drinking water; \nStates provide 20 percent match. It authorizes $53 million for health \neffects research. It has been brought to my attention at the State \nlevel that in Nebraska there is $717 million worth of infrastructure \nneeds that will have to be put in place over the next 20 years.\n  The chairman of the committee, quite appropriately--I am on the VA-\nHUD Committee--the chairman of the committee quite appropriately \npointed out one of the weaknesses of this bill is that you are sort of \npromising money that is going to be there and it may not be there. We \nare authorizing more than we have. I take this opportunity to point out \nthat the problem here is that we still have a growing cost of \nentitlements that erode our ability to make these kinds of investments.\n  I heard yesterday the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Hatfield, indicates that he thinks it is likely that we are \ngoing to come up with a way to satisfy the requirements of the \ncontinuing resolution by the 14th of December--not by cutting defense, \nnow that we are going to Bosnia. Nobody seems to be inclined to do \nthat. But we are going to get $4 billion of savings out of entitlements \nto get the job done. And we are going to get it--and the biggest \nentitlements are going to be in health care, they are going to be in \nretirement--we are not likely to touch retirement. We should, to get \nthe job done.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota wants to speak, and I will wrap \nup with this one statement having to do with a pet issue of mine. The \ncost of entitlements under the Republican budget and under the \nDemocratic alternative--a group of 20 of us or so that have an \nalternative that balances the budget in 7 years as well--in either \ncase, the cost of entitlements, health care and retirement, continue to \ngrow and displace all other expenditures. If you think it is not a \nproblem, imagine what it would be like to pass 13 appropriations bills \nif all we had was $445 billion. You say, oh, $445 billion is a lot of \nmoney. But $445 billion is what we would have in the year 2002 if you \nadjust for inflation.\n  Gosh, the most liberal Member of this body, in the House or the \nSenate, probably would not spend less than $250 billion on defense, \n$260 billion, leaving you with $170 or $180 billion for all nondefense \nspending. I urge colleagues to look at that number because it is going \nto get tougher and tougher and tougher for us to get the job done. I, \nfor one, hope, as we look for a compromise on reconciliation, not only \nwill we consider adjusting the CPI down--I would go a full point--but I \nhope we look at some other adjustments that produce savings.\n  I think it is reasonable to put an affluence test on all \nentitlements, including farm payments, to say, basically, we are going \nto adjust it as income goes up. I think it is reasonable for us to say \nnow we have to adjust the eligibility age, both for Medicare and Social \nSecurity. We can hold harmless everybody over the age of 50, if that is \nwhat we choose to do. I think it is reasonable to phase it in. It is \nreasonable to phase those changes in. Nobody listening to this who is \nover 65, or 60, or 55, ought to think we are talking about them. But, \nunless we make that kind of a change, this baby boom generation is \ngoing to rank out about 2008. When we start retiring, our kids are not \ngoing to be willing to have their payroll taxes increased by the amount \nthat is going to be necessary to pay for our Medicare and Social \nSecurity. We are not going to be able, I say to my colleagues--we are \nnot going to be able to adjust rapidly enough to come up with the $717 \nbillion that Nebraska is going to need for its infrastructure \ninvestments or for any other thing in the appropriated accounts.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the additional time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nebraska will \nprobably want to stay for a couple of minutes. The Senator from \nNebraska and I \n\n[[Page S17848]]\nwanted to visit for a couple of minutes about the conference that is \nnow taking place between the Senate and the House on the \ntelecommunications bill. The Senate has passed a telecommunications \nbill, and so has the House, and it is now in conference.\n  The impact of the telecommunications legislation will be very \nsubstantial all across this country. What is happening in the \nconference, and the reason that I came to the floor today, is very \ndisturbing to me. The issue of reforming the telecommunications laws \nand regulations in this country is very real, and very necessary. It is \nalso very important. The Communications Act has not been changed \nsignificantly since it was written in the 1930's.\n  Clearly, we ought to pass a telecommunications bill. But it ought to \nbe in the right way. If it is done in the wrong way rural areas in \nAmerica will be left out.\n  I voted against the legislation that we passed in the Senate. I also \nbelieve that the Senator from Nebraska voted against, because we saw \nsome very serious problems. We hope some of those problems will be \nfixed in conference, but it appears that some of them will be made \nworse in conference.\n  Before I talk about the larger issues, I want to talk about one that \nis most important to me: universal service. From the standpoint of \nsomeone who comes from a rural State, the market system is not going to \ndecide that the income stream in a rural State is going to persuade \npeople to come and engage in robust competition to provide new services \nin rural areas. That is why the notion of universal service is critical \nto rural areas.\n  What kind of a telephone system do you have in rural areas? Do you \nhave a telephone in the smallest town in North Dakota? Sure, we do. Why \ndo we have a telephone there? Because the existing universal system has \nmade that possible. It is much more expensive, per person, to have a \nsmall number of telephones in a small community in terms of fixed cost \nthan it is to have millions of telephones in New York City. But we have \ndecided that it is a matter of universal importance for everyone to \nhave modern communications equipment so that everyone can communicate \nwith one another.\n  The fact that there is a telephone in Regent, ND, makes a telephone \nin New York City more valuable because that New York telephone can \ncommunicate with someone on the receiving end in Regent, ND. It is a \nvery small community, and I am guessing it does cost more to have \ntelephones in Regent, ND, than in New York City. However, we have a \nuniversal service fund that is designed to equalize those costs and \nmake sure that we have universal opportunity and universal service in a \ncritical area called communication.\n  What will be the result of this new telecommunications bill? What \nabout new kinds of communications? What about new technology? Will they \nbe available in rural areas, or will they only be available in some of \nwealthiest neighborhoods? Will they only been available in some of the \nlargest cities?\n  There were 24 Senators, 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, including \nmyself, who joined together in a bipartisan group to write to the \nSenate conferees in support of the rural provisions that are in the \nSenate bill. These provisions are very important to rural States. The \nproblem we have at this point is that the conferees from the House side \nare trying to strip those provisions out. This is not a partisan fight. \nIt is a bipartisan determination on the part of the Senate to want to \nretain those provisions. I want to speak a little more about those \nprovisions later.\n  Let me go on to a couple of the larger issues in the bill that deal \nwith macroeconomic things that Senator Kerrey and I have also been \ninvolved in. I am concerned about the two areas in this bill dealing \nwith competition. One, the legislation lifts entirely the limits on how \nmany TV stations one person can own in America. We now have a limit of \n12. I think it is in the public interest to say one can only own 12 TV \nstations and no more than 12. Currently, it is no more than 12 TV \nstations reaching no more than 25 percent of the population.\n  The bill says, on the other hand, that one can own as many TV \nstations as one likes. Let us just take the cap off, the sky is the \nlimit. One can go right ahead and by as many TV stations as one can \nmuster up the money to buy. One can also own as many radio stations as \none wants to buy. That makes no sense to me. That kind of concentration \nmoves in exactly the wrong direction. Concentration is the opposite of \ncompetition. One cannot support a bill like this and call it \ncompetition--when, in fact, it provides for more concentration. Yet, \nthat is exactly what is happening.\n  It also true with respect to the question of when the Bell systems \nare allowed to go compete in long distance. They should not be allowed \nto compete in long distance service until there is competition in the \nlocal service exchange. The question is, when is there meaningful \ncompetition in the local service exchange so that competition in the \nlong distance industry will not be harmed? We had a big fight about \nthat on the floor of the Senate. It was a close vote.\n  The Senator from Nebraska and I offered an amendment that said let us \nlet the Justice Department, using the Clayton standard, evaluate \nwhether or not a baby Bell's entrance into long distance will lessen \ncompetition or tend to create a monopoly before they should be \npermitted to compete in the long distance area. The fact is, we lost. \nWe lost because a lot of folks wanted to vote for a position that is, \nin my judgment, anticompetition and proconcentration.\n  I want to read what a few of the editorials say about the \ntelecommunications bill that is now in conference, and why I and many \nothers think it desperately needs reform.\n  USA Today says: ``Monopolies win, you lose.'' That is their simple \ndescription of the bill.\n  Business Week says: ``If Congress really wants a free phone market, \nwith the competition and lower prices that will come with it, it \nshouldn't be quite so generous to those local monopolists, the Baby \nBells.''\n  The Oregonian says: ``. . . a single owner could control all the \nmedia outlets and communications links in a given market--a scary \nmonopoly.''\n  The Tennessean says: ``. . . the problem with the bill is that it \nremoves most telephone and cable rate restrictions without first \nassuring that competition is in place.''\n  The Denver Post says: ``If the current bill becomes law, phone prices \nmay rise and consumers will have fewer--and not more--choices.''\n  The Charleston Gazette says: ``. . . the bill trashes long-time rules \nthat have restricted concentration of media ownership . . . \nDeregulation and `reform' have increasingly become code words for \nfreeing huge corporations from the Government oversight that prevents \nthem from gouging the public and developing stifling monopolies.''\n  Some of us feel very strongly that we ought to pass a bill that \npromotes competition, that opens the marketplace to more competition, \nand, yes, eliminates some regulations where competition can replace \nregulations. But there are two premises that are troublesome with that \npoint. One is, you do not have competition in many rural areas. Often \nyou have a circumstance where you only have one interest willing to \nserve, and that service sometimes has to be required. The economics \nsimply do not dictate service. So you cannot deal with that quite the \nsame way; ergo, we have the question about universal service and the \nneed to make sure that exists in the legislation.\n  Second, we are very concerned about a circumstance where legislation \nin the telecommunications area allows such concentration that one \nentity really in a community can own the newspaper, can own the major \ntelevision station, can own the cable company, can own it all, control \nideas, control thought, and determine what is published, what is not. \nThat is pretty scary. It is not moving in the direction of competition. \nIt is moving in the direction of concentration, and it is exactly in \nthe wrong direction.\n  So my hope is that those in the conference will understand that if \nthey bring to the floor of the Senate a conference report that backs \naway on the protections in this bill for rural States, they are going \nto have a lot of trouble. If they bring to the floor the piece of \nlegislation that they left the floor with and do nothing in the area of \nconcentration or fixing those problems, they will have very big trouble \nbecause \n\n[[Page S17849]]\nsome of us will not want to let a conference report like that continue \nto move.\n  So I would be happy to yield some time to the Senator from Nebraska \non this subject as well.\n  Let me yield the floor and ask if the Senator from Nebraska seeks \ntime.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I really quite agree with the Senator from North Dakota. \nI think the legislation passed here was well intended. People who voted \nfor it understand there is a lot of change going on out there, and we \nneed to embrace that future and try to change our regulatory structure. \nBut it is possible for us to change it in a fashion that reduces \ncompetition. In fact, without some kind of meaningful role for the \nDepartment of Justice as we move from a monopoly to a market situation, \nas we move from a situation where the Government is making all the \ndecisions to a situation where it is the marketplace making the \ndecisions, if we do not have the agency that in fact has demonstrated \nthe ability in this area as it did with AT to manage that kind of \nsituation, I think we will end up with less, not more, competition.\n  I bring a story told at church Sunday by Father Jim Schultz from \nOmaha, NE. He told the story that kind of describes what happens out \nthere right now in the marketplace when you are dealing with a \nmonopoly.\n  The story is about a man who dies and goes to the pearly gates, and \nSt. Peter says, ``Well, you are right on the edge. We can't decide \nwhether you are going to go to Heaven or Hell, so you get to decide.'' \nThere are two doors. One goes to Heaven and one goes to Hell. St. Peter \nopens up one door and there is a big party going on with a band and \neverything, everybody is happy and great looking people inside there. \nSt. Peter says, ``Well, this is Hell.'' The man says, ``That's odd.''\n  So St. Peter looks at the next door. He opens up the door and goes \ninside, and there are a bunch of people sitting around in chairs, real \nsad and angry. He says, ``That's Heaven.'' He says, ``Take an hour and \ndecide and let me know.''\n  An hour later the man comes back and says to St. Peter, ``I think \nI'll do Hell.'' He opens up the door. The people are dead. The smell is \nstale, trash all over. He goes to St. Peter and he says, ``What \nhappened? An hour ago there was a great party, looked like a lot of \nfun, looked like the place to go.'' St. Peter says, ``An hour ago, you \nwere a prospect. Now you are a customer.''\n  In a monopoly, that is the situation. I had a recent example of that \nin Nebraska where a school trying to get enhanced services was told by \nthe telephone company: ``You do not need it. You really do not need \nthat enhanced service. We are not going to provide it to you because we \ndo not think you really need it. We do not think you really should have \nthis kind of service.''\n  When you have a situation where the company can say to you, ``We are \nnot going to satisfy your needs,'' you do not have competition. When \nyou have that kind of a situation going on, you really do have two \nchoices--take it or leave it. That is the only thing you can do.\n  We have built a tremendous telecommunications system in this country \nby using a combination of Government regulation and market forces, and \nas a consequence we not only have a tremendous telecommunications \nsystem but in any community in the country you get high quality \nservice. You can go to Alliance, NE, or Ainsworth, NE, or a rural \ncommunity in Nebraska and find your telephone service is going to be as \ngood as it is in Omaha because you have the same kind of service and \nsame high quality of service as a consequence of the law of the land \nsaying that is what universal service is to mean, that is what our \ncustomers as citizens ought to be able to have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERREY. Be pleased to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The people who are living in Nebraska or North Dakota in \na small community know when they make a long distance call, they have \nthe opportunity to choose from literally hundreds of long-distance \ncarriers. What they have experienced is that, because of hundreds \ninvolved in competition, long-distance service prices have been driven \ndown substantially for long-distance service. Competition, good \ncompetition generally provides the consumers with a better price.\n  The debate we had in the Senate was when should the Baby Bells, which \nare local monopolies at this point, engage in long-distance service and \nto try to capture the long-distance market. The answer should be when \nthere is competition in the local phone service in the communities. It \nis only when the Bells have competition, then, and only then, they \nshould be released to go compete in long distance.\n  On the question: How do you know when there is competition? I say: \nlet those who know about competition make that decision--the Justice \nDepartment. Of course, a lot of folks did not want that to happen. I \nthink we had 43 votes that supported the notion that the Justice \nDepartment should have a meaningful role. But we need to make sure that \ncompetition really exists. That is what is in the interest of the \nconsumers. Otherwise, we move right back towards recreating phone \nmonopolies that control not only local service but long distance as \nwell.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is quite right. As a matter of fact, in the \nlanguage last year, we had a Justice Department role, and we replaced \nit this year. The committee decided to replace it this year with a 10-\npart competitive checklist. The real test of competition is a very \nsimple test. One of the reasons I am of the belief that you have to \nhave a Department of Justice role of some kind--I am willing to drop \ndown to Clayton; I am willing to look at alternative standards--is that \nthe 10-part checklist does not really satisfy the consumer. I know when \nI have choice. If I have choice, the person who is trying to sell me \nsomething knows that if they do not get the price and the quality in \nthe range I think I am willing to pay for, I will shop someplace else. \nI will go someplace else.\n  If I have that kind of choice and that kind of alternative, then I \nhave competition. If I do not have it, I do not have competition. If I \nhave one company supplying all my news and one company supplying all my \nnewspaper and one company that says here is your phone service and one \ncompany says here is your cable service, there is no choice. All I have \nbasically is a question: Do I want it? Yes or no. I do not have any \nimpact upon the quality and I do not have any impact upon the price.\n  Mr. President, I hope that colleagues do not suffer under the \nillusion that the Senator from North Dakota and I--I certainly do not \nwant to create the impression that I am not willing to embrace the \nfuture and indeed make a bet. I think we have to risk here. I think we \nare talking about moving in a rather dramatically different direction.\n  I noted with considerable interest on the front page of the New York \nTimes this morning--I think that is an old picture--Steve Jobs, \ncofounder of Apple, started a new company called Pixar--what is it? \nHold on a minute here. Pixar Animation Studios is the name of the \ncompany, and he invested $68 million in it. They did a public offering \nyesterday, I believe, and thought it would go for about $22 a share. It \nturned out the market bid it up to close to $40, and all of a sudden he \nhas $1.2 billion. His company created $1 billion worth of wealth \nyesterday. The United States of America is $1 billion wealthier as a \nconsequence of this individual's decision to start a company that \nprovides animation, in this case to Disney that put out a movie--what \nis it called? The Toys or something like that. I have not seen it, but \nit had $38 million worth of revenue over the weekend, which is pretty \ndarned good.\n  In the article as well there is mention of a company I am familiar \nwith. James Clarke started a company called Netscape. He also created \n$1 billion worth of wealth.\n  This is important for us. This country is a wealthy country as a \nconsequence of somebody getting an idea and putting it out in the \nmarketplace, and all of a sudden you have value, you have something \nthat is worth something. \n\n[[Page S17850]]\n\n  It is important that these men generate wealth. It is important that \nwe continue to create ways that create wealth so we know the market is \ndoing some extraordinary things.\n  What I see, both with Netscape and Pixar Animation, is that this old \ncomputer that we saw sitting around our kids' bedrooms, and so forth, \nover the years is being converted into a communications tool. It used \nto just calculate, and increasingly we are using it to communicate.\n  Indeed, I am working with the University of Nebraska trying to figure \nout a way to leverage intellectual property because they are pricing \nthemselves out of the market. As the demand for college goes up and the \ndemand for an educated person goes up, we are getting a doubling and \ntripling and quadrupling of what that university has to do. Our \ntaxpayers do not have enough money to continue building and hiring more \nand more people. We have to leverage more intellectual property, and we \nare looking for a way to do it through computers. We know to get that \ndone we essentially have to pass a three-part test.\n  Test No. 1 is, Are you willing to embrace the future? Because if you \nare not, it is not going to work. If you want to hold on to the old way \nof teaching, say so. Because if you hold on to the old way of teaching, \nyou are not going to be able to get your costs down. And, secondly, you \nhave to be willing to place a bet, which means not only more money in \nthese areas, which unquestionably is the case, but you are going to \nrisk your reputation a little bit. You are going to take a chance on a \nroll.\n  So I understand that at some point we cannot really be sure what this \nlegislation is going to do. And I am an advocate of changing the law; I \nwish to break down the regulatory barriers so that consumers in their \nhomes can make a single choice. What we have done is we have set up a \nsystem of regulation that says over here we have television, over here \nwe have radio, over here we have dial tone, and over here we have \nprint. That is what we have done. What has happened is the technology \nhas obliterated those distinctions, and our regulatory structure still \nmaintains them.\n  So instead of being able to go to a single provider and buy it all \npackaged together--which, in my judgment, is the only way 100 million \npeople in residences are going to see a decline in price and an \nincrease in quality--you still have to buy them separately. As a \nresult, costs are higher.\n  So I hope that colleagues do not suffer under the illusion that I \nsomehow want to hold down the status quo. I am willing to embrace the \nfuture and willing to place a bet, but I want to see real vigorous \ncompetition and choice at the local level. I want to see that. I want \nto vote for this bill. I want it to come back out of conference and to \nprobably vote for it. I do not want to just stand over here and say \n``no,'' and hold my breath and try to hold it up.\n  But unless we get vigorous competition at the local level--and I do \nnot want to hold up the RBOC's. I want to be able for them to go out \nand compete. I am uncomfortable watching their top-end customers \nwhittle away while they do not compete in long distance itself. I would \nlike to be able to liberate them, but I want them to be liberated at \nthe moment when I am sure that we have very vigorous competition at \nthat local level.\n  So I hope that conferees understand that the Senator from North \nDakota and I are not sitting here saying that we do not realize the law \nneeds to be changed. We know the law needs to be changed. We know there \nis an exciting and important opportunity for wealth generation, for job \ngeneration, for education, for improving the way that our own \nGovernment operates, trying to make it more efficient, trying to \nimprove the quality of life for our citizens.\n  This piece of legislation, this law is extremely important, but it is \nimportant that we have in our own mind some kind of vision for what the \nworld is going to look like. Otherwise, all we are doing is trying to \nfashion some sort of compromise between the various corporate entities, \nand I think at the end of the day it will not create the kinds of \nchange that in fact are already occurring out there in the market.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me add just a couple comments to what \nthe Senator from Nebraska said. The status quo has been monopoly and \nconcentration. I do not believe in the status quo. I think competition, \nespecially in market areas where competition is supportable, \ncompetition is a much better arbiter of what happens in the marketplace \nthan the effects of concentration or monopoly. That is what we said \nwith respect to whether the Bells should go compete in long distance.\n  We thought we ought to do it with competition with local exchanges, \nthat true competition with local exchanges would help customers. And we \nthink that makes a lot of sense. When there is true competition, they \nought to be free to compete in long distance. If there is not true \ncompetition in local exchanges, to free them up to compete in a long \ndistance market that has been competitive and has had the effect of \ndriving down prices, that will, in fact, ruin a market system that has \nworked. That is what we are saying.\n  The second area is this issue of increased concentration that serves \nno one's interests, in my judgment. I was on a television program a \nwhile back because I asked for some hearings on bank mergers. The \ninterviewer said, ``Well, gee, these two big banks are merging and are \nable to get rid of 8,000 people who are duplicates.'' Getting rid of \nduplicate people, does that not make sense? Is that not efficiency? And \nis that not what is called efficiency? You can make that case for going \nto one bank.\n  Why not have one bank in America? That would be the most efficient, \nprobably. It would not make the most sense. I mean, efficiency--my \nhometown had two grocery stores. I suppose you could make the case we \nshould have only had one because it would be more efficient. I think \npeople were probably advantaged by having a little competition on Main \nStreet. It was a small town, but nonetheless competition in that little \narea probably served the people of my hometown pretty well.\n  So this area of concentration bothers me a great deal, and I hope \nthrough this conference they can address that once again.\n  I want to finally make this point. The Senator from Nebraska and I \nboth represent rural States. The question of what kind of \ntelecommunications service you have in a town of 2,000 people versus a \ntown of 2 million is very important, and the proposals to drop in this \nconference what we put in on the Senate side, on a bipartisan basis, \nare these sorts of things. We put in on the Senate side requirements \nthat rural areas have access to service that are reasonably comparable \nto those offered in urban areas, services that reasonably are \ncomparable in rates as urban areas, the benefits of advanced \ntelecommunications services for health care, education, economic \ndevelopment, as urban areas do.\n  Why is that important? Well, the universal service system in this \ncountry has guaranteed that up to this point, but if these guarantees \nare dropped--and one side wants to drop them at this point--and if this \nbill comes back without these kinds of provisions, this \ntelecommunications bill, in my judgment, this telecommunications bill \nwill be a full-scale retreat for a quarter century for many rural \nareas, and we will just be left in the dust here.\n  That is why we wanted at this point to at least serve notice to the \nconferees that this is not unimportant to some of us. If they think \nthey are going to bring a bill back here that is not procompetition, \nbut instead is proconcentration and promonopoly, and if they think they \nare going to bring a bill back here that says, rural people, you do not \ncount much, well, we count in the Senate. That is for sure.\n  It is true that the population decisions are made with respect to the \nrepresentation in the House. I mean, the House is, of course, \napportioned by population. But at least rural States count in the U.S. \nSenate. Someone who lives in Hutchinson County, ND, finds it just as \nimportant to have an advanced telecommunications system and good \ntelephone service and good health care service and other things as \nsomeone who lives in St. Louis. \n\n[[Page S17851]]\n\n  So these are very important issues for all of us. And we hope--I \nnotice that the conference committee did not meet today because there \nis a flareup that does not relate, I think, to what we are talking \nabout. But we hope when these conferees meet they understand the \nimportance of getting this right when they bring this bill back to the \nHouse and the Senate, because otherwise I do not think you will have a \nconference report pass the Senate.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, so people wonder what the impact of this \nis going to be, and 94 percent of American homes have telephones, 60 \npercent have cable--I believe those are the numbers--and nearly 100 \npercent have television sets, and more people have telephones and \ntelevision sets than have running water. It is a substantial success \nstory we have that kind of penetration into American households.\n  Every single household in America is going to be affected by this, \nand we are talking about trying to describe a significant change in the \nway they are going to be coming into contact with their providers. I \nthink, as a consequence, it is very important for us to decide in our \nown minds what kind of an environment are we trying to create.\n  One of the pieces that is in here that seems a little contrary to my \nown desire for competition--in fact, a little more than just a little \ncontrary, it is contrary, but it is necessary to build a bridge in that \ncompetitive environment--is the Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey \nprovisions having to do with education.\n  I am very pleased, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter written \nby the chairman of the conference committee, Senator Pressler, \nindicating that he intends to hold and support the Senate's view on \nthat provision, be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1995.\n     Hon. J. Robert Kerrey,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: Thank you for your cosigned letter regarding the \n     amendment contained in S. 652 which will ensure affordable \n     access to telecommunications services for schools, libraries, \n     and rural health care providers.\n       As Chairman of the conference, I have the responsibility to \n     advance the interests of the Senate. As your letter \n     indicates, there is strong support for this amendment to S. \n     652 in the Senate, and I am aware that many in the House \n     support the provision, too. I think this provision left the \n     Senate with strong bipartisan consensus, and the view of the \n     Senate that it should be adopted is strong. Since two of the \n     sponsors of the amendment also are Senate conferees on the \n     bill, I know they, too, will argue forcefully for its \n     inclusion in the final bill.\n       Thank you for taking the time to contact me, Bob. I will \n     try to keep you apprised of our progress in conference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this idea of technology being a \nconstructive force in our lives is sometimes a difficult sell to make \nto people, particularly with software, because they have experienced \nthe joy of downsizing as we get more efficient. They sometimes wonder \nwhat good this is all going to be, or particularly in an educational \nenvironment, people, like myself, remember the old ``talking head'' \nenvironment that was there with the television sets coming into the \nclassroom.\n  I really want to emphasize that I think the only way that we are \ngoing to be able to increase the amount of learning that goes on, \nwhether it is in the home, which I think is the first line of defense \nin education--if we can increase the amount of learning that goes on in \nthe home, it is going to be an awful lot easier to make an educational \nform work inside the school, since the homes were there before the \nschools were--it will make it an awful lot easier for any of our \ninstitutional efforts to succeed.\n  This technology gives us the opportunity to provide continuous \nlearning inside of the home environment. It is going to be very \ndifficult for us to do the sorts of things we want unless we embrace a \nfuture that changes the way we teach and changes the way we use \ntechnology unless we are willing to bet not only to change the law but \nalso change the allocation of resources.\n  It is going to be very difficult to make this work unless we, as \nadults, with the responsibility to make these decisions, say that this \nis going to become part of our core competency, whether that is a \nschool or that is in a university or whether that is a government \nagency that is trying to operate in some kind of an efficient fashion.\n  So I am here this afternoon to say that I want to embrace change. I \ndo embrace change. I am working on it all the time, particularly in the \nenvironment of our schools. But we can put change in place that makes \nthings worse.\n  I say to the men and women who are on the conference committee, my \ncolleagues and Members of the House that are on this conference \ncommittee, I urge you to put a meaningful role in there for Justice, \nsome kind of role in there for Justice or, in my judgment, you are \ngoing to regret that you did not. You will regret that you did not \nbecause we are not going to have the kind of competitive environment \nthat we need to have at that local level to enjoy the benefits that we \nall promise at least when we talk about supporting change in the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17847-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17851-S17853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, before I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, I noted earlier there were a number of Republican \ncolleagues that came down and talked about the budget. There were some \nstatements made that I feel compelled to respond to. Some came down and \nsaid the Democrats are not really serious. They do not have a plan. \nThere is no attempt here, no willingness here to, in fact, address \nthese budgetary difficulties.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I respectfully say, just the opposite is \nthe case. There is unanimous desire on the part of the Democrats to \ncome up with a change in our law so as to get to a point where our \nbudget is balanced, but we have a different vision. We have competing \nvisions and competing ideas on how to do that.\n  I appreciate, for example, the willingness of Republicans to say that \nthey want to preserve and protect Medicare. It is a very important \nchange. At least I hear it as a change. One of the things that must be \nunderstood with Medicare as a fundamental principle is that we said in \n1965, when people hit the age of 65, they are going to have difficulty \npurchasing health insurance, so we are going to create a change in the \nFederal law under the Social Security Act to provide a mechanism for \nAmericans over the age of 65 to get insured.\n  The question is, has it worked? Ask your Representative or Senator, \n``Has this worked?'' Is that an example of something that has \naccomplished the job? In 1965, 43 percent of people over 65 were \nuninsured. Today, it is less than 1 percent. The answer is \nunquestionably yes. Mr. President, 100 percent of the people over the \nage of 65 are today insured. It has worked surprisingly well.\n  However, there is a problem, and the problem is, first, we allowed \ncustomary and usual reimbursement, so we had no cost controls to begin \nwith and the costs have blown completely off the chart. We came back in \nthe eighties and implemented a system called perspective payment system \nand started to reimburse according to diagnostic groups and, \nunfortunately, that tended to shift costs over into the physician \nservices and costs continued to escalate.\n  Today, they are growing, I guess, 10, 11, or 12 percent, somewhere in \nthat area. We are facing a tremendous increase in costs. I completely \nagree with the Republicans who say that we have to control those costs. \nWe do not need to cut Medicare, but we have to slow the growth of the \nprogram. There is no question that that needs to be done.\n  However, the point of departure that I have, and I have made it a \nnumber of times--I feel like I am running a broken record here in \nsaying it--there is a short-term problem and a long-term problem with \nMedicare, and it is the long-term problem that is enormous.\n  The long-term problem with Medicare begins about the year 2008 when, \nas I indicated earlier, the largest population group, the largest \ngeneration in the history of this country, the baby \n\n[[Page S17852]]\nboomers, begin to retire. We cannot meet the promises with the current \nrate of taxes. We do not even come close. We are either going to have a \ntremendous tax increase out there or a very quick cut, not in the \ngrowth of the program, we are going to have real cuts in the program \nitself. So we have to slow the growth, not just in the short term, we \nhave to slow the growth in the long term for Medicare.\n\n  I hope as we move through these deliberations, the Democrats, in \naddition to coming to the floor and saying we want to protect Medicare \nand preserve Medicare and we want to make sure the cuts there and in \nMedicaid do not fall in a disproportionate or unnecessarily harsh \nfashion, I hope we also come to the floor and say, as I have done now \ntwo or three times, I think we should drop the tax cut.\n  I am for reforming our Tax Code so as to promote economic growth, but \none of the odd anomalies in this whole debate is that a $245 billion \ntax cut, according to CBO, actually decreases growth. It does not \nincrease growth, it decreases. I am for having a debate about how do \nyou relieve, in a fair fashion, particularly not just on working \nAmericans, but families from some of the penalties that they currently \nface.\n  But if we drop the tax cut--I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period \nof morning business be extended, with Senators permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again, I will not go on this little \ndiatribe about entitlements, but I will summarize what I was saying \nearlier.\n  I hope we do not get a continuation of visitations to the floor \nasserting that Democrats do not want to balance the budget or we do not \nhave a plan or, conversely, that Republicans are all heartless and do \nnot care about the poor and have no desire--it may score relatively \nwell, but it will not enable us to solve this problem.\n  The problem, to be clear, is, not only is the budget out of balance, \nbut the growth of entitlements are continuing at an unsustainable pace, \nnot only eroding our ability to pay for appropriations but also, Mr. \nPresident, eroding our long-term ability to be able to do anything.\n  We will, by the year 2012, convert the entire Federal Government into \nan ATM machine if we continue. That is all we are going to be doing, is \ntransferring money: collect it and transfer it. Everything else is \ngoing to be shut down.\n  To solve that problem, if you really want to create a revolutionary \nchange, indeed, if you want to vote for something that is tough as heck \nthis year, but every year afterward is going to get easy, as opposed to \nthis budget--this budget is relatively easy to vote for because the \ncuts occur later--next year's vote is going to be tougher and the year \nafter that is going to be tougher. It gets tougher every single year, \nbecause we are squeezing these appropriations accounts, and we have not \ntackled the entitlements as we ought to.\n\n  I will give you some things you have to do. Can we get it out of the \nfarm program, cut defense? The answer is no, there is not much room in \nthose things. Here is something you have to be willing to vote for: You \nhave to be willing to vote to reduce the CPI, I would say at least by \nhalf a point. I would vote for a full point. The full point pushes the \ninsolvency rate of Social Security back 30 years. That is the kind of \nrevolutionary change which produces change not only in the short term, \nthat enables us to put more money back into Medicare, Medicaid, and \neducation, if that is what you want to do, which I think would be a \nreasonable thing, but in the long term the impact is tremendous.\n  Second, we ought to think about an affluence test not just on part B, \nnot just on COLA's, but on the whole shebang. If you have a contract \nwith a retiree where they paid in, that is fine; do not break a \ncontract we have in place. But if it is merely a transfer of payment \nbeing made because we presume somebody needs it, when their income goes \nup, they do not need it; when their income goes back down, let them \nhave it again. Do not take it away from them, but adjust it according \nto income. It produces tremendous savings, both in the short term and \nin the long term.\n  Lastly, if you want to produce some real change out there in the \nfuture that will enable us to look at beneficiaries under the age of 40 \nand say there is going to be a Medicare Program for you and a Social \nSecurity Program for you, let us adjust the eligibility age both for \nMedicare and Social Security to 70. That is what the entitlement \ncommission recommended. The Kerrey-Simpson proposal on Social Security \ndoes that.\n  I say to all those who are listening, what will typically happen is I \nmake a statement like that and somebody will interview a 70 year old: \nWhat do you think of that proposal to have the eligibility age changed?\n  That is a terrible idea. It would hurt me.\n  It does not affect anybody over the age of 50. We can phase it in. \nBut the longer we wait, the quicker the change has to occur. The longer \nyou wait, the more painful the decision is. Those are the kinds of \nthings the Democrats need to come down and say to Republicans, as we \nlook for a way not only to balance the budget but balance the growth of \nentitlements and enable us to have a Federal Government that can, when \nwe agree what it ought to do--this whole thing started with me in a \ndiscussion of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Senator Bond, chairman of \nthe committee, pointed out accurately that we are authorizing more than \nwe have. We have a certain amount of infrastructure just for safe \ndrinking water over the next several years, and we are going to \nstruggle to come up with the money, as a consequence of being unwilling \nor unable, whatever, to vote a change in the law that will produce the \nchanges in the outlays on those mandatory programs.\n  That is a tough vote. But if you had a bipartisan vote on something \nlike that, I think we can take a lot of political rhetoric out of it \nand it would still be tough. But every year after that it gets easier. \nWhereas, whether it is the Republican proposal, by the way, or the \nDemocratic alternative, either one, the easiest vote is this year. Next \nyear is tougher, and it gets tougher and tougher and tougher. And these \nmandatory programs continue to grow.\n  So I hope that as we come to the floor and talk about our own ideas \nfor solving this problem, we do not say that one party is insincere, or \nthe other party is heartless; I hope we will actually come to the floor \nand suggest things that might not only balance the budget in 7 years, \nbut put us on a track where we are able to say to every single \nbeneficiary that there is going to be something there for you, and we \nare able to say to our people that once Republicans and Democrats have \ndecided what we ought to be doing in research, education, space, \ndefense, or law enforcement--once we have decided what it is we ought \nto do--and the disagreements are typically a lot more at the margin \nthan meets the eye--once we have made a decision, I hope we have the \nmoney to do it.\n  I would like to see that happen. I do not have a lot of optimism \ngiven the current lay of the land. But I would like to see sooner, \nrather than later, us making those kinds of changes because it is \ninevitable to me.\n  I challenge any staff that happens to be listening--I assume Members \nwould not listen to all this stuff--to try to figure out what I am \ntalking about. Take the number $445 billion and then go to the 13 \nappropriations accounts and add up what we are currently spending, \nbecause $445 billion is what we are allocating in 2002 under the \nDemocratic budget and under the Republican budget. You cannot do it. \nTake $260 billion out for defense--and very often people say, ``I know \nhow to save the money, we will cut defense.'' Well, you cannot cut it \nenough. You cannot cut waste, fraud, and abuse enough to be able to get \nit done. You can take our salaries to zero and it would not impact the \nsort of choices we are going to have to make. Constructive budget, \ndefense and \n\n[[Page S17853]]\nnondefense, was $445 billion. Then you begin to see the dilemma if we \ndo not vote for the changes in our mandatory programs that will enable \nus to have the Federal Government do those things that I believe the \nAmerican people want us to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17851-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17853-S17854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENTITLEMENT SPENDING\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, 4 years ago at this time, the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska was a candidate for the Democratic \nnomination for President of the United States. That was an unsuccessful \nquest. But I will reflect on the fact that had that been a successful \nquest, we would not be faced with the challenge or the deadlock with \nwhich the Congress is faced today.\n  The Senator from Nebraska, very clearly, goes much further in his \nrecommendations for dealing with entitlements than does the Republican \nbudget, which will be vetoed by the President because it does much too \nmuch for this President with respect to entitlement spending. Each of \nthe suggestions that he has made, each of the suggestions that his \nbipartisan organization has made have a great deal of merit. Each of \nthem ought to be seriously debated here in the Congress of the United \nStates and, for that matter, in the White House. Very bluntly, however, \nthey are not because the person who is President of the United States \nessentially sets the agenda, or at least the parameters of the debate \nover matters of this nature.\n  So, at this point, we are faced with the proposition that, at best, \nwe can do some of the things, take some of the steps toward a reform of \nour entitlement programs and the preservation of Medicare, advocated by \nthe Senator from Nebraska and those who worked with him. But that is \nnot the nature of the debate today.\n  In spite of the fact that the Senator from Nebraska speaks as a \nDemocrat, speaks from the other side of the aisle, we are faced today \nwith the proposition that this body, this Congress, without a single \nDemocratic vote here in the Senate, and with only the tiniest handful \nin the House of Representatives, has, in fact, passed a balanced budget \nin the year 2002, and has in fact, for the first time that this \nCongress really has ever done so, proposed profound reforms in \nentitlement programs, both for their own preservation and in order to \npreserve some ability on the part of the Congress to fund these \ndiscretionary programs.\n  We are faced with the position of at least the vast majority of the \nother party, and certainly the President, that they will not propose \nany alternative which will reach the same goal. We struggled through \nbitter debates on this floor and much difficulty to pass a modest 3-\nweek continuing resolution just a short time ago, just before \nThanksgiving, the heart of which, as far as we were concerned, was the \nproposition --which the President signed--that we would come up with a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002, using statistics provided by the \nCongressional Budget Office. Now, halfway from the date of that passage \nuntil December 15, we have no such proposal from the President, or, I \nmay say, from the leaders of the party of which the Senator from \nNebraska is a Member--none whatsoever. We have critiques of various \nelements of our proposal, including the critique of our tax reductions \nfrom the Senator from Nebraska. Well and good. Such criticisms are \ncertainly appropriate within the frame of reference for reaching a \nbalanced budget by 2002.\n\n  It would be wonderful to debate whether or not we ought to go further \nand to pass a set of reforms that would last longer and be more \ndecisive. But the Senator from Nebraska knows that no such debate of \nany seriousness will go on during this administration.\n  So the real parameters are, is there a different way of reaching the \ngoal set out in a law passed by this Congress just 10 days ago and \nsigned by this President just 10 days ago? Do they want to make some \nkind of adjustments with various spending programs or with tax \nreductions? So far, the answer is, ``no,'' they do not want to play the \ngame at all. They are content with the status quo.\n  Last night, we were informed by the President of the United States \nthat if we would simply pass appropriations bills with the items in it \nthat he regarded as priorities, then he would sign the appropriations \nbills. Wonderful. Not a word about reforms in the entitlements, which \nare absolutely necessary in order to have any money left over in future \nyears for any of these discretionary programs. Well, of course, that is \nan unacceptable offer. The only way we can determine whether or not \nthere is money for any of the programs that we feel important, or that \nthe President feels are important, is to operate within the same set of \nparameters, and to have the President submit to us something which his \nparty will support and he will sign, which meets that goal of a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002.\n  It can be as radically different as that which the Senator from \nNebraska advocates here. That would clearly be a starting point. I \nsuspect that if it were a program such as he proposed, he would find a \ngreat deal of support for many of its elements on this side of the \naisle. But he knows we are not going to get any such proposal from his \npolitical party. I hope that he regrets that we have gotten no proposal \nat all that meets those requirements--none at all. We have simply a \nstatement that ``we have these priorities and those priorities,'' none \nof which includes balancing the budget. Now, this is not a zero-sum \ngame, Mr. President, because built into the proposal which passed as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 is a huge dividend of $170 \nbillion to the Government of the United States--perhaps half a trillion \nmore in income in the pockets of the American people in the form of \nhigher wages and lower interest rates, a dividend which disappears if \nwe do not reach the goal.\n\n  Almost precisely identical with the date of last year's elections, \ninterest rates began to drop in the United States. Almost precisely \nwith that time, productivity began to increase in the United States. \nInflation is lower in the United States, as I read the statements of \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, due to anticipation of a \nbalanced budget.\n  If this deadlock continues--if the President makes no proposal to \nreach that goal, no proposal, not that his own advisers think is a good \none, but one that will stand the test of time and the financial markets \nof the United States--these improvements in our economy will be \nephemeral. Interest rates will go up, the number of jobs will go down. \nWe will be in a serious situation.\n  So I know that those Senators on this side who have heard the remarks \nof the Senator from Nebraska will admire them and in most respects \nagree with them, but the time has come that either he needs to persuade \nhis party to adopt his position, or at least he needs to persuade his \nparty to respond within the frame of reference that is now the law of \nthe United States for the last 10 years, and come up with some \nalternative that reaches those goals using the same set of figures that \nwill provide the dividend we have been told will be the dividend \nresulting from a balanced budget.\n  Somehow or another we have to get such an answer. We cannot negotiate \na precise position on one side against no position at all on the other \nside. That is what we have from the President of the United States.\n  I return to the beginning of my remarks: 4 years ago the statement of \nthe Senator from Nebraska would have been more widely heard in the \nUnited States, when he was a candidate for President. I do not think I \nwould have voted for him against the candidate of my own party, but I \ncertainly think the country would have been better off had he succeeded \nin being the Democratic nominee.\n  Mr. KERREY. In response to my friend from Washington, let me say that \nI do believe the President started off this year with a budget as \neverybody knows that he submitted, and I do not think there was a \nsingle vote for it when it came out. He understood he had to change and \ncame on with a 10-year plan and, 10 or 14 days ago, agreed now to \nsupport a plan to balance the budget in 7 years.\n  What I was trying to do and am trying to do is not just persuade \nDemocrats, but Republicans as well that we have, as we go into these \nnegotiations, \n\n[[Page S17854]]\nwhich is what we are doing now--I am part of a group that the \nDemocratic Leader Daschle has put together to discuss and come up with \na proposal so that we have something that we can try to reach agreement \nwith Republicans over.\n\n  I am trying to say to Democrats as we do that, that yes, we should \ndefend those things we think are important, make sure that Medicare has \na sufficient amount of resources, for example, so that we do not have \nto unnecessarily punish particularly rural hospitals, and look for \nways--I think block granting Medicaid is not a good thing, and rejected \nthat.\n  We should object to things we do not like in the proposal, but in \naddition to looking for a way to bridge the gap, which if I was going \nto predict I think likely will knock the CPI back by half a point and \nshave the tax thing back by x amount of dollars and put more money in \nMedicare and Medicaid and go home and say we have a deal.\n  That is lying there to be done. I do not know if we will have the \ncapacity to get it done, but we will now have a move toward balancing \nthe budget in the year 2002.\n  The only impact we have with our vote is on this year's budget. The \ndifficult thing I have is that according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the proposal that was passed with all Republican votes actually \nincreases the deficit next year and increases the deficit the year \nafter.\n  Why? Because the tax cuts are front-end loaded. Again, if you examine \nthe Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the tax cut, it produces \nless economic growth. The CBO is saying that the status quo produces \nmore growth than what we have with the $245 billion tax cut.\n  Even if you could find a way to bridge the gap and say, ``Use the CPI \nto eliminate the cuts in Medicare and figure out some way to bridge the \ngap,'' we are left with a tax cut proposal that does not promote \neconomic growth, which I think ought to be mission No. 1 as we analyze \nour tax system.\n  I am merely saying that I am prepared and am in the negotiations as \nwe meet on the Democratic side, and I find myself with an unusual \nopportunity with so much morning business--we have had very little of \nthat lately. As I find myself with an opportunity to come to the floor \nand talk about this, I just want to waste no moment to stand up and say \nthat not only do we need to balance the budget, but we need to change \nthese mandatory programs, the laws that govern.\n  Democrats who say, ``Gee, I want to spend more money on education; I \nwant to put more money in child care; I want to put more money in rural \nhealth clinics; I think we ought to do more in research and science.'' \nRepublicans who say, ``I think we need more law enforcement,'' or \nDemocrats the same way--once we decide, and there is a lot of \nagreement.\n\n  This whole diatribe started with praise from the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Idaho for their work on the Safe Drinking \nWater Act and I pause to note that the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Missouri said quite accurately that we have authorized more than \nwe will be able to appropriate for the infrastructure to keep our \ndrinking water safe; that a dominant reason we are not likely to have \nthe money for those kinds of investments is that we are seeing an \nincrease year after year after year of money going to mandated \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, 34 percent of the budget this year goes to \nappropriated accounts; 64 percent of the budget this year is mandatory \nprograms and interest; 36 percent is left over for appropriated \naccounts. At the end of this 10-year cycle we have lost another nine \npoints; another nine-point increase in mandatory and interest.\n  For all the rhetoric on both sides of the aisle about taxes, the one \nthing I say to taxpayers that has remained constant as a result of \ngeneral success in keeping the economy growing, keeping the environment \nsuch that investors create the jobs like I mentioned with Steve Jones \nand Jim Clark earlier with Netscape and so forth, the companies that \nare creating wealth and creating more economic activity, that growth \nhas enabled us even though we spend more money, the percent of the \nFederal budget of our economy has remained about 19 percent.\n  Unless somebody is proposing to increase that beyond 19 percent--that \nis your given--and what is happening is more and more money is going, a \nlarger and larger share of that 19 percent, is going for mandated \nprograms, leaving less for everything else.\n  I hope I persuade Republicans that there is an alternative course \nhere for us, to vote to do something that will revolutionize our \nfuture. And I hope to persuade Democrats, as well, who want to \ncollectively invest in education and so forth, that the only way we \nwill be able to do that is to get our arms around these mandated \nprograms in some more aggressive fashion than is even in the Republican \nbudget proposal.\n  I appreciate the very kind remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, and I hope that the kindness begets kindness. I hope we end \nup into the day voting in a bipartisan fashion for something that does \nrevolutionize our future, that does move us in a radically different \ndirection than the one we are heading right now because, folks, we are \nheading in a direction we do not want to go.\n  We will end up in the future saying, why did we not do that when it \nwas easy? It is easier today than next year. And it will be easier next \nyear than the year after. This is not one where time is on our side.\n  As tough as adjusting the CPI by a point looks, as tough as it might \nseem to phase in over a 15- or 20-year period adjustment in the \neligibility age from 65 to 70, as tough as those things look today, \nevery year you wait it gets tougher to do it. Every year you wait we \nwill have to impose changes that are more difficult for those Americans \nwho have planned on those programs being there for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, first of all I, too, want to commend the \nSenator from Nebraska. I am sure he will not get used to it, but, for \ntoday, I do. Because I think the work he and Senator Danforth and \nSenator Simpson and others have done regarding the Entitlement \nCommission is probably the single most important effort that has gone \non in this town for a long, long time. They probably feel like voices \ncrying in the wilderness right now. But it will not always be that way. \nIt is something that will grow. People pay more and more attention, \nbecause it is the fundamental truth and the most important truth that \nis in existence with regard to this entire effort.\n  I think the Senator from Washington, a few minutes ago, was \nabsolutely correct in terms of his assessment of the current situation. \nWe are talking about a short-term consideration and we are talking \nabout a long-term one. The current situation is we have struggled \nmightily this year, with great difficulty, and we have produced a \nbalanced budget. The President, while giving lip service to that \nproposition, is apparently going to do everything he can to avoid a \nbalanced budget because it means giving up power, it means giving up \nspending authority, it means giving up prestige with regard to certain \ninterest groups that elect people in this country.\n  But, hopefully, we will resolve those differences and we will wind up \nwith a balanced budget. I know we are committed to it. The Senator from \nWashington is committed to it. That is what we promised we would do. \nThat is what the American people said they wanted. We are going to take \nthem at their word. It is just that simple. We can negotiate around the \nedges, but, as far as a commitment to a balanced budget, a real \nbalanced budget, we are there.\n  The Senator from Nebraska makes a very fundamental point. In the \nmiddle of all this, it is very important that we keep in mind what we \nare doing now is just child's play with regard to the important issues \nfacing this country. He is absolutely right that we are doing the more \neasy part of it now and putting off the more difficult parts for later \non.\n  The thing that has been disturbing, I think, to many of us throughout \nthis entire debate who are somewhat new to this process and just having \ncome to the Senate is, as we take a broad view of it, it becomes so \ndifficult even to get \n\n[[Page S17855]]\nto the first step. We are just really nibbling around the edges. The \nGovernment is still going to be growing at a tremendous rate. All these \nprograms are going to be going at very substantial rates. Yet it is so \ndifficult.\n\n  We are going to have to do more next year, as the Senator from \nNebraska says. We are going to have to do more the year after that. We \nare going to have to behave and perform so well for so many years that, \nwhen you look at the current state of events, it is very depressing.\n  Frankly, that is one of the arguments I use for term limits. I am not \nat all sure we have what it takes as an institution to bite the bullet \nand do what we know has to be done, because we are bankrupting the next \ngeneration. These figures are not sustainable. The figures the \nEntitlement Commission has put out are not refuted. A handful of \nprograms are going to take our entire gross national product in about \n17 years in this country.\n  The question becomes, fundamentally, in a democracy can a democracy, \nonce people have discovered that they can pay money to themselves, can \nthey ever stop or can they ever restrain themselves or can they ever \nrestrain the rate at which they are paying themselves from their own \ntreasury?\n  Europe is going through the same kinds of problems that we are right \nnow, and we do not have an answer to that question yet. So, either by \ngetting people to come to this body and getting people in the White \nHouse with a different view, with a longer term view, or by having us \nhave a change of heart in this body--these are the only ways that we \ngoing to solve these longer term problems that are lying out there, \nthat are down the road.\n  I have always thought, and am more convinced every day, that in order \nto solve this problem, ultimately it is going to have to be both \nparties pulling in the same direction. It is going to have to be the \nWhite House and the Congress pulling in the same direction. As long as \nyou have somebody in the White House who is going to demagog and scare \nold people and take millions of dollars worth of television time \nmisrepresenting what the other side is trying to do, and as long as you \nhave people in both parties who are timid about facing up to these \nproblems that the Senator from Nebraska has been talking about and \nreally just want to push them over and make the real tough cuts and \nheavy lifting 7 years down the road when they may or may not even be \nhere, we are never going to get the job done.\n  I think it just points up, when we look down the road, the \nfundamental truths that the Entitlement Commission laid out before us, \nthe disastrous consequences of even moving along the road we are on if \nwe do not do even better. It sheds, really, I think, new light on what \nwe are doing here. If we cannot do this, if we cannot make these \nincremental adjustments now without really hurting anybody--when we are \ntalking about the difference of $4 a month in part B, the difference \nbetween what we are saying and what the President is saying--if we \ncannot get past that, if we cannot reduce the rate of spending by 3 or \n3.5 percent a year in these programs that are eating us alive, if we \ncannot do that now, we do not have any hope as a nation.\n  Again, hopefully, the President will see fit to look past next year's \nelection, on into the future and the kind of world our kids and \ngrandkids will be growing up in, and try to do what is necessary to \npreserve these programs we say we all want, and we will get together \nand we will have a balanced budget for ourselves and for the benefit of \nour kids and the future and strength of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17854-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17855-S17856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMALL FAMILY FARMS AND BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important \nissue for small family farms and businesses in my State of Michigan and \nacross our country.\n  Family businesses need estate tax relief. Federal estate or death \ntaxes kill family-owned businesses. These taxes impose an unbearable \nburden on our Nation's most productive citizens--family business \nentrepreneurs. The estate tax eliminates jobs and permanently damages \ncommunities that depend upon these businesses.\n  Family businesses have the opportunity to continue growing and \ncreating jobs for generations, instead of handing the business over to \nthe IRS.\n  Current estate tax rates range from 37 to 55 percent. Faced with the \ntremendous burden imposed by this tax upon their death, business owners \nin my home State of Michigan and across the United States, will react \nin several of the following ways:\n  First, the business owner will not expand the business because large \ncapital expenditures for long term growth make little sense when the \nfamily will soon be forced to sell or liquidate the business.\n  Second, the children will not participate in the business because the \nbusiness owner, knowing that taxes will prevent children from \ncontinuing operation of a family business, will often discourage their \nchildren from working in the business and encourage them to gain \nexperience elsewhere.\n  Third, the business owner will pay dearly in estate planning costs. \nEven if business owners have the foresight to plan early for their \ndeath, the expense of this planning, in insurance, legal and accounting \ncosts, can be enough to eliminate the business' small profit margin. \nThese extra insurance, legal, and accounting costs are especially \nburdensome because small businesses survive on cash flow, not profit.\n  Fourth, heirs may not be able to afford tax payments. Despite some \nplanning, heirs are often still faced with a significant tax burden. \nEven paid out over time, taxes may be too much of a burden to survive \nin an internationally competitive market. Plus, what bank is going to \nloan money to a business that the IRS holds a first lien against?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from today's Wall Street Journal, entitled ``Will Uncle Sam \nInherit the Family Business'' by David Pankonin. This describes the \nterrible effects of estate taxes on his fourth-generation family \nbusiness. Mr. Pankonin's story is typical of thousands of similar \nfamily businesses across the country.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 28, 1995]\n\n              Will Uncle Sam Inherit the Family Business?\n\n                          (By David Pankonin)\n\n       Cleaning out a box in the back office a few Sundays ago, I \n     came across the hand-written contract that passed the family \n     business from my great-grandfather to my grandfather. it was \n     dated Dec. 8, 1910. That was the day my grandfather became \n     proud owner of Pankonin's retail farm equipment company for \n     the princely sum of $518.09. Farther down in the same stack \n     of papers, I discovered a second document, a partnership \n     agreement between my grandfather and my father, dated 1946. \n     Times having gotten considerably more complicated by 1946, \n     the document ran to two pages. The value of Pankonin's had \n     risen to $8,912.66.\n       I plan to put those pieces of paper in a glass case out in \n     our showroom. When our customers come in to see next year's \n     new tractors and combines, they can see the little bit of the \n     history my family has put into the place.\n       Statistically, my company shouldn't have made it this far. \n     The survival rate for family firms for a first- to second-\n     generation transfer runs about 30%. For firms that stay in \n     the family from the second to third generation, that number \n     drops to 4%. For the fourth-generation transfer that put the \n     company in my hands, it's a fraction of 1%. At 16, my son \n     isn't spending every moment thinking about his chances of \n     running the family business, but as his father, I'd like to \n     know what I'm working toward. Will I be able to pass the \n     company inherited from my father along to my son--or in spite \n     of what my will might say--am I just working hard to pay an \n     heir called Uncle Sam?\n       My worry is a real one. According to a recent Gallup Poll, \n     one-third of all small-business owners will have to sell \n     outright or liquidate a part of their firm to pay estate \n     taxes. Of those who have to liquidate to pay the Internal \n     Revenue Service, half expect they'll have to eliminate 30 or \n     more jobs. Another 20% of those firms put the number of \n     employees they'll have to let go as high as 100 or more.\n       My father died when I was 23 years old, one quarter away \n     from completing my MBA at Northwestern. When I came home for \n     the funeral and decided to stay to run the business, my \n     mother became my banker, generously extending me 100% of my \n     financing. We made it work. Making it work the next time \n     won't be so easy. The reason is that for tax purposes. \n     Pankonin's and our dealership building is worth substantially \n     more than in those early years.\n       Today at my company we've got 16 employees. They're not \n     family, but they're the \n\n[[Page S17856]]\n     next closest thing. If, after I'm gone, my wife has to shut us down, \n     what will they do? Maybe it's not something you can measure \n     in dollars and cents, but they've got a stake in this \n     company, too.\n       At our store, we see plenty of people in the same \n     situation. Farming is a high-investment, low-margin business. \n     It's not uncommon to meet farmers who are paper \n     millionaires--asset rich, cash poor. That may be hard for the \n     rest of America to imagine; then again, maybe not. Think of \n     all the retirees who own homes on either coast, bought 30 \n     years ago for $30,000 but worth $350,000 today. I'll bet they \n     don't feel ``rich'' either--at least until they sell their \n     home and see that capital gains tax bill.\n       When my time comes, I'd like my son to be thinking about \n     whether it's right for him to run the family business, not \n     whether he's ready to saddle himself with a lien against the \n     paper value of the business to pay the inflated estate tax--\n     or whether he's calculated how many employees he'd have to \n     let go to clear the bill with the IRS.\n       The best solution would be to exempt the hundreds of \n     thousands of small family businesses across this country from \n     the estate tax altogether. Congress and the president could \n     haggle over how small is small, but the principle would be \n     carried into policy. If the political climate isn't right for \n     a complete exemption, then President Clinton ought to adopt \n     the proposals Congress has built into its budget plan: Raise \n     the federal tax exemption for family-owned business assets to \n     $1.5 million, institute a $750,000 personal exemption and cut \n     the tax rate for qualified small businesses in half for \n     assets between $1.5 and $5 million.\n       President Clinton calls the tax reforms Congress is backing \n     ``tax cuts for the rich,'' and says he's holding out for cuts \n     that help American families. Nice rhetoric. If he's serious, \n     he'll take a second look and support the tax reforms in \n     Congress' plan. If the small family businesses of America \n     don't get some relief, federal taxes may just be the death of \n     us yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17855-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A FURTHER STEP TOWARD LASTING PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday, British Prime Minister Major and \nIrish Prime Minister Bruton took a significant step toward breaking the \ndeadlock that had beset the Northern Ireland peace talks for the last \nseveral months. The two governments agreed to establish an \ninternational commission headed by former Senator George Mitchell which \nwill make recommendations regarding decommissioning and to work to hold \nall party talks by the end of February 1996. Their announcement, on the \neve of President Clinton's visit, revives the twin-track approach to \nachieving a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. This is good news \nindeed.\n  Both Prime Minister Major and Prime Minister Bruton deserve a great \ndeal of credit for moving the process along. The challenge now is to \nbring the various parties on board. All parties must recognize that it \nis in their interest to move forward. The situation in Northern Ireland \ntoday is completely different than it was just 16 months ago--prior to \nthe cease-fire. There are, for example, fewer British soldiers \noccupying the streets of Belfast; no longer do Protestant and Catholic \nmothers have to worry that their sons and daughters will be struck down \nby terrorist violence; and both communities in Northern Ireland are \nbeginning to focus their efforts on economic development rather than \ncontinued conflict.\n  I am certain that President Clinton will reinforce this message--that \nthe momentum needs to continue--during his visits to London, Belfast, \nDerry, and Dublin. The Clinton administration's unfailing support for \nthe peace process has been a significant factor in getting us to this \npoint. I am hopeful that his visit will contribute to the momentum.\n  Finally, from a personal standpoint, I am particularly pleased that \nGeorge Mitchell will head the international commission on the \ndecommissioning question. I have a great deal of regard and respect for \nSenator Mitchell, and believe that he will bring a great deal of wisdom \nand creativity to this position. I can think of no better person for \nthis important post.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17856-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17856-S17858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE IMPACT OF DESIGN ON COMMUNITY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise today to note the extraordinary \nimpact of design on community and product development. Many years ago I \nhelped establish an Institute of Research and Design in Rhode Island. \nBut to my regret, I was not able to get it properly launched. The \norganization was intended to help my State take advantage of the \nenormous economic benefits of new designs created by our citizens. \nDesign impacts our economy, environment, education and social sphere. \nIt is a strategic national resource with potential to improve the \nglobal competitiveness of U.S. products. Design is a tool to analyze \nproblems, develop critical thinking and communicate solutions. It \noffers numerous opportunities for creative partnerships with \ngovernment, manufacturing and technology industries, social and \ncommunity planners, scientists and educators. As the following speech \ndocuments, all of us make design decisions in nearly every life \nactivity.\n  Because of the presence of the internationally-acclaimed Rhode Island \nSchool of Design [RISD], Rhode Island attracts a large number of people \nto the State to discuss design issues. Last March, RISD hosted a \nNational Design Conference, sponsored by the National Endowment for the \nArts, that explored the main challenges for design in the coming \ncentury and ways in which design strategy can be better employed to \nincrease American economic competitiveness. In mid-November, the \nNational Assembly of State Arts Agencies held its annual meeting in \nProvidence where the professional and volunteer leadership of the \nNation's State and jurisdictional arts agencies discussed the \nchallenges of leadership in the changing environment of public support \nfor the arts. NASAA devoted the better part of a day to discussions of \ndesign programming, and featured Roger Mandle, president of the Rhode \nIsland School of Design since 1993, as a keynote speaker.\n  An art historian, educator and current member of the National Council \non the Arts who served as deputy director at the National Gallery of \nArt for 5 years following 11 years as director of the Toledo Museum of \nArt, President Mandle possesses a comprehensive perspective of the \nsocietal importance of arts and design. Rhode Island and the Nation as \na whole have benefitted enormously from his work. Mr. President, I \nwould ask unanimous consent that this important address delivered by \nRoger Mandle be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Designing To Meet the Needs of the Future\n\n                           (By Roger Mandle)\n\n       Thank you for being here today. It is more important than \n     ever that we come together through gatherings such as this to \n     plan the future of design in America, to in fact design the \n     progress of our culture and our society. I am convinced that \n     issues of design hold the key to the future, which isn't \n     surprising, perhaps, considering my current role.\n       What I am going to talk about today is the importance of \n     design in terms of community development and economic impact, \n     and the potential of design for meeting the needs of the \n     future. By ``design,'' I am referring here to both the noun \n     and the verb. When I refer to the noun--the art of design and \n     the discipline of design--I am thinking of good design, \n     design that is appropriate, well thought-out and \n     aesthetically pleasing. When we think of the verb ``design,'' \n     we think of the creative process, the act of conception and \n     invention. Today, I want to talk about how both aspects of \n     design--the practice and its outcome--play a pivotal role in \n     the world in which we live.\n       Practically everything we do in life--as individuals and as \n     communities--involves a design decision. Whether consciously \n     or not, we solve problems and make choices by following the \n     design process, using creativity, experimentation, intuition \n     and thought to come up with the ideal solution to the \n     challenges we're confronted with on a daily basis.\n       As individuals we design everything from our careers to our \n     homes, our dream vacations, even our own look. The process \n     involves: examining the circumstances, defining the problem, \n     considering the resources, trying certain arrangements, \n     establishing probabilities and testing outcomes. In many \n     ways, it is similar to the process a research scientist \n     follows in testing a theory.\n       In making these day-to-day design decisions, however, we \n     don't just want our homes or clothes to look good, we also \n     need them to be comfortable and functional. Good design is \n     the effective use of available resources in patterns, \n     combinations and arrangements that provide pleasing solutions \n     to needs. Good design makes the things you use everyday work \n     better for you. It also makes good business sense, because \n     products that are well-designed sell better.\n       To most of us in this room it's clear that art and design \n     are essential to the health of \n\n[[Page S17857]]\n     our communities not only from aesthetic, philosophical, psychological \n     and emotional vantage points, but due to sheer economics. As \n     communities, corporations and countries have become ever more \n     multinational in scope, they have come to recognize that to \n     remain competitive in the world marketplace, they must rely \n     on strong design.\n       Here at RISD we've noticed in the past five years that \n     increasingly more business leaders and heads of state and \n     local governments are awakening to the fact that design \n     matters, that it, in fact, is among the most important \n     components of community and product development.\n       On a national level, the importance of innovation in design \n     is now recognized through the annual Presidential Design \n     Awards. It is also recognized through such critical \n     conferences as this and the one the NEA is planning for this \n     winter, with RISD as a major sponsor and organizer.\n       Internationally, there are lessons to be learned from \n     countries such as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and \n     Switzerland--to name but a few--where good design is a way of \n     life. I recently returned from a trip to Korea, where art and \n     design have long been valued not only for contributing to \n     culture but for strengthening the economy as well.\n       At RISD and the country's other leading art and design \n     colleges, the correlation between good design and a strong \n     economy is underscored through a wide range of industry- and \n     community-related projects. U.S. News & World Report's annual \n     guide to the best colleges in the country, which was released \n     earlier this fall, points out that contrary to popular \n     perception, an education in the arts and design to no longer \n     destined to lead to a life as a starving artist precisely \n     because of this correlation. ``Reality and art education may \n     sound like contradictory notions,'' the article suggests, \n     ``but they are quietly merging at the nation's leading \n     colleges of art and design.'' (I am happy to add that in this \n     same issue of U.S. News & World Report RISD was evaluated as \n     the top visual arts college in the country.)\n       Projects that connect students with the real world and have \n     a tangible economic impact not only provide them with \n     practical skills for future employment, but serve industry by \n     providing research and development services at a minimal \n     cost. Corporations currently working with art and design \n     colleges throughout the country have tapped into the creative \n     energy and talent on these campuses to research and develop a \n     wide range of products.\n       In addition, municipalities turn to institutions such as \n     RISD for a range of design services, including help in \n     planning basic infrastructure needs. For instance, RISD runs \n     a Road and Land Institute that brings engineers, landscape \n     architects, city planners and others together to discuss the \n     aesthetic as well as practical needs of new and expanding \n     roads.\n       Art and design schools also offer the commercial sector \n     access to creative think tanks where students and faculty can \n     actually develop such innovations as the ideal ``Universal \n     Kitchen'' for the 21st century, an example of a current \n     collaboration between RISD and Frigidaire. RISD students have \n     been working with MBA candidates from Harvard and MIT to \n     design, develop and market innovative products of the future, \n     many of which have formed the seeds of successful new \n     businesses.\n       While RISD has been collaborating with Nissan, the Art \n     Center College of Design in California is renowned as a \n     training ground for the world's leading auto designers and in \n     return, enjoys support from General Motors and other industry \n     leaders. By the same token, nearly every animated film since \n     the 1980s has been produced by alumni of California Institute \n     of the Arts, founded in the '60s by Walt Disney and his \n     brother Roy. Thanks to industry support for CalArts, the \n     college has in essence returned the investment by educating \n     the creative talents behind every recent Disney blockbuster, \n     from The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, to The Lion King and \n     Pocahontas.\n       Art and design colleges also offer ideal settings for \n     partnerships with the business world such as one RISD is \n     undertaking with a local business school, Bryant College. \n     Together, we are creating a Center for Design and Business as \n     a joint venture with regional companies. The Center will \n     offer a wide range of educational programs and services to \n     help artists and designers develop competitive business \n     skills. It will also promote design excellence in all areas \n     of business and foster innovative product development. \n     Through the Center, we will help local companies to translate \n     ideas, technologies and resources into viable commercial \n     products and will also stimulate the region's economy and \n     create new jobs.\n       All of these examples emphasize the importance of design \n     education to the future of our economy and the well-being of \n     our communities. Unless we offer design students a solid \n     foundation in the economic, political, social and historic \n     forces that shape our society, however, they have little \n     understanding of the contexts in which they're expected to \n     find innovative solutions. Before we can acknowledge them \n     as some of society's best thinkers--the people we turn to \n     for answers and breakthroughs--designers need to be \n     educated to be socially responsible citizens of the world \n     who are equipped to grapple with and solve problems of our \n     own making.\n       We have been polluting the world with noxious fumes, \n     poisonous words and violent acts for too long. Technology may \n     bring us closer to these problems, promising to help us \n     figure out solutions to them, yet it creates a more \n     complicated network of issues to confront than before. The \n     principles of good design can offer us a way out of this maze \n     of self-destruction. But how?\n       Recently, entrepreneur and visionary Paul Hawken spoke to \n     the RISD community about the importance of design to the \n     future of our economy and the environment. Hawken's message, \n     which some of you may be familiar with through his books The \n     Ecology of Commerce, Growing a Business and The Next Economy, \n     is essentially this:\n       ``If every company on the planet were to adopt the best \n     environmental practices of the `leading' companies--say, the \n     Body Shop, Patagonia, or 3M--the world would still be moving \n     toward sure degradation and collapse. So if a tiny fraction \n     of the world's most intelligent managers cannot model a \n     sustainable world, then environmentalism, as currently \n     practiced by business today, laudable as it may be, is only a \n     part of an overall solution. Rather than a management \n     problem, we have a design problem, a flaw that runs through \n     all business.''\n       Hawken goes on to point out that: ``Just as every act in an \n     industrial society leads to environmental degradation, \n     regardless of intention, we must design a system where the \n     opposite is true, where doing good is like falling off a log, \n     where the natural, everyday acts of work and life accumulate \n     into a better world as a matter of course, not a matter of \n     conscious altruism.''\n       As a society, it's essential that we rectify this most \n     fundamental of all design problems if we're to ensure our \n     existence into the next century and beyond. Together, we need \n     to use our heads--our collective creativity--to puzzle our \n     way out of societal dilemmas and to design a sustainable \n     future. Hawken proposes redesigning the manufacturing process \n     along with the product so that the durability and \n     recyclability of the end product and its by-products are \n     accounted for at the beginning of the process. Here, more \n     than ever, design matters.\n       By definition the arts and design are problem-solving \n     pursuits capable of proposing answers to some of our most \n     gnawing human dilemmas. In our communities, issues of design \n     aid in rethinking public housing, strip malls and the layout \n     of neighborhoods, and in creating optimal functionality in \n     our classrooms, hospitals, libraries and parks. In education, \n     the arts help build understanding across disciplines, create \n     passion for learning, heighten the sensibilities of students, \n     and give them tangible evidence of their progress.\n       Design, which by its nature requires exploration and \n     experimentation, helps foster an open mind. It also fosters a \n     mode of thinking that sounds very simple but eludes many of \n     us: it enables people to think visually--to think \n     creatively--and solve problems with speed and clarity.\n       At colleges of art and design around the world, we teach \n     our students to see things others don't, enabling them to \n     find solutions, alternatives and opportunities other people \n     might overlook. If a manufacturer turns to RISD, for \n     instance--as they frequently do--and asks for help in \n     designing a better toaster, we might in fact design an \n     economical, ecologically sound toaster that looks better than \n     any you've ever seen. But we're also just as likely to \n     interpret the request as an invitation to come up with a \n     better way to make toast instead.\n       Young artists and designers use their unique ability to see \n     and to think creatively to launch an astounding array of new \n     businesses, capitalizing on their rigorous but flexible \n     education to pursue careers that are deeply satisfying. As a \n     result, you'll find graduates of these schools doing \n     everything from creating magnificent public sculpture and \n     making feature films, to designing software, weaving fabric \n     from recycled plastic and inventing better bicycles.\n       People educated at art and design schools teach some of the \n     most innovative classes in our nation's public schools, art \n     direct some of the catchiest commercials on television, and \n     produce some of the most popular music in the country. Not \n     surprisingly, perhaps, the education tends to be flexible \n     enough to allow others to go on to become successful doctors, \n     lawyers, politicians, and nationally acclaimed restaurateurs.\n       ``So what?'' you may ask. Well, all of this activity--the \n     result of artistic energy and talent--demonstrates that \n     design is, in fact, integral to our lives, that design \n     matters.\n       Paul Hawken urges us to find new ways to design business so \n     that we effectively use natural resources in a sustaining, \n     non-destructive manner. Stephen Sterling has shown us that \n     our values relating to the use of our natural resources are \n     based on the Western linear view of history and causation, \n     which amplifies the idea of limitless maximization. Bigger \n     must be better, regardless of whether it requires the use of \n     more and more resources, further degrading our environment. \n     Our approach to production has been literal; it now must be \n     poetic. We must find solutions that are metaphors from \n     continuity and for survival, that enable us to treat life as \n     a cycle--as a spiral in which growth is controlled by \n     intelligent use and replacement of resources. Here again, \n     innovative design is the answer.\n       As we all recognize, the social and cultural problems \n     facing America's cities and towns today are significant. At a \n     time when our society promises so much material wealth, few \n     are able to benefit from it; the great irony in this land of \n     plenty is that so little is available to those who need it \n     most. Now that \n\n[[Page S17858]]\n     Congress is proposing to eat away at the limited programs we do have, \n     what will we design to replace them?\n       In a world so rich in resources, logic dictates that the \n     most basic life sustaining options should be available to \n     those who so desperately need them. In this context, of what \n     value are design and the arts?\n       Maslow's hierarchy of needs places the arts and education \n     at the top of the ladder, with food, shelter, and the more \n     ``basic'' necessities at the bottom. But as a society we are \n     just now beginning to recognize that the effective delivery \n     of reasonable services and products to those with few means \n     can be achieved through good design.\n       Right now a small team of RISD students, faculty and alumni \n     are working to develop portable, low-cost housing for the \n     world's refugee population in conjunction with the UN High \n     Commission for Refugees and the Red Cross.\n       RISD is also working with Habitat for Humanity to develop \n     new designs for affordable housing, and designers in a number \n     of our urban centers are creating low-cost shelters for the \n     homeless. In addition, we are looking to designers to work \n     with engineers in developing electric cars and other more \n     energy-efficient forms of personal and mass transportation to \n     replace outmoded gas guzzlers of the past.\n       In order to enable artists and designers to lead in their \n     chosen fields, those of us charged with guiding the country's \n     art and design institutions need to work with schools to \n     recreate curricula, reallocate resources, and expand \n     experiences for students that teach appreciation and respect \n     for human creativity and invention as well for limited \n     resources.\n       The future into which these students will be launched is \n     already at hand in many respects. We know that it will be \n     technology-driven for communications, visualization, and \n     information. We know that resources will be ever more scarce, \n     and the options for using them constrained by the long-term \n     effects of manufacture. We know that our nation, indeed the \n     world, is filled with the tensions of boundaries that are \n     ever more sharply dividing people by color, language, \n     religion, and region. We know that the need to create \n     educated, creative, and tolerant citizens is even more \n     important than at any other time in history--and that our \n     nation's willingness to invest now in the education of \n     these citizens of the future is still in question.\n       Why? Because art and design, by their very nature, \n     represent change. They may help us adapt to change, to \n     express that change and create chances for it, but to many \n     people this is more threatening than comforting.\n       ``The artist and society have a tentative relationship,'' \n     says Jane Alexander, chairwoman of the National Endowment for \n     the Arts. ``The artist is often the sentinel on the \n     precipice, heralding change as it peaks over the horizon. \n     Artists challenge, ask difficult questions, and rattle our \n     cages. They can make our skin itch, or souls bristle, and \n     touch us to the heart's deep core.''\n       What this conference aims to do and we need to do as a \n     nation is to recognize the values and thought-systems \n     inherent in design-related fields. We need to help our \n     neighbors understand the vital importance of the arts and \n     design in creating strategies to rebuild and enhance our \n     communities.\n       When former Apple CEO John Sculley spoke at RISD's \n     Commencement last June, he challenged our graduates to be \n     either a mirror of society and reflect what's going on, \n     giving their interpretation or perspective, or to be a lens \n     that shows what can happen, what the possibilities are.\n       Throughout history, of course, artists and designers have \n     held a mirror up to society, producing work that chronicles \n     where we are or suggests where we might go. Rosanne Somerson, \n     head of RISD's new Furniture Design Department, reminded me \n     of the other day that furniture, like clothing, speaks \n     volumes about a society at any given point in history. When \n     else but during the Sixties, for instance, would we have \n     invented the bean bag chair and mini skirts? Next fall, to \n     illustrate the symbiosis between design and society, RISD's \n     Museum will host the first of a two-part exhibition on Dress, \n     Art & Society, curated by Lorraine Howes, head of our Apparel \n     Design Department.\n       Design and the manufacture of products not only captures \n     the pulse-beat of society at any given time, but sends \n     important signals about what we value. Urban planning also \n     affects our lives, creating social strategies out of our \n     living spaces.\n       Who had ever even heard of workstations a mere 10 years ago \n     or considered the concept of phone books, encyclopedias or \n     the entire collection of our National Gallery on CD? More \n     importantly, how would any of these innovations have been \n     developed without the critical input of designers?\n       What we are witnessing in the latter years of this century \n     is the pivotal turning point when technology is being handed \n     by the engineers who created it to us to use. It's artists \n     and designers, however, who will help us make the most of it. \n     Designers are creating the visual language of software, \n     influencing not only what we see on screen, but how we \n     explore and process information. Here again, as Sculley \n     points out, it is not the technology that is important, it is \n     the consequences of the technology--how artists, designers \n     and others make use of it.\n       One hundred and eighteen years ago RISD was founded by \n     women with foresight and commitment to the improvement of \n     society. These 19th-century visionaries realized that the \n     arts and design are an essential ingredient in the vitality \n     of a community, of an economy and of a nation.\n       And they weren't alone. An intelligent appreciation of art \n     and design has always been part of the American democratic \n     promise. Our Founding Fathers recognized this and upheld it.\n       ``I must study politics and war,'' John Adams wrote to his \n     wife Abigail, ``that my sons may have liberty to study \n     mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study . . . \n     navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their \n     children a right to study painting, poetry, music, and \n     architecture.''\n       At times it is difficult to fathom that as a nation we seem \n     to have strayed so far from the underlying sentiments that \n     made this country strong. When our government spends less \n     that 5/100ths of one percent of the national budget on all \n     forms of cultural subsidies, how can Speaker Gingrich \n     continue the pretense that the proposed elimination of \n     federal funding for the arts has anything to do with the \n     national deficit?\n       The politicians of the day somehow ignore the fact that art \n     and design are serious business and that without a minimum \n     federal investment as an incentive there will be a far \n     smaller return. You have all heard the figures--that for \n     every dollar of federal support, the NEA and NEH help \n     leverage $16 in private funding. Yet our Speaker of the House \n     still fails to acknowledge that the not-for-profit arts--\n     organizations such as the ones many of you in this room work \n     with and support--employ 1.3 million people, generate $37 \n     billion a year in economic activity and most importantly for \n     those concerned with the bottom line, return $3.4 billion a \n     year to the federal treasury through taxes. This return is 20 \n     times the dwindling budget of the NEA.\n       During its 30-year history, the overwhelming majority of \n     NEA grants have supported projects that include such laudable \n     design innovations as architect Bill Warner's plan for the \n     Providence river front. If you haven't already had an \n     opportunity, while you're here you should take a walk along \n     the completed portion at the foot of the hill, just south of \n     the train station. It was thanks to a small NEA grant that \n     Warner originally proposed a major waterfront revitalization \n     project in the city that is having enormous repercussions for \n     business, industry and the state's economy. For Rhode Island, \n     the vision of this one designer has definitely made a \n     difference.\n       ``Great artists and designers have always been \n     discriminating people,'' says painter Alfred DeCredico, a \n     RISD graduate and one of our associate professors of \n     Foundation Studies. ``The life work of great artists and \n     designers constitutes a commitment to humanity and to what \n     they believe is true. What is often perceived as arrogance \n     and an insistence on control is in reality an adherence to an \n     ethical stance,'' DeCredico goes on to point out.\n       This ethical stance can help illuminate and define the \n     progress artists, designers, art educators and advocates make \n     as a creative community. In a wider sense, the arts and \n     design also help shape or mirror the values of society. In my \n     view, artists and designers are central to each level of \n     human existence, from the basic provision of food and \n     shelter, to the sustenance of community, manufacturing and \n     governance.\n       In conclusion, I want to reiterate that in this age of \n     high-speed information and economic uncertainty, the need to \n     recognize the value of good design has taken on great \n     urgency. Either by plan or default, we are designing how we \n     wish to be remembered as a society.\n       To maximize the potential impact of good design on solving \n     the challenges facing our communities, designers need to be \n     adequately educated, properly nurtured and competitively \n     compensated. In short, they need to be recognized as \n     invaluable contributors to the future health and well-being \n     of society. Once that happens, the possibilities will be \n     staggering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17856-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17858-S17859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHINA'S ARREST OF DISSIDENT WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last week, while the world's attention was \nfocused on new hopes for peace in Bosnia, the Chinese Government \nformally arrested and charged its most famous dissident with sedition. \nWei Jingsheng, who has been imprisoned without charge for the last 20 \nmonths, is known as the father of China's still-fragile democracy \nmovement. Wei's formal arrest signals a renewed hardline approach on \nthe part of the Chinese leadership to internal criticism of the \nGovernment.\n  The timing of Wei's arrest is telling. It comes alongside China's \npush for entry into the World Trade Organization as a developing \neconomy. The United States, joined by the European Union, Japan, and \nCanada, insists that China has a strong exporting economy that can meet \nthe open-trade standards demanded of other member economies. China \ncontinues to reject this standard and argues that it is being excluded \nfrom the organization and isolated by the United States and the West.\n  I strongly believe that we need to engage China and my reading of \ncurrent \n\n[[Page S17859]]\nUnited States policy is that we are doing so. The United States has no \ncontainment policy and we are not isolating China in any way. But if \nChina wants the benefits of being an active member of the international \ncommunity, it must accept the standards and play by the rules of that \ncommunity. On human rights or on trade, China cannot expect to \nflagrantly violate international norms with impunity. United States \ncriticism is not an attempt to isolate China, but the opposite; China's \nwillingness to abide by international standards will make its \nacceptance into the international community all the easier.\n  On trade, I commend the administration for continuing to insist that \nChina meet the standards which are commensurate with its economic \nstatus. On human rights, I urge the administration to lead the West by \nworking for a resolution censuring China's human rights abuses at the \nnext annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. \nThere has been growing world support for such a resolution in recent \nyears as China's treatment of its own citizens and of Tibetans \ncontinues to fall far short of the criterion of the international \ncommunity. Now is not the time to reduce our efforts to pass this \nresolution; Wei Jingsheng's arrest shows the necessity for continued \ninternational focus on China's behavior.\n  China has urged the United States to overlook its human rights abuses \nand forgo working for a U.N. resolution, just as it has urged the \nUnited States to ignore its growing economy and allow its entry into \nthe World Trade Organization using lower standards. In both cases, the \nU.S. response must be the same. If China wants to be respected as an \nimportant international actor, it must meet the expected behavior of \none. If it wants the United States to stop criticizing its human rights \npractices, it must stop giving us reason to do so. Releasing Wei \nJingsheng and other political prisoners would be an important first \nstep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17858-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER USE IN VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spent a great deal of my time in the \nU.S. Senate working on telecommunications issues, and studying how \nchanging technology is having an impact on our Nation. In particular, I \nhave been interested and concerned about the effect of the so-called \ninformation superhighway on rural States like Vermont.\n  With this in mind, I asked a young student at Champlain Valley Union \nHigh School to take a broad survey on computer use in his high school. \nWhat I will include in the Record is the report that this student, \nSteve Waltien, sent to me recently.\n  I find his results fascinating and encouraging. You will see the vast \nmajority of high school freshmen and seniors are familiar with \ncomputers, and use computers whether in school, at home, or both. Now, \nI realize that Champlain Valley Union High School is not necessarily \nindicative of the rest of Vermont or the Nation. It is no doubt on the \ncutting edge of new technologies, and is led by one of the finest \nprincipals in the country, Val Gardner.\n  But Mr. President, this study shows just how dramatically our lives \nare changing; in particular, it shows how dramatically our children's \nlives are changing. The decisions we make on issues affecting access to \ntelecommunications issues will have a direct impact on our children, \nespecially in rural areas like Vermont.\n  I am grateful to Steve Waltien for his well-written and thorough \nstudy. He and I have e-mailed each other on this subject, and am \ndelighted to share his work with my fellow Senators.\n  I ask that a study on high school computer use be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The study follows:\n\n                          Computer Use Survey\n\n(By Stevenson H.

As of now, there is little \n     government regulation of the ``menu'' available on the \n     Internet. This presents an interesting issue for our law-\n     makers: is use of these systems of great enough significance \n     for the government to take some kind of role in their \n     existence? The environment of a high school seemed to be of \n     interest because of the growing technology being offered \n     there. It was decided at an early point that it would be \n     extremely difficult to survey the entire school, and \n     therefore might be more beneficial and reliable to survey \n     only the Freshmen and Senior classes to see computer use at \n     both ends of the age spectrum at Champlain Valley Union High \n     School. The intent was that the survey would provide Senator \n     Patrick Leahy with some statistics about rural high school \n     use of computers and the Internet. These results could be \n     used to indicate the extent students in a rural school use \n     computers regularly and how they use them. The survey was \n     conducted between September and November of 1995.\n\n\n                               The School\n\n       Champlain Valley Union High School is located in Hinesburg, \n     Vt. and is the public high school for the towns of Hinesburg, \n     Charlotte, Shelburne, and Williston. The school is comprised \n     of over 950 students. The communities that make up the school \n     are mostly middle class. The school prides itself on having \n     extremely high standards of technology. There are \n     approximately 250 computers at CVU, the majority of which are \n     Apple Macintoshes. The school has a computer lab which is \n     open to all students during their free time. It is comprised \n     of both IBM and Macintoshes. The Physics program has \n     approximately 20 Power Macintoshes that make up the Physics \n     lab. The school also has a foreign language lab and a \n     business lab, with roughly 30 units each. The majority of \n     computers in the lab are connected to the school's 128-kbps \n     Internet connection. Students have access to most of what is \n     available on the net, including the World Wide Web and other \n     popular net services.\n\n\n                         Results of the Survey\n\n       The survey was distributed to the Freshmen through the \n     Freshmen core program at CVU and there was an almost \n     immediate result with 96% of the Freshmen responding. The \n     seniors were harder to reach in that there is no single class \n     which all seniors take. The surveys were distributed through \n     the advisory program in which all students participate. Due \n     to the difficulty of student and faculty schedules however, \n     there was only a 70% response to the senior surveys. Although \n     this number may be low, the data is statistically valid due \n     to the similarities in answers for all seniors and the fact \n     that those who responded do not leave out any particular \n     group or type of student. The advisories that responded show \n     a random group of students, therefore it is a good sampling \n     of the class as a whole. Two hundred and seventeen Freshmen \n     and one hundred-forty Seniors responded. The results are as \n     follows:\n\n     Percent of those surveyed owning a home computer:\n       Freshmen--90%; Seniors--91%\n\n     Percent of those owning a home computer that use it:\n       Freshmen--97%; Seniors--98.5%\n\n     Percent of those owning a home computer with family members \n     who use it:\n       Freshmen--86.5%; Seniors--96%\n\n     Amount of computer use per week by percentage (home computer \n     owners):\n       Less than 1 hr.--Freshmen: 6%; Seniors: 5%\n       1-3 hrs--Freshmen: 20%; Seniors: 16%\n       4-6 hrs--Freshmen: 74%; Seniors: 79%\n\n     Primary uses of home computer:\n       Word Processing/Homework--Freshmen: 95%; Seniors: 97%\n       Internet/E-mail--Freshmen: 20%; Seniors: 20%\n       World Wide Web--Freshmen: 11%; Seniors: 9%\n       Games--Freshmen: 39%; Seniors: 30%\n\n     Percent of students who use school computers:\n       Freshmen--68%; Seniors--93%\n\n     Primary uses of the school computer:\n       Word Processing/Homework--Freshmen: 80%; Seniors: 82%\n       Internet/E-mail--Freshmen: 34%; Seniors: 70%\n       World Wide Web--Freshmen: 20%; Seniors: 27%\n       Games--Freshmen: 4%; Seniors: 6%\n\n     Degree of influence school computer usage has had on overall \n     computer use:\n       High--Freshmen: 24%; Seniors: 47%\n       Moderate--Freshmen: 41%; Seniors: 40%\n       Little or none--Freshmen: 35%; Seniors: 13%\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       It is shown that usage of school computers is much higher \n     for seniors even though home computer ownership is almost \n     equal. According to the results, 25% more seniors use school \n     computers than freshmen. The majority of seniors say that \n     access to computers in the school has greatly influenced \n     their overall computer usage. It would appear that computer \n     education earlier in a student's career enhances additional \n     use. The key seems to lie not in computer ownership, but \n     rather with computer knowledge. The earlier students become \n     fully computer literate, the earlier they utilize the tools \n     they possess more effectively. There are possible reasons to \n     account for the large discrepancy in the percentage of \n     freshmen and seniors using computers in school. The freshmen \n     have not been exposed to the computers as long, and the \n     courses they take are not as challenging to require as much \n     computer usage. Yet it is clear that seniors use computers \n     for more \n\n[[Page S17860]]\n     than just class work, therefore their exposure must have left an over-\n     all positive impression.\n       It is interesting that E-mail and Internet usage basically \n     doubles for freshmen and triples for seniors when they are in \n     school as opposed to at home. This can probably be explained \n     by the fact that they may not have access to the Internet at \n     home, or even if they do, they do not have the sophistication \n     of technology available at the school. This does tell us that \n     if these systems are available at schools, people will use \n     it.\n       A fascinating statistic is that family computer use rises \n     almost ten points between freshmen and senior years. This \n     tells us that the computer education young people are getting \n     in school may be influencing their families to try out \n     computers with their children. According to the survey, about \n     90% of homes within this population own a personal computer. \n     This can be compared with a national estimation of only 35%. \n     This can be partially accounted for by the higher than \n     average income in this area, but one has to wonder if the \n     influence of computers in schools encourages people to go out \n     and buy a home computer, and, further to avail themselves of \n     high technology enhancements such as Internet access and on-\n     line services.\n\n\n                        CVU COMPUTER USE SURVEY\n\n       Participants: This is a survey that will be used to assist \n     the United States Senate through the offices of Senator \n     Patrick Leahy as they endeavor to craft legislation that will \n     enhance computer access and resources to students throughout \n     the country.

Mr. President, I have had delivered to each Senator a copy \nof the transcript of the Judiciary Committee's November 17 hearing on \nH.R. 1833, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, together with inserts \nand written submissions. Since the distribution of these materials, I \nhave received answers to written questions from another one of the \nwitnesses who testified at the hearing. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from Dr. Norig Ellison to me be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  American Society\n\n\n                                         of Anesthesiologists,\n\n                                                November 22, 1995.\n     Re  H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for inviting my participation \n     in your Committee's hearing on H.R. 1833.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to reply to the written \n     questions of Senator Leahy. The only one of the six questions \n     which falls within my area of expertise is number four:\n       4. Do analgesics and anesthetics given to a pregnant woman \n     undergoing an abortion provide any pain relief to the fetus, \n     even if the medication stops short of killing a fetus?\n       Drugs normally cross the placenta from mother to fetus \n     according to a concentration gradient. The effect on the \n     fetus of drugs administered to the mother will depend on (a) \n     fetal condition, (b) the route of administration, and (c) the \n     timing.\n       a. Fetal acidosis will facilitate transport of local \n     anesthesia such as lidocaine, which is a weak base, into the \n     fetus.\n       b. Drugs administered intramuscularly achieve peak \n     concentrations lower than intravenous administration, with \n     the resultant decrease in placenta transport of the former.\n       c. Drug administration intramuscularly will have no effect \n     on infants born within one hour after administration; in \n     contrast, birth 2-3 hours after intramuscular administration \n     may result in depressed infants. Conversely, intravenous \n     administration of drugs will have maximum depressed effect in \n     babies born \\1/2\\-1 hour after the administration.\n       d. Very little is known about fetal response and \n     consciousness to pain prior to 24-25 weeks gestation. It is \n     clear that a pregnant woman can receive an effective \n     anesthetic for cesarean section, and the fetus when delivered \n     within the next half hour will be exquisitely sensitive to \n     pain stimulus and will respond by crying and avoiding the \n     stimulus more than 95% of the time.\n       In direct answer to question number four, drugs \n     administered to the mother, either local anesthesia \n     administered in the paracervical area or sedatives/analgesics \n     administered intramuscularly or intravenously, will provide \n     not-to-little analgesia to the fetus.\n       In closing, I reiterate that the pregnant woman in need of \n     urgent, even life-saving surgery, need not defer same due to \n     misinformation regarding the effect of anesthetics on the \n     fetus.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Norig Ellison, M.D.,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17860-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, earlier this month, the whole world \nstopped to pay respects to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a \nsoldiers, a statesman, and a visionary committed to security and peace \nfor the people of Israel and of the entire Middle East.\n  Yitzhak Rabin dedicated his life to the survival of the State of \nIsrael and to the crusade for peace, a crusade that ultimately took his \nlife. His death is not only a loss for his family, the people of Israel \nand Jews across the world, but also to all those dedicated to the \nsearch for a true and lasting peace between Israel and its Arab \nneighbors.\n  As a military leader, a diplomat, and a Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin \nwas at the center of major events through his nation's five decade \nhistory. It was, after all, General Rabin who led Israel's armed forces \nto victory during the 1967 Six Day War. And it was Prime Minister Rabin \nwho, 23 years later, on September 13, 1993, signed an historic accord \nthat put Israel on a glidepath toward peaceful and normal relations \nwith the Palestinian people.\n  During his professional life, Yitzhak Rabin did much to strengthen \nthe relationship between the United States and Israel. As Ambassador to \nthe United States, Mr. Rabin repeatedly communicated and demonstrated \nto officials of the United States Government Israel's unyielding \ncommitment to United States interests in the Middle East and around the \nworld. And in every other post in which he served--Army Chief of Staff, \nDefense Minister, and Prime Minister--Yitzhak Rabin always earned the \nrespect, admiration, and friendship of American leaders from both \nparties.\n  While I did not know Yitzhak Rabin personally, I had the honor of \njoining him at the White House some weeks ago for the signing of the \nOslo II Agreement, one of the many historic developments of which Mr. \nRabin was an architect. I remember at that ceremony thinking about how \nmuch progress had been made in the Middle East over the past several \nyears. I was impressed by the extent to which this fragile peace \nprocess had been kept on track despite \n\n[[Page S17861]]\nwhat seemed at times to be insurmountable hurdles. Yitzhak Rabin was \ncritical to keeping the delicate process moving forward. This, however, \nwas not his only accomplishment since he began his second term as Prime \nMinister in 1993. Prime Minister Rabin orchestrated the Israel-Jordan \nPeace Treaty, the normalization of relations between Israel and \nTunisia, Israel and Morocco, and the acceptance of Israel by many \nothers in the Arab world and around the globe.\n  Mr. President, on November 6, I joined some 4,500 members of \nDetroit's distinguished Jewish Community to pay tribute to Yitzhak \nRabin at a memorial ceremony organized in my State by the Detroit \nJewish community Council and the Detroit Jewish Federation. It was an \nincredibly moving experience for me and my wife Jane. We listened to \nJewish leaders from Detroit talk about their memories of the slain \nIsraeli leader and all he had meant to the Jewish people. I especially \nwas struck by the message of the last individual who spoke that \nevening, Rabbi Steven Wiel. During his remarks, Rabbi Wiel posed the \nfollowing question: ``Do we not love what we love more than we hate \nwhat we hate? Do we not love the chance for peace, do we not love the \nstate of Israel, do we not love our Jewish brethren, do we not love \nhuman life more than we may hate decisions made by political leaders \nwith whom we may disagree?''\n  Mr. President, the hatred that Rabbi Wiel spoke of may have been \nacted upon by Yigal Amir in Tel Aviv on November 4, but it exists in \nvarious forms throughout the Middle East and in too many other places \nin the world. This hatred can be found in individuals of all faiths and \nof all nationalities. And if we truly are committed to a lasting peace \nin the Middle East, we not only must help Israel overcome its most \nrecent tragedy, but we must also unite leaders from the entire region \nagainst the hatred of those who have tried and will continue to try to \nderail this peace process through heinous and murderous crimes. In this \nvein, I have already pledged my strong support for Mr. Rabin's \nsuccessor, Shimon Peres, and I commend Israel's leaders from across the \npolitical spectrum for seeking to unify the Israeli people during this \ntragic time. It is absolutely essential that the United States stand \nbehind Prime Minister Peres and the citizens of Israel as they work to \novercome this crisis and continue to work toward peace.\n  I believe the greatest way the United States can pay tribute to our \npartner, Yitzhak Rabin, is to continue to assist the efforts of those \ntrying to make peace in the Middle East. Any peace that is achieved \nforever will be attached to the name of Israeli leader and peacemaker \nYitzhak Rabin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation has always been willing to \nfight for the values and freedoms that our Nation, our flag, and our \nConstitution represents. We have always met that test. America and \nAmericans have always stepped forward. My father served in World War \nII, my uncles, our neighbors, sons, daughters. That was a time and a \nwar when every American understood that our basic way of life was being \nthreatened. There was a direct obligation for each and every American \nto do his or her part, and Americans met that challenge, and \nindividuals were willing to face the dangers of loss of life to protect \nand preserve the freedoms that the next generation of Americans share \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I submit, there is no compelling American interest in \nBosnia that meets that standard that would jeopardize or put our \nchildren and our grandchildren in such a dangerous situation. It is an \nunwinnable, untenable civil war in a place called Bosnia.\n  As a parent, I do not wish my sons or daughters put in harm's way, \nand I cannot imagine that any other parent would be willing to risk the \nlives of their children in a peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.\n  The President has not made a compelling case to sacrifice one \nAmerican life, let alone place 20,000 U.S. troops in a dangerous, \ndangerous situation. Sending American troops to Bosnia is unnecessary, \nit is wrong, and I will oppose it with every fiber in my body.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about that. But let me suggest \nto you, getting 20,000 troops in may look somewhat grand as they come \nmarching off, as the tanks roll in, as there will be crowds well \norchestrated for the TV cameras to see them cheering, but how long will \nthey have to serve? How will they get them out? Do we really believe \nthey are going to come out in 1 year? The administration is already \nwiggling on this. How many lives will be lost?\n  This administration's track record in being able to keep its promises \nand meet its obligations in similar situations has not been a good one. \nCertainly, it was a disaster in Somalia, when a mission that started \nout as one for peacekeeping and one to give food to people was changed.\n  Certainly, as things are unraveling today in Haiti, we have every \nreason to believe that upon the withdrawal, if our American troops are \nwithdrawn on time, there will be an unraveling, once again, and the \ncitizens of Haiti will find themselves, once again, at war.\n  I think it is naive to really think that by putting 20,000 troops--\nand by the way, there are going to be about 40,000 troops in that \nregion, 20,000 in Bosnia. The cost is astronomical, not to mention the \ndanger to our troops.\n  I think it is absolutely disingenuous for the administration to now \ncome forward and say the United States will lose prestige abroad \nbecause they brokered this peace on the basis of sending U.S. troops \nthere. They were warned repeatedly by this Congress, by this body, by \nthe House of Representatives, that clearly we were opposed to sending \ntroops there, and to say now that we are going to be having them there \nand for us to be less than supportive, and that this would embarrass \nthe President, embarrass the Nation, endanger our relations with NATO \nis to ignore the fact that the President deliberately undertook this \noperation, was well aware of the opposition of the citizens of the \nUnited States and of the Congress and does not--and does not--deserve \nat this point in time our support.\n\n  Our support should be to protect the lives of our U.S. troops, to see \nto it that if we are going to enter a conflict--and this is a conflict \nthat has been brewing for hundreds of years--that there is a vital \nnational interest.\n  Should we work to bring about peace? Yes. But I suggest putting \n20,000 troops in and promising to take them out in 1 year is not going \nto end over 500 years of hostility. It is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, the entire Nation has its attention on the \ndeployment of United States Forces to Bosnia. Congressional hearings on \nthe peace agreement began this week. The President received a NATO \ntroop deployment plan for the implementation force today. Many of my \ncolleagues have made statements on the issue.\n  I have long urged that we lift the arms embargo in Bosnia and let the \nBosnians defend themselves. This would have been the best option for \nBosnia and the United States. It would \n\n[[Page S17862]]\nhave been the legally, morally, and strategically correct approach. \nLifting the arms embargo would have also been the best way to avoid \nsending United States troops to Bosnia. In fact, had we done that, \nlifted the arms embargo, we would not be talking today about deployment \nof U.S. Forces.\n\n  The record should be clear. We are where we are today because the \nPresident repeatedly--and let me repeat, repeatedly--rejected Congress' \nbipartisan effort to lift the embargo.\n  We should also be clear at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. It is \ntime for a reality check in the Congress. The fact is that President \nClinton has decided to send United States Forces to Bosnia. The fact is \nthat these troops will be sent--and indeed some are already there. The \nfact is by next week, there will be a couple thousand American soldiers \non the ground in Bosnia.\n  The President has the constitutional power as Commander in Chief to \nsend these forces. The Congress cannot stop this troop deployment from \nhappening. The President and senior advisers have repeatedly said they \nwill proceed with the deployment, whatever the Congress does. If we \nwould try to cut off funds we would harm the men and women in the \nmilitary who have already begun to arrive in Bosnia.\n  So we should find a way, if possible, to support the American men and \nwomen in uniform on their way to Bosnia and who will be in Bosnia--I \nassume a full 20,000, they say, by February.\n  Like all Americans, I have real concerns about this operation. First, \nI am concerned about the possibility of American casualties. The men \nand women of our Armed Forces are volunteers. But that does not make \ntheir lives any less valuable than those of draftees or any other \ncategory. They know the risks. We have an obligation to do all we can \nto reduce those risks. We can reduce the risk to American Forces by \nlimiting their mission to enforcing only military provisions of the \npeace agreement: That means no Somalia-like nation-building.\n  We can also reduce the threat to U.S. Forces by making it crystal \nclear that any attack on our troops will be met with an overwhelming, \nrapid, and decisive response. No more cumbersome command arrangements \nlimiting ability to retaliate--no more U.N. second-guessing or dual key \nveto authority. The United Nations will not be involved. This is a NATO \noperation. It will be an American general making these decisions.\n  The second major concern is that American Forces will be drawn into a \nquagmire with no way out. Many people are concerned about that because \nthe administration has not articulated an exit strategy; and setting an \narbitrary date is not an exit strategy.\n\n  Bring them out in a year--what does that mean? That is not a \nstrategy. Who knows what the strategy is?\n  The President has a plan to get us into Bosnia but no realistic plan \nto get us out. Keeping Bosnia defenseless is not an exit strategy. \nRelying on Utopian arms control schemes is no exit strategy. Relying on \nunnamed third parties is not an exit strategy.\n  The United States must have its own exit strategy to control its own \ndestiny. We should not be dependent on the good will or actions of \nother nations. The only way to make certain that United States Forces \nwill be able to leave in a timely and honorable way is to ensure that \nthe Bosnians are provided the means to defend themselves when we leave.\n  What is needed is a concrete effort, led by the United States, to arm \nand train the Bosnians. This effort should not be contingent on so-\ncalled builddown provisions in the Dayton agreement.\n  I understand administration officials said this morning that the \nUnited States or NATO would not be involved in enabling Bosnia to \ndefend itself. In my view, it is an abdication of responsibility to \nrely on unspecified third countries to create the conditions that allow \nwithdrawal of American forces. The sooner we start to enable Bosnians \nto defend themselves the sooner United States Forces can come home.\n  In my view, the definition of success of this deployment must include \na real end to the war--that is only possible with the creation of a \nstable military balance which enables Bosnia to defend itself. Anything \nless simply exposes American Forces to great risks in order to monitor \na temporary interlude in the fighting. In other words, I guess if they \nall came home next year there might be a temporary interlude to get us \nthrough the November activities of 1996, and I am not certain it would \nlast very long.\n  Over the coming days--in fact, we have been working on it a couple of \ndays--we will be working on a resolution that I hope the majority of my \ncolleagues can support. We have not yet seen the final NATO \nimplementation plan. In fact, as I said earlier, the President just \nreceived it today. I do not want to make a snap judgment. I hope we can \nfashion a resolution that offers support to our military forces, that \nhelps reduce the risk they face, and that ensures American Forces come \nhome as soon as possible with a successful mission accomplished.\n  I urge my colleagues to not make this a partisan issue. I have been \ndebating issues like this in the Senate floor for 20-some years. I was \ndebating cut off of funds in the Vietnam war, and my colleague, Senator \nMcCain was a prisoner of war. We stood on this floor day after day \nafter day beating off efforts to shut off funding which I thought would \nhave a direct impact on men in the service like John McCain and others \nwho were in that part of the world. We had some success.\n\n  Let me suggest that the overwhelming votes to lift the arms embargo \nwere bipartisan. They were Democrats, Republicans, and they were \nbipartisan with bipartisan leadership.\n  I believe the best foreign policy is conducted with bipartisan \nsupport. I know that the Senate votes on Lebanon and the gulf war were \nmuch more partisan in my view than they should have been.\n  Indeed, I was dismayed, as I have said before, in the gulf crisis \nthere was not a single member of the Democratic leadership in either \nthe House or the Senate, when we already had troops on the ground, that \nwould support President Bush's decision to protect American interests \nin the operation Desert Storm.\n  I have had a long feeling that once the troops were deployed--which \nis going to happen; it is already happening--that we have some \nobligation to ensure their safe and honorable return. I have often and \nlong felt it is too important for partisan posture. I know the easy \nvote on this is ``no, no.''\n  I hope that some of my colleagues will look at it very carefully. We \nare talking about troops that have been committed. They are on their \nway. They will be there next week. We are going to be debating this \nnext week on the Senate floor. Someone will say no troops should be \ndeployed. It will be a little late for that, so it is probably not a \ndifficult vote.\n  Others of us, hopefully on both sides of the aisle, want to make \ncertain, as I have said, that we have a way to get out. It is not hard \nto get in, but we need a way to get out. We need an exit strategy. We \nneed to make certain that the Bosnians are armed and trained. We need \nto take on that responsibility.\n  I know the Bosnians tried to secure that assurance in Dayton, OH, \nwithout success. If we do not have that, how do we leave? When do we \nleave? How long will it take?\n  I just hope we can all work together in the coming days to fashion a \nresolution which supports our military forces, reduces the risk they \nface, and brings them home as soon as possible. Some would say, ``Well, \nif you do this, you are supporting the President of the United \nStates.'' I say that is all right with me. We have one President at a \ntime. He is the Commander in Chief. He has made this decision. I do not \nagree with it. I think it is a mistake.\n\n  We had a better option, many better options. But as I said, he \nrepeatedly rejected those options. Now it is up to high noon. The \ntroops are on the way. They are from Kansas, from Arizona, from \nTennessee, they are from Ohio, they are from all over America. They are \nlooking to us for support. They are looking for us to make their job \njust as safe and just as secure as possible.\n  I believe we do that. The bottom line, the President intends to send \nthese troops one way or the other. He has made it very clear. He has \ntold us that. It has been in the paper. I think we have the \nresponsibility, as I said, in the Congress, to try to ensure to our \nbest ability, that as this deployment goes forward, that we create the \nconditions to end it quickly and successfully so \n\n[[Page S17863]]\nthat the U.S. Forces can return to their families.\n  I am very happy to yield the floor. I know my colleague from Arizona \nwanted to make a statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17861-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17863-S17865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUR MISSION IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I congratulate the distinguished majority leader on a \nstatesmanlike and nonpartisan statement. I will briefly add to \nit. Again, I hope his statement is paid attention to by colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n\n  I would like to restate in my opening remark what the distinguished \nmajority leader has just stated, what we must understand, and what \nshould be a framework for whatever debate ensues next week on the \nfloor.\n  The American people and my colleagues should understand one salient \nfact. The President will be sending 20,000 Americans to Bosnia for 1 \nyear, whether we approve or disapprove.\n  We can argue about whether the President should have made the \ncommitment almost 3 years ago to participate in the peace \nimplementation force in Bosnia. As Senator Dole just stated, there are \nmany other options I would have preferred to have employed besides this \none. I would not have made that commitment. But the reality is the \nPresident did so commit and those troops are going to Bosnia.\n  The President has the authority under the Constitution to do so, and \nhe intends to exercise that authority with or without our approval. We \ncan cut off funding, but the President will veto, and his veto will, \nwithout any doubt, be sustained. Even if we should force the President \nto renege on his commitment, we should understand that there would be \nvery negative consequences to such an action. The credibility of the \nword of the U.S. President is an enormous strategic value of the \nAmerican people and essential to our security. I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to consider, in their deliberations on this question, how \nhigh a premium they would place on the credibility of a Republican \nPresident and place that same premium on this President's credibility. \nOur friends and enemies do not discriminate between Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents when the word of an American President is given. \nWhen the President's word is no longer credible abroad, all Americans \nare less safe.\n  Another consequence would be the severe damage to the stability of \nNATO, the most successful defensive alliance in history.\n  And, finally, all signatories to the peace agreement have stated \nthat, absent United States participation in the implementation force, \nthe war in Bosnia will reignite. I repeat, the war in Bosnia will \nreignite and the atrocities we have all come to abhor will continue.\n  Therefore, I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that our \nmission in Bosnia is, as the President said it would be, clear, limited \nand achievable, that it has the greatest chance for success with the \nleast risk to the lives of our young men and women. That is our \nresponsibility as much as the President's, and I intend to take that \nresponsibility very seriously.\n\n  We can best achieve this by ensuring that our Armed Forces do not \nengage in any nonmilitary activities such as refugee resettlement or \nother nation-building activities for which they are not trained. \nTherefore, we should condition our authorization of this deployment on \nthe prohibition against our forces enforcing any other aspect of this \nagreement, other than the military provisions of the military annex to \nthe general framework agreement.\n  Further, we must ensure that the goals of their mission are clear and \nachievable and will justify, to some extent, the risk we will incur. A \nclear exit strategy is not time based but goal based. We must ensure \nthat the peace we enforce for 12 months has a realistic prospect to \nendure in the 13th, 14th, 15th month and, hopefully, for years beyond \nthat.\n  Essential to that goal is a stable military balance. To achieve that \nbalance, we will have to see to it that the Bosnian federation has the \nmeans and the training to provide for its own defense from aggression \nafter we have withdrawn. Therefore, I believe our authorization of this \ndeployment must be conditioned on the concrete assurance that the \nUnited States will do whatever is necessary, although without using our \nsoldiers who are part of the implementation force, to ensure that the \nBosnians can defend themselves at the end of our mission.\n  Some will want to pursue military equilibrium through the arms \nbuilddown envisioned in the agreement, but to assume in a few months we \ncan persuade all parties to build down to rough military equilibrium is \nincredibly naive. We should rightly have little faith in the prospects \nof arms control negotiations in such a short period. Therefore, we must \ninsist that before we leave in a year there is a stable military \nbalance which will have been achieved by helping the Bosnians to \nacquire the arms and the training to defend themselves that we have \ndenied them for 4 years.\n  In closing, let me again urge my Republican colleagues to consider \nvery carefully the institution of the Presidency as they deliberate on \nthis very difficult question. I spent much of my life defending the \ncredibility and the honor of the United States. I have no intention of \nevading that responsibility now.\n  Therefore, I intend to work on a resolution with Senator Dole and, \nhopefully, all of my Senate colleagues, that will maximize the \nprospects for the success of the mission and minimize American \ncasualties. I am fully aware that in doing so, I will bear some of the \nresponsibility in the event the mission fails. I do so readily, because \nmy first responsibility is to do everything in my power to support and \nprotect the fine young Americans we will send to Bosnia and to ensure \nthat whatever sacrifices they will endure, they will have done so for a \ncause that was worthy and winnable.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just take a moment to thank my \ncolleague from Arizona. He knows as well as I do what the public \nopinion polls are showing; 80 percent, in some cases higher, ``Do not \nsend the troops.'' As we have tried to point out, that is not the \noption anymore. The option is to have an exit strategy and to make \ncertain that in that exit strategy we train the Bosnians so they can be \nan independent force to defend themselves so we can come home; second, \nto take every step we can to ensure the casualties will be as low as \npossible.\n  The Senator from Arizona is not unaccustomed to courage and making \ncourageous stands--this is another example--in the face of public \nopinion. But that is what leadership is all about. I have to believe, \nonce the Americans are there starting next week and once the images on \ntelevision are of Americans and the children and the families and the \nsecurity they have, the attitude of Americans will change.\n  The Senator from Arizona made a point that I think deserves \nrepeating. That is, NATO--NATO has been very important. It has \npreserved freedom for a half century. We have given our word. In \neffect, we are NATO, as far as I am concerned, the United States. \nWithout the United States as a partner in NATO, you would not have \nNATO.\n  But, in addition, the President of the United States, without \nconsulting Congress, but it was the President of the United States in \n1993 who, in effect, gave his word that the United States, if there \nwere peace to keep, would send 20,000 Americans as part of a 60,000-\nmember force. Then we invited all the parties to come to Ohio, to \nDayton, OH, where they stayed for about 3 weeks. The implication was \nclear. The Americans had taken over the negotiations. The peace talks \nhad broken down. I talked with the Prime Minister of Bosnia less than 3 \nhours ago. They were all packed, ready to go home; then Mr. Milosevic, \nthe President of Serbia, made some concessions. But the implication \nthroughout was that the United States would be the principal player. \nYou cannot have peace, according to him, unless the United States is \npresent. Not that they do not have great respect for the Europeans who \nhave been there and the U.N. Protection Forces for the past several \nyears, who lost about 200 lives total.\n  So, it seems to me that our responsibility now is not to say we are \ngoing to pass some resolution here that says--it is only two lines \nlong: ``The Senate is opposed to deploying U.S. forces.'' Let me \nrepeat. They are going to be there next week, about 3,000. \n\n[[Page S17864]]\n They are already deployed and the others will follow.\n  We do have some responsibility, when the President of the United \nStates, whoever that may be, gives his word to the international \ncommunity that this is what will happen and this is a responsibility we \nwill assume.\n  So, I hope we have a good debate. We hope to start it next Wednesday, \nif we can. It is not going to be easy. It is not politically popular. \nBut it is the right thing to do, and sometimes it takes a while for \npeople to understand when you do the right thing.\n  So I commend my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain. I know he \nunderstands, probably better than anyone on this floor, what loss of \nfreedom and loss of liberty might be like--what it was like for him for \nseveral years. So this is about America. This is about American forces. \nThis is about our responsibility as Congress--not about Republicans and \nDemocrats. It is about the Congress. As the Senator said, we could cut \noff funds. That would be vetoed. I do not think anybody wants to cut \noff funds.\n  And I do not suggest everybody who has a different view is posturing. \nBut there will be some of that. There always is. So, this is a very \nimportant time in American history.\n  It is a very important commitment that the President has made. We \nwish he would have listened to us--this Senator, the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Connecticut--about lifting the arms \nembargo a year ago. We would not be talking about sending American \ntroops now. But that did not happen. So here we are.\n  I believe the Congress will do the right thing. We will end up \nsupporting U.S. forces. We will attempt to do everything we can to \nreduce casualties, and we will have an exit strategy in the resolution. \nWe believe it will be bipartisan. We hope that we can have the same \nspirit of bipartisanship in the House and that we can send a resolution \nto the President for his signature --if not next week, the first part \nof the following week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There is very little I can add to the eloquent words of \nthe majority leader, except that I would also like to note the presence \nof the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, who has labored \nlong and hard on this issue in a very bipartisan fashion. He and I, the \nmajority leader and others, will be working on this resolution so we \ncan get it to the floor, get it debated, and get it passed as quickly \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, often bandied about by politicians is reference to the \nConstitution of the United States. It is very clear to me that the \nPresident of the United States, by virtue of his election by a majority \nof the American people, has the authority to send these troops. I \nbelieve that it is up to us to do everything we can to ensure their \nsafety, and if that means that there is some political damage inflicted \nby that decision I will hearken back to my first responsibility, and \nthat is to minimize the loss of a single American life. I believe we \ncan do no less.\n  I want to thank the majority leader, and I look forward to hearing \nthe views of my colleagues. I hope that we can work together with as \nlittle rancor as possible on this very emotional, divisive issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer respectfully a word of thanks to the \ndistinguished majority leader and to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The Senator from Arizona described the remarks of the majority leader \nas statesmanlike. I say that the remarks of the majority leader were \nmore than statesmanlike. They were, in fact, patriotic in the sense \nthat, in taking the position that he has, he has put the interest of \nhis country ahead of politics. All that I know about the majority \nleader says to me that one should not be surprised to see him do that. \nNonetheless, the action he has taken today should not pass without \nbeing commented on, and should be appreciated.\n  Senator Dole and I, Senator McCain and others, Senator Biden on this \nside, have been working in a bipartisan way now for almost 4 years \nthrough the administration of President Bush, and now President \nClinton, trying to create a reaction that was effective to what we have \nseen all along--acts of aggression against Bosnia, taking advantage of \nits military weakness, and ultimately becoming not just acts of \naggression but acts of genocide.\n  The four of us, and others on both sides, ultimately becoming a \nresounding majority, a bipartisan majority, cried out for the raising \nof the arms embargo, feeling it was immoral, it was unfair, and it was \nunrelated to reality to continue to impose on the warring parties there \nan embargo that was adopted in 1991 as an attempt to stop the war from \nbreaking out. But the war did break out.\n  On one side, the Serbs possessed most of the military war-making \ncapacity of the former Yugoslavia. On the other side, the Bosnians had \nlittle or none, and, as a result, they were victimized.\n  Particularly after the attack by the Serbs on the undefended, so-\ncalled ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica and the brutal, inhumane slaughter \nthat occurred there, this brought the United States-led NATO to carry \nout a series of air attacks that finally convinced the aggressors that \nthe rest of the world would not stand by and watch wars spread in \nEurope, watch people be slaughtered because of their religion, watch \nNATO and the United States lose their credibility and the respect that \nthey enjoyed throughout the world. President Clinton led the effort in \nNATO to carry out those air strikes and then designated Secretary \nChristopher and Ambassador Holbrooke to bring the stature and force of \nthe United States of America to bear to bring the parties to peace. No \nother country in the world could have done this. It is remarkable that \neach of the warring parties trust the United States more than any other \ncountry in the world. That is to say, that all three of them trust us. \nIn Bosnia, in the Middle East, and perhaps in Northern Ireland, we have \ncredibility, and we have strength. With that strength comes \nresponsibility. But I would say also that with that strength and \ncredibility comes increased security for each and every citizen of the \nUnited States.\n  I agree with the commitment that President Clinton has made to send \nthese 20,000 troops to be part of an international force of 60,000 \nbecause I understand that without that commitment, there never would \nhave been peace, the three warring parties would never have come to the \npeace table and our allies in NATO would never have joined to keep the \npeace. So while I strongly support the commitment that was made--and I \nunderstand that my friends and colleagues who have just spoken do not--\nwhat I particularly respect and appreciate is that the Senate majority \nleader and the Senator from Arizona understand that the question now is \nnot whether we all agree with the commitment that was made; the \nquestion now is whether we will honor that commitment. What is on the \nline there is the credibility and reliability of America's word in the \nworld, of America's leadership in the world.\n  Somebody asked in the Armed Services Committee hearing that we held \non Tuesday of a panel of witnesses, three people who had served in \nvarious administrations, ``Is Bosnia worth dying for?'' And, of course, \neach and every one of us hopes and prays and believes that there will \nnot be casualties among our forces, that we are taking every \nprecaution, learning from Somalia and Haiti, and how important it is to \nlimit our objectives here with the military objectives easily carried \nout, to make sure that our troops have robust rules of engagement, \nwhich means if their safety is threatened in the slightest they can \nstrike back with overwhelming force. But we understand that there are \nrisks involved in any military operation, any sending of American \ntroops to a zone where there may be combat, even if it is to keep the \npeace as it is today.\n  While we understand all of that, what is important here is that my \ncolleagues have to answer the question which the former Under Secretary \nof Defense answered on Monday when the question was asked, ``Is Bosnia \nworth dying for?'' He said, ``That is not the right question.'' In the \ngulf war situation, \n\n[[Page S17865]]\nafter Saddam Hussein moved into Kuwait, the question appropriately \nwould not have been, ``Is Kuwait worth dying for,'' because there was \nmuch more on the line there as there is here. What is on the line here \nis the credibility and the reliability of the word of the President of \nthe United States, who alone has made this commitment and is authorized \nto execute the foreign policy of the United States.\n  Five-hundred and thirty-five Members of Congress cannot be at every \nmeeting, every negotiation that the President of the United States is \ninvolved in. The Presidency, beyond this President, must have that \nreliability, that credibility, that strength. In that strength and \nreliability rests not just some distant esoteric governmental structure \nor authority point of view; in that reliability rests the security of \neach and every American.\n  So I thank my colleagues for understanding that there is more at work \nhere. The reliability and credibility of our word, the controlling of a \nconflict, hopefully ending a conflict that could have spread and become \na wider war and drawn us in later on at a much higher price, the \nrenewed strength of NATO on which we will rely to help us share the \nburdens of peacekeeping, not just here but around the world.\n  We called on NATO allies in 1990 and 1991 in the gulf war and said we \nneeded their help, and our allies came to our assistance, fought by our \nside. Today, in effect, they in Europe are asking our help--not to do \nit all, but to provide one-third of an international force. Who knows? \nA year or two from now, we again may find that some strategic interest \nor moral principle of ours has been challenged around the world and we \nwill turn to our allies in Europe and NATO and ask them for help. If we \nsay no today, then what can we reasonably expect them to say to us \ntomorrow?\n  So, Mr. President, I thank again the majority leader and the Senator \nfrom Arizona for rising above politics and partisanship, doing what is \nnot popular but doing what they have concluded and I believe is best \nfor our country and best for those 20,000 soldiers who are going into \npeacekeeping in Bosnia.\n  The last thing I think we would want to do is to send those 20,000 \nsoldiers into Bosnia wondering whether they have the support of anybody \nbesides the President of the United States. It is up to us in Congress, \nas representatives of the people of this country, every State and \ndistrict of this country, to say to those brave soldiers--the finest \nfighting force that has ever existed in the history of the world, in my \nopinion--we are with you. We stand behind you. The time for partisan \ndebate is over. You have a mission to do, and now we are focused on \ndoing everything we can to support your mission and to help, as Senator \nDole has said, to make sure that it can be carried out swiftly, \nsuccessfully, and with good effect.\n  I agree with my colleagues that part of that is to make sure that the \nBosnian military is adequately armed and equipped to deter aggression \nonce the NATO peacekeeping force leaves Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, there are moments when not only the people of the \nUnited States but Members of Congress are disappointed, frustrated, \ndiscouraged by what happens here. There are other moments when we are \nelevated and inspired and encouraged because we see among our \ndistinguished colleagues an extraordinarily able group that has been \nsent here from around the country. We see really the finest, in a sense \nI would say the most noble of human behavior, real acts of leadership, \nand I respectfully suggest that we have seen such an act from the \nSenate majority leader today and from the Senator from Arizona.\n  I look forward to working with them and, hopefully, with a strong \nbipartisan majority of colleagues, to draft and then pass an \nappropriate resolution of support for those 20,000 troops and for the \nPresident and the Presidency that has made this commitment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17863-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17865-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17865-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 30, 1995, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2519.

A bill to require the consideration of certain criteria in \ndecisions to relocate professional sports teams, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                        fans rights act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to address the situation we face in \nprofessional sports at the moment. What I am introducing today is a \nbill we call the Fans Rights Act. I believe we truly are at a \ncrossroads in professional sports. When we talk about professional \nsports and introducing legislation, obviously the first question is why \non Earth do we want to get the Government involved in professional \nsports? Keep our mitts out of that area. Stay away from it. We have no \nbusiness getting into the area of professional sports.\n  Yet, I would say that we are into a situation now that I think is \nvery important. I think it is important for the country. It does \ninvolve professional sports. Why get Government involved? Professional \nsports, the way they are organized, do have to come to Government for \nantitrust exemptions and for permission to use broadcast money for \nvarious purposes and spread across interstate--a whole host of things \nwhere Government does, indeed, get involved.\n  Beyond that, Americans are sports minded. Part of the fabric of the \ndaily life of the United States is looking at the ball scores, looking \nat the scores on the weekends, and watching the professional sports \nteams operate. I think Senator Specter, at a hearing we had yesterday, \nput it well when he said, ``America has a love affair with professional \nsports.'' Indeed we do have a love affair with professional sports. We \neven have sports idols, of course, that are the role models for many of \nour young people. It goes into the whole fabric of this country. I will \nnot belabor that idea any further.\n  The shock waves of the Cleveland Browns' proposed move to Baltimore \nextend far beyond just the State of Ohio. Every community with a \nprofessional sports team needs to know this: Any city in America can \nfall victim to a bidding war in which the interests of loyal fans and \ncommunities are given very little consideration.\n  Quite simply, if it can happen in Cleveland, where loyal fans \nsupported the Browns through thick and thin, then, Mr. President, it \ncan happen anywhere. Other communities may have been willing to grin \nand bear it, but in Cleveland, we are drawing a line in the sand and we \nare here to say that enough is enough.\n  The new economics of sports is a zero sum game in which teams seem to \nbounce around the country and taxpayers too often are left holding the \nbag.\n  Unfortunately, professional sports leagues, like the NFL, actually \nhave little ability to regulate the movement of their own member teams. \nThey cannot enforce their own bylaws that franchise holders agree to \nwhen they become members of the league. There is no process involved to \nallow a community to have any protection or input before such moves. A \nteam simply picks up and goes, leaving behind fans, businesses, and a \ncommunity that has invested vast emotional and financial support.\n  Judging by the barrage of reports during football games each Sunday \non nightly hockey broadcasts or in the sports pages each day, it would \nseem to lead us to believe that almost half of America's sports \nfranchises are looking for greener pastures.\n  Let me run through just a few of the things being considered right \nnow.\n  In Texas, the Houston Oilers have announced they are moving to \nNashville. In Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are rumored to be \nmoving up to Orlando. The Chicago Bears are considering an offer to \nmove over the border to Gary, IN.\n  If that is not confusing enough, this past weekend various NFL \ncommentators reported that:\n  The Buccaneers will end up in Cleveland with the Browns' name;\n  The Buccaneers will end up in Baltimore and the Browns will be sold;\n  The Oilers transfer is not a done deal; and\n  Both the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals are talking about \nrelocating to Los Angeles, which lost both its teams in moves before \nthis season.\n  Does anyone find it ironic that the Cardinals are talking about \nrelocating to Los Angeles to replace the Rams who moved to St. Louis to \nreplace the Cardinals after they moved to Phoenix?\n  No wonder the sports fans find it tough to even follow those moves. \nThese are the people we are concerned about, not just those in the \nskyboxes. We are talking about the average American whose family has \nsupported a franchise through season tickets, parking fees, T-shirts, \nand paraphernalia through concessions for decades and decades and \ndecades, because it is those people who are the true fabric of American \nsports.\n  It is those people who are truly hurt when a flagship team like the \nBrowns threatens to leave town.\n  We are here today to say that it is time to give a voice to the fans \nof America. That is what the Fans Right Act we are introducing today is \nall about.\n  I think the league knows they have a basic problem. We have talked to \nCommissioner Tagliabue about this, and actually the league does not \nhave control over where these franchises go even though their own \nbylaws say that a vote of the league owners will determine where the \nteams go.\n  The problem has been that a few years back one of the owners decided \nto move anyway, even though the league had voted against him, on a move \nof the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles, in effect thumbing his nose at \nthe league when they voted that he could not move. He was taken to \ncourt. The league lost, and there was about a $50 million penalty \nassessed against the league, even though their own bylaws that the \nowner had agreed to said that the league could control the move.\n  That is the situation we find ourselves in.\n  Let me hasten to add that this is not an antiowners bill in any way, \nshape, or form. It does not prohibit the owners from making money. It \ndoes not limit the amount of money they can make. It does not stop them \nfrom cutting the best deals they can with their host cities. It does \nnot even bar them from moving their teams to the other locations if \nthere are good reasons for doing so. But it does require them to play \nby the rules that they themselves set and vote upon. It lets the league \nhave the final say whether a transfer will be made or will not be made. \nRight now the league does not have that authority because it has been \ntaken to court and shown that they did not have it.\n  I realize that professional football, like all big league sports, is \na business. It is a big business. But a business is comprised of its \nowners, its workers, and its customers. Team owners have rights. They \ndo not hesitate to enforce them. Team players have rights, and they do \nnot hesitate to enforce them either. The third part of that is I \nbelieve the team customers--the fans--have some rights also, and that \nis what this addresses.\n  I say it is time that we help them enforce those rights--not just in \nCleveland but all across this great country. If it were just one move, \nwell, all right. I would doubt that would be the subject of any \nlegislation here on the floor of the Senate. But, as I indicated \nearlier, this has become a basic problem in professional sports, and we \nare trying to address that problem.\n  So while we recognize that professional sports franchises are clearly \nbusiness and we must consider profit, we also believe Congress should \ntake a number of steps to, in effect, help the league in its ability to \ncontrol the destiny of the league. That is a power they do not now \nhave. It gives them the power to increase stability and ultimately \npreserve the integrity of professional sports.\n\n  Let me turn to some of the details. We accomplish the first by \nproviding sports leagues with a very narrow, limited exemption to \nantitrust laws if the league has voted to block a move. Let me read \nthat again. We accomplish it by providing sports leagues with a very \nlimited antitrust exemption if the \n\n[[Page S17867]]\nleague has voted to block a move. This exemption would say that if the \nleague prevails, they could not be taken to court in a situation like \nthat. And the exemption would shield sports leagues from the likes of \nthe $50 million antitrust lawsuit that we saw the Raiders win in the \n1980's and from the types of lawsuits the NFL is currently fighting in \ncourt. What we are trying to do is let them run their own business but \ndo it fairly.\n  Yesterday, at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Commissioner \nTagliabue asked for such an exemption so that the NFL could enforce its \nown bylaws. I discussed this with him in my office several weeks ago \nwhen I had written him a letter and told him what I was thinking about \ndoing and the proposal we were about to make.\n  So today we propose that Congress give the NFL and other sports \nleagues the legal ability to block the move of a team if they think it \nis not in the best interest of their sport. By law, we will require \nthat these leagues abide by their own bylaws, which currently take into \naccount fan loyalty and community support, their own bylaws that some \nowners see fit to not go along with even though they have agreed to \nthose bylaws when they accepted the franchise in the league.\n  Second, our legislation would also require that teams give \ncommunities at least 6 months' notice before a relocation can occur. \nThis would allow communities facing a team relocation the opportunity \nto put together bona fide offers to purchase the team or induce it to \nstay. The sports league would be required to take these efforts into \nconsideration as it considers a team relocation. And it would require a \nhearing so that people like Mayor Mike White in Cleveland and Art \nModell, the owner of the Browns, could sit down together, with \nCleveland and the Nation watching, and publicly discuss whether it is \nsuch a great idea for the Browns to leave Cleveland and what the \nreasons are for leaving.\n  Third, our bill has a fair play clause. It says to owners thinking \nabout moving their teams that no longer can they give a so-called \nrelocation fee to the league, which I understand may be even \ndistributed to the other owners before their vote, before the league \nvotes on whether or not they should relocate.\n  This is something Mayor White has talked a lot about, and my \ncolleague, Senator Mike DeWine, made a strong case for it in \nyesterday's hearings and at a press conference we had this morning. I \nknow he will make his own statement on that shortly. He is on the floor \nnow. But there are two things you can say about it. First, it is just \nplain fair, and it makes sense to put that kind of a limitation, a fair \nplay clause, in there.\n  This bill sends a very clear message to the league and to the owners. \n``We are giving you the tools that you yourselves have said you need to \nput your house in order. We are giving you authority to enforce your \nown bylaws that you all agree to and say you will play by. Congress \ndoes not want to run your business.'' I do not want to be involved in \nrunning the business out there.\n  I think this legislation is much needed so that it can bring some \norder to what is a rather chaotic situation in the league now. I hope \nthat this will be looked at very, very carefully at the January 17 \nmeeting of the league in Dallas, which I believe is their current \nschedule.\n  I believe this legislation, simple though it is, can fix the problem. \nIt can fix the problem. Make no mistake, there are far harsher \nproposals out there that Congress may be inclined to consider. I know \nthe distinguished Senator from Washington, who is in the chair right \nnow and is the Presiding Officer of the Senate, has proposed some \nlegislation in the past and has had experience with this in his home \nState in getting a team to stay and in setting up conditions that go \nalong some of this same line. I know he feels that programs do not go \nfar enough in what we are proposing here and has said so publicly this \nmorning. So I am not telling tales that were private conversations of a \nday or two back.\n  All I am pointing out is that there are harsher proposals out there. \nI do not want to see Congress forced to take these harsher steps, these \ntough steps. I would rather see the league take this authority we are \ngiving them now and act on it, control their own league, and get on \nwith the business of making sure that everything is very fair.\n  Baseball has its own set of problems, of course, and there have been \nproposals in the past to take the antitrust exemption away from \nbaseball. But the one thing to say about baseball is they have had \nauthority to keep teams where they were and to not just float teams \naround willy-nilly, all over the United States.\n  I was told this morning that it has been 24 years since a major \nleague baseball team moved, that the new teams we have in the league \nare expansion teams. I have not checked that out, but I guess that is \ncorrect. It indicates that if you have authority to go ahead and run \nthe league and to pass on the franchises and where they will be, there \ncan be some stability.\n  I will be introducing separate legislation which would allow a \ncommunity to keep the team name in the event of a relocation. That will \nnot be part of this legislation I have just submitted today. But the \nteam name in the event of a relocation would remain, and the community \ncould waive this right if it wishes to do so. I am working with \nCongressman Hoke in the House and Senator DeWine on that bill, and it \nwill be introduced separately at a later date.\n  I cannot think of any football team or any sports team for that \nmatter that has enjoyed more loyal and fervent support from its \ncommunity than the Cleveland Browns. Week in and week out, whether \ntheir record might be 13 and 3, or 3 and 13, just the opposite, over \n70,000 fans regularly pack Cleveland Municipal Stadium to show their \nsupport to the Browns.\n  At the hearing we had yesterday, Senator Thurmond, who was chairing \nthe hearing, talked about how in his home State of South Carolina there \nis a loyal band of Cleveland fans, ``dawgs'' as we call them around \nCleveland, as they call themselves, and the ``dawg pound,'' as they \ncall the area where this particular group always sits in Cleveland \nStadium, and Senator Thurmond said they have 800 South Carolinians who \nare loyal Cleveland fans and meet every time there is a Cleveland game. \nI told him then I had not been aware that we have a remote dawg pound, \nas we call it in Cleveland, down in South Carolina.\n  I relate that only to indicate the loyalty of Cleveland fans all over \nthe country. So this move cannot take place because anyone thinks there \nhas been a lack of fan support or lack of fan interest in the Cleveland \narea.\n  Mr. President, with this legislation, we say to fans in Cleveland and \nacross the country, any sport that boasts it is played in America and \nmade in America, as football has been termed, should be operated fairly \nin America also. So I think once again we are at a crossroads in \nprofessional sports, and I think this legislation will take us down the \nright path from that crossroads. Let me just say for all of you outside \nof Cleveland who may be listening, it happened to us in Ohio, in \nCleveland, and it could happen to you. I think the legislation we are \nproposing today will go a long way toward giving the National Football \nLeague the ability, the legal ability, which they do not now have, to \ncontrol their own league. It gives them the legal ability, and I think \nthey will use it judiciously and properly and stop some of this turmoil \nof disruption that we see in the league right now, the way it has been \noperating in the last few years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my colleague from \nOhio today in cosponsoring this piece of legislation. The senior \nSenator from Ohio has very eloquently outlined the need for this \nlegislation. Let me also talk about a few items that I feel are \nimportant, because this legislation is not just about the Cleveland \nBrowns. Really, this legislation is about how tax dollars are spent. \nThis legislation is about equity. It is about fairness. It is a bill \nthat would ultimately help protect professional football fans \neverywhere. The question is asked many times, particularly this week \nwhen we are talking in this city about important issues such as Bosnia \nand the budget, why should Congress even think about becoming involved \nin professional sports?\n  I think the answer is threefold. First, in 1966, the NFL-AFL wanted \nto merge, \n\n[[Page S17868]]\nand they came to this Congress to ask for specific exemption of the \nantitrust law, and that was granted. Later on, when they wanted to pool \ntheir resources, pool the TV money, again the NFL came to this \nCongress, to the House and the Senate, to the American people, and said \nwe want special legislation. That legislation was passed and signed \ninto law, and they operate under that law today.\n  In virtually every move that is contemplated today in professional \nsports, certainly in regard to the purported move by the Browns from \nCleveland to Baltimore, tax dollars are involved, Federal tax dollars \nindirectly, local tax dollars both indirectly and directly. No move \ntakes place today without subsidization by the taxpayers. In the case \nof the Baltimore-Cleveland situation, you have the Cleveland community \nthat has not only supported the Browns with its individual money by the \npeople who go to the game, not only watch the game on TV, not only the \ngreat loyalty of almost 50 years of the Cleveland Browns fans, but the \ncommunity through tax dollars has put tax dollars back into Municipal \nStadium over the years, and there has been a contribution. And so we \nsee that case now in Baltimore with additional tax dollars. Yes, I know \nthey are called lottery dollars. They are. But again they are public \nfunds that are used to lure Cleveland over to Baltimore. So public \ndollars are involved and involved in virtually every single move. And \nso these are three good reasons I believe why Congress is already \ninvolved in the NFL, already involved in professional football. The \nonly question before us is to what extent we want to be involved.\n  Senator Glenn has outlined the major provisions of this bill. The one \nprovision which will give a limited antitrust exemption to the NFL \nowners if they turn down a move is, as Senator Glenn said, very \nlimited, and it does have the effect, in my opinion, of facilitating \nthe NFL in doing what they ought to do anyway, and that is, frankly, \nfollow their own nine-point criteria. That is all anyone can expect \nthem to do.\n\n  When anyone looks at the nine-point criteria that the NFL drew up to \nguide them, that they did in lieu of the Al Davis case--and they drew \nup nine points, very objective criteria--it is abundantly clear that if \nyou objectively apply the criteria, the Cleveland Browns would simply \nnever be allowed to move. It is not even a close call.\n  Here we have a community that has put an average of 70,000 people in \nthe stands Sunday after Sunday after Sunday in good years and some \nyears that maybe were not so good--almost 50 years of football \ntradition, NFL football in Cleveland.\n  The day after it was announced that the Browns wanted to move to \nBaltimore, a day after the infamous press conference in Baltimore was \nheld, less than 24 hours later, the voters of Cleveland, in Cuyahoga \nCounty, voted by a 72 percent margin to tax themselves to keep the \nBrowns in Cleveland--72 percent in 1995, with the antitax climate that \nwe have today.\n  Here is a team that is rated No. 1 in the NFL, No. 1 in the NFL in TV \npenetration of their market. They get a bigger share of the TV market \nin the Cleveland area, throughout the Cleveland market, northeast Ohio, \ncentral Ohio, than any other team in the NFL.\n  So if you look at the criteria that is applied, objective criteria, \nhow well has the community supported the team, how willing is the \ncommunity willing to try to negotiate and to provide the things that \nare needed for the team to solve any problems the team might have, when \nyou look at all the criteria, it is abundantly clear, on an objective \nbasis, the Browns did not qualify. It is not even close. Baltimore \nshould get a team, but it should not be the Cleveland Browns.\n  Let me turn, Mr. President, to another provision in this bill, and it \nhas to do with something that I discussed yesterday with Commissioner \nTagliabue when he testified in front of our Judiciary Committee, and \nthat is this thing that is called the franchise relocation fee. This \nis, in essence, to boil it down, money that is given by the team that \nis moving to all the other NFL owners.\n  The last time this was done, the amount was, if you count the direct \nmoney and the indirect money, $46 million. The last time there was a \nmove in the NFL, $46 million, they spread it among the other NFL teams. \nThese are the same owners, same teams that have to judge whether or not \nit is in the best interest of football and the fans for a team to be \nable to move.\n  What this bill does is say you cannot have this franchise relocation \nfee. It is not right. It is not fair. It does not accomplish anything \nfor the fans, for professional football, and certainly it does not make \nthe decisionmaking process any more objective as carried on by the \nowners.\n  The deal between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore in Maryland \nprovides a specific provision. In that contract it provides that up to \n$75 million can be used for a franchise relocation fee, up to $75 \nmillion. I would submit, Mr. President, that it is not too far a \nstretch of the imagination to argue that the lottery funds, other \npublic money, from Baltimore, from Maryland, will then go to the \nBrowns, the Browns would then turn around and distribute this, on this \nrelocation fee, to the other owners. I think it is abundantly clear \nwhat the problem is with this franchise relocation fee.\n  Mr. President, we are not in any way with this bill arguing or saying \nthat teams should not be able to move. Teams should be able to move. \nThey should be able to move if the market is not good, if there are \nproblems locally that cannot be resolved. What we are simply saying, \nthough, is that the movement should be based on merit, and there should \nbe some logic behind that.\n  In yesterday's hearing, Mr. President, I talked with some of the \nwitnesses, particularly witness Tagliabue, the commissioner of the NFL, \nabout a couple changes I thought the NFL could make without any \nintervention by Congress. The franchise relocation fee is one. The NFL \ndoes not have to wait for legislation. They could do that tomorrow. \nThey could change the rules and do away with that. And I think they \nshould.\n  Another thing that the NFL could do would be to change their very, \nvery strange--I do not know, Mr. President, a better word to describe \nit--but the very, very strange structure by which they share revenues \nin regard to people who go into those coliseums and ballparks every \nweekend.\n  Mr. President, if you or I buy a ticket, go in to see an NFL football \ngame this coming Sunday, if we just buy a regular ticket, part of the \nmoney from that ticket will go to the visiting team, part will go to \nthe home team. It is the way most professional sports divide the money \nup. The home team does get more, but there is a certain percentage. It \nworks no matter where you buy the ticket. There is one exception to \nthat.\n  This has to do with the luxury boxes. If you are lucky enough to be \nseated up in a luxury box, in comfort, looking down, the money you have \npaid or the money someone else has paid for that luxury box, for that \nseat, whatever you want to call it, that all goes to the home team. \nWell, this was a decision made apparently a few years ago by the NFL.\n  It did not take the owners and teams very long to figure this out. \nAnd so if you got extra money, if you got all the money from the luxury \nboxes, it put a premium on building more luxury boxes, in fact, put a \nlot of pressure on the teams to build these luxury boxes, because not \nonly, Mr. President, do the teams get all of the money instead of just \npart of the money----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Not only does all this money for the luxury boxes then go \nto the individual owner of the home team, but it also has the effect--I \nwill not take the time on the floor of the Senate today to explain all \nthe math of this--but it has the effect of driving up these salary caps \nbecause that salary cap is based on total gross revenue and based on \nformulas. Basically, it is 62 percent times the designated amount of \nrevenue.\n  And so if one team, let us say team A, has no luxury boxes, but team \nB builds luxury boxes, not only does team B get all the money for the \nluxury boxes, not split at all with team A, \n\n[[Page S17869]]\nwho they might be playing that weekend, but team B, by getting that \nluxury box money, drives up the salary cap, not just for them but for \neverybody. So team A has their costs go up. So it is almost like being \non a treadmill.\n  The NFL has created a system by which everybody has a real incentive \nto go out and build luxury boxes. What that means is they are either \ngoing to build them in the home coliseum or the home park, or they are \ngoing to make the incentive to move somewhere else.\n\n  So the NFL has created a situation with this structure that really \nputs a premium on movement, and I do not think it is in the best \ninterest of football. Again, it is something that the NFL should change \nand can change themselves, and I think it is a fair representation of \nCommissioner Tagliabue's testimony yesterday that he simply did not \ndisagree with this at all.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by stating that the thing that I have \nfound most interesting in the last several weeks in regard to the \ncontroversy surrounding the Cleveland Browns' reported move to \nBaltimore has not been the reaction of fans in Ohio--and that has been \nabsolutely unbelievable. People are up in arms. But we sort of expected \nthat. What I think is interesting is that people across this country, \nwho are sports fans, and who are not Browns fans, have looked at this \nand said this is not right, something is wrong, there is a problem. \nMaybe this move or attempt to move by the Browns to Baltimore is sort \nof, or should be, a wakeup signal to the NFL that something is \nabsolutely wrong.\n  Mr. President, the NFL has a nine-point criteria. I think they should \napply that nine-point criteria to determine if this move--I think they \nwould, if they applied the nine-point criteria, determine this move is \nnot right, does not fit the criteria, and should not take place, and is \nnot in the best interest of football.\n  I believe that the bill that Senator Glenn introduced, that I have \ncosponsored, today will help in this situation. It will help the NFL do \nwhat it should do anyway, and is one more step toward trying to rectify \na situation in professional football and other professional sports that \nis really very much out of hand and out of control.\n  I will be talking more about this on the floor in the weeks to come, \nMr. President. I thank the Chair and the Senate for the additional \ntime, and I yield back.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1440. A bill to amend the Social Security to increase the earnings \nlimit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17866-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17869-S17870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS LIMIT LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would increase the Social Security earnings limit--the amount that \nsenior citizens can earn before they start losing Social Security \nbenefits.\n  As my colleagues know, the earnings limit is currently $11,280, and \nit is increased each year for inflation. For seniors between the ages \nof 65 and 69, every $3 earned over that limit means a $1 reduction in \nSocial Security benefits.\n  It is almost hard to believe this issue is still around. I remember \nback in my first term in the Senate--in 1977--when I introduced similar \nlegislation. At the time, the earnings limit was $3,000, and I tried to \nincrease it to $6,000. I was prompted to do so in part because of a \nDelaware woman who came up to me at a meeting and told me that she was \nbreaking the law.\n  I wondered what crime could this sweet, frail, elderly woman be \nguilty of. And, she told me. She had a part-time job and was being paid \nin cash so that she would not have to report her income and thereby \nlose her Social Security benefits. She needed both to survive \nfinancially.\n  In the years since then, I have heard other stories--they are \npractically endless.\n  Imagine an elderly couple whose adult child develops some medical \nproblem. Like most parents, they want to help their child--they do not \nabandon their parental instincts and concern just because they have \nturned 65. But, to meet the costs of caring for their child, they need \nto go back to work--and as a result, they will lose some of their \nSocial Security benefits.\n  Or imagine the case--and it happens all too often--where the husband \ndies. And the wife, who he supported financially, now faces a dilemma. \nHer widow's Social Security benefits are not enough. She must get a \npart-time job to maintain a living. So, she goes to work, but loses \npart of her Social Security benefits.\n  Or imagine those senior citizens who just want to supplement their \nSocial Security income--so they do not become dependent on welfare or \non their own children, who are facing a financial squeeze of their own \nbetween their mortgages and putting their kids through college. Those \nseniors who want to ensure that they do not become dependent on others \nare penalized by having their Social Security benefits reduced.\n  Mr. President, these stories illustrate the perversity of a low \nSocial Security earnings limit. It discourages some seniors from \nworking, penalizes other seniors for working, and makes criminals of \nsome seniors who need both a paycheck and a Social Security check to \nsurvive. This is not right.\n  So why does this policy even exist? Well, believe it or not, at one \ntime, it had a very legitimate purpose.\n  In the midst of the Great Depression roughly 60 years ago, \nunemployment was rampant. And, the plain fact was, we wanted senior \ncitizens out of the work force so that there would be more jobs for \nyoung workers with young families. That is part of the reason why \nCongress created the Social Security earnings limit--to discourage \nseniors from working.\n  A legitimate rationale at the time. But not today. Today, \nunemployment stands at a low 5.5 percent. And, the American economy, \nwith a shrinking labor pool, is facing competition within an ever \nexpanding global marketplace.\n  So, just when we need experienced workers in the labor force, we are \nwasting the greatest source of experience--our senior citizens. Just \nwhen we should be encouraging seniors to stay in the work force, many \nelderly workers are better off earning less than earning more. These \nare seniors who wish to work--in some cases, must work--who would work \nhard, and who could add millions of dollars to our economy. But, many \nare not working because the Social Security earnings limit penalizes \nthem for doing so.\n  This is simply not fair to our seniors, and it is not good for this \ncountry. We should not penalize anyone for wanting to work and for \nwanting to supplement their income. And, we should not make criminals \nof those who do.\n  Now, unlike some of my colleagues, I do believe that some earnings \nlimit still has a place. Social Security is, after all, a retirement \nprogram, not a reward for becoming old. But, an earnings limit set at \n$11,280 simply has no rational basis whatsoever. And those it hurts are \ntoo often those who are already struggling.\n  I find it interesting that the effect of such a low earnings limit is \nthat working, middle-class seniors are penalized. They lose part of \ntheir Social Security benefits. But, the wealthy are treated \ndifferently. The elderly Donald Trumps and the elderly Ross Perots of \nthe country have far greater incomes than $11,280, but they get those \nincomes from investments and unearned income. Therefore, they do not \nface the reduction in Social Security benefits that the middle-class \nfaces.\n  This needs fixing. So, Mr. President, the legislation I am \nintroducing today would increase the Social Security earnings limit to \n$14,500 next year and then gradually increase it over the following 6 \nyears until the limit reaches $30,000 in the year 2002. In other words, \nseniors could earn up to $30,000 per year before their Social Security \nbenefits begin to be reduced.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate debated and failed to pass similar \nlegislation introduced by Senator McCain. I want to commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his dedication to this issue over the last several \nyears. And, I say to my colleagues that the bill I am introducing today \nis the same as the Senate considered--and unfortunately rejected--a few \nweeks ago, except in a couple of respects.\n  First, my bill would also apply the increase in the earnings limit to \nblind \n\n[[Page S17870]]\nrecipients of Social Security benefits. Currently, blind individuals \naged 55 and over qualify for Social Security disability benefits if \ntheir earnings are below the level of the retirement earnings limit. My \nproposal would retain this parallel treatment between the retired and \nthe blind.\n  The second major difference between my bill and the earlier McCain \nlegislation is that my bill does not include an offset. I believe we \nmust find a way to pay for this bill. But, it was clear that the vote \nto defeat an increase in the earnings limit earlier this month was \nbased in part on the proposed offset. So, my hope is that by not \nspecifying an offset now, we can work together in a bipartisan fashion \nto find a suitable way to pay for the costs of this proposal and \nincrease the Social Security earnings limit.\n  Mr. President, those senior citizens who want to work and those who \nmust work to make ends meet should be honored and commended, not \npenalized by the Social Security system. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17869-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 673, a bill to \nestablish a youth development grant program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Kassebaum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 704, a bill to \nestablish the Gambling Impact Study Commission.\n\n\n                                 S. 706\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 706, a bill to prohibit the \nimportation of goods produced abroad with child labor and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nKentucky [Mr. McConnell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 969, a bill to \nrequire that health plans provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay \nfor a mother and child following the birth of the child, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Levin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1228, a bill to impose \nsanctions on foreign persons exporting petroleum products, natural gas, \nor related technology to Iran.\n\n\n                                S. 1245\n\n  At the request of Mr. Ashcroft, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1245, a bill to amend the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to identify \nviolent and hard-core juvenile offenders and treat them as adults, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1271\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Heflin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1271, a bill to amend the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1271, supra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17870-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, last night the Senate passed the \nCharitable Giving Protection Act, which Senator Hutchison and I \noriginally introduced earlier this year. This legislation will help \ncharities use contributions effectively and ensure that these vital \norganizations can continue their good work. I commend Senator Hutchison \nfor her diligent efforts and thank all of my colleagues for their help \nin passing this legislation in the Senate.\n  Every day across this country, charitable organizations help millions \nof Americans. Whether its giving disadvantaged children meals or \nclothing, providing shelter to the homeless, or working to support the \neducational and medical needs of the less fortunate, charities help \nweave a stronger social fabric for our Nation.\n  Regrettably, the benevolent endeavors of charities have been \njeopardized by a lawsuit, Ozee versuse American Council on Gift \nAnnuities, currently before a Federal district court in Texas. That \nlawsuit, which has been certified as a class action against almost \n2,000 charities, asks that all money donated to charities through \ncharitable gift annuities be returned, along with double that amount in \ndamages. I have heard from a broad spectrum of charitable organizations \nin Connecticut and they fear that this lawsuit will undermine their \nwork.\n  Over the years, charities have used gift annuities as a means of \nmaking it easier for people to donate money. Generally, these \ntransactions work as follows: A person donates money or some other \nasset to a charity and receives a tax deduction. The charity then \ninvests the money and makes fixed, periodic payments to the donor. When \nthe donor dies, the remainder of the gift goes to the charity. These \narrangements help both donors and charities, and it was never the \nintent of Congress to unduly restrict their use.\n  In order to ensure that the lawsuit does not bankrupt charities and \nto facilitate the work of charities in the future, the Charitable \nGiving Protection Act clarifies Federal law. The legislation provides \nthat the activities of charities relating to charitable gift annuities \ndo not violate antitrust law. It also codifies certain exemptions that \nthe Securities Exchange Commission has recognized for charitable \norganizations that pool and invest donations.\n  However, none of these changes would make it easier for charities to \ncommit fraud. The legislation would not change the antifraud provisions \nin Federal securities law or affect Federal tax laws relating to fraud. \nPeople could still bring appropriate lawsuits against \n\n[[Page S17871]]\ncheats or swindlers attempting to disguise themselves as charities, or \ncharities acting fraudulently.\n  Mr. President, in recent years, charitable organizations have stepped \nforward and filled some of the gaps in the American safety net, gaps \nthat will widen if extreme Republican budget cuts are enacted. Although \ncharities will not be able to come up with the funds necessary to \nrepair the terrible damage these cuts will cause, charities will try to \nhelp. They always have in times of crisis. The Charitable Giving \nProtection Act will help them in that effort. Once again, I applaud \nSenator Hutchison's hard work on this legislation, and I thank all of \nmy Senate colleagues for helping to move it forward \nexpeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17870-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GERALD W. HEANEY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on the eve of his 50th wedding \nanniversary, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Judge Gerald W. \nHeaney, a distinguished jurist who is beginning his 30th year of \nservice on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Although \nJudge Heaney assumed senior status on December 31, 1988, he continues \nto handle an impressive workload, bringing to each case the same \nunyielding compassion, fairness, and sense of justice that has marked \nhis tenure on the bench since his appointment on December 1, 1966.\n  Gerald Heaney was born on January 29, 1918, in Goodhue, MN, a rural \ncommunity in the southeastern part of the State. In that productive \nfarming community, he learned the values of close family, honesty, and \nhard work: qualities that have distinguished his public service. Judge \nHeaney received his undergraduate education at the College of St. \nThomas and his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1941.\n  At the outbreak of World War II, Gerald Heaney enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy. Serving with the distinguished 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, his \nextraordinary bravery in the Battle of La Pointe du Hoc during the D-\nday landing at Normandy earned him the Silver Star. He was also \ndecorated with the Bronze Star and five battle stars before he was \nhonorably discharged with the rank of captain on January 18, 1946.\n  At the end of World War II, Judge Heaney married Eleanor Schmitt. Of \nhis wife, Judge Heaney recently said, ``I am fortunate to have married \nEleanor. She has been the love of my life and my friend, my companion. \nShe has brought stability to me, to our children, and to our \ngrandchildren.'' In December of this year, Gerald and Eleanor Heaney \ncelebrate their 50th wedding anniversary by renewing their wedding vows \nat the College of Saint Scholastic Chapel in Duluth, MN.\n  Judge Heaney began his legal career with the firm of Lewis, Hammer, \nHeaney, Weyl & Halverson. During his 20 years of private practice, \nGerald Heaney dedicated himself to serving the disadvantaged and those \nseeking equality. To cite one example of this dedication, Judge Heaney \nrepresented teachers in their successful fight to make Duluth the first \nschool district in Minnesota to adopt the same pay scale for both male \nand female teachers. While in private practice, Judge Heaney \ncontinually demonstrated his commitment to the improvement of the \nState's educational system. He worked actively with the Governor and \nState legislature to develop a State school aid formula, which remains \nin use today and continues to serve as a model for the rest of the \nNation. Judge Heaney also served on the board of regents of the \nUniversity of Minnesota, an institution to which he has devoted a \nlifetime of loyal service in recognition of its importance to the lives \nand welfare of Minnesota citizens.\n  In 1966, with the support of Senators Eugene McCarthy and Walter \nMondale, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, and congressional \nrepresentative John A. Blatnik, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed \nGerald Heaney to the Eighth Circuit of Appeals. Former Vice President \nWalter Mondale said of Judge Heaney: ``I have served many years in \npublic life and one of the best things I did was to support the \nnomination of Gerald W. Heaney to be a Circuit Judge for the Eighth \nCircuit.''\n  Since his appointment, Judge Heaney has authored over 2,000 judicial \nopinions in which he has demonstrated leadership in many different and \ncomplex areas of law including school desegregation, civil rights, \nemployment discrimination, Social Security disability cases, criminal \nlaw, labor relations, first amendment jurisprudence, and commercial \nlitigation. These opinions evidence Judge Heaney's guiding principle: \nAll persons--regardless of race, color, or creed--are entitled to equal \nprotection under the law. At the unveiling of his portrait at the \nFederal courthouse in St. Paul, MN, Judge Heaney commented on the \nchallenges facing our society and those in public service, ``It has \nbeen no simple task to preserve freedom, and it will not be simple in \nthe future. Every democracy is fragile. It needs our constant and \nunwavering support. This is the task to which we must all rededicate \nourselves.''\n  Judge Heaney continues to leave his mark on the landscape of the law \nin this country. As his colleague, Judge Donald P. Lay, former chief \njudge of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, has said,\n\n       In my judgment he is the most outstanding judge ever to \n     serve, not only on the Eighth Circuit but throughout the \n     United States, in the last 25 years. He is the most well-\n     prepared judge in the circuit. His industry and dedication to \n     law are unparalleled. His compassion and understanding of \n     human problems is unique. He is a scholar and true gentleman \n     in all respects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17871-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17871-S17872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE ODDS AREN'T WORTH IT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, during the November elections, \nvoters in 19 communities from seven States were asked to voice their \nopinion on the expansion of gambling. Many of these initiatives pitted \ngrassroots efforts and coalitions against well-financed gambling \ninterests. Election results supported more gambling in only 4 of the 19 \ncommunities.\n  It is difficult to determine whether this represents a shift in \npublic opinion. However, it is clear that in order to make informed \ndecisions at the ballot box, voters need objective and authoritative \ninformation. Conflicting claims remain unresolved. Nagging questions \nlinger.\n  A recent editorial from the Boston Globe, ``The Odds Aren't Worth \nIt,'' clearly describes the need for a national study. I as that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n     [From the Boston Globe, Saturday, City Edition, Nov. 25, 1995]\n\n                        The Odds Aren't Worth It\n\n       Gambling tempts high-rolling risk-takers, it tempts the \n     luckless with little to lose, and it tempts politicians. \n     Since Atlantic City mortgaged Boardwalk to the chance \n     industry 18 years ago, legalized gambling has expanded with \n     amazing speed. Where once there were only two states that \n     allowed or sponsored gambling, now there are only two--Utah \n     and Hawaii--that don't.\n       In the past few weeks, however, what had seemed an \n     inexorable acceleration has suddenly slowed to a trickle as \n     voters and public officials across the country have fastened \n     on gambling's dubious benefits and hidden costs.\n       Last week the Connecticut Senate rejected Gov. June \n     Rowland's plans for a mammoth casino in Bridgeport. What had \n     seemed a done deal was undone. In Maryland, a study \n     commission recommended against increased gambling there, and \n     most politicians agreed. On election day this month, voters \n     in Washington state and Jefferson City, Mo., killed proposals \n     to expand gambling, and voters in three Massachusetts \n     communities rejected casinos; only New Bedford voted yes.\n       Now Congress is considering proposals to set up a national \n     study commission that would examine the history of legalized \n     gambling, explore the tradeoffs and provide credible data on \n     which states and municipalities could make their own choices. \n     The chief sponsors are Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, a \n     Democrat, and Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, a Republican. \n     President Clinton and Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, a \n     Republican seeking to challenge Clinton, both support it. \n     Wolf believes that the commission will be approved, possibly \n     before Christmas.\n       It should be. What is needed most urgently is a sober study \n     that will sort out the conflicting claims--not only the moral \n     arguments but also the actual economic and social effects.\n       Clearly, many people like to gamble. In Mississippi, which \n     has had a no-limits attitude since 1992, a gaming publication \n     estimated that $29.7 billion was wagered in 1994--an amazing \n     $2.1 billion more than the state's total taxable retail \n     sales. The phenomenal growth of the Foxwoods casino in \n     Connecticut hints at the demand that might be tapped.\n       Yet what are the economics of gambling? It is an industry \n     that creates no wealth but \n\n[[Page S17872]]\n     only redistributes it--mostly from the poor to the rich, and often the \n     rich are not even local people. A good study would provide \n     the details.\n       But the signs are obvious. In the subway, and advertisement \n     for the lottery portrays a pastel rainbow with a pot of gold \n     at the end. Right next to it is a public service announcement \n     describing how to apply for food stamps. The striking thing \n     is that the two messages are addressed to the same audience: \n     People who can't even afford to buy their own food without \n     government help are encouraged by the government to throw \n     what little they do have at a mirage.\n       Lotteries may turn out to be the most regressive form of \n     state gambling. One of the few arguments for them other than \n     the revenue they raise is that they closely mimic the illegal \n     numbers games that have thrived in many communities, \n     therefore drawing money away from organized crime.\n       Casinos raise additional concerns. Successful ones do \n     provide jobs, and some older cities have looked to casinos as \n     potential saviors. New Bedford is as good an example as any. \n     With textiles and other industries gone and fishing on the \n     wane, people in New Bedford are desperate for help. They \n     voted nearly 3-1 for a casino this month. And they argue that \n     half the cars in the Foxwoods lot are from Massachusetts \n     anyway, so the state is exporting the gambling dollar \n     needlessly.\n       Yet other casino towns have found not only that crime and \n     vice rise rapidly with gambling but that the net effect on \n     the economy is not salutary. Local restaurants and other \n     retail businesses suffer; the problem of addiction to \n     gambling, including among young people, grows; and in many \n     places population drops. Also, the casino sometimes drives \n     out better options. In Bridgeport, for instance, city \n     officials said last week they would dust off a waterfront \n     development plan--one that might provide stronger economic \n     stimulation in the long run than gambling. The plan had been \n     sidetracked by the casino proposal.\n       A solid study would give substance to all these questions.\n       Those selling New Bedford on a casino may be no different \n     from the hucksters touting the pot of gold at the end of the \n     pastel rainbow. What provides the spice, as with all \n     gambling, is the fact that someone, sometime, actually wins \n     the gold. But many cities and states have found the odds are \n     no better for them than for the gamblers whose pockets they \n     empty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17871-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1438\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Madam President, I wish to say briefly that I have \njust heard the majority leader, Senator Dole, and Senator McCain state \nthat they would be introducing a resolution--I am sure a bipartisan \nresolution--to support the President's efforts to send troops to \nBosnia.\n  Madam President, there are no two people I know in the Senate that I \nrespect more, and certainly no two people in the Senate who have given \nmore in the military service of our country than Senator McCain and \nSenator Dole. I respect them, and I know that they are coming to this \ndecision in a way that is very thoughtful and statesmanlike.\n  I am very sad that this is going to happen because I disagree totally \nwith the conclusions they have reached. I think every Member is going \nto have to really search his or her conscience to decide what is the \nresponsibility of a Senator or a Member of Congress in this type of \naction. I know all of us are going to vote our conscience. I do not \nthink anyone will come to their conclusion based on anything except \nwhat they think is right.\n  I am sure debate will be heated, but I think it is very important \nthat we have an alternative to the resolution introduced by the \nmajority leader because many of us feel that this is the wrong decision \nand that for us to exercise our responsibility as Members of the \nSenate, we must speak out against deploying troops to Bosnia. So there \nwill be an alternative and I hope we will be able to vote on a clear \nalternative, and that is a resolution to disapprove this deployment of \nour troops.\n  We will go into debate more in the next week, and I do appreciate the \nfact that we are going to have the opportunity next week, rather than \nsome later time after it is too late to try to have an impact on the \nPresident's decision.\n  I have read the Constitution. It is very clear to me that the \nFounders of our country were specific in not giving the war powers to \nthe President alone.\n  In fact, in The Federalist Papers, both Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton \nspecifically said this is not a monarchy, therefore, the President \nalone should not be able to wage war. So the question becomes, what is \na war? Are we sending our troops into a hostile situation in which they \nwill be in harm's way? And does that mean that they are in a war?\n  I believe sending troops into a situation in which we believe there \nis a good chance for fatalities must be done by the President and \nCongress together, not by the President alone. I think it is most \nimportant, and I think it was part of the balance of powers, that the \nfounders of our country were very careful to put in our Constitution \nthat this kind of decision not be made by one person.\n  I am very concerned that we are also setting a precedent for our \ntroops to be deployed on the ground in border conflicts, in ethnic \nconflicts, in civil wars that were never contemplated when we signed on \nto in the NATO Treaty. Nowhere in the NATO Treaty does it say \n\n[[Page S17873]]\nthat we should be required to go into a country that is not a NATO \ncountry, a country which has not been invaded by a hostile force, a \ncountry which is, in fact, in a civil war.\n  So, Madam President, the debate will come. And people will be very \nemotional about it. I am very emotional about it. I want to take my \nresponsibility as a Member of the U.S. Senate, as a person given that \nresponsibility by the voters of my State with obligations that are \nconstitutional, to try to make sure that not only do our young men and \nwomen in the armed services have everything that we can give them when \nthey chose to give their lives to protect our freedom, but that they \nalso have the leadership that has the judgment to know that only when \nit is a U.S. security interest at stake is it worth the risk of their \nlives. And, Madam President, I hope we can make the case that that is \nnot the situation in Bosnia.\n  I want to help the Bosnian people. We have done our part. We have \nshouldered about 60 or 70 percent of the cost of this effort so far. We \nhave been there for the parties to come together. We have been a \ncatalyst for the peace agreement. And I give the President credit for \nthat. He deserves credit for bringing the people to the peace table and \nfor hammering out this peace agreement.\n  But I think it is most important that we have many options to help \nthe people of Bosnia. I do not think United States troops on the ground \nare among the best things that we can do for the Bosnian people, not \nfor NATO, and not for America. It is not in our best interest to send \nground troops to Bosnia. The President of the United States has \nunfortunately allowed our allies and others in the world to somehow \nargue that the only way we can show our commitment to peace is to have \nground troops.\n  I think there are many other ways we can support this peace \nagreement. We can continue to provide air support. We can continue to \nplay a strategic role. We are giving money now, and we will continue to \ngive money. We can provide intelligence support for them, which we have \nbeen doing, and which we can do. We can arm and train the Moslems \nwithout being part of this peacekeeping force. In fact, I think that \nwould be a far better policy. So, many options are there for us to help \nthe Bosnian people. But placing American troops in harm's way is not an \noption that I think is right, not for America, not for NATO, and not \nfor the people of Bosnia.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17872-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17873-S17874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think what has happened today, in my \nown view, as tragic as it might be, is refreshing to some of the \nAmerican people, the people who feel this is a partisan place up here, \nwhere there is nothing but partisan politics, that the Republicans \nstand for something and the Democrats stand for something. But what we \nwitnessed a short while ago should defuse that because we now have the \nmajority leader of the United States Senate supporting the President in \nhis effort in sending American troops into Bosnia on the ground.\n  I listened briefly to the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, and \nI concur in her remarks. There certainly are no two people I have \nhigher regard for, in terms of their war record and patriotism, than \nthe Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and the Senator from Kansas, \nthe majority leader, Senator Dole. However, I think there is an honest \ndifference of opinion here.\n  I think what the President has been attempting to do seems to be \nworking. But what the President has been doing is staying out of the \nfray until troops can be deployed long enough and far enough into \nBosnia that it puts us in the position of where we are going to have to \nsupport the effort because we are supporting the troops. I do not buy \nthat.\n  I think you can support the troops--and I will always support the \nAmerican troops, wherever they are, anywhere in the world. But if we \nhave the option right now of stopping the deployment of troops into \nBosnia, it is our moral responsibility to do that. And I believe that \noption is still there.\n  I said this morning on this floor that there are not going to be any \nfree rides on this one. We are going to have a vote, not a vote on a \nsoft resolution saying, well, we oppose the effort but we support the \ntroops, we are going to have a vote on whether or not we send our \ntroops into Bosnia.\n  The environment in Bosnia is not one the likes of which we have seen \nin any of the wars that we have been involved in because we have always \nbeen able to identify the enemy. You cannot identify the enemy. Sure, \nwe have chosen sides. We have been supplying the Croatians and the \nBosnian Moslems against the Serbs now for quite some time. I think \nperhaps that was not the right thing to do, but nonetheless we have \ntaken sides. We have taken sides through our air attacks.\n  Now it looks as if we are going to deploy troops over there to take \nsides. But who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? In this case \nwe do not know. You might say, well, this year--any snapshot in history \nwould give you a different answer to that question. There was a time \nwhen clearly the Croatians would have been the bad guys and a time when \nclearly the Serbs would have been the bad guys. But here we have more \nthan just three major factions. We have many, many elements. We have \nrogue elements. And some of these elements are Serb elements, some are \nMoslem elements, such as the Black Swans. That is a rogue element. \nNonetheless, they are there.\n  We are sending troops into an environment where only in this \nmorning's newspaper we see a quote from the guy who is working directly \nfor the general with whom I have spoken in the very sector where we are \nproposing to send our troops, General Haukland from Norway, where they \nsay that there are literally millions of mines all throughout that \narea--millions. Not 10, not 100, not 1,000--millions of mines of all \nsizes, all shapes. And we do not know where they are. They are now in a \nposition where, even though they have been going centimeter by \ncentimeter trying to defuse these mines, we are now in a position where \nthe winter is setting in, the ground is frozen, the snows are coming, \nand there is not any way in the world that we are going to be able to \nprotect our troops that are going over there from stepping on these \nmines.\n  Remember, just a short while ago we were faced with a similar \nsituation down in Nicaragua. And what were most of the losses? They \nwere from mines. And the amputees were the result of what was \nhappening.\n  Now, that is what we are faced with again. Only in today's newspaper, \nthis is happening right now. We have already sent troops over there. I \nknow that the President is hiding out in Europe. He is going to stay \nthere until we have more troops. Then he will come back and say, ``Now \nyou have to go with me because we have to protect our troops that are \nover there.''\n  Madam President, our troops are not there yet. We only have a few \nthere. But a lot are on their way. I went to the training area in \nGermany of the 1st Armored Division. I know they are training them to \ngo. They are going to go up through Hungary and then come down south \nthrough the Posavina corridor and into the Tuzla area.\n  When you look at that area, there has never been an area anywhere in \nthe world that is so conducive to guerrilla warfare. There has never \nbeen an area in the world that has more guerrillas in it that are not \nidentifiable. We have identified nine rogue elements that are there \nthat are not even related in any way to anyone who was around the table \nin Dayton, OH.\n  So, Madam President, I just wanted to be sure that it is crystal \nclear that I do not stand alone. There are many others who feel just as \nstrongly as I do that we are going to do everything we can to stop this \nmass deployment of troops into Bosnia. It was a bad idea 2\\1/2\\ years \nago when the President first started talking about it, when he took \nsides and started airdrops. It was a bad idea 1\\1/2\\ years ago when the \nPresident decided he was going to have airstrikes. And it is a bad idea \ntoday. And I will continue to do anything within \n\n[[Page S17874]]\nmy power to stop the deployment of troops into Bosnia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first I wish to compliment my friend \nand colleague Senator Inhofe for his statement on Bosnia. I will have a \nstatement soon on that subject. But I compliment him, one, for his \ncourage and conviction, and also the fact he went through the trouble \nof going to Bosnia recently, and I think his observations are very \ncorrect. I think we are in the process of getting bogged down in a \nquagmire.\n  So I compliment him for that. Again, I will add to my remarks at a \nlater time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17873-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DR. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to make a couple of remarks \nconcerning a very sad event that happened this week, and that was the \ndeath of our friend, Richard Halverson, the Chaplain of the Senate for \nthe last 14 years.\n  I first want to express my condolences to Chaplain Halverson's \nfamily--his wife, Doris, his son, Chris and daughter-in-law Maura, his \nson, Steve and daughter-in-law Paula, and his daughter, Debbie and son-\nin-law Fred, and his nine grandchildren.\n  Chaplain Halverson was a friend, not only to myself but to all \nSenators as well the Senate staff and the entire Senate family. He \ncertainly was a pastor of exceptional repute, a person who has been \ndefined by many as ``a man of God,'' as a person who certainly loved \nthe Lord and showed that love by his words and by his actions. It was \nevident when he would sit in his chair in the Senate Chamber and greet \npeople on a daily basis. This love for people was not reserved for \nSenators only, but it was generously given to people who sweep the \nfloors or those who work in the restaurant or the elevator operators. \nChaplain Halverson was a friend, and he will certainly be missed.\n  He is loved by many thousands from his service in the pulpit and for \nhis 14 years as Chaplain of the Senate. I really consider it a blessing \nto have known him, to have worked with him, to have shared many good \ntimes with him. To have been with him with families in prayer. To have \nworked along side him with the National Prayer Breakfast, in which he \nhad been instrumental. He has left a very valuable mark on our lives.\n  A friend of mine from Oklahoma once commented to me about Dr. \nHalverson. He asked me if I knew him. I asked, ``Why?''\n  He said, ``I will tell you, I've had the pleasure of knowing him for \nyears,'' and my friend paid him the highest compliment I ever heard \npaid anyone. He said Chaplain Halverson was the most Christ-like man he \nhad ever known. I think that was an appropriate definition for a \nwonderful servant of God who also served this body.\n  So we extend our sincerest condolences to the Halverson family and we \nwant them to know we love Chaplain Halverson and that our thoughts and \nprayers are with them and will continue to be.\n  I might mention to the Senate that it is our intention--and I am \nworking with Chaplain Ogilvie on this--to have a memorial service for \nDr. Halverson a week from Tuesday, at approximately 11:30 a.m. Once the \narrangements have been finalized, I will make a formal announcement to \nmy colleagues early next week.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/senate-section/article/S17874-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1441\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
