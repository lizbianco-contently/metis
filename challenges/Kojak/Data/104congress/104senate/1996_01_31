Madam President, tomorrow, or possibly Friday, we will be \nvoting on cloture motions dealing with the Farm Program and a variety \nof bills dealing with the Farm Program.\n  Within the context of the entire Farm Program, there are a lot of \nsubprograms, and one that I wish to talk about is the Sugar Program. \nThe Sugar Program in this country has proceeded since the early 1980's \nto be a program of inordinate subsidy for a few small farmers--for a \nfew farmers; they are not small farmers--at the expense of the \nconsumers of this country.\n  Last year, it was estimated that the Sugar Program cost the consumers \nof this country approximately $1.4 billion. It has cost the consumers \nof this country approximately $10 billion over the last decade. That is \nbecause we have in this country a system in the Sugar Program where we \nartificially inflate the cost of sugar to benefit a few growers of \nsugarcane and some sugar beets, but primarily in this instance it is \nbenefiting sugarcane growers.\n  This makes no sense. This program is appropriately tied to sugar, I \nguess, because the last vestiges of Marxism in the world of any \nsignificance is the nation of Cuba, which always had a sugar-based \neconomy.\n  Now, you might argue, well, China is still a Marxist nation. \nActually, China has become quite capitalistic. Cuba is the only \ncountry, certainly in the Western Hemisphere, it is the only \ndictatorship in the Western Hemisphere, in the world that still \npractices theoretically pure Marxism, Marxism being a system where \nessentially the State sets the price and the production of all \ncommodities within the community. And, of course, the Cuban economy is \nalways based on sugar. So maybe that is why we as a nation have for \nsome reason decided in our sugar industry we are going to emulate Cuba \nbecause that is essentially what we do. We have in the Farm Program \nwhich we have designed in this country essentially a system of top-down \nmarket controls, \n\n[[Page S570]]\nproduction controls which create, at best, an economic structure which \nemulates what used to be the East European countries and at worst an \neconomic structure which basically tracks the philosophy of social \neconomics as designed by Karl Marx, because essentially what it does is \nsay that the Government will set the price, the Government will set the \nproduction levels, not necessarily for the purposes of benefiting the \nconsumer but for the purposes of benefiting the producer.\n\n  We set up a structure here where the fact that sugar on the open \nmarket can be bought for 10 cents a pound has no impact on the price of \nsugar in the United States. Can you imagine that? The United States, \nthe center of capitalism in the world, a market that all of the rest of \nthe world looked to when other nations were trying to design their \neconomies, has put in place in our Sugar Program a structure which is \nessentially a carbon copy of what they did in Eastern Europe, what they \nnow do in Cuba, or still do in Cuba, in what we basically call a \nSocialist form of economics.\n  Why do we do this? Why do we have a system which penalizes our \nconsumers to the tune of $1.4 billion, which does not allow any \ncompetition for the price of sugar in the marketplace, which \narbitrarily sets the cost of sugar, and which rewards a few growers of \nsugarcane specifically? Seventeen growers get 42 percent of the benefit \nin the sugarcane industry--17 growers get 42 percent of the benefit. In \nfact, one grower gets a benefit that is estimated to be almost $68 \nmillion a year. Why do we structure a system like this? Well, at the \nrisk of using a pun, it is raw power, raw political power.\n  The fact that the sugarcane, sugar producers lobby is so strong in \nthe Congress of the United States, it has been able to maintain this \ntotally unjustifiable system. How ironic it is that when the Republican \nParty, after 40 years, finally gets control over the Congress of the \nUnited States, we continue to allow this sort of antimarket system to \nflourish, to grow, and to abuse the consumers of this country.\n  How ironic it is that this President--and I cannot fault him \nindividually because the fault lies on both sides of the aisle on this \none--but this President who has made such a large issue of protecting \nconsumers in many other areas of his administration and has made this \nhis cause celebre, allows a program which every year takes $1.4 billion \nout of the pockets of consumers and artificially transfers it to a \nnonproductive sector of our economy--I am not sure it is unproductive--\nbut a sector of our economy that does not want to compete. Why should \nnot we have a sugar program which is willing to compete?\n  There are some other side effects that also we ought to be concerned \nabout besides the fact that we are basically taking the consumers of \nthis country for a ride for the benefit of a few individual growers. \nThere are some other issues we ought to be concerned about.\n  There is the issue of environmental protection, the fact that as a \nresult of having this artificially high-priced sugar, we have seen a \nhuge amount of land in southern Florida converted to cane growing which \nland was the original watershed of the Everglades. It is not clear \nreally what would be a better use of this land. I have to admit that \nthe jury may still be out on that.\n  But before the facts are known, the Everglades are under a tremendous \neffect, and the fact, first, that the water is not flowing in its \noriginal form--and there is the belief that the sugarcane activity is \npart of it--and, second, sugarcane activity is expanded artificially as \na result of this.\n  Another concern we should have is the effect it is having on our \nneighbors in the Caribbean. We just invaded Haiti because we felt that \nit was in economic and political chaos. One of the reasons that our \nneighbors in the Caribbean are in economic chaos is because we do not \nallow them to participate in competition with us. We have closed our \nmarkets to one of their primary goods--sugar. We live in fear, I guess, \nas a nation, that we cannot compete with Haiti.\n  My goodness, how absurd. Obviously, with the technologies we have and \nthe ability we have of growing products in this country, we can compete \nwith our Caribbean neighbors. We would find, I suspect, that if we were \nto open our markets that sugar beets in many parts of this country \nwould remain very viable and very competitive, sugarcane in parts of \nthis country would remain very viable and very competitive, and we \nwould have also the added benefit of allowing some of our Caribbean \nneighbors to maybe increase their standard of living a little bit by \nbeing able to sell us a little bit of their primary product.\n\n  Maybe we would not have to go around invading them. We could save the \ndollars we spend on national defense in places like Haiti, and the \ndollars we spend on economic and political development in other regions \nof the Caribbean because we would have to help them out through what is \nknown as the old-fashioned way, by letting them compete in the \nmarketplace with us.\n  So tomorrow we take up these farm bills, and there will be an attempt \nto shut off debate. One of the outcomes of shutting off debate and \npassage of these farm bills, or at least down the line in the farm bill \nwould be a 7-year extension of the outrage called the Sugar Program. \nThat would be a rather bitter pill for the American consumers. That is \nnot a sweet deal for American consumers. It may be a sweet deal to get \na 7-year extension of this program for some of the growers, but it \ncertainly would mean that under the present calculations that would be \nabout another $10 billion of tax, because that is essentially what it \nis to American consumers.\n  So I strongly oppose the attempt to do this. And along with the \nSenator from Nevada, who has joined me on this, Senator Reid, we will \ndo all we can, I believe, to try to avoid allowing the consumers of \nthis country to be once again pilfered by this program. As a result, I \nwill attempt to oppose cloture. I hope that others who are concerned \nabout the consumers of this country, about the environment of this \ncountry, and about our neighbors in Central and Latin America, would \nalso join me in opposing cloture.\n  Because it is not right. It is not right that a few folks because of \ntheir political influence and strength should be able to keep in place \na program which should have died when the Berlin Wall fell. The fact \nis, it is very ironic and unfortunate that as a nation we continue to \npromote this concept that competition should not be allowed in the \nproduction of sugar.\n  It is antithetical to all the Republican Party stands for. It is time \nto put an end to it.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair for the time to speak. I yield \nback such time as I may not have used, and I make the point of order \nthat a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I assume that we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S569-5", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S570-S571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNPRECEDENTED FLOOD OF SUBSIDIZED CANADIAN LUMBER\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, in morning business today, let me make \nseveral comments on an issue that is very important to this country. It \nis kind of a quiet issue that has not been prominent in the headlines \nof the Washington Post or the Washington Times; but certainly in my \nState and every timber-producing State of the Nation, it has made a \ngood many headlines over the course of the last year or 16 months. And \nthat is the unprecedented flood of subsidized Canadian lumber flowing \ninto the continental United States and into the markets of the 48 lower \nStates.\n  Normally, Canada is a supplier to our market, and we need their \ntimber to round out the needs of the housing industry of our country \nand the home building industry. But to meet that need and still keep \nAmerica's work force in the forest products industry employed, Canada's \npercentage participation in our market normally is somewhere in the \nhigh 20's or low 30's.\n  In January, this month that is now today concluding, they reached an \nall-\n\n[[Page S571]]\ntime high of about 37 percent of total market share. As a result of \nthat, we now see in this country about 29,000 men and women who are \nunemployed as a direct result of a major dumping effort--let me repeat, \nas a direct result of a major dumping effort--on the part of the \nCanadian forest products industry into our market.\n  In my State of Idaho, just in the last few days, we have had \nannouncements of another 200 men and women laid off simply because the \nprice of lumber, as a result of this huge volume of subsidized lumber \npouring in from Canada, is so low that mills cannot operate.\n  Ceda-Pine Veneer north of Sandpoint, ID; Crown Pacific in Bonners \nFerry, ID; and two Louisiana Pacific plants in Chilco and Sandpoint \nhave just announced layoffs or have shut down, and the story goes on \nand on, as is true across Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and the Southeast, \nas a result of what has happened with Canadian lumber imports.\n  This administration, to their credit a good many months ago became \naggressively engaged with the forest products industry in negotiating \nwith Canada in an effort to resolve this issue.\n  When I say that, it is about the only good thing I am going to say, \nbecause as we entered into those negotiations the forest products \nindustry was told by our United States Trade Representative nearly 10 \nmonths ago that within 6 months, if the Canadians did not negotiate in \ngood faith successfully, this administration would take action, and \nthat action would be a temporary duty imposed until such time as a \ncountervailing duty suit would be charged or the Canadians would come \nto the table with some form of a legitimate agreement to negotiate the \ndifferences between the two countries.\n  That did not occur from the Canadians, and, as a result, finally this \nadministration did say, ``We will have to bring a countervailing duty \nsuit, and move toward a temporary duty.''\n  In late November of this year, the Canadians finally did bring some \nproposed agreements for us--the industry and our United States Trade \nRepresentative--to look at to see whether they would meet the criteria \nthat we were trying to advance, which was a level playing field, \nrecognizing the legitimate share of the market that the Canadians could \nhave without destroying our industry.\n  From that point, myself, Senator Baucus, and a good many others have \nasked the United States Trade Representative to become much more \naggressive in insisting that this problem be solved now. It was in \nDecember, just before we recessed for Christmas, that Mickey Kantor did \ncome to the Hill and sat down with myself, Senator Baucus, five or six \nother Senators from timber-producing States, and a good many \nRepresentatives from the House to talk about where we were in this \nnegotiation.\n  At that time, Mickey Kantor said to us, and it was conveyed to the \nCanadians, that if no agreements were reached through the current \nnegotiation, that on January 31, 1996, he would impose a temporary duty \nagainst the Canadians, and we would then move to do a variety of other \nthings, including reform NAFTA's chapter 19, to consider what is called \nsuspension of liquidation on Canadian imports into this country, and do \na variety of other things that would bring about some permanency and \nstability to this problem.\n  Madam President, today is January 31. Canadians are now still \nnegotiating with our trade ambassador, and I do not want to say nothing \nwill be resolved, but I do want to say to our trade ambassador: If \nnothing is resolved by the end of the day, it is absolutely imperative \nfor this country's credibility and for this administration's \ncredibility with Canada and with the industries and the work forces \ninvolved that we move. And that tomorrow I would expect to hear from \nour United States Trade Representative an announcement of an imposed \ntemporary duty against the subsidized lumber coming out of Canada while \nthese other measures are forthcoming; that the United States lumber \nindustry would probably move to file a countervailing duty case, and \nthat case would go forward, but would literally take months and \npotentially a year.\n  But what is important here and what this administration must face is \nthat it is now time to make a decision, and they must make that \ndecision. If they fail to, if they bend in any form to the Canadians, \nthey will send the kind of message that I believe has been sent for the \nlast 6 months: We just keep on talking.\n  As we keep on talking, mills are closing down in my State. As I \nmentioned, 29,000 jobs in this country are now in suspension, and men \nand women are not working as a direct result of this phenomenal flood \nof Canadian lumber coming into the market.\n  It is important that this administration recognizes the high level of \nimportance of the decision that they are about to make today, which is \nif the Canadians still are only talking--and, oh, are they good at \ntalking--that the talking is over; that it is time for the temporary \nduty to level this playing field to send a very clear message to the \nCanadians that we mean business; that while they have a right based on \nneed and supply, on the Canadian Free-Trade Agreement, and on the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement to have access to our market, they \nabsolutely do not have the right to intentionally dump, and we know \nthat is what they are doing at this time. They have reached out to grab \na very large share of the U.S. market, as much as 10 percent more than \nthey have ever held.\n\n  Stocks of Canadian lumber are sitting in lumberyards across this \ncountry, and they are even financing it to sit there and saying, ``You \nkeep it until you sell it and then you pay us.''\n  I call that an aggressive antitrade effort. It is a dumping process \nand the Canadians know it. It is time they stop it, and the only way \nthey will is when we speak directly and act decisively to solve this \nproblem.\n  Back in the early eighties, they played this game on us, and it was \nat that time in the Reagan administration that a duty was imposed and \nthousands of people went back to work in my State almost overnight as \nthe markets rapidly improved. Of course, that also happened in other \ntimber-producing States across the Nation.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the same thing can happen in the next month \nif this administration will act. If it does not act, I say to our trade \nambassador today, ``What are you going to say to the nearly 30,000 men \nand women that are without a job today in the timber industry simply \nbecause of the aggressive dumping action on the part of the \nCanadians?'' ``What are you going to say, Mr. Ambassador, and, more \nimportant, what are you going to say, Mr. President, about the fairness \nand equity you talk about, about the jobs you talk about creating, \nwhile you, by your failure to act, may well be destroying jobs?\"\n  In the end, when you destroy the jobs, you destroy the mills and the \ninfrastructure that has been an extremely important part of the forest \nproducts industry of our country. As those people stand in unemployment \nlines, many of the mills are near bankruptcy today because most of them \nhave operated in the red for well over a year now. It is time that \nstopped and that we bring fairness back to the marketplace. That can be \ndone by a single act by a trade ambassador and a President. They know \nthey can do it. We asked them to do it, and we hope it will be done \ntomorrow if the Canadians fail to come to an agreement today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nmy predecessors, Ralph W. Yarborough of Austin, who died last weekend.\n  Ralph Yarborough was reared in Chandler, TX, attended West Point and \nwhat we know as Sam Houston State University. He worked as a teacher, a \ntrade emissary, a National Guardsman, a lawyer, an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, a judge, an Army officer in World War II, a writer, and a U.S. \nSenator. In the Army, he served on the staff of Gen. George Patton. He \nwas among only three southern Senators to support the 1965 Voting \nRights Act and was a key supporter of the National Cancer Act.\n  Senator Yarborough and I share a common background. We have deep \n\n[[Page S572]]\n  east Texas roots. We attended the University of Texas law school. We \nboth held this seat in the U.S. Senate, which both of us reached \nthrough a special election in the spring after the resignation of a \nSenator in January. Like me, he reached this Chamber less than 2 years \nbefore the term was up, and probably felt, as I did, envy for Members \nof the other body, who have a full 2 years between campaigns.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of all the citizens of Texas, I offer to \nMrs. Yarborough, his widow, the rest of the Yarborough family, and his \nmany friends, our deepest condolences. May he rest in peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, from time to time, in the mail we get a \nletter, an observation, or a communication from a constituent that we \nthink is particularly on target. I would like to share that a little \nbit this morning. It has to do with consistency in leadership and with \nwhere we are going in this country. The President has talked in the \nlast couple of days about the consistency of his administration. Of \ncourse, I think there is great question about that. If we are to move \nforward to make the changes that most of us want to make, that I think \nmost Americans want to make, we have to have some consistency in \npolicy.\n\n  The President came to Washington based on a campaign of change, based \non a promise of change, based on a promise of a new Democrat. He said \nmore recently that the era of big government is over. The fact is that \nthere has not been much consistency. The fact is that there was a great \ndeal of talk about reforming of welfare which is certainly high on the \nagenda of most people. Most people want to continue to be able to help \npeople who need help, but in a program that helps people back into a \nposition to help themselves. Yet this Senate passed a bill on welfare, \nI think 85 positive votes, that was vetoed by the President who says he \nwanted to change welfare as we know it.\n  The balanced budget--I suspect the prime issue of this entire \ncongressional session--it took four budgets to come up with a balanced \nbudget, despite the President saying he was for a balanced budget when \nhe ran, and would do it in 5 years. It took four budgets to do it in 7 \nyears, and then, frankly, not a real budget.\n  Most everyone who studies the issue knows that if you are going to \nchange the financial direction that this country has taken, if you want \nto be responsible for finances, that there has to be a significant \nchange in the budget, that you cannot tinker around the edges.\n  The President and his staff, and Mr. Panetta, whom I worked with in \nthe House, and I always thought was responsible--almost as if you push \na button, we protect Medicaid, protect the environment, have an \ninvestment in education. The fact is that over a period of several \nyears you cannot do that; there is no money to do that unless you do \nsomething about entitlements. That is a fact.\n  So to say we are going to balance the budget and we are going to \nprotect Medicare, Medicaid, the environment, invest in education, it is \nimpossible to do, unless, of course, you raise taxes considerably.\n  Mr. President, these are the things raised about consistency. I want \nto read the letter from Linda Russell of Rawlins, WY.\n\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I sent you a wire to just get the \n     budget balanced and quit ``posturing'' and playing politics.\n       You wrote a very nice letter back--but I am very concerned \n     that you don't understand what the people of this USA want \n     and need. You say we must ``maintain our values--protecting \n     Medicare, Medicaid, and the environment''. Certainly no one \n     would disagree that these are excellent GOALS--but they are \n     NOT our base VALUES. Our base values would be fiscal \n     responsibility, keeping a military strength sufficient to \n     protect us, and staying out of the faces of people who are \n     perfectly capable of handling the GOALS you mention far \n     better than the Washington DC political establishment.\n       I attended the White House Conference on Small Business and \n     heard you address the group on how you felt regulations \n     should be reduced and the budget balanced and the tax burden \n     lessened. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SUPPORT OF THOSE IDEAS since \n     that meeting??\n       May I respectfully suggest that you let the power revert to \n     the people by going with the block grants so that we can take \n     care of our neighbors with our tax money and not waste 90% of \n     it paying a huge bureaucracy in ``DC'' to tell us how to do \n     it. TRUST US--we are neither stupid nor insensitive. If you \n     have any wish at all to be reelected, it would be well to \n     give us the respect we are due--and stop taking more and more \n     money via taxes to support some liberal agenda.\n       Mr. President--listen again to your own inaugural address \n     to the nation, which I thought very impressive--and WALK YOUR \n     TALK??\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Linda Russell,\n                                                      Rawlins, WY.\n\n  Mr. President, I think her expression ``and walk your talk'' is an \nexpression from someone who represents a good deal of the thought in my \nState in Wyoming. I think many of us believe that this is the direction \nwe should take, make the changes that we came here to make--less \ngovernment, less cost, less regulation, move the responsibilities to \ncommunities, to States, and frankly to individuals.\n  I had the opportunity last evening to meet with a group of students \nfrom Washington and Lee High School in Arlington, VA, who were inducted \ninto the Honor Society. We talked to some of them about the concepts of \nfreedom and about the responsibility in leadership that goes with \nfreedom. I was really pleased at the receptiveness they had to the \nnotion that if you are going to be free and responsible and have a \nGovernment where we participate and we govern ourselves, then you have \nto be responsible and take some leadership positions to do that.\n  Mr. President, that is sort of what it is all about and what this \nletter is about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President's response \nto Linda Russell's wire be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 1995.\n     Ms. Linda Russell,\n     Rawlins, WY.\n       Dear Linda: Thank you for sharing your views. It's \n     important for me to know how you feel about the challenges \n     facing our nation.\n       I believe that we must balance the budget, but we must do \n     it in a way that is good for our economy and that maintains \n     our values--protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and the \n     environment, and continuing our investment in education. And \n     we have to do it without raising taxes on working families.\n       In the weeks ahead we will continue our bipartisan efforts \n     to find common ground on balancing the budget, and I hope you \n     will stay involved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, it is with a great sense of relief and hope \nthat I rise today to comment on the announcement by French President \nJacques Chirac that France has concluded its nuclear weapons testing \nprogram for good and will close its nuclear testing center in French \nPolynesia. \n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n  Like most people throughout the Pacific islands and Asia, the \ncitizens of Hawaii were angered by the six underground nuclear \nexplosions at Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls conducted by France. The \nthreat to the environment and public health posed by the numerous \nblasts over the years is real and ongoing. This week, an article in the \nWashington Post documented French acknowledgement that radioactive \nmaterials have leaked into the sea surrounding the atolls. These \nreports confirm claims made by international organizations that French \nnuclear testing has weakened the coral atolls and vented radioactive \nmaterials into the Pacific. Regrettably, France has not allowed \nindependent inquiry and verification at the test sites.\n  The global outcry against the resumption of French nuclear testing \nhas given renewed vigor to the drive for an international moratorium on \nnuclear testing and the completion of a comprehensive test ban treaty. \nInternational protests extended well beyond the nations of the Pacific; \nthe French action drew criticism in the United States and objections \nfrom most members of the European Union. The Senate and the Congress \njoined the international chorus of concern following President Chirac's \nannouncement last summer that France would end its testing moratorium. \nLast session, the Congress adopted a sense of the Senate resolution I \nauthored calling on France and China to abide by the international \nmoratorium on nuclear test explosions and refrain from conducting \nunderground nuclear tests in advance of a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, the definitive end to nuclear testing by France is \nwelcome news. It comes after six unnecessary and ill-advised nuclear \nexplosions. However, France's rejoining the global moratorium, pledge \nto sign the Treaty of Rarotonga, and commitment to pursue a zero-option \ntest ban treaty presents an opportunity to conclude a permanent nuclear \ntest ban treaty and advance nuclear nonproliferation. The challenge we \nface is to reach agreement among the nations participating in the \nUnited Nations Conference on Disarmament. In his State of the Union \nmessage, President Clinton called for the signing of a truly \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year. This ambitious \ntimetable underlines the President's strong leadership in the effort to \nhalt the nuclear arms race, advance nuclear disarmament, and ensure \npeace and security for all people.\n  President Chirac's intention to play an active role in concluding an \ninternational nuclear testing ban should add momentum to efforts now \nunderway in Geneva, Switzerland aimed at resolving remaining \ndisagreements over the text of the treaty. We should encourage all \npositive contributions toward nuclear disarmament, even those that come \nfrom recent converts to the cause.\n  Mr. President, the state visit and address to Congress by the \nPresident of the Republic of France has prompted denunciations and \ncalls for action by many citizens and elected officials. This \nunderstandable reaction reflects the anger, pain, and offense felt by \nthe people of the Pacific islands over the arrogance and insensitivity \nwith which their objections have been dismissed. This singular \nopportunity offers President Chirac a forum to embark on a new course \nto advance nuclear nonproliferation. I encourage President Chirac to \npursue reconciliation with the Pacific island peoples and nations. \nFrance should not delay its pledge to sign the protocols of the Treaty \nof Rarotonga, which declare and establish the South Pacific as a \nnuclear-free zone. I also call on President Chirac to permit \nindependent inspection and evaluation of the test sites and the lagoon \nand sea surrounding the atolls for environmental damage and radiation \nleakage.\n  The political and environmental damage wrought by the recently \nconcluded tests cannot be undone. However, the end of the final series \nof underground nuclear testing by France offers an opportunity and \nchallenge for our countries to cooperate on the successful conclusion \nand approval of a comprehensive test ban treaty this year. It is with \nthis spirit of hope that I greet the state visit by the President of \nthe Republic of France.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Craig.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for now nearly 10 months, the U.S. Senate \nand the Senate Agriculture Committee have been working diligently to \ncraft a new farm bill for our country. We all know that on September 30 \nof this immediate past year, the old farm bill expired. We also \nrecognize that under the necessary budget changes and spending \nprocedures and priorities that we were establishing, a large portion of \nthe farm bill appeared and was a part of the Balanced Budget Act that \nwe sent to the President, and the President vetoed it.\n  That has placed American agriculture, in my opinion, in a very \nprecarious situation. While they have worked with us through the year \nof 1995 in numerous hearings that the Senate Agriculture Committee, on \nwhich I serve, participated in, we began to hear a very clear message \nfrom American agriculture that current policy was not serving it as \nwell as it should, that there was a great desire on the part of \nproduction agriculture to progressively move to the market and produce \nto market trends and market ideas instead of to the perpetuation of \nfarm programs.\n  Now, recognizing that, we also saw the clear importance that that \ntransition American agriculture was talking about come in a way that \nall could live with. None of us wanted to shock the market. None of us, \nmore importantly, wanted to create any kind of economic catastrophe in \nagriculture across this country. As a result, the Senate, in a very \nbipartisan way, worked diligently.\n  We also have the mandate of the Senate Budget Committee to meet the \ncriteria of the budget. That was to find additional savings for the \nyear and then to spread those savings out over the 7-year period of the \nBalanced Budget Act to arrive at some 40 billion-plus dollars' worth of \nsavings. All of that was accomplished. Of course, all of that was for \nnaught when the President decided to veto that most important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Recognizing that that did not happen and that clearly American \nagriculture now has been asking us on a very regular basis over the \nlast month, ``What are you going to do?'' it became important here in \nthe Senate and in the House--the House acting yesterday--to mark up \ntheir version of the farm bill, and the Senate in the past week \nattempting to bring procedure forward, \n\n[[Page S574]]\nand on Friday last introducing S. 1541, the bill that I have just \ncalled up, to address the question being asked us. Most important, to \ncraft critical policy that is time certain, that works in the \nmarketplace of agriculture, that says to the farmer, ``Here is \nsomething you can now plan as you sit down with your banker and your \nfinancial advisers to plan for the coming year,'' so that we are \ntimely. That is why we have the debate today and, hopefully, votes \ntomorrow on this and possibly other critical pieces of legislation.\n\n  I believe that the Balanced Budget Act represented probably the most \nfar-reaching, positive reform for U.S. farm policy in a generation, \ncertainly in the time I have served in the U.S. Senate and in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. While we work to change and cooperate with \nagriculture and move into the marketplace, clearly, the product of \neffort that we presented in the last several months is as much or more \nreform than I think we have seen in farm policy here in the U.S. \nCongress in the last 60 years.\n  The amendments allow farmers to sign a 7-year income support contract \nwith the Federal Government. That contract takes the place of the old \nmarket-distorted target pricing system. As a result of that and the \nflexibility that we have offered in this program, clearly the farmers \ntoday who wish to stay in the program have by far the greater \nopportunity to look to the matter, as they should, in deciding what \nthey will plant and not have to worry about the loss of their base in \nthat kind of flexibility and also have the income support program that \nwe have talked about, at a minimal level, but an important level, so \nthat we do not create the type of downturns that we have seen.\n  A declining series of payments through the year 2002 would provide \nthe kind of genuine flexibility and smooth transition, as I have just \nexplained, toward the marketplace and allow agriculture then to be \nresponsive to the market moving into the next century. No longer will \nGovernment tell the farmer which crops to plant. In other words, no \nlonger will farmers have to farm the Government program to stay in the \nprogram or to realize some benefit from it. No longer will that occur. \nIt leaves the farmer free to decide what is the most productive effort \nfor his or her land.\n  I think this is the way it ought to be. Of course, the marketplace, \nthen, largely becomes the determinator of value and that, of course is \nthe way any business and industry really ought to operate.\n  The balanced budget amendments that we have brought into S. 1541 have \nbeen endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter here from the President of the \nNational Farm Bureau, Dean Kleckner. This letter was sent to me just \nthe day before yesterday with a full endorsement of S. 1541. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: Congress must pass farm program \n     legislation quickly. Failure to reach agreement on multi-year \n     farm legislation is delaying planting decisions for farmers. \n     Widespread planting will begin soon in the south. Yet farmers \n     still do not know the farm program rules. Lending \n     institutions are withholding production loans based wholly on \n     the uncertainty being created in Washington, D.C. Our \n     competitors in world markets are surely amused at this policy \n     disarray.\n       Farmers and consumers in the greatest agricultural nation \n     in the world need a workable farm program. We urge you to act \n     now, in the bipartisan spirit that has been the norm in the \n     Senate Agriculture Committee, and approve workable policy for \n     all titles of the farm bill including those previously \n     scheduled for later consideration.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors \n     unanimously voiced its support for the Freedom to Farm Act, \n     S. 1544 either as freestanding legislation or if added to \n     another legislative vehicle. The Board voiced strong \n     opposition to a short-term extension of existing programs or \n     reverting to the Act of 1949.\n       A short-term extension of existing farm programs straps \n     agriculture to a steadily declining budget baseline, provides \n     no help to farmers in repaying advance deficiency payments \n     and allows significantly less planting flexibility than is \n     needed in today's world market. Reverting to the Act of 1949 \n     is acknowledged by policy experts to be counter productive. \n     Under the Act of 1949, the federal budget exposure would be \n     enormous, domestic production would be reduced at a time when \n     world stocks are very low and foreign competitors would \n     expand exports at our expense.\n       The Freedom to Farm Act, S. 1544, embodies the core \n     components of farm policy previously included in the vetoed \n     Budget Reconciliation Act. The combination of market \n     transition payments and marketing loans contained in S. 1544 \n     forms a compromise which significantly restructures the \n     income support mechanism for farmers to maximize the \n     available federal support for agriculture and provides \n     significant planting flexibility to meet world competition.\n       Throughout the discussions leading up to the adoption of \n     the conference report on Budget Reconciliation, including \n     farm programs, the Farm Bureau identified several policy \n     areas which we believed were key to crafting effective and \n     equitable farm programs for producers of all commodities. \n     Those key concepts include:\n       Adequate protections for producers of non-program \n     commodities.\n       Maintenance of existing landlord/tenant relationships.\n       Adequate spending levels for MPP and EEP.\n       Maintenance of current payment limits rules.\n       Dropping the requirement for crop insurance to participate \n     in commodity programs.\n       Maintenance of the CRP program.\n       We believe that S. 1544 embodies many of these concepts and \n     we urge you to protect them during subsequent floor action \n     and through conference.\n       Significant contributions to balancing the federal budget \n     are achieved as a result of changes made to the commodity \n     programs including those for sugar and peanuts. The sugar and \n     peanut programs have contributed to both stability within \n     those production sectors and an abundant supply of quality \n     products for consumers. The changes to these titles in S. \n     1544 ensure workable programs for both producers and \n     consumers and they deserve your support.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation supports the inclusion \n     in S. 1544 of the compromise dairy proposal. Our members \n     supported purely administrative changes to marketing orders. \n     However, we will actively participate in the rulemaking \n     process to ensure that the final changes in market orders \n     will be equitable to all regions and all producers. We \n     support the Livestock Environmental Assistance Program (LEAP) \n     but encourage a modification of the eligibility of dairy \n     herds to expand potential participation beyond smaller \n     producers.\n       Due to low price levels for rice in recent years rice \n     producers are disadvantaged in the early years of market \n     transition contracts. We urge the committee to take steps to \n     adjust rice payments and rectify this situation.\n       Consideration of the credit, trade conservation, research \n     and other titles of the farm bill were postponed and until \n     after the commodity titles and budget provisions were \n     completed. We can no longer afford to wait for consideration \n     and debate of those titles. We urge you to include those \n     titles in the final package sent to the House. Much of the \n     preliminary work on these titles is complete. Failure to act \n     now will almost guarantee they are not reauthorized in 1996.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation supports the expedited \n     consideration of S. 1544 with the addition of the dairy, \n     research, credit, conservation and trade titles.\n       We look forward to working with you in a bipartisan effort \n     to pass multi-year farm legislation.\n                                                    Dean Kleckner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is no question this very vital farm organization, \nrepresenting more people in production agriculture today than any other \nfarm organization, recognizes the importance of this legislation and, \nmost important, the importance of what it does; that it again moves the \nfarmer toward the marketplace as all of us are concerned happens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Bill \nNorthey, the president of the National Corn Growers Association, be \nprinted in the Record along with a letter from Robert Petersen, \ncoalition coordinator for the Coalition for a Competitive Food and \nAgricultural System.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            National Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: The National Corn Growers Association \n     (NCGA) urges you to vote for cloture on S. 1541, the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act. It is important that farm \n     legislation receive the consideration it deserves, and, that \n     a logical, responsible conclusion follow. With planting fast \n     approaching, the nation's farmers must know what to expect \n     from federal farm policy. Timing is critical.\n       S. 1541 is the clear choice for the nation's farmers. \n     Throughout the entire farm bill debate, the NCGA supported \n     key provisions \n\n[[Page S575]]\n     contained in this legislation. Farmers have long suggested a simpler \n     farm policy. The Agricultural Market Transition Act allows \n     farmers to make the production decisions that will offer the \n     best opportunity for profitability. Guaranteed, fixed \n     payments provide certainty and aid in long-range planning. \n     Finally, farmers can and will make the transition to greater \n     market reliance and less dependence on federal programs.\n       Some opponents of this legislation favor a simple extension \n     of current law. A continuation of farm policy passed six \n     years ago will discourage corn producers from participating \n     in the farm program that will in turn jeopardize conservation \n     compliance. Real reform is necessary to maintain agriculture \n     as one of the strongest sectors of the nation's economy.\n       The NCGA strongly urges you to vote to invoke cloture later \n     this week. Further, your support of the Agricultural Market \n     Transition Act is needed to ensure that agriculture continues \n     to thrive into the next century. Thank you for your attention \n     to our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Northey,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Coalition for a Competitive\n\n\n                                     Food Agricultural System,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: As the Senate prepares to take up the \n     farm bill, the Coalition for a Competitive Food and \n     Agricultural System urges you to support S. 1541, the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act, as introduced, to reform \n     U.S. agricultural policies.\n       U.S. agriculture needs to have a new farm program in place \n     quickly. Major provisions of the 1990 farm bill expired on \n     December 31, 1995. As a result, the only farm program \n     authorities now available to the Secretary of Agriculture for \n     many crops are the 1938 and 1949 Agricultural Adjustment \n     Acts. There is broad agreement that those authorities are no \n     longer workable. And, resuscitating the 1990 farm bill \n     provisions is not acceptable to most of U.S. agriculture.\n       The Coalition, on behalf of its 127 member companies and \n     associations, believes S. 1541, as introduced, represents the \n     best policy alternative for agriculture. The bill would: (1) \n     reform and modernize farm programs; (2) provide a more \n     certain income safety net for farmers through direct \n     payments; (3) eliminate annual acreage reduction programs; \n     and (4) provide broad planting flexibility for farmers. These \n     proposals enjoy broad and growing support in the agricultural \n     community.\n       Enclosed is a list of key points. Also enclosed is a \n     Coalition Backgrounder.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Robert R. Petersen,\n                                            Coalition Coordinator.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, S. 1541 brings savings to the program. All \nof us want to accomplish that. It was the farmer that stood forth as \nsoon as anyone else to say that a balanced budget is critical to our \ncountry and that a balanced budget is critical to the vitality of \nAmerican agriculture; that American agriculture stands a lot better \nchance of surviving in an economy that is vibrant, in an economy where \nthe consumers have access to and opportunity to purchase, with greater \npurchasing power that we believe the balanced budget would ultimately \nbring.\n  Export subsidies would be curtailed, and of course peanut and sugar \nprograms have gone through major reform. While those programs still \nhave their critics here on the floor of the Senate, all of us can stand \nforward--those of us who work to produce these reforms--and demonstrate \nthat clearly all of the commodity interests of our country have been \nsensitive to the kind of reform that moves us to the marketplace.\n  I do not think the argument today that the consumer is paying the \nbill fits anymore. What does fit is the sensitivity to a fair playing \nfield, especially in those industries that have to compete and must \ncompete in worldwide economies.\n  I do not think anyone in this country wants to see the destruction of \na vibrant industry, or opening the borders in a way that allows dumping \nfrom Third World countries, as we have seen in the past, especially if \nthe production in the Third World country is well below the marketplace \nand if it is subsidized by the sponsoring governments. That is what we \ncan avoid, and that is what we have avoided here while complying with \nGATT, while in recognition of NAFTA. Markets must be balanced and they \nmust be fair.\n  I have never yet heard of a farmer or rancher in my State who would \nnot say, ``Give me a level playing field and I will compete with the \nbest in the world because I am the best in the world but I cannot \ncompete against open subsidies or in a situation that allows those \nsubsidized crops to be dumped in my domestic market.'' That is, of \ncourse, what we try to accomplish here in the type of balance and the \nkind of reform that we have brought to these programs.\n  Conservation programs remain a critical part of any good farm bill. \nAmerican agriculture has led the way in water quality, in saving our \nsoil, and recognizing the vital interests of that industry by a sound \nenvironment and responding to that environment. Conservation programs \nwill be a critical part of the bill. While we will continue to work \nthis summer to finalize greater portions of the conservation title that \nmeet the kind of critical environmental needs that is important out \nthere in farmland America, what we are doing here is a major step in \nthe right direction. I think it offers the opportunity to forestall any \nintrusive kind of regulation that could occur because it demonstrates \nthat American agriculture was not only responsive to its own needs but \nsensitive to the criticisms of others where they were appropriately \nplaced.\n\n  Mr. President, S. 1541 is identical to the original balanced budget \namendment with two exceptions: First, there is an increase in the size \nof dairy operations that could qualify for livestock environmental \nassistance; and another portion that is critical to my State and \ncritical to a good many others, as we create flexibility in program \ncrop areas that allow farmers to move toward the market, we do not want \nthat farmer who is currently receiving Government support to be openly \ncompeting against a farmer who does not or has never received that. In \nsimple terms, Mr. President, that simply would not be fair. Everybody \nin agriculture understands that.\n  As a result of that, in the area of fruits and vegetables, they would \nqualify for current law, meaning that farmers who farm to the program \nand are in it with the flexibility and get the benefit of the 7-year \npayment program would not be allowed to use their flex acres in those \nproductions.\n  My State of Idaho raises potatoes. It is critical to the State and, I \nlike to think, important to the Nation. But it is a very sensitive \nmatter as it relates to availability and supply. A rush to plant \npotatoes in a relatively strong market could ultimately destroy that \nmarket or cause tremendous dislocation by some projection of unusual \nincreases in planting. We are recognizing the need for transition. \nPotato farmers are not saying they should not compete, but why should \nthey or any fruit or vegetable farmer compete against somebody who is \nreceiving direct Government program benefits, as they would through the \ntransition period? The answer, we think, and the fair answer is, they \nshould not. That is why those areas have been left as current law \nprovides.\n  Mr. President, that is a brief summary of what we are attempting to \naccomplish in S. 1541. I certainly hope other colleagues would come to \nthe floor to debate this issue today. We think it is important that we \nresolve it through this month, hopefully by early next month, or no \nlater than the 1st of March we could go to conference between the House \nand the Senate, work out our differences, and in late winter or early \nspring let American agriculture know what farm policy is going to look \nlike for the next good number of years. That keeps us in cycle with the \nnormal planting cycles of our country and something we need to be \nresponsive to.\n  I understand there will be other legislation proposed later on in the \nafternoon. Senator Leahy is working on a proposed offering that will \ntake a serious look at because all of us recognize that farm \nlegislation, when it is good legislation, has always demonstrated the \nbipartisan approach that every good farm bill has ever been crafted on. \nCertainly this side wants to work with the other side in dealing with \nthat issue, in solving the problems that we currently have.\n\n  More important than that, though, is the timely message. I hope today \nand tomorrow we can debate this issue and vote on these issues. \nClearly, that will send a signal--the House having brought a bill out \nof their committee yesterday, and hoping to be able to move on that \nwithin the next few weeks--that comes a long way toward \n\n[[Page S576]]\nresolving the problems we want to resolve.\n  With the flexibility and, I think, the simplicity, the certainty we \nare offering, the opportunity for transition in the markets and \nhopefully the profitability that I think can be produced by this type \nof program with farmers, we not only offer them up a good piece of work \nthat I think we in the Senate can be proud of, but we say to American \nagriculture: We will partner with you, but we expect you to farm to the \nmarket and to be sensitive to market trends and to farm to the world \nconsuming public. We will help you get there in the best ways \nGovernment can facilitate, and that is really all that any industry in \nthis country should be able to ask for. It is a partnership that has \nlong existed, and it is one that I think brings a kind of ability to \nAmerican agriculture that they expect.\n  Mr. President, I have no further comments at this time. We have the \nlegislation now before us, and with recognition that no one is here on \nthe floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, \nwas on the floor visiting about the farm bill. I wanted to discuss just \nbriefly where we are and where we are headed on that issue. That is a \nvery important issue to a lot of farm States. Tomorrow we will, I \nunderstand, be voting on a series of alternatives dealing with farm \nlegislation.\n  It is long past the time when Congress should have passed a farm \nbill. Last year was the year in which Congress was required to enact a \n5-year farm program. The Congress did in fact put a 5-year farm program \nin the reconciliation bill, but, of course, everyone knew that the \nPresident was going to veto that bill. The budget reconciliation bill \nhad a whole series of other things in it, and the farm program was \nactually a very small part of it.\n  The result of the President's veto of the reconciliation bill was \nthat we are left without a farm program. Farmers are thinking about \ngoing into the field in the spring--some down South will be going into \ntheir fields in a matter of weeks--and there is no farm program. In \nNorth Dakota, they are not preparing to go into the field today, I \nguarantee you. It is a little too cold out there. But they are talking \nto their bankers and their farm equipment dealers. They are getting \nready for the spring's work, and there is no farm program. They want to \nknow what will the farm program be.\n  It is a waste of time to be pointing fingers about who is at fault as \nto why we are so late and what has happened. What is most important, at \nthis point, is for us to try to understand how can we construct a farm \nprogram that works for the benefit of family farmers and how can we do \nit soon.\n  My hope is that by the end of the day tomorrow we will have passed \nfrom the Senate a proposal that we can put into conference with the \nHouse. Then we could in the next week get a conference committee and \nhave a farm program passed and signed into law. We owe that to family \nfarmers in this country.\n\n  My understanding is that Senator Dole, the majority leader, will \noffer the freedom to farm bill. That bill has some provisions that I \nsupport. It does some things I cannot support. I have proposed an \nalternative that we will likely offer tomorrow called the Farm Security \nAct.\n  I think common to both proposals would be the notion that the \nGovernment ought not to be telling the farmers how to plant, nor \ntelling them when to plant, nor telling them where to plant. That is \nthe straitjacket that we have in the current farm law. That, in my \njudgment, ought to be changed. We do not need the Government hip deep \nin planting decisions. Let farmers determine what they plant on base \nacres. The freedom to farm bill would do that. The Farm Security Act \nwould do that. It seems to me that is a common objective that we could \nagree on.\n  Most of us believe that we ought to forgive advance deficiency \npayments for farmers who suffered a crop loss last year. These farmers \nare now threatened with having to repay those amounts. If they did not \nhave a crop, there is no money with which to pay. We should forgive \nthat. The freedom to farm proposal would provide some relief for \nfarmers on that score. So would the Farm Security Act.\n  There are sufficient common elements, it seems to me, so that we \nshould be able to reach agreement at the end of the day tomorrow on \nsomething that we could put into conference.\n  The one major difference I would have with the freedom to farm bill \nis that it presupposes, with some up front attractive transitional \npayments, that we would then get rid of the farm program. In exchange \nfor giving transitional payments to farmers now, it would repeal \npermanent farm law, the 1949 act. The purpose of all that is to provide \nsome payment up front. You take the payment in exchange for getting out \nof the business of providing any kind of price supports at all in the \nfuture.\n  I understand the short-term attractiveness of that. Yet, we know farm \nprices are going to go down. Grain prices go up, and they go down. The \nproblem is they never go up on the up-side grid aggressively. Every \ntime grain prices start to go up--and they are up some now--what \nhappens is the grain trade starts floating rumors about embargoes, or \nsomebody else starts doing something saying this is going to hurt \nconsumers. They try to dampen prices. The farmers then never get the \nuplifting side of higher prices for any length of time. They should, \nbut they do not because the larger economic interests are always in \nthere trying to mess with grain prices. And they do it in a way that \ntends to collapse prices that family farmers need to make a living.\n  Grain prices are up some points now. They are stronger, and they are \nhigher. But they will go down, and they will collapse. because we have \nthese cycles of ups and downs of grain prices. When these prices \ncollapse, family farmers will not make it unless there is a safety net \nwith some kind of loan rate or deficiency payment.\n  Unless there is some safety net, these family farmers will get washed \naway, and they will be bankrupt. They do not have big enough financial \nstrength to sustain a number of years of low prices, and these family \nfarmers will be washed away.\n  The freedom to farm bill would take away the safety net. It would \ngive you some attractive payments up front. But, there will no longer \nbe a farm program down the road. I can understand why that is \nattractive to some. However, it seems to me this is not a good trade. \nWe ought to have a farm program in the long term. We ought to provide a \nbasic safety net for family-size farmers.\n  Tomorrow some of us will offer a Farm Security Act which provides \nsome attractiveness on the front end as well. We would provide that we \nwould not only forgive the advanced deficiency payments of last year \nfor those who suffered a crop loss, but also that we would provide what \nwould normally be a 50-percent advance deficiency payment this spring. \nThis would not have to be repaid. This would be done in order to help \nfamily farms recapitalize their farms. Its a repayment of sorts for \nsome difficult situations, acknowledging that Congress did not do its \njob and did not provide a farm bill when it should have done it last \nyear.\n  I do not mind providing some up-front attractive features. I am just \nas happy to do that in the Farm Security Act as they might be in the \nFreedom to Farm bill. But I will not do it under the condition that it \nis in exchange for pulling the rug out from under farmers later. I am \nnot willing to say to farmers that when prices collapse you will not \nhave a safety net. That is not a good trade.\n  I think we have to decide in the Senate and in the Congress whether \nwe care a rip whether there are family farmers in this country? Do we \ncare at all? Some people may say it does not matter. Some say let \ncorporations farm from California to Maine. And they will.\n  Food prices will be higher when the large corporate interests capture \nmost of the enterprises in family farming and they become part of large \nagrifactories. We will certainly have \n\n[[Page S577]]\nmuch higher food prices. But it will mean more than that, more than \nfood price economics.\n  Go to a small town. I come from a small town of 300 people. Go to a \nsmall town and look around that town. We need to understand what is it \nthat feeds the economic life of that small community. All across this \ncountry the blood vessels of our small towns are those yard lights out \non the family farms. If you turn off those yard lights and turn those \nfamily farms into corporate agrifactories, all of those small towns die \nquickly.\n  The question before us is both social and economic. Is there an \ninterest in maintaining a network of family farms in this country's \nfuture? I think the answer is yes. If the answer is yes, then we ought \nto put together something with price supports that make sense for \nfamily farmers.\n  When prices drop and stay down, we ought to put something together to \nput some payment in place which we will provide in the same basic level \nof a safety net in the long term.\n  If we fail to provide some long-term safety net it means that we do \nnot care whether our young farmers get started. It means we do not care \nwhether there is renewal on family farms, and we do not care whether \nthere are family farms and small towns in the future.\n  I hope we can find a way by tomorrow evening to reach agreement on a \nbipartisan basis to pass a farm bill out of this Senate and put it into \nconference. We need a farm bill that provides some attractive features \non the front end and one that provides much greater flexibility of \nplanting for farmers, forgiveness of advance deficiency payments, and \ncertainly the retention in the long term of a network of price supports \nfor family farms.\n  If we can do that, we will have done something significant. There is \nno reason, if we work together, that we cannot have finished a farm \nbill by the end of next week, one which the President could sign and \none which will provide family farmers some certainty about their \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S573-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S577-S578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, none of my colleagues is here. We are not \nin business with votes today. We are in business today for the purpose \nof introduction of legislation, and we will have votes tomorrow. I \nwould like to turn to one additional topic.\n  I am going to bring to the floor of the Senate some information about \nour merchandise trade deficit in the next couple of days. It is \ninteresting to me that we have an enormous amount of debate in this \ncountry about the budget deficit. It is appropriate because our budget \ndeficit is a serious problem for this country. We are spending money \nwhich we do not have. We are borrowing it. When we do that, we run into \ntrouble if we keep doing it. We need to have a budget that is in \nbalance. We need to do it the right way with the right priorities. No \none disputes that.\n  Yet, the interesting thing is that there is a conspiracy of silence \nit seems to me. Its almost a complete conspiracy of silence about \nanother deficit that is even larger than the budget deficit in this \ncountry. That is this country's trade deficit. Our merchandise trade \ndeficit in America last year was higher than the Federal budget \ndeficit. I will bet hardly anybody knows that.\n  We had over a $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, over a $30 \nbillion deficit with China, and nearly a $40 billion deficit with \nCanada and Mexico combined.\n  What does all of that mean? It means fewer American jobs, lower \nAmerican wages, less American growth, and less opportunity for the \npeople who live in this country.\n  I am not suggesting we ought to construct a trade strategy that says, \n``Let us put walls around our country and keep out the exports from \nother countries in order to reduce our trade deficit.'' That is not the \npoint I am making.\n  The point I am making is that China says to us, ``We are going to \nship you all of our goods, all of our trinkets. We will ship you all of \nour manufactured products, all of our textiles. And, we are going to do \nit in sufficient quantities so that we will run up a $30 billion trade \nsurplus with you.'' That is real trouble because what that means is we \nhave transferred jobs that used to be good-paying manufacturing jobs in \nthe United States to China. They are now lower paid manufacturing jobs \nin China. It is also true with Mexico. It is true with Japan.\n  Did you know that every single day there are two to three permits \napproved down on the Mexican-United States border from the maquiladora \nplants, the plants by which companies transfer their production from \nAmerica to just outside of our country. They move just across that \ninvisible line, the international border, so that they do not have to \ncomply with the pollution laws of America, so they can pay lower wages \nfor someone living outside of our country, and then manufacture goods \nthere and ship them back to us here?\n  Do you know Hershey kisses used to be American? Not any longer. They \nare now made in Mexico. Hanes underwear closed six plants in America. \nGuess where most of that underwear is going to come from in the future?\n  Moving jobs from America to other countries means less opportunity \nhere. It means slower economic growth. It means trouble for American \nworkers and for American young people who want to go to school to learn \nand to get a good job. Nobody seems to care much about it. Trade \ndeficits, that does not matter. Nobody talks about that.\n  NAFTA is a good example of what I am concerned about. When NAFTA was \nproposed to the U.S. Congress, there was one major study called the \nHufbauer-Schott study. One of the fellows was Gary Hufbauer, an \neconomist. He predicted an enormous number of new jobs in America if we \nwould pass NAFTA, the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.\n  Well, I did not support NAFTA for a lot of reasons. I felt that we \nwould have a wholesale loss of American jobs. The year before the \nUnited States-Mexican trade agreement was approved by the Congress, we \nhad a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Two years later, we now \nhave in this last year nearly an $18 billion trade deficit with Mexico. \nWe went from a $2 billion surplus to an $18 billion deficit.\n  Mr. Hufbauer in that study had predicted I think 130,000 new American \njobs if we would pass NAFTA. He now says maybe he ought to be in a \ndifferent business. He says, ``I am not much of an estimator.'' He now \nsays he thinks we lost 220,000 American jobs as a result of NAFTA.\n  That is just one example of a trade circumstance that has gone awry. \nI suppose in theory it does not matter much. I have never found a \njournalist who has lost a job because of imports or exports. So, you \nare not going to read a lot in the Washington Post about our \nmerchandise trade deficit.\n  In fact, when we debated NAFTA in the Congress, I counted the column \ninches devoted, pro and con, to the trade agreement in the Washington \nPost, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times, four \nmajor papers. Do you know what these citadels of free speech and free \nexpression gave? It was a 6 to 1 ratio, 6 column inches for NAFTA on \ntheir editorial and op-ed pages, and 1 column inch against. They gave a \n6-to-1 advantage for those who were proposing this trade agreement \nversus those who were opposed to it. That is what we faced in dealing \nwith this topic.\n  What I wish to do is to call this deficit to the attention of the \nCongress and the American people. We need to understand the trade \ndeficit, especially the merchandise trade deficit.\n  You do not in this country move America ahead by measuring our \nprogress by what we consume. You measure it by what we produce. \nEconomic progress is what we produce. And yet every single month you \nwill hear on the news the economy is rolling along because we consumed \nmore of this or we bought more cars or bought more of that, or that \nretail sales were up.\n  That is not a barometer of economic progress. The barometer of \nprogress is what has happened to production in this country. Are we \nproducing more or less? And the second barometer, equally as important \nas it relates to production, is what has happened to wages.\n  It has hurt over 60 percent of American families. When they sit down \nfor dinner tonight at their dinner table--actually, in my hometown they \nsit down for supper; we still call it supper, but out East they call it \ndinner. But, when they sit down at the dinner table \n\n[[Page S578]]\nand they talk about their situation, 60 percent of American workers, \nare making less money now than they did 20 years ago when you adjust \ntheir income for inflation. They are making less money now than 20 \nyears ago. They have made no progress in 20 years. In fact, they have \nlost ground.\n  Now, why would people lose ground in 20 years with respect to their \npersonal income? Because we have constructed a trade circumstance where \nwe say to them, you American workers, especially you lower skilled \nAmerican workers, we are going to ask you to compete with 2 or 3 \nbillion other people and those people are willing to work for 12 cents \nan hour, 40 cents an hour or a dollar an hour. And they work for people \nwho put up factories where they do not have to worry about pollution. \nThey can pump the waste in the water. They can pump the pollution \nstraight up in the air.\n  So, the result is we get somebody working an hour and a quarter of \ndirect labor to make a pair of tennis shoes in Malaysia, making 14 \ncents an hour. Thus there is roughly 20 cents or slightly less in \ndirect labor costs in a pair of tennis shoes from a plant in Malaysia. \nThe labor comes from a woman, often under age, who works 12 hours a day \nat 14 cents an hour. Then that tennis shoe made there is shipped to \nPittsburgh or Fargo or Denver and sold for $80 a pair. It comes with a \n20-cent direct labor cost from a foreign country. It is under these \nkind of circumstances that we have told American workers: ``You compete \nwith someone making 14 cents an hour.''\n  We cannot do that. You cannot compete with that. You lose. What do \nyou lose? You lose the jobs. You lose the plants and the jobs, and you \nlose economic opportunity and economic vitality in our country.\n  As perverse as it may sound, we not only have this problem in \nmerchandise trade deficits, but we also have a provision in our tax law \nthat says we are going to make it easier for companies to do that. Our \ntax laws say, ``We will provide a tax incentive in America's tax code \nif you will please shut the doors to your plant in America and move \nyour jobs overseas.''\n  We have a tax incentive that says, ``Shut your plant down here and \nmove your jobs overseas. We will give you a tax cut.''\n  Interestingly enough, in the bill that went to the President for a \nveto during this budget battle there was another provision that made it \neven a sweeter deal to close a plant here and move jobs overseas.\n  When that bill was in this Chamber, I offered an amendment which \nwould shut down this perverse incentive that says, ``If you move your \njobs overseas, we will give you a tax break.'' I said. ``Let us shut \nthat down.''\n\n  If we can agree on anything, it ought to be on this. We ought not \ngive a tax break for moving jobs out of America.''\n  Do you know the vote was a partisan vote, essentially a partisan \nvote? Everybody on one side voted for my amendment, everybody on the \nother side voted against it, and we lost. It makes no sense at all. We \nneed to come together and decide as a matter of economic strategy what \nwe want for this country.\n  Part of it is a more sensible tax law. Part of it is a more sensible \ntrade strategy that provides fairness and opportunity for American \nworkers and provides for the resurgence of an American manufacturing \nsector. We need to do that soon.\n  The reason I mention it today is it in some respects fits with what \nwe are talking about with respect to agriculture. I do not want to \nbuild walls. I wish to build bridges. As a fellow who represents a \nState that needs to find a foreign home for a fair amount of grain, I \nunderstand the need for international trade. I want to expand trade, \nnot restrict it.\n  I wish to make darned sure that the circumstances of trade are \nrepresented by fair rules. I do not mind that Americans should have to \ncompete. They must compete and must win in competition, but the \ncompetition must be fair. We should not say to an American worker and \nhis family, ``You compete against someone overseas making 14 cents an \nhour employed by someone who does not have to follow any laws with \nrespect to pollution.'' I say that is not fair. We need to dig into \nthis and be concerned about it and respond to it. It relates to the \nissue that I described about where we are going with respect to wages \nand opportunity and where we are going with respect to jobs in this \ncountry's future.\n  Mr. President, I will be in the Chamber tomorrow to offer some \namendments and discuss in some detail the alternatives that we will be \ndiscussing when we talk about the farm program. There will be some \ndifferences, and as I said the major difference between us is that many \nof us feel we should not withdraw a long-term safety net from family \nfarmers. Notwithstanding those differences, I hope there will be \nsignificant agreement as well because I want by the end of the day \ntomorrow to have this Senate pass out into a conference committee some \nkind of basic farm legislation. This Senate owes that to American \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I hope that we can enact farm \nlegislation quickly. I just met with a group of farmers in my State. \nThey expressed to me the need to work with their bankers to make their \nspring plans for planting. They expressed to me the need to have a farm \nbill passed for purposes of their planning, so that they could have \ncertainty of their investment.\n\n  There has been much debate in this Chamber over the years on farm \npolicy. I know that there are currently several approaches that are \nfloating around the Chamber. One is, more or less, some modification of \nthe Freedom to Farm Act, as suggested by Congressman Roberts and \nothers, there is another plan to have a new farm bill and another to \ncontinue the present farm bill for a year.\n  I suspect that in this Senate with the need for cloture, it will be \nhard to get a cleancut decision on any one of those bills. I suspect \nthat we will have to have a compromise of one of those approaches.\n  Let me say that in talking to the farmers from my State--these \nparticular farmers were grain farmers, corn and wheat farmers--they \nthought the Freedom to Farm Act would be most advantageous to them from \nwhat they had heard and from what they knew about it. They felt \nstrongly that they might even like to try some new crops, crops that \nthey do not presently grow now, or do some experimenting with new \ncrops. Under the traditional farm programs where we have commodity \nprograms for this crop and that crop, as defined in legislation, \nproducers are locked in to growing corn or wheat or whatever. They \nexpressed to me support for planting flexibility under the concept of \nfreedom to farm.\n  I am concerned about having a cap on who receives benefits. If we had \nfreedom to farm, a cap on the income levels of farmers who might \nreceive benefits or possibly the size of farm or something other test \nmight be needed. There also has been a debate over the budgetary \nnumbers, and we always have different budgetary numbers. Congressman \nRoberts argues that his plan would actually save the taxpayers money \nand lead us into the time when commodity prices might be much higher.\n  The advantage to extending the current farm bill would be that we are \nin the midst of a planting season, that this is a program that our \npeople have become accustomed to and that they can farm and prosper, to \nsome extent.\n  Underlying all of this is the fact that commodity prices have gone \nabove what the target price trigger is; that is wheat and corn prices \nare above the level that they receive a subsidy. So farmers are paying \nback the so-called deficiency payments, and this has caused some \nhardship because people have used those deficiency payments in their \noperations. But there is provision for the Secretary of Agriculture to \n\n[[Page S579]]\nmake adjustments where there is hardship.\n  Mr. President, I know that tomorrow we will have a cloture vote--we \nmay have more than one cloture vote--and then we will have some \namendments. It might well be that we have an experimental 2-year \nfreedom to farm with some continuation of the deficiency payments \nprogram. But above all, we should act, because on too many issues, for \none reason or another, Washington has not produced either a budget or a \nfarm bill or, indeed, a telecommunications bill, which I hope we will \nproduce soon also.\n  We have the people's work to do, and I hope we are here and doing it. \nBut I urge that this Chamber come to a conclusion on the farm bill \ntomorrow or, hopefully, within a week. I will be here to assist in that \nprocess, as will my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the farm bill has become a focal point now \nfor legislation in Washington and not too soon. I think it is the first \ntime in 40 or 50 years we have failed to enact a farm bill in the year \nthat the farm program expired. So we are a year late, and this is what \nmy distinguished friend from South Dakota is saying.\n  I worry about the Freedom to Farm Act because that is a check that \ngoes to the farmer, and, basically, some farmers are referring to it as \nwelfare. You can lock your door, go to Florida, and still get your \ncheck and not raise any grain, not raise any crop. Therefore, your \nlocal fertilizer dealer, local equipment dealer, local feed and seed \npeople no longer will be selling. So, therefore, it worries a lot of \nfolks that the so-called payment, regardless of whether you have a high \nprice or a low price, will be received.\n  That does not seem quite fair to me, where under the present program \nyou stabilize the market. If you go under, the prices are lower than \nthe set price, then you get some help. If it goes above that, then you \nmake a profit and you do not need the money. So somehow or another, it \nhas stabilized, in my mind, the market.\n  What is so frustrating now to the farmers is it appears that it is \nthis or nothing. In the beginning, the Freedom to Farm Act was opposed \nby the American Farm Bureau late last November. We have copies of the \nletter where they oppose the freedom to farm act.\n  Now, as we fail to enact a farm bill and we get closer to the time \nwhere southern States are beginning to plant, or within the next few \nweeks, they are very concerned. The farmers in my State who are \npreparing for the spring are very concerned about their financial \nsituation.\n  I think we have to be very careful that we do not allow the last-\nminute gasp here to remove the safety net for the farmers in the \nfuture, because under the Freedom to Farm Act, the farm program in 7 \nyears is gone, or sooner than that when the general public finds that \nif you do not farm, you get a check every year, and it could be up to \nas high as $120,000 a year. The general public is not going to like \nthat.\n  You can cut all the deals you want to for milk and nutrition and all \nthose sort of things and pass the Freedom to Farm Act, or at least send \nit to conference. I think that it is incumbent upon all of us to be \nsure that the future of farming stays around.\n  In my State, the average farm is 157 acres. So farming is a very \nnarrow operation as to the products, as to the income and for stability \nin our farm program.\n\n  Mr. President, I have real concerns. The Senator from South Dakota \ntalks about flexibility. You have a quota, you have an allotment, \nwhatever it might be, as to acres. We propose that you have \nflexibility, that you do not lose--say you have 100 acres and you want \nto take 30 acres to try something else. If something else does not \nwork, then you can revert back to your 100 acres. So it gives \nflexibility.\n  You can give to farmers a good, well-thought-out, debated farm bill \nto give them a future and a safety net that I think will be more in \nkeeping with our, or at least, what my idea is of a farm bill for \nagriculture's future.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that when tomorrow comes and we try to push \na farm bill through quickly--and maybe a telecommunications bill, \nwhatever it might be here--that we do not rush through without giving \nas much thought to the future of farming in this great country as we \nshould.\n  I think you will find some offers tomorrow, ways that can be, I feel, \na good future for agriculture, rather than saying, ``Here is a check \nevery year for the next 7 years, and at the end of that time, you are \nout on your own.''\n  My small farmer will not be able to accommodate that. I think we \nought to pass a farm bill that gives hope to the farmer and \nencouragement to young farmers to stay on the farm and not move so \nquickly on the basis of being under the gun.\n  We have delayed in this Congress, more than any time during my 21 \nyears, right up to the hilt. It is the first time I have not been able \nto see a farm bill until this late--yesterday afternoon--which we are \ngoing to be called upon to vote on tomorrow. Just highlights of the \nfarm bill were in the Record, but I would like an opportunity to read \nthe fine print. I was brought up that ``the devil is in the fine \nprint.'' I want to read the fine print and see what this bill and piece \nof legislation says.\n  Mr. President, I hope that eventually we have a farm bill that we all \ncan be proud of, which the farming community can rally around, and that \nwe do not leave any particular field--if that is a good word for \nfarming--out hanging by itself, not protected and cared for as we would \nlike it to be for the future.\n  So I am very concerned about the farm bill. I am concerned that we \nwill just get rid of it or push it so we can go out and have \nPresidential politics in the next few weeks. I think that happens to be \nvery important to several of our colleagues. But I do not believe that \nthe farm States are interested in us doing something hastily, which \nwould not bring them a future as it relates to the community.\n  Farm products and prices are good. So, as I understand it, we have \nsaved about $5 billion that was set aside for the farmers if the prices \nwere projected, as CBO said they were going to be, downward. Instead of \nthat, CBO was wrong on this one. The prices have gone up. There is \nabout $5 billion not expended that was based on the projection of CBO \nabout this time last year.\n  So it just proves that CBO is not right all the time and that we have \nthe ability to make the farm bill substantial and stabilize the market \nthrough some of the procedures we have held onto in the past. Secondly, \nwe can give flexibility to the farmer to try new products, without \nlosing their total allotment or set-aside.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to be very careful in their \ndeliberation of the farm bill tomorrow. If it takes another day, so be \nit. We have waited now a year. We are about a year late in passing the \nfarm bill. Usually, we have a 5-year farm bill. At least, in 1985 and \n1990 we did. Most of the farmers were able to operate under that \nbecause we gave them some long-term stability.\n\n  My colleague from South Dakota indicated there might be just an \nextension with a few changes in the present farm bill in order to give \nus more time to be sure that our farm bill for the future is correct. \nThat may be something we want to give serious consideration to--a year \nor two extension of the present farm bill, with some modification as it \nrelates to the deficiency payments.\n  I understand the dilemma. You have a deficiency payment, you are not \nentitled to it, and you are supposed to pay it back. Now the farmers \nhave used it and do not want to pay it back or cannot pay it back. I \nunderstand that. But there was an understanding in the beginning.\n  So my point here--and it may not be very cogent--is that I hope my \ncolleagues will be very careful before they rush pell-mell into trying \nto get a farm bill out of here tomorrow so we can go home tomorrow \nnight. We ought to stay here and develop a good farm bill that would be \nin the interest of the future of the farmers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the reason I wanted to address the Senate at \nthis time is that having spent a few days in Arizona recently visiting \nwith constituents, I think that I have learned something that is \nimportant for us to share as we continue this debate about the budget \nimpasse and whether we are going to be able to reach an agreement on a \nbalanced budget.\n  What I have heard from my constituents is, they are as concerned \nabout the other side of the equation, namely, the income side of the \nequation, as they are about the balancing of the budget by the saving \nmoney side of the equation. Specifically, in the context of the new \nreport issued a couple of weeks ago by the so-called Kemp Commission, \nthey are suggesting that we should turn more of our attention to how we \nraise our revenue as much as we do to how we save our revenue. The \nreport, entitled ``Unleashing America's Potential,'' is the official \nname of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform \nReport, the so-called Kemp Commission Report that was issued about 2 \nweeks ago of this past month.\n  Jack Kemp, who is the chairman of that commission, traveled to \nPhoenix and gave a couple presentations to constituents of mine talking \nabout this, and combined with other meetings I have attended, as I have \nsaid, the conclusion I have come to is that while my constituents are \nvery interested in balancing the budget--and they have encouraged me to \nstay the course and continue to try to press the President to reach a \nmeaningful balanced budget over 7 years--they have also concluded, as I \nhave, that that may not be practicable right now, the President just \nmay not be ready to make a budget deal, that the incentives are not \nthere for him to reach an agreement.\n  If that is so, what they are saying is, look at the other side of the \nequation, because there is another debate that is starting in this \ncountry about how to raise tax revenues, and that debate could have as \nmuch to do not only with how we balance the budget but also how we \npromote economic growth in this country.\n  Today, very briefly, I want to talk about those two subjects. When a \nfamily sits down at the table and figures up how they can do better \neconomically to send their child to college or to buy the new car they \nhave to buy because the old one is pretty much on its last legs, or any \nother way try to figure how they will do better economically, they \ngenerally look at both sides of the equation.\n  They say, ``Well, first of all, are we spending too much money? Can \nwe save money? Are we going out to dinner too much? Are we going out to \nthe movies too much? We can save some money. We can pinch some \npennies.'' And they figure out how much they can save.\n  That is what we are trying to do with our balanced budget. We are \ntrying to say the Government can save a lot of money. Republicans are \ntalking about saving hundreds of billions of dollars over a 7-year \nperiod, thus being able to balance our budget. The President would like \nto spend about $400 to $500 billion more than we would. That is why we \nhave not been able to reach agreement with him on a balanced budget. \nClearly, we ought to be looking at the side of the equation that tells \nus whether we are spending too much money.\n  But the other side of the equation is how can we cause the economy to \ngrow so that not only will families be better off, so that they will \nnot have to rely upon the Government so much, but that they will \nactually be producing more in terms of productivity and therefore more \nrevenue to the Federal Government with existing tax policy? We can \nactually talk just like a family talks about getting a raise or doing \nsomething in business so they can make more money, which is the other \nhalf of their fiscal health, I guess you can call it.\n  The Federal Government can be doing the same thing. There are two \nways to do that. There is a wrong way and a right way. The wrong way \nsays let us raise tax rates. That will bring in more money to the \nFederal Treasury. We know the last tax increase, the biggest in this \ncountry's history, promoted by the President, did not raise income \nnearly as much as the administration projected because, of course, \npeople changed their behavior. The most graphic example of that was the \n1990 tax increase which included a much higher tax on luxury items, \nsuch as expensive cars and yachts and furs. And what happened to the \npeople that were building the yachts? They went out of business, \nbecause people could not afford to pay the high tax so they stopped \nbuying the yachts, as a result of which not only did the Federal \nGovernment not get the revenue but it actually had to pay money in \nterms of unemployment compensation because a lot of people lost their \njobs because the yachts were not being made. Of course those people did \nnot pay income taxes.\n  So the bottom line was that even though the income tax rate was \nincreased, the revenues did not increase at all. That is what we found \nin this last tax increase. Revenues to the Treasury have not increased \nnearly as much as the administration predicted. So we know that raising \ntax rates does not necessarily mean an increase in income.\n\n  We also know that lowering tax rates can sometimes mean an increase \nin revenues to the Treasury. It is a little bit like the person who \nputs goods on sale about Christmastime. He does not do that to lose \nmoney. The retailer knows you can more than make up in volume what you \nlose in terms of the price cut. The same thing in taxes. You can reduce \ntaxes and make more revenue for the Treasury because you have promoted \ncommercial activity.\n  As a matter of fact, in the preamble to this report, ``Unleashing \nAmerica's Potential,'' former HUD Secretary and Representative, Jack \nKemp, quotes John F. Kennedy who gave a speech before the Economic Club \nof New York in December 1962 and said this:\n\n       In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too \n     high today and tax revenues are too low, and the soundest way \n     to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates \n     now. . . . The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a \n     budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding \n     economy which can bring a budget surplus.\n\n  That is John F. Kennedy in 1962, who also said ``A rising tide lifts \nall boats,'' meaning if we can get the economy growing again everyone \nwill benefit, the entrepreneur who has had his tax rates cut as well as \nthe person looking for a job who finds that there are jobs available \nbecause there is increased economic activity. It all has to do with \ninjecting more capital into the private sector. John F. Kennedy made \nthe point.\n  Ronald Reagan made the point 20 years later. When tax rates were \nreduced in the Reagan administration, tax revenues for the Treasury \nwere increased. That is what we are talking about here in the Kemp \neconomic report, a fairer, simpler, single-rate tax that would promote \neconomic growth and opportunity and job creation because it would \nprovide the incentive for investment and savings rather than the \nincentive which we have today which is get as many deductions as you \ncan by borrowing, because that is how you can, in effect, work the Tax \nCode.\n  Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle say, ``A tax cut \nfor the rich is what you are talking about. Capital gains are enjoyed \nby rich people, so if you cut the capital gains tax that helps them.''\n  You know, nothing can be further from the truth. As Jack Kemp has \npointed out, a capital gains tax cut benefits the poor more than the \nrich. The rich people do not have to sell their assets. What they can \ndo is use their assets as collateral to borrow money and take an income \ntax deduction on the interest costs of borrowing and they still have \ntheir capital assets. So the rich people do not have to have a capital \ngains tax cut. They can use the capital as the equity to borrow money \nand then write off the interest on their income taxes.\n\n  It is the poorer people in our society, who are looking for a job, or \na better job, who can benefit by a capital gains \n\n[[Page S581]]\ntax cut. Not only do many families have small assets tied up that they \nwould like to sell so they could utilize that money to send a child to \nschool or invest or for whatever purpose--on rates now they are paying \n28 percent if they sell that asset--but it is also the entrepreneurs \nwho can free those assets up, take the money and invest it in something \nmore productive, thus creating jobs, thus providing more opportunities \nfor people at all levels of the economic spectrum in our society. So a \ntax cut can be beneficial, and it can benefit everybody in society, not \nsimply those who are more well off.\n  We are going to be introducing a constitutional amendment in the next \nday or two, a resolution which would provide that a two-thirds vote in \neach House of the Congress would be required to approve a tax rate \nincrease. Representatives Barton and Shadegg are introducing a similar \ninitiative on the House side. This is similar to constitutional \namendments that have been proposed and sometimes passed in States \naround the country. As a matter of fact, my own State of Arizona has \nhad such a proposition.\n  The idea here is that tax increases have almost always been \nantithetical to growth, both in the private sector and to revenues of \nthe Government. At least they have not been helpful. What the Kemp \nCommission suggested is that if we are going to have a single-rate, \nsimple-income Tax Code--scrapping all of the existing code and going to \na new, simpler, fairer single-rate code--we also need to have a \nmechanism in there to prevent the Congress from raising the rates after \nwe get it into effect. I do not know whether the rate will be 17 or 19 \npercent or if it has to be 20 percent. But wherever that rate is set, \nit ought to stay there and it should not be going up over time. Of \ncourse that is the experience with Congress, because there are some, \nand some Presidents, who thought they could raise revenues by raising \ntax rates.\n  I think I have demonstrated that is not true, but it has not stopped \nthem from trying. So we would like to build in a two-thirds requirement \nto approve any tax rate increase. I think that resolution should be \ndebated and considered, along with the recommendations of the Kemp \nCommission, as they are introduced as legislation in force over the \nnext several months. So we are going to be introducing that legislation \nand I will be looking for support to get that moving.\n\n  Mr. President, in the time I have remaining let me just note a couple \nof statistical things of interest, I think. I made the point that the \ntax cuts of the early 1980's demonstrated that we can increase revenues \nby cutting rates. The figures are as follows. Revenues increased from \n$599 billion in fiscal year 1981 to over $990 billion in fiscal year \n1989, an increase of about 65 percent. High tax rates, on the other \nhand, of course we know discourage work, discourage production, savings \nand investment, so there is ultimately less economic activity to tax. \nRevenues amounted to about 19 percent of the gross national product \nwhen the top marginal income tax rate was in the 90 percent range in \nthe 1950's. They amounted to just about the same 19 percent of GNP when \nthe top marginal rate was in the 28 percent range in the 1980's, and \nagain we are at about 19 percent of GNP in the 1970's, one of the \nlongest postwar economic contractions in our history, and also at about \n19 percent during the longest peacetime expansion, the 1980's.\n  The point is, as a percentage of GNP, the tax revenues have been \nalmost constant at 19 percent. You cannot increase revenues as a \npercent of GNP by increasing tax rates.\n  But what you can do is decrease tax rates, increase the size of the \nGNP, and still be at 19 percent of GNP in terms of Federal revenues. \nBut the total dollar amount, of course, is much higher because you have \nincreased the size of the GNP.\n  So the question is not just the percentage but a percentage of what? \nAnd a percentage of a much more vibrant and larger GNP at 19 percent \nobviously represents more tax dollars than 19 percent of a contracting \nand lower gross national product.\n  So that is why we need to focus not just on the question of how much \ntaxes are raised, or cut, but how they are raised. Of course, that is \nwhy we think it is important to have a very firm consensus in the \nCongress. In this case, we would like to have a two-thirds vote to \napprove any kind of tax increase. But more importantly, as the Kemp \nCommission recommends, we would like to have a reduction in tax rates, \nwhich we think will then produce a higher GNP and at least the same \npercent of revenues to the Federal Treasury.\n  Let me just read one quotation. Then I will conclude this point from \nthe Kemp Commission report.\n\n       The roller coaster ride of tax policy in the past few \n     decades has spent citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real long-term reform while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low tax rate \n     of the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and \n     anger when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less \n     than 7 years. The commission concludes that a two-thirds \n     supermajority vote of Congress will earn American's \n     confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of \n     any new tax system.\n\n  That is why, Mr. President, we think it is important to introduce \nthis constitutional amendment to require two-thirds of Congress to \nsupport a tax increase for stability and for predictability so the \nAmerican people have confidence that, if we go to a single rate, a \nsimpler and fairer tax system, as the Kemp Commission recommends and we \nset a rate to produce the revenues that we are gathering today to the \nFederal Treasury, that Congress is not going to come along later and \nbegin increasing that rate, because clearly, once most of the \ndeductions and exemptions are eliminated, then taxpayers will no longer \nhave those areas in which to retreat when rates are raised, which has \nbeen historically what has happened. Americans adjust their behavior in \norder not to pay taxes. They will buy municipal bonds so they do not \nhave to pay taxes, for example.\n  What we are saying, if we eliminate most of, or many of, those \nreductions, or exemptions, or credits, we do not want Congress and the \nPresident then to come along and raise the rates of income tax. That is \nwhy we think it is important to have a two-thirds majority. The Kemp \nCommission made the recommendations to eliminate the estate tax, to \nprovide full deductibility of payroll taxes so that working Americans \nare not taxed on a tax. I think that would be a good idea. They \nencourage us to consider deductibility of charitable contributions and \nmortgage interest deductions. I think that debate needs to occur \nbecause that will affect the rate at which we end up having to set \nincome tax, if we are going to have a single rate. The higher the \ndeduction for mortgage interest, for example, the higher the single \nrate will have to be. We will have to consider what that tradeoff tells \nus in terms of actual tax policy.\n\n  I am hopeful during this Presidential campaign that, armed with the \nKemp Commission report, the candidates will get out there and debate \nthis concept thoroughly, and that the American people will evaluate the \ndifferent proposals. I am not an advocate of any specific proposal, but \nI think each of them has some merit. What we ought to be focusing on is \nthe end result here of a simpler, fairer, predictable tax structure. If \nwe can do that, then I am sure the specific decisions we make will fall \ninto line. But the American people need to focus on that during the \ncampaign, need to question the candidates, and need to come to some \nkind of conclusion as to what they want us to do.\n  I am hoping that the next election will result in a mandate of sorts \nthat in 1997 will cause us to come together and conclude that the \nAmerican people have spoken in the election, they have supported \ncandidates who generally believe in a certain approach to income tax \nreform, and then in 1997 we will begin the legislative process of \nfundamentally reforming our Tax Code.\n  What I would like to do beginning this week is to begin the debate on \nthe two-thirds supermajority because it would be the only \nconstitutional amendment that would accompany the Kemp Commission \nrecommendations. It is going to take longer to put into effect. We know \nby historical reference that constitutional amendments do not pass very \nquickly around here, and they should not. That is why we want to begin \nthe debate now so that by the time we debate legislative changes in the \nTax Code we will have been able to \n\n[[Page S582]]\nthoroughly air this constitutional proposal as well as perhaps pass the \nbill at the same time because clearly we would want to be able to \nrestrict future Congresses' ability to raise taxes.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line here is, yes, we need to focus on \nbalancing the budget, on pinching pennies, and on saving in every way \nwe can so we are not spending taxpayer dollars unwisely. That has been \nour focus all this year. We came close to getting a balanced budget \nagreement, but we did not quite do it. It would still be nice, if we \ncould. Since we have not been able to, I think we have to focus equally \non the other side. How do we get the economy growing again, moving \nforward, providing opportunity for growth, for job creation, for \nentrepreneurship, and for capital infusion for the economy. And the \nbest way to do that is to follow the recommendations of the Kemp \nCommission--to give everybody a better opportunity by having a simpler, \nfairer, single-rate Tax Code.\n\n  I look forward to this debate in the ensuing weeks and months. I hope \nmany of my colleagues will join me in sponsorship of the constitutional \namendment to require a two-thirds vote to approve any income tax rate \nincreases.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, let me stand up and be the \nfirst one to officially accept the challenge made by the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona. He is absolutely correct in his analysis as to \nwhat is happening in the country right now. It is refreshing to listen \nto someone who can look at historical data and come to a decision that \nis really incontrovertible.\n  The Senator from Arizona quoted the Kemp report as to what can happen \nin order to stimulate the economy and actually result in increasing \nrevenues by reducing marginal tax rates. If we think back and look at \nwhat happened in 1980, the total revenues derived from our marginal tax \nrates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. And during that \n10-year period, we had a greater reduction in marginal rates, including \ncapital gains. Obviously, what happened is exactly what the Senator is \nsuggesting would happen in the future if we would we do this now.\n  I have heard so many times on this floor people say look what \nhappened in the 1980's when we had a President who was reducing tax \nrates and the deficit went up. The deficit went up not because revenues \nwere not coming in. Clearly they were coming in at a much more rapid \nrate as a result of giving the free enterprise system a chance to \nbreathe by reducing marginal rates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S582-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S582-S583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE MISSILE THREAT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wanted to take just a moment, Mr. President, to mention \nsomething else that will be very dear to the heart of our previous \nspeaker, Senator John Kyl, from Arizona. I am sure, since he was quoted \nin the article that I am about to quote, that he shares my concern over \nan article that appeared in the Washington Times yesterday entitled \n``Missile Threat Report Politicized, GOP Says.''\n  I will just read the first paragraph of this article. It says:\n\n       A new intelligence estimate by the Clinton administration \n     which foresees no ballistic missile threat to the United \n     States for at least 15 years enraged GOP lawmakers who want \n     to deploy a defense against a limited missile attack.\n\n  This is factual. I am one of those who was enraged because there is a \nlot of redundancy here. We have stood on this floor. We have tried \nthrough talk radio, through every other means possible, to convince the \nAmerican people that we really do have a very serious threat out there. \nThis estimate was made by the national intelligence estimate which only \na year ago stated, as was pointed out by Senator Kyl, that there is a \nrisk out there. And it specifically talked about North Korea and the \nTaepo Dong II missile that would have the capability--this was a year \nago--of reaching Hawaii and Alaska by the year 2000 and the Continental \nUnited States by the year 2002.\n  We just had a defense authorization bill that was vetoed by President \nClinton. In his veto message he said we did not want to spend that \nmoney on a missile defense system to defend Americans against a missile \nattack. This is something that came not too long after the statement \nmade by James Woolsey, who was the CIA Director appointed by President \nClinton, that between 20 and 25 nations either have, or are developing, \nweapons of mass destruction, either chemical, biological or nuclear, \nand the missile means to deliver them. We also know that there are \ncountries, as he pointed out, that now have this technology, and what \nthey have they will sell.\n  This article goes on to report that the new national intelligence \nestimate indicates that it is very unlikely that any of the countries \nwith this missile technology would sell it. I find that very difficult \nto believe when you look at such countries as China and North Korea. \nThen you look at countries in the Middle East that have an abundance of \nwealth due to their oil holdings--Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, any number \nof countries--and you begin to realize that they could be willing \nbuyers, not to mention in potential nations which could be inclined to \nfire a missile at the United States.\n  I have to say this. I hesitate to stand on the floor of the Senate \nand make this statement, but I tend to think that this national \nintelligence estimate was dramatically influenced by the White House.\n  It was just a week ago that we heard the State of the Union Message \nwhen the President of the United States made a statement that seemingly \nwent unnoticed when he said that we are changing the role of our \nmilitary from defense to peacemaking. Earlier, in vetoing the defense \nauthorization bill, he talked about the fact that there is a linkage \nbetween the START II arms limitation agreement that was supported and \nratified by this body a couple of days ago and the 1972 ABM Treaty.\n  Well, I have questioned that linkage, but since the President \nbelieves it is there, I have to go back and talk about it and see how \nthat relates to this article that came out just yesterday. The ABM \nTreaty was put together, it was a philosophy that was articulated for \nnational defense to defend our strategic interests by the Nixon \nadministration, by Dr. Henry Kissinger.\n  Back at that time, they formulated a plan that was called MAD, \nmutually assured destruction, and what we were talking about at that \ntime was we only had two superpowers in the world. We had the U.S.S.R. \nand the United States of America. They said, ``Well, I tell you what. \nYou don't defend yourselves; we won't defend ourselves. If somebody \nshoots at us, we'll shoot back and we all die.'' That was fine. That \nwas the policy. I did not agree with it at that time, but at least it \nwas predicated on the assumption there were two superpowers in the \nworld, and at that time it was true, the U.S.S.R. and the United States \nof America.\n  Now, in light of the statement of James Woolsey and of what our \nintelligence has reported to us, there are probably 25 countries now \nthat have this power. So we are not talking about just two.\n  In a way, I think things were more secure back during the cold war; \nat least then we could identify a singular enemy. Now we do not know \nwhere it is coming from. So if the President has his way and we are to \naccept his idea of continuing a policy that was articulated and \nestablished back in 1972 of mutually assured destruction--assuming, of \ncourse, that Russia, which is the other party of this policy, this \nbeing the START II Treaty, if they do what they say they will do--and \ntheir performance is not very good in the past in their arms reduction \ncommitment--but assuming that they do, then you have Russia and the \nUnited States reducing our nuclear capability at the same time there \nare 24 other nations out there that are not reducing theirs; they are \nraising theirs.\n  That is the situation, the environment that we find ourselves in \ntoday. I felt we could win this argument on the debate because the \nAmerican people are intelligent people. There are a lot of ways of \ngetting to the American people and getting the truth that is not \nfiltered through the Washington, DC, media, and that is going straight \non talk radio and other means. \n\n[[Page S583]]\n\n  Now, all of a sudden, as reported in yesterday's paper, we are \nconfronted with this dramatic conversion in the national intelligence \nestimate from one that only a year ago said we were under a threat of \nnuclear attack within 5 years to one that now says there is no problem \nfor the next 15 years. This is very disturbing because to most people, \nit is surely an implausible conclusion.\n  If you look at the hits that have been taken on the budget that \nSenator Kyl was talking about, the only real reduction that we have had \nduring this administration is in our military capability. We have \nconsistently, time and time again each year for 10 consecutive years, \nreduced our military spending while all other spending has gone up.\n  The Senator from Arizona quoted President Kennedy. The more I hear \nquotes of President Kennedy, the more he sounds like a present-day \nRepublican. He did make the statements that Senator Kyl mentioned. But \nhe also recognized back in 1961, when he developed his first budget, \nthat we had to have a strong national defense. And the first budget \nunder President Kennedy had 50 percent for military and 30 percent for \nhuman resources. Today, in the budget we have, only 17 percent is for \nmilitary and defense and 60 percent is for human resources. So it is \njust reversed, and yet we are saying this at a time when some would \nlike to lull the American people into believing that there is no threat \nout there when, in fact, we know that there is. So it may be only a \nhandful of us in the Senate who are going to do our very best to keep \nAmerica strong. And, again, I would reiterate my concern about what was \nreported in the article that just came out in yesterday's paper. I am \npersonally outraged that this critically important estimate of the \nthreat to our national security has been totally reversed from previous \nestimates seemingly just to support a position that the President is \nholding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis remarks on the report in the Washington Times concerning the \npotential threat of ballistic missiles from not only North Korea but \nother nations around the world, and the apparent modification of the \nthreat estimate from our security agencies.\n  Both of us sit on the Intelligence Committee and are well aware of \nthe work that goes into our national intelligence estimates, well aware \nof the difficulty in gathering information and analyzing it, and the \ndifficulty really of discussing the analysis in a way that does not \ncompromise our ability to gather that information.\n  The public does need to know that the factual information acquired \nover the years about the potential threat specifically from North Korea \nled to some conclusions in 1995 that were very disturbing. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma just reiterated several of them.\n  I would add that Admiral Studeman, then the acting Director, \ntestified publicly a year ago that the North Koreans could be expected \nto deploy a missile within 3 to 5 years and that that missile could \nreach the United States of America. Why this is important is that some \nMembers of the Congress have used a revision in the intelligence \nestimate to say there is no problem and therefore we do not need to \nfund ballistic missile defense.\n  A year ago, the national intelligence estimate clearly would have led \nanybody to the conclusion that we needed to move forward with ballistic \nmissile defense. Now, a year later, the estimate is that that is not \nnecessarily required because countries like North Korea may not be in a \nposition to deploy a missile that could harm the United States as early \nas we thought. But the facts have not changed, and that is what \ndisturbs Senator Inhofe; it is what disturbs me. If the facts have not \nchanged, what has changed? Has there been a change in the methodology \nof the assessment? If so, I am not aware of it. I intend to find out. \nMight there be other considerations for reaching a different conclusion \nbased on the same information?\n  I know the newspaper article speculated that politics could be \ninvolved. I would find it very hard to believe that the Central \nIntelligence Agency would permit that to happen. But something \nhappened. And I think we have to find out because in this matter we are \ntalking about the most serious possible consequences. It is literally a \npotential life and death situation.\n  If, in fact, according to our intelligence estimates, countries that \nare unfriendly to the United States are going to develop capabilities \nthat they could use against us in the very near future, we have to be \nprepared to deal with that, period. If, on the other hand, that threat \nis further away than we originally thought, we have a little bit more \nflexibility in determining when and how to respond. But it is important \nthat the information be real and that it not be subjected to rose-\ncolored filters of some kind either based upon hope or based upon \npolitics.\n  As I said, I cannot believe that anybody in the administration would \nskew the analysis of such an important matter just in order to cause \nthe Congress not to move forward robustly with the ballistic missile \ndefense system. That is why Senator Inhofe and I and others are going \nto get to the bottom of this and determine whether or not there is a \nreason for the change in the estimate.\n  But the interesting part of this, Mr. President, is that it probably \ndoes not matter one way or the other in the sense that, if we began \ntoday to get on with the job of developing and deploying an effective \nballistic missile defense system, it still would not be ready by the \ntime the threat is said to exist.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. We need to move forward as robustly as we can.\n  I would be glad to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was hoping it would come out that the Defense \nauthorization bill would have put us in the position to deploy a \nsystem, a very crude system, a very basic system, by the year 2003. The \nestimates are that this would actually be 2 years beyond the time when \nthe threat would exist, so we would still have 2 years of \nvulnerability. I believe I am correct when I say that.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is absolutely correct, which is why it makes it \nso important for the Senator from Oklahoma to have brought this to the \nSenate floor today. Even if you assume the most conservative estimate--\nor I should say the most liberal estimate--of the time that the threat \nwill be there, we are still not moving forward to meet that threat.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator would yield further, it is also very \nimportant, any time a discussion or debate takes place like this, to \nremind the American people and ourselves in this body that we have a \nsystem that is about 80 to 85 percent paid for right now. We have \napproximately $40 billion already invested in the Navy's Aegis system \nthat we are merely trying to upgrade to reach into the upper tier.\n  I would have to say that what offends me more than anything else, \nbecause I watch it at work, are the liberals who do not want to invest \nany money at all in a national defense system, referring to it as star \nwars because what you get in your head when you hear ``star wars'' is \nthat it is some kind of an image of something from Buck Rogers--some of \nyou may not remember that--or science fiction, when in fact anyone who \nwas watching CNN during the Persian Gulf war knows the technology is \nthere. This is something for which the technology is here.\n  We are almost there. It is a matter of spending a little more, about \n10 percent more than what we have already spent to be able to defend \nourselves against missile attack.\n  I did not really become wrapped up in this issue, Mr. President, \nuntil the bombing took place in my State of Oklahoma. I saw all the \ndisaster surrounding that. I watched and heard the stories, and I knew \npeople who were in there, people later found to be dead. I looked at \nthat and I thought, that bomb was equal to 1 ton of TNT. The smallest \nnuclear warhead that we know of today is 1,000 times that size.\n  If you multiply the disaster that the whole world grieved over in \nOklahoma \n\n[[Page S584]]\nCity, multiply that by 1,000, it gives you some idea. Maybe it is the \nfact that this magnitude is more than we can comprehend. I do not know.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could make another comment. Perhaps the Senator from \nOklahoma would want to add to this, too.\n  Let us go back a little bit and put this in perspective. The weapon \nthat killed 28 Americans in Saudi Arabia during the gulf war was a \nconventional explosive organ, just high explosives they call it, and \nyet the single largest number of American casualties occurred in that \none instant. And 28 Americans died when that 1 Scud missile hit the \nbarracks in Saudi Arabia. That was a relatively crude Scud missile with \na range of maybe 300 miles or thereabouts.\n  The point is that every year countries learn how to cause their \nmissiles to go farther and farther and farther, and they put heavier \npayloads on them, and they make them more accurate in terms of where \nthey will fall.\n  What our intelligence has been telling us about the North Korean \nmissile is that they are on a subsequent generation now. They have \nalready developed missiles that will go these intermediate distances. \nThey are working on missiles that will go farther and farther and \nfarther. So what we are trying to do is estimate just when will it be \nthat they will have advanced to the point that they can deliver that \nwarhead all the way to the United States? We cannot tell that with \nprecision. We do not know when that will happen. But the information we \nhad suggested they were now getting along to the point where it would \nbe perhaps within 3 to 5 years that they had that capability. That is \nwhat we are talking about here.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think that is interesting because it was a week ago \ntoday in the New York Times that a story came out about China, making \nreference to the fact that they were talking about possible missile \nattacks against Taiwan. But do not worry, they said, because the \nAmericans are not going to go to Taiwan's defense because they are more \nconcerned about Los Angeles than they are about Taipei.\n  What does that tell you? Certainly there is an interpretation on that \nthat could be very close to a warning to us. It just bothers me that we \nin this country have adopted a policy, just during this administration \nand specifically this year, that we are going to be downgrading our \nnuclear capability, our missile technology, our capability when, as the \nSenator from Arizona states, the rest of the countries are raising \ntheirs up.\n  If there is one lesson from the Persian Gulf war that the American \npeople learned, it is that the leader of that country is capable of \ndoing anything. If he had a missile, I do not doubt that most people in \nAmerica believe he would use it.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator from Oklahoma would like to respond to this: \nIs it not a fact that Saddam Hussein said that if he had had the bomb, \nhe would have used it? I know Muammar Qadhafi said that, the leader of \nLibya.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. It seems to me Saddam Hussein said the same thing.\n  May I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. He went on to say, ``If we waited, if the war was 2 years \nfrom now, we would have the capability.''\n  Mr. KYL. The nuclear capability.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Suppose it is 3 or 4 years from now and the North Koreans \nhave a missile which has enough range now to finally hit the \ncontinental United States or even, Mr. President, Alaska or Hawaii--\nmaybe even just Japan, although presumably they are already there. \nNorth Korea clearly could get into Japan at this point.\n  But suppose they had a missile that could get to Hawaii or Alaska, \nand they decide that they have had it with Taiwan, that they have \nthreatened Taiwan long enough and it is time for them to incorporate \nTaiwan into China, not only in a rhetorical and political sense, but in \nan actual and military sense; therefore, they are going to threaten \nTaiwan with obliteration if it does not agree to become an effective \npart of the Chinese Government--they call themselves a state now, but \nthey are not subject to the government in Beijing--suppose that China \nbegins rattling its sword and says, ``We are now going to do this,'' \nand Taiwan has to go along. And the United States says, ``No. We have a \ntreaty obligation, or we have obligations, in any event, if not rising \nto the level of a treaty, which have commitments to Taiwan to protect \nthem in the event you attack.'' And the North Koreans say, or the \nChinese, either one, says, ``Well, we have weapons that we know can \nreach Alaska and Hawaii, and you know that, too. So we would suggest \nthat you not step in the way of China taking over Taiwan or step in the \nway of North Korea taking over South Korea,'' whatever the target \nbetween China and North Korea would be.\n  What do you think the United States would do in that event, if we \nknew that if the Chinese taking over Taiwan or the North Koreans taking \nover South Korea could launch a missile against the United States and \nwe could not stop them? Would we intervene militarily to protect South \nKorea against North Korea or Taiwan against China?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will respond to the Senator from Arizona. It is even \nmore complicated than that, assuming we continue our present course of \nblindly adhering this to the provisions of the ABM Treaty. Taking the \nsame scenario, if we have an Aegis ship in Sea of Japan, and two \nmissiles are launched from, say, China or North Korea--one bound for \nTaiwan and one bound for Los Angeles, we could very well be in the \nadsurd position of being fully able to intercept the one bound for \nTaiwan, but not the one bound for Los Angeles, because that would be a \nviolation of the ABM Treaty.\n  We have debated this before as to the fact that the ABM Treaty does \nnot have valid application today. In fact, it was Henry Kissinger, the \narchitect of the treaty, who said to me--and you can quote me, he said, \n``It's nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.''\n  So this is the environment that we are dealing with. I am very \nthankful to the leadership of the Senator from Arizona and a few others \nwho share our concern over the vulnerability of the United States.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma bringing this issue \nup. I also know that the Senator in the chair, the Senator from New \nHampshire, has a very strong voice speaking in favor of the development \nand deployment of the U.S. ballistic missile defense system, and I \nthank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S583-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S584-S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I inquire of the Chair what is the current order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 1541, the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, I spoke on the \nfloor of the importance of this Senate dealing with farm policy in a \ntimely manner that sends the appropriate signals to American \nagriculture of what they can expect in the reform policy that the 104th \nCongress is proposing.\n  This afternoon, I earlier spoke of the commodity programs and how \nthey would be affected as we move with production agriculture much \ncloser to the market and away from a Government program with which to \nfarm.\n  There is a good deal more that Government can do for agriculture and \nstill stay out of the business of telling them what to grow and how to \ngrow it, because I think that is the responsibility of the family \nfarmer, and I think that family farmer, or anybody in agriculture \ntoday, ought to be attuned to the market and ought to be farming to the \nmarket and deciding what his or her business may be, to what the world \nneeds and what our consuming public needs than what a Government \nprogram will provide them or not provide them in telling them what to \ndo.\n  In other words, what I am saying, Mr. President, is there are \nlegitimate roles for the Federal Government in its association with \nagriculture. I think some \n\n[[Page S585]]\nof those obvious areas are in the area of research, trade and \nconservation. I say that because where Government should involve itself \nis where the individual farmer or family farmer really cannot help \nthemselves or cannot help themselves in an individual way.\n  American farmers, without question, lead the world in productivity. \nOne American farmer today, and we have all heard it said, produces \nenough for himself or herself and 120 other citizens. It was not very \nlong ago, at least it was not very long ago in this Senator's mind, \nwhen I was traveling as a national officer for the Future Farmers of \nAmerica in the 1960's, the midsixties.\n  I remember well giving speech after speech where I spoke of the \nproductivity of the American farmer. I oftentimes said that the \nAmerican farmer produces enough for himself and 52 other Americans or \n52 other citizens of the world. I just got through saying in 1996 that \nthe American farmer produces enough for himself or herself and 120 \nother Americans or world citizens. Is it possible that productivity has \nmore than doubled in 30-plus years? That is absolutely right, Mr. \nPresident, and the reason it has is because of research, the kind of \nresearch long term that has been done in direct association with the \nFederal Government where we, as taxpayers and as policymakers, can \nrecognize the importance of long-term investment in the research area \nand that is, of course, where our land grant colleges and universities \nand our ag research stations have worked so very well over the years.\n\n  That is a legitimate role. That is the right kind of role that \nGovernment can play an important part in doing and, of course, that is \nwhere we ought to continue to work so closely together.\n  The different varieties, the E. coli bacteria problem that has cost \nlives in this country, can be dealt with and solved by the simple \napplication of some research and by the proper education that can be a \npart and should be a part of a Government's role in participating with \nproduction agriculture.\n  In my State of Idaho, there are some extraordinary things being done. \nJust recently, I was part of an announcement between USDA and the \nDepartment of Energy working cooperatively in a new research program. \nYou scratch your head and say, ``Well, what is the Department of Energy \ndoing in agriculture?'' Because of the kind of technology that has been \ndeveloped in DOE, in sensors, in the ability to use satellite and \nsatellite technology, USDA and DOE are coming together in a project out \nin Idaho that literally links the farmer and his or her tractor and \napplicator on the ground with a satellite back to a computer to tell \nthem exactly where they are in the field, how much fertilizer to apply \nor not to apply. Phenomenal efficiencies come from the application, a \ngreater sense of environmental control comes from the application and, \nas a result, cost savings and extremely high levels of productivity.\n  Could that be done by the individual farmer? No, it certainly cannot \nbe done. Can it be done by industry? Not very well. When the kind of \nresearch and turnaround time is measured in decades, that is where \nGovernment can play a role, and that is where this Congress recognizes \nGovernment should play a role. It is a much better place for Government \nto be associated with agriculture than telling the farmer what to farm, \ntelling them how to farm it, and oftentimes then saying, ``And we'll \nprovide you a safety net at the end.''\n  While we recognize the importance of those kinds of commodity \nprograms, what our bill says and what we are clearly saying in the \n104th Congress, as we have said over the last decade to production \nagriculture, learn to farm to the market and not to the program.\n  The other area that I mention this afternoon is in the area of trade. \nObviously, if we are as highly productive as I mentioned we are, then \nwe have to have a market for our crops. That kind of productivity, \nabsent the market, says that we are not going to get the kind of price \nfor the product that deserves to be had and certainly provide that kind \nof profitability. Therefore, it is important that we have a strong \ndomestic trade policy and, as we know, trade means you have to involve \ngovernments, you have to cross political boundaries, and that cannot be \naccomplished very well oftentimes by the individual farmer unless it is \nthe Government working with their farmers to accomplish that.\n  In my State of Idaho, almost three-fourths of our annual wheat crop \nis exported. It has to move in world markets to maintain levels of \nprofitability. In addition, we send large amounts of meat, peas, \nlentils, dairy products, and potato products to other countries around \nthe world. Since the passage of NAFTA, we have seen some positive and \nsome negative results. Cattle producers in my State are increasingly \nworried about the slaughter cattle moving in across the boundary, both \nfrom Mexico and from Canada.\n  Now and in the future, we must be assured that our trade negotiations \nand our trade policy fairly represents American agriculture, and if we \nare to walk away from and work with agriculture to move away from the \nkind of direct Federal payment and safety net to productivity in the \nmarketplace, we have to make sure that they have full access to foreign \nmarkets. That is a legitimate role of Government associated with \nagriculture.\n  We also must continue our effort to develop and maintain the foreign \nmarket by investing in those markets, by working with production \nagriculture to teach foreign consumers how to consume the agricultural \nproducts of this country. That is an important and successful \npartnership that has worked time and time again over the years, whether \nit is actually the development of wheat products in China that my State \nhas been involved in with the Federal Government and our wheat growers, \nto the marketing of lentils somewhere in the Middle East and to a \nmarket use and expanded diversity in their use in the recipes of the \nMideasterners. That is all a role, once again, that Government plays \nvery successfully.\n  So let me urge my colleagues to support all of these approaches. It \nis one thing to say we are going to simply provide for agriculture, and \nhistorically that is some of what we did to what we have been saying \nfor the last decade: American agriculture, farm to the market, be \nproductive, do what you know how to do and do it well, and then we will \nhelp you break down the foreign barriers which will access you to the \nworld so that you can be productive.\n  The third area that I believe Government can play a cooperative \npartnership role in is in the area of conservation. For example, the \nCRP program, while originally quite controversial in its introduction, \nhas proved to be a highly successful program in the saving of topsoil \nand the improving of water quality and wildlife habitat.\n  In my State of Idaho, almost 850,000 acres went into CRP. The record \nis now very, very clear of the tremendously positive effect, converting \nthose acreages into sod bases, and what allowing them to rest \nundisturbed has done for all of the areas I have mentioned, including \nwildlife habitat. Upland game bird population increases in my State \nhave been very dramatic as a result of these programs.\n  So that, again, is the kind of partnership that the Government can \nassociate itself with, and I think oftentimes should. Targeting truly \nerodible lands, we can continue a successful program under a voluntary \nparticipation. I believe, Mr. President, voluntary is the key when we \ndiscuss agricultural conservation. We have made some changes over the \nyears that I have not liked and that American agriculture has not \nliked.\n  We, historically, did allow Government to work in a voluntary, \ncooperative way with production agriculture, except in the mid 1980's, \nwhen we started making some changes and making conservation policy \nmandatory, and dictating. We started saying to the USDA, ``You are \ngoing to be the cop out in the field saying, `You are doing it wrong, \nand you have to do it differently or suffer the consequences.' '' When \nthat kind of news hit the ground--and we saw it in the late 1980's--\nrelationships and partnerships began to change. There was no longer the \nvoluntary aspect that had caused the conservation program to be as \nsuccessful as it was. And we heard about it, very loudly and clearly, \nthis year as we held hearings on this issue in the subcommittee, which \nI chair.\n  Conservation, partnership, cooperation, and voluntary relationships \nhave \n\n[[Page S586]]\nproven very successful over the years. Any other form and our resource \nbase suffers, and it should not have to suffer. Farmers and ranchers, \nin my opinion, always have been, and must always be, the original \nenvironmentalists. We are the groundskeepers, the stewards of the \nprivate land, and the private land is the largest base in this country. \nIf we are going to have a positive environment, that private property \nbase must recognize the responsibility it has, and it has successfully \ndone so over the years, whether it is erodible lands or whether it is \nthe wetlands that we dealt with in the sod buster provisions of the \nfarm bill of a few years ago and now, working with that again, to not \nmake it so punitive, to make it cooperative, to include wetlands in the \nCRP base, so that you reward the farmer for moving that land out of \nproduction and into a protected type of classification, is what we \nought to be doing, because we all recognize the value of wetlands to \nour Nation as a habitat and as a filtering system to the aquifers and \nto the productive sector of our country. That is cooperation, \npartnership, and that is the way it ought to be.\n  I am certainly pleased that the kind of legislation that I have \nhelped craft this year in revamping and bringing forth the new farm \nbill fits these criteria and moves us in a direction that I think most \nof production agriculture wants to move in. It puts Government in a \nrelationship that it ought to be in.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, just a few minutes ago, I was occupying the \nchair, as the Senator from Arizona is now, and I witnessed, first, a \nfew remarks by the Senator from Arizona regarding the two-thirds \nsupermajority vote for a tax increase, legislation that he is planning \nto introduce. And later, hearing the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Inhofe, come down and engage in a debate on both that \nissue with the Senator from Arizona and the issue of ballistic missile \ndefense, I was very much taken by the debate.\n  First of all, I want to compliment both the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Oklahoma for the distinguished service they have given \ntheir country just in allowing this dialog to come to the forefront. In \nthe case of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Oklahoma, I \nhave worked very closely with both of them on this ballistic missile \ndefense matter, taking that issue first, knowing that here we have a \nsituation where the entire defense authorization bill was held hostage \nby the President of the United States because he did not want national \nmissile defense. Not only did he not want national missile defense, he \ndid not even want language talking about national missile defense. So \nin order to get a pay raise for our military, whom the President of the \nUnited States sent to Bosnia, we had to agree to take missile defense \nlanguage out of the bill.\n  What came to my mind as I listened to the debate between my two \ncolleagues was one simple line: Elections have consequences. I found \nmyself saying that if a President sat down at the White House who \nshared the philosophy of the Senators from Arizona and Oklahoma, \nsticking to missile defense, we would have had a Defense authorization \nbill not only with language, but with a real direction to move toward \nbuilding a defense against incoming ballistic missiles against the \npeople of the United States of America. We now do not have that.\n  As the Senator knows, there have been a number of focus groups where \npeople throughout America have been asked one very basic question: If \nthe United States were fired on by a ballistic missile from another \ncountry, what would the United States do? Overwhelmingly, the response \nis, ``Shoot it down.'' In fact, we know we cannot shoot it down.\n\n  It is shocking to me that a President, and many of the colleagues in \nhis party, would hold a Defense authorization bill hostage to simply \nget that language out. I am outraged by it, to be candid about it. I \nthink that what the Senator from Oklahoma brought to the floor with \nthis intelligence information is shocking. I said to him, privately, as \nhe was leaving the floor, ``I hope that both of you Senators, who are \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee, pursue this diligently because \nit goes really to the heart of our democracy here.'' If, in fact, those \ncharges are true, or even remotely true, as they appeared in the \nWashington Times, that somehow this was falsified, this is a very, very \nserious matter because the defense of the United States of America is \nat stake.\n  I just cannot understand why anyone would not want to do what needs \nto be done to defend American cities and American people. That is our \nobligation. That is one of the primary obligations of the U.S. \nCongress, certainly, as outlined in the Constitution. Yet, we have this \nsituation where a report--and the Senator well knows we heard reports \nto the contrary. I am also on the Armed Services Committee. We heard \nreports to the contrary that this could be a problem within 2, 3, 4, 5 \nyears. Now we are hearing maybe it is 15 years, or even further down \nthe road.\n  Something is wrong, Mr. President, because you and I both know of the \ntechnology that is out there. We know it is being shipped all around \nthe world. The Chinese have this missile technology, the Iraqis have \nit, the Iranians have it, the North Koreans have it, and Qadhafi would \nlike to have it, and he may have it soon. It goes on and on and on.\n  The Senator from Arizona, the occupant of the chair, made an \nexcellent point, which reminded me--and I want to accent it, comment on \nit a little further, expand on it a little further--that when those 28 \nbrave men and women were killed in the Persian Gulf by that missile, \nthat is the first time in the history of America that a missile--in \nthis case a theater missile, but a missile--attacked, hit, and killed \nAmerican service men and women.\n  I find myself thinking, what if we had not had Jack Kennedy, to his \ncredit, as you mentioned, and Ronald Reagan in the positions they were \nin at the time to see to it that we had even just the remotest \npossibility of defending against that missile. As the Senator knows, \nthe missile that was used to shoot that missile down was not designed \nfor that purpose, it was not designed to do that. So this is a very, \nvery serious matter. We investigate a lot of things in the Congress, \nbut if the intelligence community truly has information that says that \nthe threat of attack from an incoming ballistic missile from one of \nthose countries I mentioned, or another one, is possibly 15 years down \nthe road, then I think they need to prove that to the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I do not believe that is going to be the case. I do not think they \ncan prove it. We know the range of these missiles. We know how this \ntechnology is being exported. We know our own technology has in some \ncases been bought and in some cases stolen and has been shipped around \nthe world and in some cases encouraged to be sold by the current \nadministration--certain types of technology which may or may not be \nused in building these missiles.\n  It is a perfect example, again, of one of the basic differences \nbetween the two political parties. So much focus has gone on the budget \ndebate, and rightfully so, that we are trying to turn around 4 years of \nbig government spending. That is a huge issue in and of itself, but \nalso this issue of defending America, the basic responsibility that we \nhave as Government servants of the people of the United States to \npreserve, protect, and defend our country is at stake here.\n  I am certainly going to be pursuing this, as well, on my own and in \nconjunction with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee to find \nout the facts. I hope that we are not going to find that somehow this \nthing was inflated to be something that it is not, and that some \npressure was put on to play this down, because I have been in some \nmeetings over the past several months and years that I have been on the \nArmed Services Committee where I have heard the contrary from very \nhigh-ranking administration and military officials, as I am sure the \nSenator from Arizona has. I am looking forward \n\n[[Page S587]]\nto hearing the results of this investigation. I think it should be on \nthe front burner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S586-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Let me also say in regard to the tax initiative that the \nSenator brought up a few moments ago, this again goes to the heart and \nsoul of the differences between our two parties.\n  George Bush said recently on national television that it might be \nnice if the American people just gave--it has not happened since 1952--\none party, in this case the Republican Party, the opportunity to \ngovern. The Democrats have had that opportunity once under Clinton, \nunder Carter, to do it, and we did not see the debt go down. We did not \nsee deficits diminish. On the contrary, we saw the opposite. Give us a \nshot at it. If we do not do well, throw us out. That is fair. Give us a \nshot. That is what President Bush said.\n  There is such a dramatic difference. How many times have we heard the \ndebate from our friends on the other side that somehow growth is bad, \nmaking a profit is evil, that there is something wrong with that; and \nyet at the same time this debate occurs we see dollars being taken \naway, almost stolen, from the families of America. So we promote big \ngovernment with the dollars taken from our families and at the same \ntime denying them the opportunity to do the things that they would like \nto do for themselves, including education, getting a job, and being \nable to be productive in society.\n\n  There are no jobs, as the Senator pointed out, if there is no growth \nin America and if there is no opportunity for businesses to create \nthose jobs. Government should not be in the business of creating jobs. \nThe economy--business--should be creating jobs. That is what we are all \nabout.\n  Somehow we have gotten into this debate that it is evil for anybody \nto make any money. I am pleased to hear when people make money. It \ndelights me because I know somebody is getting dollars when somebody is \nmaking money.\n  The Senator brought up the point about the luxury tax, which I am \nproud to say I opposed and voted against, where all the people who \nbuilt boats and luxury cars lost their jobs because of the tax \nincrease, and people did not buy then.\n  When are we going to get the message that the greatness of America--\nwe grew more at any time in the history when we did not have an income \ntax. Again, it is taking dollars. If all of the dollars that have been \ntaken away from the American families throughout especially the last 40 \nor 50 years--if it worked, welfare would have been a success. We would \nnot have all the crime we have today. We would not have to be spending \nmoney on crime or on welfare and other things that we find we are not \nsatisfied with in America. The truth is, it has not worked. Since it \nhas not worked, we should try something new.\n  What we have--and you hear the American people say they are tired of \nthe gridlock, the deadlock, tired of you fighting with each other. \nAgain, the issue here is standing for principle, standing up for \nprinciple, because we believe deep in our hearts that these principles \nwe espouse are right, they are correct, and we need to move this \nPresident. He is not moving. We understand that. If he is not moving, \nand we go as far as we go, we go to the American people, and \nessentially the decision is, very simply, we either move on with more \ndebt and more deficits, or we move toward more growth, more economic \nprosperity, and more revenues to the Treasury, as the Senator pointed \nout.\n  Again, going back to the issue of missile defense, same thing--two \nvery, very, important issues, if not the two most important issues that \nwe face today in America, and a President with a distinctly different \nposition than the House and the Senate.\n  I really want to compliment the Senator from Arizona, who is now in \nthe chair, and the Senator from Oklahoma for two very, very worthwhile \npoints in bringing to the attention of the Senate --although it is in \nthe middle of the debate on a farm bill. Sometimes when other Senators \nare not here to participate in that debate, we have the opportunity, \nunder Senate rules, to make these points. They are excellent points. I \nwant to compliment both Senators.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \ncloture and another one I filed earlier will occur back-to-back \nbeginning at 1:30 on Thursday.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the amendment that has just been filed for \nSenator Leahy and myself and others is a substitute to S. 1541 as I \nearlier introduced this afternoon. This substitute is an effort to put \ntogether a bipartisan coalition of Senators with all of us very intent \non producing farm legislation as soon as possible to do exactly what I \ntalked about doing earlier today; that is, sending a clear message to \nthe agricultural community of this country as to the certainty and the \ntiming of key farm bill legislation. There are a variety of adjustments \nin the substitute--the language which deals with $100 million per year \nin additional mandatory funding for crop-oriented conservation cost-\nsharing programs similar to S. 854 that was introduced by Senator Lugar \nand Leahy earlier this year.\n  There is a grazing lands conservation initiative program which will \nencourage innovative rangeland management techniques across the \ncountry. Certainly in my State of Idaho and other States, this can be a \nvaluable resource in improving livestock grazing lands. State technical \ncommitments would make it possible for farmers to serve on these \ncommittees where they now do not have standing.\n  There are some nutritional reauthorizations that would reauthorize \nfood stamps and other nutritional programs for the period of time of \nthis legislation. Much of this will be corrected and adjusted when the \nHouse, the Senate, and the President agree on welfare legislation. \n\n[[Page S588]]\n\n  There is a Northeast dairy compact provision in there to allow New \nEngland States to implement a price enhancement compact. We wish we \ncould have gone further. The House acted yesterday on dairy \nlegislation. Certainly in conference, it is my hope that we can refine \nand clarify dairy policy inside the farm bill for the coming year. The \ndairy industry of our country has worked now for the last 6 months with \nthe House and the Senate Agriculture Committees to arrive at a \ncompromise that reduces the overall budget profile for dairy programs \nand creates greater flexibility in the program. We hope that can get \naccomplished. Certainly there is a conservation foundation in this \nprogram that creates a nonprofit foundation to promote conservation. I \nknow this has been something Senator Leahy has worked at for a good \nnumber of years.\n  There is legislation in here also to deal with wetlands and the \nFlorida Everglades issue. There is a concern that I will express for \nthe Record that deals with this section as it applies to the program \nand the restoration of these vital wetlands in Florida. There is a \nprovision for eminent domain. I think it is very important that the \nRecord show that this Senator and many others recognize that authority \nof the Government, but also recognize under a former Executive order on \nMarch 15, 1988, signed by President Reagan, that Federal departments \nand agencies must consider the takings implication and deal with \nwilling seller-willing buyer. I certainly, through the balance of this \nlegislation, activities, debate, and in the conference, will work with \nthe Senators from Florida to assure that in all instances we have a \nwilling seller-willing buyer relationship as the State of Florida and \nthe Senators from that State work to maintain the Florida Everglades \nand any consideration there with private property acquisition for the \npurpose of enhancement of the Everglades. All of us want to see that \nvaluable natural resource protected. But at the same time, it is very \nimportant that the right of the private property owner be maintained.\n\n  Mr. President, I chair the Private Property Rights Caucus here on the \nHill. We just brought out of the Judiciary Committee the private \nproperty rights bill that I think is sweeping in its protection of \nprivate property rights. It sets the Government on notice. Certainly \nthis legislation, if that act would become law, would fall subject to \nthat new law. That would be important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S587-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, before discussing today's bad news about \nthe Federal debt, how about ``another go,'' as the British put it, with \nour pop quiz. Remember--one question, one answer.\n  The question: How many millions of dollars in a trillion? While you \nare thinking about it, bear in mind that it was the U.S. Congress that \nran up the enormous Federal debt that is now about $13 billion shy of \n$5 trillion.\n  To be exact, as of the close of business Tuesday, January 30, the \ntotal Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $4,987,589,544,052.52. \nAnother depressing figure means that on a per capita basis, every man, \nwoman and child in America owes $18,931.32.\n  Mr. President, back to our quiz (how many million in a trillion?): \nThere are a million million in a trillion, which means that the Federal \nGovernment will shortly owe five million million dollars.\n  Now who's not in favor of balancing the Federal budget?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S588-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S588-S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TIME TO PRIVATIZE THE WILLIAM LANGER PLANT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, late Friday evening the Senate passed by \nvoice vote S. 1544, a bill of mine to permit the conveyance of the \nWilliam Langer Plant to the Job Development Authority of the city of \nRolla, ND. The bill is crucial to the immediate economic future of the \nplant, which is why I sought its expedited approval. I am glad to say \nthat my good friend and senior colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, cosponsored S. 1544, which now goes over to the House.\n  Most of my colleagues have probably never been to Rolla, and do not \nknow what the Langer Plant is, or what it has been doing over the past \nseveral decades. So let me describe the background and purpose of my \nbill.\n  The Langer Plant has roots in the cold war. Back in the 1950's, our \ndefense leadership realized that we lacked the ability to produce jewel \nbearings, which are finely machined bits of carborundum and were \ncrucial components in military avionics systems. So the Congress \nlocated a jewel bearing plant in our State, because of our strategic \nlocation in the middle of the country. The Langer Plant has been making \njewel bearings as a government-owned, contractor-operated facility \nsince the 1950's.\n  My colleagues should also know that the plant is a few miles from the \nTurtle Mountain Indian Reservation. Of the plant's 100 or so employees \nremaining after a downsizing, about 60 percent are Native American. The \nLanger Plant brings crucial skilled jobs to an economically depressed \narea.\n  However, changing technology means that the National Defense \nStockpile no longer needs to buy jewel bearings. The Defense Department \nhas now reported the plant to the General Services Administration as \nsurplus property. Those of my colleagues who are dealing with base \nclosures and defense downsizing know that this situation presents Rolla \nwith a crisis and an opportunity.\n  The future of this factory depends on its ability to become a \ncommercial manufacturer. Normal surplus property rules would require \nthe GSA to sell the plant for fair market value. The problem is that no \nlocal entity can afford the plant, which had an original cost of $4.2 \nmillion. The plant itself is not now healthy enough in a business sense \nto finance its own acquisition by a new management team.\n  In fact, the plant's economic position is so tenuous that the plant \nwill likely run out of money in March, because it has not had a chance \nto build a strong commercial customer base. The plant has worked hard \nto cut costs, and it has already had to cut its workforce by 30 \npercent. I am deeply concerned that the plant may fold before it can be \nauctioned.\n  My colleagues will understand that as a government-owned facility, \nthe plant is not able to compete freely, nor is it eligible for the \nkind of small business or economic development assistance that is \navailable to private sector firms. However, once conveyed, the plant \nwill be in a position to aggressively seek commercial contracts and \nassistance from the State and other agencies.\n  I would like to stress to the Senate that the Rolla community, the \nState of North Dakota, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, and the \nlocal business community have been working hard to ensure that the \nplant makes a successful transition to the private sector. The local \ncommunity is united behind the plan to transfer the Plant to the Job \nDevelopment Authority of the city of Rolla. Of course, the conveyance \nis conditional on the community and the General Services Administration \nreaching a mutually acceptable legal agreement on the conveyance. But I \nam confident that the GSA and the community can reach that agreement \nswiftly.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that in September the Senate \napproved by voice vote an amendment of mine to the defense \nauthorization bill that was exactly identical to the bill that we \npassed on Friday. So this is the second time that the Senate has \napproved this legislation.\n  Let me thank the Chair and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senators Stevens and Glenn, for their support of this bill. \nAnd the Chair and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenators Thurmond and Nunn, have been helpful to me for almost half a \nyear now. Senator McCain has also assisted in expediting this \nconveyance. I am deeply grateful to all five senators and their staffs \nfor the support and assistance they have given me on this matter. \n\n[[Page S589]]\n\n  Mr. President, to sum up, I would simply say that S. 1544 tries to \ngive a helping hand to the Langer Plant and the city of Rolla. It also \nwill relieve the Federal Government of a facility that the Defense \nDepartment no longer needs. I am grateful to the Senate for its \napproval of S. 1544 on Friday, and I look forward to its swift passage \nby the House.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S588-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 11:20 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1868.

FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) a sound and prosperous economy in the United States \n     is dependent on American agriculture and related industries, \n     including producers, processors, handlers, manufacturers, \n     marketers, transporters, and the banking and credit industry;\n       (B) American agriculture and related industries account for \n     over 21,000,000 jobs and approximately 16 percent, or over \n     $1,000,000,000,000, of the gross domestic product; and\n       (C) because of the combined effort of American agriculture \n     and related industries, consumers in the United States enjoy \n     a dependable supply of food and fiber at fair prices;\n       (2)(A) the future of American agriculture is dependent on \n     the continued viability of the American agricultural \n     producer, the underpinning of the agricultural economy; and\n       (B) agricultural producers must receive a fair return on \n     their productivity and investment in an industry \n     characterized by continued subsidized foreign competition and \n     wide fluctuations in production and prices due to weather and \n     related factors;\n       (3)(A) one of the essential elements of a sound \n     agricultural economy is the ability of the United States to \n     compete in the world market;\n       (B) agricultural exports are expected to reach nearly \n     $50,000,000,000 in 1995 and contribute about $20,000,000,000 \n     to the United States balance of trade; and\n       (C) agricultural exports alone account for over 1,000,000 \n     American jobs; and\n       (4)(A) Commodity Credit Corporation outlays for farm \n     programs have declined from a high of approximately \n     $26,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 to less than \n     $9,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, a reduction of over 65 \n     percent that is unique among the many mandatory spending \n     programs of the Federal Government; and\n       (B) according to the Congressional Budget Office, farm \n     program outlays are projected to remain below the outlay \n     level for fiscal year 1995 for the next 5 years and continue \n     to decline by nearly 8 percent, even if no changes are made \n     in current law for existing farm programs.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) continued Federal Government support is necessary to \n     provide stability for American agricultural producers to--\n       (A) enable the producers to continue to provide consumers \n     with a steady and dependable supply of food and fiber at fair \n     prices;\n       (B) maintain the competitiveness of the United States in \n     the world market; and\n       (C) otherwise preserve the underpinnings of a sound \n     agricultural economy; and\n       (2) to meet the objective of achieving a balanced budget \n     for the Federal Government in a manner consistent with \n     paragraph (1), reductions in farm program spending should be \n     made in a fair and equitable manner.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish \n     agricultural price support and production adjustment programs \n     for the 1996 through 2002 crop years that provide a structure \n     for a sound agricultural economy in a manner consistent with \n     subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENDING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the continuation of significant Federal budgetary \n     deficits harms the economic well-being of the United States \n     and is detrimental to the development of sound, long-term \n     agricultural policy;\n       (2) agricultural price support and production adjustment \n     programs are necessary for the continued economic health of \n     United States agriculture, which must compete in \n     international markets against subsidized foreign competition; \n     and\n       (3) agricultural price support and production adjustment \n     programs should be--\n       (A) implemented, to the maximum extent practicable, in a \n     manner that is consistent with the primary goal of the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1996 \n     (H.Con.Res. 67, agreed to June 29, 1995) to end Federal \n     budget deficits; and\n       (B) modified, as necessary, to ensure that the programs \n     comply with applicable budget reconciliation instructions in \n     the concurrent resolution that are designed to end Federal \n     budget deficits, in a manner consistent with section 306 of \n     the concurrent resolution.\n                             TITLE I--WHEAT\n\n     SEC. 101.

The Secretary may include other products of milk, \n     except cheese, within the Class IV classification if the \n     Secretary determines that inclusion of the product would be \n     fair and equitable.\n       (2) Use of classification.--Each marketing order issued \n     with respect to milk and its products under section 8c of the \n     Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c), reenacted with \n     amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of \n     1937, and each comparable State milk marketing order, shall \n     use the classification required by paragraph (1) in lieu of \n     any other classification, such as Class III-A milk, to \n     properly classify milk used to produce butter, butter oil, \n     nonfat dry milk, or dry whole milk.\n       (b) Establishment of Class IV Pool.--The Secretary shall \n     establish a Class IV pool for the purpose of making \n     collections and disbursements related to milk classified as \n     Class IV milk under subsection (a).

CONSERVATION OF PRIVATE GRAZING LAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) privately owned grazing land constitutes nearly \\1/2\\ \n     of the non-Federal land of the United States and is basic to \n     the environmental, social, and economic stability of rural \n     communities;\n       (2) privately owned grazing land contains a complex set of \n     interactions among soil, water, air, plants, and animals;\n       (3) grazing land constitutes the single largest watershed \n     cover type in the United States and contributes significantly \n     to the \n\n[[Page S660]]\n     quality and quantity of water available for all of the many uses of the \n     land;\n       (4) private grazing land constitutes the most extensive \n     wildlife habitat in the United States;\n       (5) private grazing land can provide opportunities for \n     improved nutrient management from land application of animal \n     manures and other by-product nutrient resources;\n       (6) owners and managers of private grazing land need to \n     continue to recognize conservation problems when the problems \n     arise and receive sound technical assistance to improve or \n     conserve grazing land resources to meet ecological and \n     economic demands;\n       (7) new science and technology must continually be made \n     available in a practical manner so owners and managers of \n     private grazing land may make informed decisions concerning \n     vital grazing land resources;\n       (8) agencies of the Department of Agriculture with private \n     grazing land responsibilities are the agencies that have the \n     expertise and experience to provide technical assistance, \n     education, and research to owners and managers of private \n     grazing land for the long-term productivity and ecological \n     health of grazing land;\n       (9) although competing demands on private grazing land \n     resources are greater than ever before, assistance to private \n     owners and managers of private grazing land is currently \n     limited and does not meet the demand and basic need for \n     adequately sustaining or enhancing the private grazing lands \n     resources; and\n       (10) privately owned grazing land can be enhanced to \n     provide many benefits to all Americans through voluntary \n     cooperation among owners and managers of the land, local \n     conservation districts, and the agencies of the Department of \n     Agriculture responsible for providing assistance to owners \n     and managers of land and to conservation districts.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide a \n     coordinated technical, educational, and related assistance \n     program to conserve and enhance private grazing land \n     resources and provide related benefits to all citizens of the \n     United States by--\n       (1) establishing a coordinated and cooperative Federal, \n     State, and local grazing conservation program for management \n     of private grazing land;\n       (2) strengthening technical, educational, and related \n     assistance programs that provide assistance to owners and \n     managers of private grazing land;\n       (3) conserving and improving wildlife habitat on private \n     grazing land;\n       (4) conserving and improving fish habitat and aquatic \n     systems through grazing land conservation treatment;\n       (5) protecting and improving water quality;\n       (6) improving the dependability and consistency of water \n     supplies;\n       (7) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush \n     encroachment problems on private grazing land; and\n       (8) integrating conservation planning and management \n     decisions by owners and managers of private grazing land, on \n     a voluntary basis.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Private grazing land.--The term ``private grazing \n     land'' means privately owned, State-owned, tribally-owned, \n     and any other non-federally owned rangeland, pastureland, \n     grazed forest land, and hay land.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture, acting through the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service.\n       (d) Private Grazing Land Conservation Assistance.--\n       (1) Assistance to grazing landowners and others.--Subject \n     to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall \n     establish a voluntary program to provide technical, \n     educational, and related assistance to owners and managers of \n     private grazing land and public agencies, through local \n     conservation districts, to enable the landowners, managers, \n     and public agencies to voluntarily carry out activities that \n     are consistent with this section, including--\n       (A) maintaining and improving private grazing land and the \n     multiple values and uses that depend on private grazing land;\n       (B) implementing grazing land management technologies;\n       (C) managing resources on private grazing land, including--\n       (i) planning, managing, and treating private grazing land \n     resources;\n       (ii) ensuring the long-term sustainability of private \n     grazing land resources;\n       (iii) harvesting, processing, and marketing private grazing \n     land resources; and\n       (iv) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush \n     encroachment problems;\n       (D) protecting and improving the quality and quantity of \n     water yields from private grazing land;\n       (E) maintaining and improving wildlife and fish habitat on \n     private grazing land;\n       (F) enhancing recreational opportunities on private grazing \n     land;\n       (G) maintaining and improving the aesthetic character of \n     private grazing lands; and\n       (H) identifying the opportunities and encouraging the \n     diversification of private grazing land enterprises.\n       (2) Program elements.--\n       (A) Funding.--The program under paragraph (1) shall be \n     funded through a specific line-item in the annual \n     appropriations for the Natural Resources Conservation \n     Service.\n       (B) Technical assistance and education.--Personnel of the \n     Department of Agriculture trained in pasture and range \n     management shall be made available under the program to \n     deliver and coordinate technical assistance and education to \n     owners and managers of private grazing land, at the request \n     of the owners and managers.\n       (e) Grazing Technical Assistance Self-Help.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) there is a severe lack of technical assistance for \n     grazing producers;\n       (B) the Federal budget precludes any significant expansion, \n     and may force a reduction of, current levels of technical \n     support; and\n       (C) farmers and ranchers have a history of cooperatively \n     working together to address common needs in the promotion of \n     their products and in the drainage of wet areas through \n     drainage districts.\n       (2) Establishment of grazing demonstration.--The Secretary \n     may establish 2 grazing management demonstration districts at \n     the recommendation of the Grazing Lands Conservation \n     Initiative Steering Committee.\n       (3) Procedure.--\n       (A) Proposal.--Within a reasonable time after the \n     submission of a request of an organization of farmers or \n     ranchers engaged in grazing, the Secretary shall propose that \n     a grazing management district be established.\n       (B) Funding.--The terms and conditions of the funding and \n     operation of the grazing management district shall be \n     proposed by the producers.\n       (C) Approval.--The Secretary shall approve the proposal if \n     the Secretary determines that the proposal--\n       (i) is reasonable;\n       (ii) will promote sound grazing practices;

Mr. President, the New York Times carried an \narticle titled ``As China Threatens Taiwan, It Makes Sure U.S. \nListens,'' written by Patrick E. Tyler, about irresponsible talk from \nChinese leaders against Taiwan. I ask that the article be printed at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  It is the kind of talk that inevitably sours relations between China \nand the United States but, also, causes apprehension among the entire \ncommunity of nations.\n  The United States made a mistake in the Shanghai Communique of not \nrecognizing that Taiwan and China, in fact, today are two separate \ncountries. If they eventually want to merge as East Germany and West \nGermany did, that is up to them.\n  But China should not think that when we read accounts like that in \nthe New York Times, we sit idly by and think that it makes no \ndifference. The New York Times editorial response to it, which I ask to \nbe printed at the end of my remarks, is appropriate.\n  I want a good relationship with China. All of my colleagues want a \ngood relationship with China. But China is impeding the possibility of \nthat good relationship with its threats to Taiwan.\n  The New York Times article and editorial response follow:\n\n     As China Threatens Taiwan, It Makes Sure United States Listens\n\n                         (By Patrick E. Tyler)\n\n       Beijing, Jan. 23.--The Chinese leadership has sent \n     unusually explicit warnings to the Clinton Administration \n     that China has completed plans for a limited attack on Taiwan \n     that could be mounted in the weeks after Taiwan's President, \n     Lee Tenghui, wins the first democratic balloting for the \n     presidency in March.\n       The purpose of this saber-rattling is apparently to prod \n     the United States to rein in Taiwan and President Lee, whose \n     push for greater international recognition for the island of \n     21 million people, has been condemned here as a drive for \n     independence.\n       While no one familiar with the threats thinks China is on \n     the verge of risking a catastrophic war against Taiwan, some \n     China experts fear that the Taiwan issue has become such a \n     test of national pride for Chinese leaders that the danger of \n     war should be taken seriously.\n       A senior American official said the Administration has ``no \n     independent confirmation or even credible evidence'' that the \n     Chinese are contemplating an attack, and spoke almost \n     dismissively of the prospect.\n       ``They can fire missiles, but Taiwan has some teeth of its \n     own,'' the official said. ``And does China want to risk that \n     and the international effects?''\n       The most pointed of the Chinese warnings was conveyed \n     recently through a former Assistant Secretary of Defense, \n     Chas. W. Freeman Jr., who traveled to China this winter for \n     discussions with senior Chinese officials. On Jan. 4, after \n     returning to Washington, Mr. Freeman informed President \n     Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, that the \n     People's Liberation Army had prepared plans for a missile \n     attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile \n     strike a day for 30 days.\n       This warning followed similar statements relayed to \n     Administration officials by John W. Lewis, a Stanford \n     University political scientist who meets frequently with \n     senior Chinese military figures here.\n       These warnings do not mean that an attack on Taiwan is \n     certain or imminent. Instead, a number of China specialists \n     say that China, through ``credible preparations'' for an \n     attack, hopes to intimidate the Taiwanese and to influence \n     American policy toward Taiwan. The goal, these experts say, \n     is to force Taiwan to abandon the campaign initiated by \n     President Lee, including his effort to have Taiwan seated at \n     the United Nations, and to end high-profile visits by \n     President Lee to the United States and to other countries.\n       If the threats fail to rein in Mr. Lee, however, a number \n     of experts now express the view that China could resort to \n     force, despite the enormous consequences for its economy and \n     for political stability in Asia.\n       Since last summer, when the White House allowed Mr. Lee to \n     visit the United States, the Chinese leadership has escalated \n     its attacks on the Taiwan leader, accusing him of seeking to \n     ``split the motherland'' and undermine the ``one China'' \n     policy that had been the bedrock of relations between Beijing \n     and its estranged province since 1949.\n       A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked to comment on \n     reports that the Chinese military has prepared plans for \n     military action against Taiwan, said he was awaiting a \n     response from his superiors. Last month, a senior ministry \n     official said privately that China's obvious preparations for \n     military action have been intended to head off an unwanted \n     conflict.\n       ``We have been trying to do all we can to avoid a scenario \n     in which we are confronted in the end with no other option \n     but a military one,'' the official said. He said that if \n     China does not succeed in changing Taiwan's course, ``then I \n     am afraid there is going to be a war.''\n       Mr. Freeman described the most recent warning during a \n     meeting Mr. Lake had called with nongovernmental China \n     specialists.\n       Participants said that Mr. Freeman's presentation was \n     arresting as he described being told by a Chinese official of \n     the advanced state of military planning. Preparations for a \n     missile attack on Taiwan, he said, and the target selection \n     to carry it out, have been completed and await a final \n     decision by the Politburo in Beijing.\n       One of the most dramatic moments came when Mr. Freeman \n     quoted a Chinese official as asserting that China could act \n     militarily against Taiwan without fear of intervention by the \n     United States because American leaders ``care more about Los \n     Angeles than they do about Taiwan,'' a statement that Mr. \n     Freeman characterized as an indirect threat by China to use \n     nuclear weapons against the United States.\n       An account of the White House meeting was provided by some \n     of the participants. Mr. Freeman, reached by telephone, \n     confirmed the gist of his remarks, reiterating that he \n     believes that while ``Beijing clearly prefers negotiation to \n     combat,'' there is a new sense of urgency in Beijing to end \n     Taiwan's quest for ``independent international status.''\n       Mr. Freeman said that President Lee's behavior ``in the \n     weeks following his re-election will determine'' whether \n     Beijing's Communist Party leaders feel they must act ``by \n     direct military means'' to change his behavior.\n       In recent months, Mr. Freeman said he has relayed a number \n     of warnings to United States Government officials. ``I have \n     quoted senior Chinese who told me'' that China ``would \n     sacrifice `millions of men' and `entire cities' to assure the \n     unity of China and who opined that the United States would \n     not make comparable sacrifices.''\n       He also asserted that ``some in Beijing may be prepared to \n     engage in nuclear blackmail against the U.S. to insure that \n     Americans do not obstruct'' efforts by the People's \n     Liberation Army ``to defend the principles of Chinese \n     sovereignty over Taiwan and Chinese national unity.''\n       Some specialists at the meeting wondered if Mr. Freeman's \n     presentation was too alarmist and suggested that \n     parliamentary elections on Taiwan in December had resulted in \n     losses for the ruling Nationalist Party and that President \n     Lee appeared to be moderating his behavior to avoid a crisis.\n       ``I am not alarmist at this point,'' said one specialist, \n     who would not comment on the substance of the White House \n     meeting. ``I don't think the evidence is developing in that \n     direction.''\n       Other participants in the White House meeting, who said \n     they would not violate the confidentiality pledge of the \n     private session, separately expressed their concern that a \n     potential military crisis is building in the Taiwan Strait.\n       ``I think there is evidence to suggest that the Chinese are \n     creating at least the option to apply military pressure to \n     Taiwan if they feel that Taiwan is effectively moving out of \n     China's orbit politically,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, a China \n     scholar at the University \n\n[[Page S664]]\n     of Michigan and an informal adviser to the Administration.\n       Mr. Lieberthal, who also has traveled to China in recent \n     months, said Beijing has redeployed forces from other parts \n     of the country to the coastal areas facing Taiwan and set up \n     new command structures ``for various kinds of military action \n     against Taiwan.''\n       ``They have done all this in a fashion they know Taiwan can \n     monitor,'' he said, ``so as to become credible on the use of \n     force.''\n       ``I believe there has been no decision to use military \n     force,'' he continued, ``and they recognize that it would be \n     a policy failure for them to have to resort to force; but \n     they have set up the option, they have communicated that in \n     the most credible fashion and, I believe, the danger is that \n     they would exercise it in certain circumstances.''\n       Several experts cited their concern that actions by \n     Congress in the aftermath of President Lee's expected \n     election could be a critical factor contributing to a \n     military confrontation. If President Lee perceives that he \n     has a strong base of support in the United States Congress \n     and presses forward with his campaign to raise Taiwan's \n     status, the risk of a military crisis is greater, they said. \n     A chief concern is that Congress would seek to invite the \n     Taiwan leader back to the United States as a gesture of \n     American support. A Chinese military leader warned in \n     November that such a step could have ``explosive'' results.\n       In recent months, American statements on whether United \n     States forces would come to the defense of Taiwan if it came \n     under attack have been deliberately vague so as to deter \n     Beijing through a posture of what the Pentagon calls \n     ``strategic ambiguity.''\n       Some members of Congress assert that the Taiwan Relations \n     Act of 1979 includes an implicit pledge to defend Taiwan if \n     attacked, but Administration officials say that, in the end, \n     the decision would depend on the timing, pretext and nature \n     of Chinese aggression.\n\n                         China Threatens Taiwan\n\n       China has made no secret of its concern that Taiwan is \n     drifting toward independence with the tacit support of the \n     United States. Beijing pounced on an unofficial visit to \n     America last year by Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, to \n     register its strong objection to any potential change in \n     Taiwan's status. But China has now escalated tensions by \n     recklessly raising the prospect that it might use military \n     force to intimidate Taiwan. The United States and other \n     countries must make clear that such a step would unravel \n     Beijing's relations with the international community and \n     undermine China's prized economic boom.\n       Patrick Tyler of The Times reports that Chinese officials \n     have let the Clinton Administration know that Beijing has \n     completed plans for a limited military attack on Taiwan as \n     soon as this spring unless the island bows to demands for a \n     lower-profile foreign policy.\n       These warnings may well be nine-tenths diplomatic bluff. \n     But even so they suggest that Beijing has lost sight of one \n     of the basic understandings underlying improved Chinese-\n     American relations since the Nixon Administration--that \n     Taiwan's future status must be settled by peaceable means.\n       Beijing is plainly infuriated by the recent efforts of \n     President Lee to win increased recognition for his country in \n     foreign capitals and international bodies like the United \n     Nations. The mainland Government sees Taiwan as an integral \n     part of the historical Chinese empire, torn away by foreign \n     imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek at a time when China was \n     weak. Taiwanese see it differently, pointing to their \n     centuries of separate cultural development and, more \n     importantly, their hard-won political democracy and thriving \n     capitalist economy as good reasons for standing somewhat \n     apart.\n       China apparently hopes its warnings will lead Washington to \n     lean on Mr. Lee to accommodate Beijing. While Washington \n     should urge caution on both sides, the United States must \n     vigorously reject military bullying from Beijing in cases \n     like this.\n       Taiwan is too big to be treated as a mere pawn in relations \n     between Washington and Beijing. It is America's seventh-\n     largest trading partner, with 21 million people, a vibrant \n     democracy and one of Asia's highest living standards.\n       More than anything else, it is the fear that today's \n     freedoms and prosperity would be lost under Beijing's harsh \n     authoritarian rule that fuels Taiwan's quest for a separate \n     identity. Beijing would do better to address this fear with \n     political and economic reforms at home rather than \n     threatening the use of force across the Taiwan \n     Straits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S663-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THE FAITH HOUSE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto the Faith House. It is a great pleasure to recognize this \norganization for its 4 years of superior service to the under-\nprivileged children of the St. Louis community.\n  The Faith House was established in 1992 to meet the ever-increasing \ndemand for the care of infants and children exposed to drugs. This \nresidential facility has already succeeded in serving over 250 infants \nand children in its stable, home-like environment through the \ndedication of numerous volunteers and professional medical staff. The \n24-hour comfort and security provided by the caring individuals \ncomprising the Faith House is essential to the long-term physical, \nemotional, and intellectual development of our children.\n  As a father and long-term advocate for children and families, I \nbelieve the welfare and security of our Nation's children are of \nparamount importance to the future of our society. The Faith House \naspires to continue it's tireless dedication to improving the quality \nof life for those children who have been some of the least fortunate in \nour society.\n  The Faith House is endeavoring to meet the increasing demand for \ngrowth and expansion of its quality care through construction of a new \n50-bed home. Efforts are currently underway to realize this project, \nand on February 23, 1996, a dinner-dance and auction will be held in \nSt. Louis to recognize this outstanding facility. It is an honor to \ncongratulate the people of the Faith House on all of their successes \nand to wish them the best of luck in their future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S664-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FATHER MAC\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to bring attention to \nthe outstanding work of Msgr. Ignatius McDermott and Haymarket House. \nIt is my pleasure to inform you that in December, Haymarket celebrated \nits 20th anniversary. One of largest treatment and detoxification \ncenters in Chicago and the Midwest, Haymarket is the culmination of one \nman's lifetime of education and devotion to helping the addicted.\n  Haymarket was founded in December 1975, when ``Father Mac'' was in \nhis early sixties. For the last 20 years they have made history, \nestablishing programs for those no one else wishes to serve. The \nprograms include Illinois' first non-medical detox center and Illinois' \nfirst sanctuary program for skid row alcoholics. These programs, along \nwith the tireless efforts of Monsignor McDermott, have helped change \nattitudes about alcoholism and have helped establish it as a disease to \nbe treated, rather than as a social problem.\n  Through Haymarket, Father McDermott reached out to serve those \nostracized by today's society. His goal--to serve the homeless, the \nchemically dependent, the substance abuser, the disadvantaged, and the \nunfortunate--is reached through the providing of shelter and care for \nthese people and their families.\n  When drug addicted infants enraged the public, Haymarket provided the \nfirst residential treatment program for drug-addicted pregnant women. \nThis was at a time when those providing treatment were more concerned \nwith liability issues than with the treatment of these women. Since it \nbegan, the Maternal Addiction Center [MAC] has delivered 350 drug-free \nbabies. Haymarket, along with Maryville Academy, has also established \nIllinois' first residential treatment program for postpartum women who \nhave delivered drug-addicted babies.\n  Haymarket currently runs 28 programs and has served over 13,000 \nclients. Their unique program is centered around the idea that to \nachieve long-term recovery the whole person must be addressed. They \nbelieve that without a continuum of care, people are more likely to \nrelapse. This continuum brings together drug abuse prevention and \ntreatment, health services, day care, parent training, vocational \neducation, and job placement. These services help the center improve \nthe prevention and treatment services and increase the savings to \ntaxpayers associated with these services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in commending Father Mac and \nHaymarket for their continued commitment to the services they provide. \nI extend to my colleagues an invitation to visit Haymarket when they \nvisit the Chicago area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S664-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S664-S665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING PETER CRISTIANO ON HIS DECADES OF SERVICE TO SOUTHFIELD, \n                                   MI\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \npay tribute to Peter Cristiano on his long and successful service to \nthe city of Southfield, MI. Mr. Cristiano began his public service in \nSouthfield in 1960, when \n\n[[Page S665]]\nhe was chosen superintendent of parks and recreation. By 1964, he had \nbeen appointed deputy city administrator. From 1968 to 1980, he served \nas Southfield's city administrator, moving on to the city council in \n1981 and serving as council president from 1986 to 1988.\n  Peter won numerous awards during his tenure in Southfield, including \nthe Governor's Distinguished Public Employee Award, the Jaycees' ``Man \nof the Year,'' and the International City Managers Association's \nManagement Innovation Award. He won these awards the hard way: By \nmaking substantial improvements in his city's structure and way of \nlife. Capital improvements, park land acquisition, and development, \naddition of a sports arena, municipal golf arena, and an animal control \nfacility, all were part of his program to improve Southfield, as were \nnew police-court facilities, a senior adult housing complex, and a new \nheadquarters fire station and training center. As important, Peter \ninitiated and implemented a nationally renowned life support unit \nemergency medical service--one of the first of its kind in the Nation. \nAnd Peter restored the city's lovely historical site, ``The Burgh,'' \nfor all of us to enjoy.\n  Peter will be missed as a fixture of Southfield city government. His \nlong, dedicated service helped his community in many concrete ways. And \nhis example should serve as an inspiration to all of us concerning what \nwe can accomplish for our neighbors. Thankfully, Peter will not be \nleaving us altogether; instead he is merely giving up his government \nposition to concentrate on his duties as president and CEO of his own \ntelecommunications company. I would like to wish Peter all the best in \nhis new endeavors and thank him for all the hard work and good service \nhe has done for his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S664-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S665-S666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FEDERAL CONTRACTORS AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Federal Government has played an \nimportant role in promoting equal opportunity in employment by Federal \ncontractors for the past 55 years. Current Federal policy requires \ncontractors to review their own hiring practices for any intentional or \nunintentional discrimination. Academic studies show that enforcement of \nthese policies has led to increases in hiring of ethnic minority and \nfemale workers and that these programs continue to have a positive and \nsignificant impact on remedying discrimination in the workplace.\n  The Federal affirmative action guidelines not only benefit workers. \nEmployers have found that affirmative action programs help them to \nensure that they locate and select the best qualified candidates from \nan expanded talent pool. Companies also report that a diverse work \nforce leads to enhanced performance and productivity.\n  There is always room for improvement, however. A Labor and Human \nResources Committee hearing last June 15 suggested that some \ncontractors are not aware that their progress in achieving recruitment \ngoals is lagging behind industry or regional norms unless or until they \nare selected for a compliance review. Witnesses also raised several \nconcerns about the burdens some regulations may impose on the \nbusinesses--particularly paperwork.\n  Shortly after the hearing, my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, \nand I wrote to Shirley J. Wilcher, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nLabor who oversees the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs \n(OFCCP). We suggested that OFCCP develop a way of providing employers \nwith earlier indications that their progress toward compliance with \naffirmative action guidelines should be reviewed for possible problems. \nWe also requested that they meet with representatives from contracting, \nconsulting, and other constituent groups to review OFCCP regulations \nand to suggest how they may be improved upon or eliminated.\n  I am pleased to report that OFCCP has made significant progress \ntoward resolution of many of the complaints raised at the hearings. \nThey have developed strategies to ensure that compliance officers are \nconsistent and uniform when administering and enforcing laws and \nregulations. They are creating a technical assistance manual that will \nallow contractors to develop affirmative action plans without retaining \nexpensive law firms or consultants. They have clarified the \nrelationship between OFCCP and the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission to ensure that employers are not subject to duplicative, \ninconsistent, or unnecessary regulatory burdens.\n  OFCCP officials have had substantive discussions with a variety of \nconstituent groups. These meetings will likely lead to regulatory \nreforms that will reduce paperwork, reduce the time involved in \ndeveloping written affirmative action programs, and establish practical \nreporting requirements without undermining OFCCP's mission. They are \nalso considering the development of an early alert system that would \nprovide contractors with feedback on progress before the need arises \nfor a full compliance review.\n  I commend Deputy Assistant Secretary Wilcher for the progress she has \nmade. I encourage her and her colleagues to continue to work toward \nthese important changes.\n  I ask that Ms. Wilcher's written response be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n         U.S. Department of Labor, Employment Standards \n           Administration, Office of Federal Contract Compliance \n           Programs,\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: On June 27, 1995, following the Labor \n     and Human Resources Committee's hearing on the Office of \n     Federal Contract Programs (OFCCP), you wrote to suggest some \n     actions that I might take to respond to the concerns of the \n     agency that were highlighted in the hearing testimony. This \n     letter responds to your request that we report by December \n     15th on the progress we have made toward reducing the \n     contractors' compliance burdens and improving OFCCP's \n     performance. I appreciate the opportunity to report on our \n     efforts.\n       Since coming to OFCCP in February 1994, I have been \n     committed to pursuing a fair enforcement strategy. Over the \n     past several months, I have heard the concerns about the \n     internal program management and administration of the \n     contract compliance program. As noted in your letter, several \n     of the witnesses at the June hearing voiced concerns about \n     the time involved in preparing affirmative action programs; \n     the use of goals as rigid quotas; inconsistency in \n     interpretation and application of the regulations; and \n     duplication of efforts with the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (EEOC). Because these issues seriously affect our \n     ability to administer and enforce the equal employment \n     opportunity requirements in a manner consistent with our fair \n     enforcement approach, we have taken actions to address each \n     of these concerns.\n       Several measures have been taken to ensure that compliance \n     officers are consistent and uniform when administering and \n     enforcing our laws and regulations. First, in order to clear \n     up any confusion about how affirmative action works under \n     Executive Order 11246, on August 2, 1995, the agency issued a \n     policy directive on ``Numerical Goals under Executive Order \n     11246.'' The directive reaffirms OFCCP's longstanding policy \n     that affirmative action program goals are not to be used as \n     quotas which must be achieved through race-based and gender-\n     based preferences.\n       Rather, as the policy directive explains, goals under \n     Executive Order 11246 are to be used as a tool to aid in \n     breaking down barriers to equal employment opportunity for \n     women and minorities without impinging upon the rights and \n     expectations of other members of the workforce.\n       Additionally, we provided enhanced training to the staff; \n     conducted several accountability reviews of regional and \n     district office operations; and implemented a customer \n     service improvement plan. Further, we are establishing the \n     position of ombudsperson to handle contractor and constituent \n     complaints about the program and actions of compliance \n     officers. The person assigned to the position will be \n     responsible for outreach, public education and alternative \n     dispute resolution.\n       In response to complaints about the time and expense \n     associated with developing an affirmative action program, in \n     FY 1995 OFCCP began work on developing a comprehensive \n     compliance assistance program, which will include a technical \n     assistance or ``how to'' manual. The agency has not had an \n     effective public educational component or a ``user friendly'' \n     technical assistance manual. As a result, small and newly \n     covered contractors feel obligated to retain law firms and \n     consultants to assist them in developing a written \n     affirmative action program. Our goal is to increase technical \n     support to Federal contractors by establishing programs that \n     expand training about our regulatory requirements and enhance \n     voluntary compliance.\n       In light of the concerns that OFCCP and EEOC are \n     duplicating work, OFCCP and EEOC have examined the \n     interagency coordinating mechanisms that were established to \n\n[[Page S666]]\n     ensure that employers are not subject to duplicative, inconsistent, or \n     unnecessary regulatory burdens. OFCCP and EEOC staff \n     routinely communicate on issues of mutual interest and \n     concern. This coordination is prescribed in Executive Order \n     12067, the 1981 Memorandum of Understanding between DOL and \n     EEOC, and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (ADA). EEOC and OFCCP have issued joint regulations \n     which delineate the respective responsibilities for \n     processing complaints that are within the jurisdiction of \n     both the ADA and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n     1973. Further, employers generally are not subject to \n     simultaneous or dual enforcement proceedings by OFCCP and \n     EEOC. In the rare instance where both agencies may \n     investigate or seek enforcement against the same employer, \n     one of the agencies defers to the other, or the matter is \n     handled on a joint basis by OFCCP and EEOC.\n       As you suggested, between August and October, we held \n     meetings with representatives of the employer and \n     constituency groups to discuss proposals to revise the \n     regulations under the Executive Order program. We met \n     separately with representatives of the following employer \n     groups: the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the \n     Equal Employment Advisory Council (EEAC) and the \n     Organization Resources Counselors, Inc. (ORC). We also met \n     with representatives of civil rights and women's rights \n     organizations. These recent meetings with OFCCP \n     stakeholders were the latest in a series of consultations \n     on regulatory reforms that began in April 1994 in \n     connection with an earlier proposal to revise certain of \n     the provisions in the Executive Order regulations. OFCCP \n     also convened four partnership meetings outside of \n     Washington with several hundred representatives from the \n     contractor and constituent communities in the Spring of \n     1995. The purpose of the meetings, which were held in \n     Dallas, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Chicago, was to elicit \n     recommendations for changing the regulatory requirements \n     for written affirmative action programs and the procedures \n     for evaluating a contractor's compliance with the \n     regulatory requirements. The participants at the \n     partnership meetings were also asked to suggest data \n     requirements for a proposed affirmative action program \n     summary format.\n       We have identified a number of issues we would like to \n     change through regulatory reforms. OFCCP staff is in the \n     process of drafting rulemaking proposals to effect the \n     contemplated revisions to the regulations. These consultative \n     meetings not only are required by Executive Order 12866, \n     which requires agencies to involve the public in proposed \n     rulemaking, but also have been an integral part of OFCCP's \n     established rulemaking practices. The discussions with our \n     stockholders have been worthwhile and productive. In \n     addition, we are examining whether some of the issues raised \n     during the consultations can be addressed through policy \n     guidance or other kinds of programmatic changes.\n       Our overall objectives are to reduce paperwork, reduce the \n     time involved in preparing a written affirmative action \n     program, and establish practical reporting requirements \n     without undermining the ability of OFCCP to be an effective \n     enforcement agency. Further, revising the compliance review \n     procedures would enable OFCCP to better focus its limited \n     resources while reaching a greater percentage of the \n     contractor universe than it currently reaches.\n       Finally, the agency also intends to prepare annual \n     monitoring reports by geographic area and industry to track \n     how different industries are performing. You also recommended \n     that we develop a way of providing contractors early \n     indications of compliance problems. We are considering the \n     concept of an ``early alert system'' to give a contractor \n     advance notice of potential deficiencies so that the \n     contractor would have the opportunity to ``self-correct'' and \n     thereby lessen (if not obviate) the need for a full \n     compliance review. Such an alert system could assist the \n     agency in targeting its limited resources. Accordingly, we \n     are trying to determine the feasibility and administrative \n     costs involved.\n       Again, thank you for the opportunity to provide an update \n     on our efforts to develop and implement changes to the \n     Executive Order program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Shirley J. Wilcher,\n\n                                    Deputy Assistant Secretary for\n\n     Federal Contract Compliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S665-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DANGEROUS PATHOGENS\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I intend to hold hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee in the very near future on the subject of \npossession of dangerous human pathogens, such as bubonic plague, \nanthrax, and similar pathogens. My purpose will be to determine what \nlegislation may be necessary to protect the American people from the \nmisuse of such pathogens.\n  These are very dangerous and deadly organisms which, apparently, are \nreadily available to just about anyone, including those with legitimate \nneeds, such as researchers, and those who, instead, may have an evil \nintent or who simply do not know how to store and handle properly these \norganisms.\n  The December 30, 1995, Washington Post has a story with a headline \nthat leaps off the page: ``Man Gets Hands on Bubonic Plague Germ, but \nThat's No Crime.'' The story is more chilling than the headline. An \nOhio white supremacist purchased, through the mail, three vials of this \nextremely dangerous pathogen, which wiped out about one-third of Europe \nin the Middle Ages. When the purchaser called the seller to complain \nabout slow delivery, the sales representative got concerned about \nwhether the caller was someone who really ought to have the bubonic \nplague in his possession. Ohio authorities were contacted, according to \nthe story. When police, public health officials, the FBI, and emergency \nworkers in space suits scoured the purchaser's house, they found nearly \na dozen M-1 rifles, smoke grenades, blasting caps, and white separatist \nliterature, but no bubonic plague. The deadly microorganisms were found \nin the glove compartment of his automobile, still packed as shipped.\n  Apparently, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires permits \nfor shipping animal pathogens, at least between States, there is no \nFederal domestic regulation of who may receive these deadly human \npathogens. According to the Washington Post story, ``* * * the only \ndomestic restrictions on human pathogens * * * are the rules the \nhandlers impose themselves.'' As Kenneth Gage, acting chief of the \nplague section at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's \nvector-borne diseases division, stated: ``I don't think it's going too \nmuch out on a limb by saying this kind of thing shouldn't happen.''\n  So, for the purchase of three strains of bubonic plague, what was the \npurchaser charged with? Three counts of wire fraud and one count of \nmail fraud. And these charges have been plea bargained down to a guilty \nplea for one count of wire fraud. Even these charges would not have \nbeen possible if the purchaser had not faxed a false statement on the \nletterhead of a nonexistent laboratory stating the laboratory assumed \nresponsibility for the shipment, as the seller had required.\n  Earlier this year, a group released a nerve gas in Tokyo's subway \nstation, killing 12 and injuring over 5,000. The ready availability of \ndeadly human pathogens raises the obvious concern that such organisms \nnot fall into the wrong hands. The task will be to meet the legitimate \nneeds of scientists while assuring protection of our citizens from the \ninadvertent or deliberate misuse of these pathogens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S666-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENFIELD FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nEnfield Fire Department on the occasion of their 100th anniversary.\n  For the past 100 years this dedicated group of men and women have \nstrived to ensure the safety of the community of Enfield, CT.

Indeed some \nhave given the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives while trying to \nprotect their fellow citizens.\n  This organization's dedication and commitment to the town of Enfield \ncan be seen not only through the fire department's actions but also in \nthe great confidence and respect the residents of Enfield place upon \nthese men and women. Ordinary men and women asked to perform \nextraordinary tasks, never asking what was in it for them. The \ncommunity's faith in their fire department has not wavered in its first \n100 years and will undoubtedly continue through the next century.\n  The Enfield Fire Department has been an important stone in the \nfoundation of the town of Enfield.

Mr. President, I rise today to address America's \nrole in implementing peace accords around the world, and in providing \npeacekeeping troops to enforce them. As we all know, President Clinton \ndecided unilaterally to send American ground troops to Bosnia. During \nour debate on that decision, I argued that our troops have too high a \npolitical profile and \n\n[[Page S667]]\nrepresent too powerful a nation to successfully implement the Dayton \nAccord.\n  This is not to say, Mr. President, that our troops can never succeed \nas peacekeepers. In my opinion there have been and will continue to be \noccasions when our participation in peacekeeping efforts will advance \nU.S. strategic and political interests. But we do a disservice to our \ntroops and to our Nation if we do not examine such operations coolly \nand dispassionately to determine whether we should, in fact, engage in \nthem. Because we are likely to receive requests for American \npeacekeepers from a variety of sources in the future, Mr. President, I \nwould like to further clarify my views on the criteria we should apply \nbefore putting our sons and daughters in harm's way.\n  In my view it is our duty in dealing with such requests to assess the \nnature of the conflict and determine if our troops are appropriate. We \nalso, however, must assess how directly events in the area impact on \nour interests. We then must determine whether in fact a peace exists \nwhich we can help keep, and whether our relations with any of the \nparties to the conflict are sufficiently close that we would be willing \nto assume this greater responsibility.\n  Therefore, let me express an overall theme which I believe warrants \nspecific elaboration. When we previously considered the issue of \npeacekeeping and U.S. troop deployments, I felt many in this body were \nsearching for some absolute, universal theories to guide our actions. I \ndo not believe that is necessary. In fact, I would argue that decisions \nsuch as these require us to accept that our national interests vary \nfrom region to region and from situation to situation. We must \ntherefore consider our options on a case-by-case basis. These \nsituations almost never call for black-or-white, do-or-die, absolute \ndecisions. Instead we are usually presented with a sliding scale of \nU.S. interests, transitory levels of progress toward establishing a \njust and lasting peace, and fluid relationships with the parties \ninvolved. It may be possible to develop a theoretical model to address \nthese gradations, and give us a quantitative output as to whether or \nnot we should intercede, but I doubt such a model would be workable if \nit could even be developed. Therefore, I believe we must accept that \nthese situations are best analyzed on an individualized and prudential \nbasis, where the sliding scales of U.S. national interests, the \nprobability of success, and the current state of U.S. international \nrelations are all measured against one another.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me now discuss one area where I \nbelieve some generalizations can be made regarding the deployment of \nU.S. troops as peacekeepers. I believe American troops are singularly \nill-suited to serve in traditional peacekeeping roles, and that their \ndeployment in such roles should be the exception rather than the rule. \nBecause our national interests are so extensive and widespread, we \nalmost always will be seen as an interested party, taking sides in the \nconflict rather than serving as neutral arbiters. Traditional \npeacekeeping demands objectivity and strict neutrality. Peacekeeping \ntroops themselves may be forced to take action against one side or the \nother in particular circumstances, but they must be perceived as being, \non the whole, scrupulously neutral.\n  Our troops are the fighting forces of the world's sole remaining \nsuperpower. This means that they bring to the field their status as \nfighting forces for the world's sole remaining superpower, and the \nliving representation of our Nation's political will. Because our \ninfluence and interests are so far-flung, the mere presence of our \ntroops in a particular area is a political statement. Both sides will \nsee our troops as potential allies or enemies who can decide the \noutcome of a continued conflict. Therefore, I believe traditional \npeacekeeping is best conducted by smaller countries who are not \nperceived to have any vested interest in the outcome of a conflict; \nwho, because their country's interests are marginal in the area of \nconflict, are undeniably neutral.\n  However, even if circumstances favor use of American peacekeepers we \nmust keep in mind that our ability to deploy troops is not sufficient \nreason to do so. In my view this administration has too willingly \ncommitted our troops and national resources to foreign hot spots on the \nnaive assumption that we can and should develop a world police force. \nMr. President, I believe we must remember that a peacekeeping mission \nis not just another peacetime deployment overseas. It is a dangerous \nsituation in which troops are intentionally placed among warring \nparties in order to construct some sense of order and discipline.\n  American troops are highly visible and so will be especially at risk \nin these conditions. This makes it our duty, as policy makers, to \ncommit troops only where our vital interests are at stake. We neither \ncan nor should subordinate our interests to those of any abstract, \nworld-wide organization beholden to dictators who see us as enemies. \nRather, in deciding whether to deploy U.S. troops to a particular area, \nwe first must weigh the extent to which success in that area will \nadvance our national interests. Only where vital national interests are \nat stake should we expose our troops to extraordinary danger.\n  Mr. President, please let me also reiterate my earlier statement as \nto the sliding-scale of interests that usually lay before us. The more \ndirectly and significantly our national interests are effected by \ninstability in a particular area, the greater will be the argument for \nthe deployment of U.S. troops. Again, I do not believe that there is \nsome definitive level of American interests that signals the call for \nU.S. involvement, but rather, the effect upon our interests must be \nmeasured against the degree to which the other criteria I have \nestablished are impacted.\n  Which brings me to my second criteria--the probability of success in \nfurthering our national interests. It makes little sense to me to \nundertake a mission that has little or no chance of success unless the \nthreats to our national interests are so great, that such a high level \nof risk is justified. With peacekeeping, compared to other, more \ntraditional military missions, the risk should be low given \nthe relatively low return we can expect from a mission, which by \ndefinition, is supposed to be nonconfrontational. I will repeat again \nthat there is not, in my opinion, some definitive level of risk which \nwe should not cross in a peacekeeping mission; the measurement of that \nrisk should be weighed along the sliding scale of national interests \nand broader international relations we maintain with the various \nparties to the conflict.\n\n  Furthermore, the probability of success will, in my opinion, be much \ngreater for those conflicts where a peace is already at hand, arrived \nat by the parties themselves from a true desire to end the conflict and \nfind some common ground from which to build a future. In those \nsituations, a peacekeeping force from a trusted friend may be just the \nstep necessary to allay fears and allow the peace process to continue. \nBut when the United States, from a position of superiority or \npaternalism, attempts to impose a peace upon warring factions in an \nessentially unresolved conflict, the underlying issues continue to \nsmolder, and the chances for success drop dramatically.\n  There is, however, a third factor which I believe must be considered \nin any decision to deploy U.S. forces: the degree to which our \nrelationships with the countries of the region will be improved by our \nparticipation. At times, for example, while both sides of a conflict \nwish for peace, one side or the other is so frightened that only \nAmerican assurances will be sufficient to quiet them. Furthermore, \nthere are countries who are such trusted friends and allies, that their \nsecurity is a national interest for us too. And just as I have stated \nearlier regarding the sliding scale with which I believe we should make \nsuch analyses, the closer and more significant our relations are with \nthe countries of the region, the more willing we should be to deploy \nour troops in support of a peace accord.\n  But in such a case we must not seek merely to mimic traditional \npeacekeepers like the Swedes or Fijians, following some inflexible \npolicy of impartiality. Rather, we should, in my view, make clear that \nwe will not tolerate threats to our interests, or to the interests of \nour friends. Precisely because we always are perceived as choosing \nsides, such a statement of interest, if backed up by military presence, \nwill be believed.\n  Two cases where we have become involved may shed some light on how I \n\n[[Page S668]]\n  think we should apply these criteria. In the Sinai, America saw the \nconfluence of vital national security interests, a strong probability \nof success emerging from a peace accord initiated and completed by \nEgypt and Israel, and a conflict where two of our close allies \nrequested our involvement. The Middle East conflicts of the last 50 \nyears have repeatedly placed the United States at odds with the Arab \nworld. The threats to the vital energy supplies of the West's \nindustrial base threatened our most significant national interests. \nIndeed, the world-wide economic recessions of the late 1970's and early \n1990's are both directly attributable to the oil shocks of 1973 and \n1990.\n  The threats to our national security alone were sufficient to warrant \nour involvement. But, in this case, the criteria of our international \nrelations with the involved countries was also met through our ties \nwith Egypt and Israel. The Camp David Accord was a consummation of a \ngrowing United States-Egyptian relationship, heralding a breakthrough \nin United States-Arab relations. Started with the shuttle diplomacy of \nHenry Kissinger, and culminating in the extensive military-to-military \nrelationship developing through our assistance programs, the deployment \nof American troops to the Sinai helped cement our emerging relationship \nwith Egypt. Furthermore, our commitment to Israeli sovereignty and \nsecurity has always been a cornerstone of United States Middle East \npolicy. Our participation in the Sinai multinational observer force \ndirectly improved our relationship with both countries, helped \nstabilize the Middle East, and directly represented our commitment to \nthe success of the Camp David Accords. It is doubtful our close \nrelations with either country, the successful establishment of \nPalestinian authority, or the Israeli-Jordanian Peace Agreement, would \nhave been possible without our peacekeeping pledge.\n  Finally, the probability of success for the Camp David Accord was \nparticularly high given that the combatant states themselves initiated \nthe process and had the most to lose by its failure. It was apparent \nfrom the start that both Anwar Sadat and Menachim Begin wanted peace, \nbut needed assistance in finding a way to protect their vital national \nsecurity interests. In such a situation, the good offices provided by \nthe United States, and the assurances to Israeli security provided by \nthe presence of our troops, were the critical elements in securing the \nAccord.\n  The Dayton agreement, on the other hand, in my view represents a \nsituation in which an American peacekeeping presence is not justified. \nAs I stated during the authorization debate, there is a American \ninterest in resolving the Balkan conflict arising from the threat of \nbroader European instability, the strain the conflict places on our \nrelationships with our NATO allies, and the friction it causes between \nEastern and Western Europe. But none of these threats is so far along \nthe scale of national interest that they warrant our involvement in and \nof their own right. In fact, when measured against the other criteria \nof success probability and our relationships with the regional states, \nI believe a compelling case is made for the United States to \nparticipate in a peacekeeping mission.\n  As I just explained, I believe American troops are particularly ill \nsuited to serve as traditional, impeccably neutral peacekeepers. They \npresent too ripe a political target and bring too much political \nbaggage simply because of the flag they fly. Because there are \nalternatives to United States ground involvement, including the \nprovision of air and naval forces, logistical support, and financial \nresources to support other nations' forces, I believe it is wiser to \nuse smaller, more traditional peacekeeping forces from areas such as \nScandinavia, Africa, and Asia.\n  Furthermore, I am not convinced the Dayton Accord was anything other \nthan an imposed peace by a paternalistic Clinton administration. \nWhereas both the Israelis and Egyptians had concluded that further use \nof arms was fruitless and counterproductive, the Balkan parties, in my \nopinion, believe force may still be a legitimate tool to achieve their \npolitical aims. In fact, the Washington Times of 31 January 1996 quoted \na draft version of a new national intelligence estimate as stating, \n``the former combatants share a deep, mutual distrust and will continue \nto seek achievement of their fundamental goals, rather than \naccommodation, even as the Dayton agreement proceeds * * *. They will \nsee compromise as a zero-sum game and attempt to divide and manipulate \nthe international community in the way the accords are implemented.'' \nUntil all sides truly want peace, I am doubtful that any peace \nagreement, no matter how elegantly crafted, will hold in the long run. \nAn imposed peace is, to me, only conflict delayed. Once we leave, I \nbelieve the conflict will start anew.\n  Mr. President, I wish we could decide when and where to deploy \nAmerican troops in support of peacekeeping missions by consulting a \nchecklist of clearly definable and easily quantifiable criteria. \nUnfortunately, the world is not so simplistic. Each conflict, each \nsituation that begs our involvement, each call for America to serve as \npoliceman or arbiter of justice, presents an enormous range of national \nsecurity concerns. Along the broad scales of national interests, \ninternational relations, and mission success feasibility, we must \nidentify the net result for each situation and determine what action \nwill best advance our national goals. It is not easy, it is not clean, \nbut we must do it. Often times, I believe we will discover that our \nnational interests are not sufficiently implicated to warrant the \ndisproportionate risk under which our military must labor simply \nbecause they are the highly visible political force of the world's only \nsuperpower. But at other times, especially when our interests do lie \nwith the protection of one or more parties to a conflict, the \ndeployment of U.S. peacekeepers may reasonably advance our national \ninterests. At times like these, we must be ready and willing to make \nsuch a commitment to assisting our friends and allies in achieving true \nand lasting peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S666-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JOSEPH GENTILE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

He has devoted himself tirelessly to his \ncommunity in his quest to help the area youth and underprivileged \nsucceed. Through his participation in sports and community \norganizations, he has always extended a helping hand and his goodwill \nto those in need.\n  His accomplishments, as are the lives that Joseph has touched and \nhelp shape, are countless. As a coach, commissioner, administrator, and \nfriend of the Annex Y.M.A. Little League, the East Haven Midget \nFootball League, and East Haven High School he produced winners on and \noff the field. His football, baseball, and softball teams won numerous \nleague, State, and district championships throughout his coaching \ncareer. More importantly, the youngsters he came in contact with \nlearned lessons in humility, sportsmanship, and perseverance from a \ntrue role model.\n  Joseph Gentile has also exemplified these same qualities as a long-\nstanding member and former board of governor and director of the Walter \nCamp Football Foundation, as a volunteer for the Connecticut Special \nOlympics and while serving as a New Haven commissioner for persons with \ndisabilities. He has also played an instrumental role while serving as \ndistrict coordinator for the New Challenger Division in Little League \nbaseball for physically and mentally handicapped children. When called \nupon for assistance, Joseph Gentile has always answered the call.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I see it only fitting that this outstanding \nand caring individual be commended for his many contributions, hard \nwork and for always having a golden heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S668-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S668-S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, on the night of January 9, while this \ncity was buried under a record snowfall, President Clinton vetoed the \nwelfare reform conference report by this Congress, thereby blocking \nreal welfare reform. Recent news accounts suggest that an effort is \nunderway to resurrect the Senate-passed welfare bill and send that to \nthe President.\n  I rise today to state that I would be strongly opposed to doing that. \nAs I just said, Mr. President, the fact of the matter is simply this: \nThe Congress has passed a bill and demonstrated its commitment to real \nwelfare reform. It is time the President quit talking about welfare \nreform and demonstrate his commitment to it.\n  Mr. President, the President promised to ``end welfare as we know \nit,'' but I think it is time he did a better job explaining what he \nmeans by ending welfare as we know it before we send him another bill.\n  The welfare reform bill that President Clinton opposes takes the \nfirst step in 60 years of the welfare programs toward requiring that \nrecipients work for their benefits.\n  The welfare reform bill that President Clinton opposes takes \nimportant steps to stop and slow the growth in illegitimacy, which is \nthe root cause of welfare dependency, and we are still subsidizing it.\n  The welfare reform bill that we have passed places a 5-year limit on \nreceiving benefits and consolidates the Federal welfare bureaucracy and \nreturns power to the States; toughens child support enforcement laws; \nprevents noncitizens from receiving benefits; and saves working \nAmerican taxpayers $60 billion. It was a good bill that we sent the \nPresident. The conference report was a good bill, and he stood up at \nthe State of the Union Address and said, ``I am for welfare reform,'' \nbut vetoes it.\n\n  I voted against the Senate welfare reform bill because it excluded \ncritically important illegitimacy provisions such as a family cap and a \nlimit on the subsidies for children born out of wedlock. I support the \nimproved conference report as it was sent to the President as a first \nstep toward requiring real work from welfare recipients, reducing \nillegitimacy, and slowing the unrestrained growth of welfare spending.\n  President Clinton simply does not want welfare reform by requiring \nwork and reducing illegitimacy. What he means by ``welfare reform'' and \nwhat he meant when he said we ``misunderstood him,'' what he meant when \nhe said he was going to ``end welfare as we have known it,'' was that \nhe was going to put more money into it than we ever heard of, he was \ngoing to hire more people to administer the program, and he was going \nto put more people on the welfare program. That is what he means by \nending welfare as we have known it.\n  I urge my colleagues in both Houses to stand by the welfare reform \nconference report, let the President come forward with his version of \nwelfare reform before we retreat from a good product and a year's work. \nLet him bring us one.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/31/senate-section/article/S669-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nJOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH \n                                REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.
