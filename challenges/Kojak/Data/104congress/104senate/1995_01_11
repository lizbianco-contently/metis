Mr. President, I rise today to address two matters.\n  First, Mr. President, to let you and my other colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate know how honored I am to be a part of this noble institution and \nhow much I look forward to working with each of you in conducting what \nSenator Howard Baker has called ``the business of the people.''\n  Second, I want to take a moment to address the issue of unfunded \nFederal mandates, and specifically the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995.\n  As I look around this great body I realize that I am one of the very \nfew Members who has come directly to the Senate from the private sector \nwith no previous ties to Washington, DC or, for that matter, politics. \nThe people of Tennessee elected me as a true citizen legislator--to \ncome to Washington for a period of time with a mission to accomplish \nand then return to Tennessee to live under the laws I helped pass. As a \nrecently elected citizen legislator, I carry a very distinct advantage: \na closeness to the people, a commonality of interest with real people \nwith real jobs, and an immediate understanding of the message of \nNovember 8.\n  During the last year, I have traveled to most all of the 95 counties \nin my \n [[Page S750]] home State of Tennessee--from Memphis to Mountain City--\nlistening to the thoughts and concerns of private citizens and local \nofficials. Coming directly from the private sector, I heard their \nmessage in the clearest possible terms, unfettered by the preconceived \nnotions and prejudices of Washington.\n  And their message was: ``Change the direction of the country. Get the \nFederal Government off our backs, out of our pockets, and off our land. \nThe arrogance of Washington is stifling us, and we are capable of \nmaking our own decisions.'' A simple, crystal clear message.\n  Mr. President, this is the message I bring to Washington. And there \nis no better example of the Federal Government's arrogance and unwanted \nmeddling than the unfunded Federal mandates. As our majority leader so \neloquently pointed out in his opening remarks of the 104th Congress, \nthe 10th amendment provides that powers not delegated to the United \nStates nor prohibited to the States are reserved to the States or to \nthe people. Yet, through unfunded mandates, the Congress has forced its \nwill upon the people by requiring State and local governments to pay \nfor legislation over which they have no control. The result of these \nmandates is that local governments are forced to abandon their own \npriorities, to offer fewer services to the public, and to ultimately \ncharge higher taxes and utility rates.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, for example, local officials from the \ncity of Knoxville determined that they would have had an additional $11 \nmillion to spend on local priorities in the absence of 10 unfunded \nFederal mandates. According to their estimates, Knoxville could have \nspent $3.5 million for police and crime prevention were it not for \nthese unfunded Federal mandates. Part of this money would have funded \napproximately 60 new police officers.\n  Examples such as these have been cited from cities across this \ncountry, from across America. It is essentially a problem of taxation \nwithout representation. That injustice helped bring about one \nrevolution about 200 years ago, and I think on November 8 we saw \nanother such revolution. The people have demanded that we put an end to \nsuch practice. The State and local battle cry, ``no money, no \nmandates,'' has reached a fever pitch.\n  The test of any government is its responsiveness to its citizens. The \nsolution to the problem of unfunded mandates is to require Congress to \npay for any mandate it places on State and local governments.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Senate bill No. 1, the Unfunded Mandate \nReform Act of 1995, is a step in the right direction. It will be an \neffective but simple mechanism to curb the unfunded mandates that are \nstrangling America's communities. Requiring Congress to pay for its \nmandates will merely require Congress to live in the real world. Like \nthe rest of America, Congress will have to learn to balance budgets, to \nprovide services efficiently, to prioritize, and to make tough spending \ndecisions.\n  For this reason, I have cosponsored the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act \nof 1995. I commend Senator Kempthorne for his leadership over the past \n2 years in raising the awareness of lawmakers and the American public \nregarding the unfunded mandate issue. As Mayor Victor Ashe, of \nKnoxville, TN, currently president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and \na champion of this cause has said: ``This bill will begin to restore \nthe partnership which the founders of the Nation intended to exist \nbetween the Federal Government and State and local governments.''\n  However, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not say that there \nare aspects of this bill that can and should be improved. The bill has \nno affect on Congress unless the Congressional Budget Office first \ndetermines that a bill which contains an unfunded mandate will cost the \nState and local government more than $50 million over a single year. \nWhile I am sure much thought has been given to this threshold amount, \nand while I understand that increased demands will be placed on the \nCBO, I urge my colleagues to listen a little more closely to the will \nof the people. Their message was not to limit unfunded Federal \nmandates, it was to eliminate them. I urge my colleagues to give \nserious consideration to eliminating the $50 million threshold in the \nbill.\n  The second provision of the bill which disturbs me is the provision \nthat allows Congress to override the prohibition on unfunded Federal \nmandates with a simple majority vote in the Senate. In essence, what we \ngive to the American people with one hand we potentially take away with \nthe other. I urge that this provision be strengthened to require a \nsupermajority of 60 votes to waive this legislation. Those two concerns \nnotwithstanding, I believe this bill is a good step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, the directive of November 8 is clear: A return to \nFederalism, the idea that power should be kept close to the people. I \nbelieve that the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, particularly if \nstrengthened as I have urged, will go a long way toward saying to the \nAmerican people that this body believes the people can and should be \ntrusted with the power to make their own decisions. I urge my \ncolleagues to strengthen and then pass this important piece of \nlegislation as quickly as possible. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas [Mrs. Hutchison] is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to my \ncolleague from Idaho, after which I will then take no longer than 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S749-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S750-S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A PLEDGE TO HELP\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas \nfor yielding for a few moments. I appreciate a portion of her time.\n  Let me congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for a very clear \nmessage about why he came to Washington, reflective of the expectations \nof his constituency to respond to the issue of unfunded mandates. We \nwill begin debate on that issue tomorrow, and it is exciting that my \ncolleague, Dirk Kempthorne, is the champion of that issue as we begin \nto address why the American public is so frustrated over what we do \nhere, and this is one of the most effective ways of curbing it.\n  I also recognize my colleague from Colorado in his reintroduction of \ngrazing law reform. I will join with him, and I have pledged, with my \nchairmanship of the Public Lands Committee of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, that we will deal with this issue this year.\n  I have also appreciated the cooperation of the Secretary of the \nInterior. We have had several discussions over the last couple of \nmonths as he brings forth new rules and regulations that he would not \ndeal with grazing fees per se and that he would offer some flexibility \nso that the authorizing committee could respond to the grazing industry \nand other interests out there that are concerned about the management \nof our public grass lands and how they will be grazed and under what \npolicy they will be grazed.\n  For the balance of my brief time, let me suggest that there is a \ntactic underway, Mr. President, that while it may appear to be well \ndirected, in my opinion, it is tremendously misguided. That is a tactic \nbeing used by the Democrat leadership at this moment to try to refocus \nthe whole debate on a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. \nThere is that old adage that when you are out in the swamp surrounded \nby alligators, you are forgetting your initial purpose to come to the \nswamp was to drain it. That is exactly the tactic being used at this \nmoment by the Democratic leadership in both Houses, to say: ``For the \nnext 7 years tell us every budget cut you are going to make. Let us be \nspecific right down to the detail. What are you going to cut, and how \nare you going to cut the budget to arrive at a $1.3 billion reduction \nin the budget to get to a balanced budget by 2002?''\n  That is phony. It is just as phony as can be to play that kind of \ngame. What we have to talk about here is what we want to do first and \nhow we want to do it, and then let us proceed down a path that will \nyield a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n   [[Page S751]] Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SIMON. I commend the Senator for his comments. If the demands of \nthose of us who favor a balanced budget amendment spell out how we do \nit, they are always making speeches how you can balance the budget \nwithout a constitutional amendment. It seems to me that it is incumbent \non them to spell this out also. Is that being unrealistic?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Well, to my colleague from the other side, and one of the \nprimary sponsors of the balanced budget amendment, it would not be \nunrealistic. But what is realistic to talk about is the very thing that \nall of us know who focus on the balanced budget amendment. And how we \nget there by the year 2002 is a simple matter--although complicated and \nvery tough to do--of reducing the growth rate of Federal budgets from \nabout 5 percent to about 3 percent. When the American public hears \nthat, they say to a Senator Simon of Illinois or a Senator Craig of \nIdaho, that sounds immensely reasonable. While it may be tough to do, \nit is a heck of a lot more reasonable to understand that is the kind of \napproach we are talking about. Then, apparently, the game plan, or the \nthreat, there is the impending damage that could come from that kind of \nlanguage that would suggest we have to cut $1.3 trillion from budgets. \nWhat we could also say is that if we do not have a balanced budget \namendment, by the year 2002 the Federal budget will be $1.3 trillion \nlarger, or that the Federal deficit will be $500 or $600 billion \nannually, or that the Federal debt will be $6 or $7 trillion, or that \ninterest on the debt will be $400 billion annualized.\n  That is not at all what they are talking about. Instead of talking \nabout the kind of positive things that can grow and emanate from a \nbalanced budget, they are talking about all of the negatives.\n  The American public knows exactly what we are saying and they are \nsaying very clearly back to us: Do not get weak-kneed. Balance the \nFederal budget. Produce the mechanism that will result in that and give \nus a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that will force the \nkind of fiscal discipline that this Congress has failed to respond to \nfor now over three decades.\n  Mr. President, this 104th Congress is considering a historic and \nremarkable balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Some partisan \nsparring broke out over the last few days. That's unfortunate.\n  Democrats have been asking Republicans, ``Where's your plan?'' \nspecifically showing how to balance the budget by 2002?\n  Let us stay focused on the central issue. Which do we want: Balanced \nbudgets or the status quo? Which do we want: An issue? Or passage of \nthe balanced budget amendment? We know which is better for the country.\n  Let us remember what has brought us to this point: $4.7 trillion \nFederal debt; annual deficits now in the $160 billion range; and \ndeficits projected to shoot toward $400 billion after the turn of the \ncentury.\n  Let us stay above partisanship. Some of my friends on the other side \nof the aisle sincerely support the balanced budget amendment but also \nare demanding to know specific budget cuts. I sympathize with your \nfrustration; but don't be distracted.\n  Do not be fooled by a partisan tactics on the part of balanced budget \namendment opponents to simply kill this amendment at any cost. Do not \nfall into that some old trap of trying to score a partisan point today \nat the cost of our children's economic well-being tomorrow. That is \nexactly the kind of shortsighted trade-off we're trying to stop by \npassing the balanced budget amendment.\n  The balanced budget amendment began as a bipartisan effort. Let us \nkeep it that way.\n  Where are the specific cuts? There are literally hundreds of plans \nout there; there's no one way to balance the budget. What's lacking is \nsome mechanism to force a consensus. There may be 100 plans in the \nSenate for balancing the budget, but not one of them will get 51 votes \nuntil we remove the easy alternative of borrow-and-spend.\n  Lessons of History: We have had the specific plans before us in the \npast. The way Congress has treated them demonstrates why we need to the \nbalanced budget amendment. In the past, one/both Houses defeated \nnumerous deficit-reduction plans full of specifics. Most recently, and \nin a bipartisan effort: Kerrey-Brown rescission/entitlement reform \npackage (1994) (Penny-Kasich in the House, 1993).\n  ``Draconian'' budget cuts required? Contrary to what's being said, we \nknow the direction we have to go, and how to get there. For example: \n``Glide Path'' Plan: Federal spending is increasing now at about 5 \npercent, or about $75 billion per year. Simply trimming that growth in \nspending to 3.1 percent would balance the budget in fiscal year 2002. \nFor those concerned about Social Security: We can trim the growth of \nnon-Social Security spending to 2.4 percent and still balance the \nbudget by 2002. This will require discipline, but it is a far cry from \nthe doom and gloom scenario being portrayed by many opponents.\n  Name every budget cut in advance? Opponents of this proposal want it \nboth ways. First they say, show them how we would cut the budget. Next \nthey say balancing the budget by 2002 would be too painful.\n  But this tactic proves our point: The budget won't be balanced \nwithout passing the BBA first. Democrats want our plan, but where has \nthe Democrat plan been? President Clinton did not propose a path to a \nbalanced budget--current projections show deficits going way up after \n1995.\n  Bad Policy, putting the cart before the horse: When people decide \nthey want to be healthier and live longer, they don't plan every meal \nand every workout for the next year. First they commit to do whatever \nis necessary. Then they pick the specific diet and exercise plan. The \nhigh failure rate for dieters illustrates our point that external \nenforcement is necessary. Specifying all the cuts before we even commit \nto balancing the budget condemns us to failure before we start.\n  Will the BBA work or won't it? Opponents cannot have it both ways: \nFirst, they say it is a fig leaf to cover budget failures in previous \nCongresses, that it's an empty promise; then they talk in terms of \n``slash and burn'' to scare the interest groups into active opposition; \nI think they really do fear this amendment will work and are not \nwilling to share the responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from Texas, and I thank \nher for sharing with me some of her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the introduction of S. \n191 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I and a number of my colleagues spoke on the Senate \nfloor this past Friday, we pointed out that a terrible injustice has \nbeen done to thousands of workers in my State of Iowa, Illinois, and in \nOhio. It is an action that has ramifications not only for the other \nworkers throughout our country, but for international relations as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say that if there are people at the \nJapanese Embassy here in Washington who have their sets tuned in to the \nproceedings in the Senate, I ask them to turn the volume up and pay \nclose attention to what I am about to say. I believe I am joined by my \ncolleague, Senator Simon, from Illinois, we have a message for the \nJapanese Prime Minister who is in Washington today, meeting with the \nPresident of the United States. We have a very strong message for the \nJapanese Prime Minister. I hope that the people of the Japanese Embassy \nwill turn their sets up and start to pay attention right now because \nthis message is for the Japanese Prime Minister.\n  The Bridgestone-Firestone Corp. is a Japanese-owned company. It \nannounced it would permanently replace \n [[Page S752]] over 2,000 of its employees currently involved in a \nlegal strike over proposed major cuts in worker pay and benefits and \nover a worsening of working conditions.\n  After earlier being hopeful that this lengthy strike would be \nsuccessfully resolved through good-faith negotiations by both sides, it \nnow appears that Bridgestone/Firestone has been acting in bad faith. \nThis is irresponsible corporate behavior and it harms the United States \nof America.\n  We take the floor again to address this issue because as we speak \nPresident Clinton is meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi \nMurayama, and I hope this message gets to the Prime Minister. Our \nPresident is meeting with him to discuss a number of important economic \nand international relations issues. We must improve our relations with \nJapan. Japan is an economic leader, and an ally of ours. Friendship and \npositive relations between our two nations is in the best interests of \nboth countries and the entire world.\n  Mr. President, nothing does more to undermine positive relations and \ngood will between our nations than acts like that taken by Bridgestone/\nFirestone. Here is a company that is profitable, whose workers have \nmade it profitable by reaching record levels of productivity. Then they \ngo and knock thousands of workers out of their livelihoods because \nBridgestone/Firestone is not willing to abide by the same contract \nsigned by their two largest American competitors.\n  I want Prime Minister Murayama and his government to know how \ndestructive these actions are, how it rips apart families and \ncommunities. These workers have given the best years of their lives to \nthis company. They are highly productive, diligent, hard-working \nindividuals. They took contract concessions when times were tough and \nthe company needed them to remain in operation. Now that times are \nbetter, workers just want fair treatment from the company.\n  Mr. Prime Minister, these are workers like Sherrie Wallace who \nrecently wrote me after she and her husband lost their jobs. Let me \njust read from this letter from Sherrie Wallace, a worker at Firestone:\n\n       When Bridgestone came to each of us asking for help because \n     we were not doing as well as the company needed to do, we all \n     did our best. They asked me for one more tire every day, and \n     to stay out on the floor and forgo my cleanup time. Not only \n     did I respond, so did each and every member of the URW. Not \n     only did I give them the one more tire per day they asked \n     for, I gave them three times what they asked for. Our \n     production levels soared. We threw ourselves into our company \n     believing that we all must succeed together in order to \n     create a better way of life for all. The membership joined \n     committees and we became involved and we gave them our \n     hearts. We began to believe this company was different. We \n     gave them our input to create a better working environment. \n     To increase productivity we began to meet our production \n     levels. We were proud of our company and our union. Together, \n     we did make a difference. It is these things that make me \n     wonder why does Bridgestone now demand such unreasonable \n     demands?\n\n  In return for their increased productivity, workers are being asked \nto take a 30-percent cut in the introductory wage, cutting out four \nholidays, bunching up all their holidays at Christmas time, cuts in pay \nrates for work on Saturdays and Sundays.\n  I asked my staff, Mr. President, to compare what the workers in Japan \nwere getting in Bridgestone Corp., compared to workers in America. I \nthink you will find this pretty startling.\n In Japan Bridgestone union employees average annual wage is $52,500 a \nyear, for the Bridgestone union employees in America, their average \nwages are $37,045 a year. The average monthly hours in Japan? One \nhundred fifty-two hours. In the United States? One hundred ninety-eight \nhours. Not only are our workers working more, they are getting paid \nless. Now, what the company says they want them to do is two shifts a \nday, 12 hours on, 12 hours off. They want them to work a crazy quilt \nwork schedule. They would work three 12-hour days, then have 2 days \noff; then 2, 12-hour days, have three days off; then they work two 12-\nhour days, have 2 days off. Try to map out a schedule for your family \nlife on that. It would be worse than the U.S. Senate. Workers would not \nknow when they would have days off during the year.\n\n  In Japan, same company, same employees have three shifts, eight hours \na day, and they rotate those shifts. The company says no, what is fair \nin Japan is not fair for our workers in America.\n  So, Mr. President, workers increase their productivity tremendously \nat this company. All the statistics show it. At Goodyear Tire & Rubber, \nthey had a contract dispute last year, they settled it, setting the \ncontract pattern for the rubber industry in this country and they moved \nahead. Now what Bridgestone-Firestone is doing is saying they can beat \ntheir major competitors in America by squeezing their workers a little \nharder. Well, I do not think any company ought to gain a competitive \nadvantage at the expense of its workers.\n  The United Rubber Workers have offered proposals through the Federal \nMediation and Conciliation Service and the company refused to \nnegotiate. This refusal is a refusal of the basic tenant of labor-\nmanagement relations of collective bargaining.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a couple more minutes, but let \nme yield to my colleague from Illinois because I know his workers in \nIllinois are facing the same kind of situation as ours are in Des \nMoines, IA.\n  Mr. President, I yield at least 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa. I thank him \nfor his leadership on this.\n  When he mentioned the States that are affected, he should have \nincluded Oklahoma, which is the State of the Presiding Officer. The \nJapanese Prime Minister is here today to create good will for his \ncountry, and I hope he has a very good visit. However, it is \nappropriate that we let the Japanese Prime Minister know right now here \nand clearly, that one of the Japanese-owned corporations in this \ncountry is creating ill-will in this country, and is not doing any good \nfor United States-Japanese relations.\n  In addition to the comments of my colleague from Iowa, I would point \nout that the Secretary of Labor asked to meet with the chief executive \nof the Bridgestone-Firestone Co. here in the United States.\n  He refused to meet with the Secretary of Labor to talk about this. I \nhave a wire service story in which Secretary Reich is quoted as saying:\n\n       I consider this outrageous, quite frankly. Japanese \n     companies in this country have a sterling record of social \n     responsibility, in general.\n\n  And I think that is correct. Most Japanese corporations in this \ncountry have an excellent record. This company is refusing even to meet \nwith the Secretary of Labor. I have never heard of an American \ncorporation or a corporation in this country refusing to sit down with \nthe Secretary of Labor.\n  The company said:\n\n     * * * it would be happy to send Charles Ramsey, its chief \n     negotiator--\n\n  Only they are not negotiating.\n\n     to meet with--\n\n  The Secretary of Labor.\n  That is like sending an errand boy. The Secretary of Labor ought to \nbe able to sit down with the person who is making the decision.\n  This is only the third time, I am told, since the early 1930's when a \nmajor corporation--and that includes major corporations in the United \nStates of America, with the air traffic controllers being one of the \nthree--this is the third time we have had a permanent replacement of \nstrikers of this magnitude.\n  Our whole tradition is against it. It is very interesting that this \nJapanese-owned corporation cannot do in Japan what they are doing in \nOklahoma and Illinois and Iowa and Ohio and Indiana. It would be \nillegal for them to do it in Japan, and they are doing it here, \ncontrary to our traditions. It is illegal to do it in Canada or all of \nWestern Europe, except for Great Britain.\n  I think that the company is making a great mistake. I have been \naround public life for a while--I am 66 years old. I have observed a \nlittle, and I have noted when this pendulum swings too far to one side, \npretty soon \n [[Page S753]] the pendulum is going to swing too far to the other \nside, and that is the danger in labor/management relations in this \ncountry. It is a danger for Bridgestone/Firestone.\n  I heard my colleague from Iowa say the other day that he would not \nbuy any Firestone tires. Believe me, I am certainly not going to buy \nany Firestone tires, and I think there are going to be a lot of people \nin the United States who are going to feel the same way.\n  The sensible thing is to sit down and negotiate. I have, Mr. \nPresident, over the years been involved in some labor/management \nnegotiations. Sometimes it gets tough, but getting people together \naround a table, sooner or later--a little bit like a conference \ncommittee between the House and the Senate--sooner or later you get \nsomething worked out. That is what Bridgestone/Firestone should do, not \ndismiss 2,300 employees. They ought to sit down and try to work things \nout. That is the American tradition.\n  I note that the Wall Street Journal, in an article about the chief \nexecutive of Bridgestone, refers to him as a bulldog, that he is a born \ngambler. Well, he is gambling with something that is very important. He \nis gambling with his company's future. He is gambling with labor/\nmanagement relations in this country. He is gambling with the lives of \n2,300 workers and their families. I hope common sense prevails, and I \nhope the Japanese Prime Minister gets the message that we who have \nspoken on the floor of the Senate have nothing but good will toward \nJapan. I respect that country. I might add, I grew up in the State of \nOregon--something I do not stress in the State of Illinois--but I grew \nup in the State of Oregon. My father was a Lutheran minister and, in \n1942, stood up when Japanese-Americans were taken away from the west \ncoast. That was my first real experience in civil rights. I was 13 \nyears old then. I remember the hostility that my father received on \nthat occasion.\n  I do not want to sour United States-Japan relations. I want an \nimproved relationship. I think the Japanese Prime Minister would be \nwise to get a message to the chief executive of Bridgestone: sit down \nand try to iron this thing out.\n  I yield back my time to my colleague. And, again, I thank him for his \nleadership on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nIllinois, again, for his strong support for trying to inject some \nsanity and some reasonableness into these negotiations to try to settle \nthis strike at Bridgestone/Firestone.\n  I want to say to my friends, whether they are watching in the \nJapanese Embassy, or to Prime Minister Murayama, I want to echo what \nSenator Simon said. The vast majority of Japanese companies operating \nin this country operate in a highly responsible, effective, \ncompassionate manner with their workers. I have seen many of them and, \nin many cases, the workers are happier there than perhaps they are at \nother companies that are not Japanese.\n  I do not want to cast Bridgestone's actions as something true of \nevery Japanese company. That is not true. Senator Simon is right on the \nmark with that. For some reason, this seems to be some kind of a rogue \ncompany. But it is always that bad apple that can spoil the barrel, and \nthat is what Bridgestone/Firestone is going to do. They are going to \ncolor with their insensitive, outrageous behavior all the other fine \nJapanese corporations that are doing a good job in this country. I \nwould hate to see that happen. I know the Senator from Illinois would \nhate to see that happen, too.\n  That is the message, I think, that we want the Japanese Prime \nMinister to take back with him. It is not just this one company and you \ncan ignore it. This will have ramifications over and beyond just that \none company.\n  Mr. President, I read from the letter from Sherrie Wallace who worked \nat Firestone 33 years. Her husband also worked there. Let me read one \nfinal paragraph. I will not read the whole letter. She said:\n\n       You see, we are one of those families that both husband and \n     wife work at Bridgestone/Firestone in Des Moines, IA. We both \n     have lost our jobs, our benefits and our livelihood. We have \n     had days and nights of no sleep, wondering where our life is \n     heading. Trying to keep the ``American Dream'' alive with \n     dignity, conviction to stand up for what you believe in and \n     hope.\n       Please hear our plead for help. * * * Over 25,000 \n     employees, spouses and children will be affected by this one \n     * * * incident.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the Japanese Prime Minister will heed \nthis.\n  As I pointed out last year, Goodyear Tire and Rubber reached an \nagreement with its workers, and they were chosen to set the pattern for \nthe industry. Well, they did. Now Bridgestone/Firestone has come in and \nsaid they want to break that pattern.\n  One can understand if, in fact, the workers are not productive, but \nas Sherrie Wallace pointed out in her letter, they have become highly \nproductive. In fact, in March 1994, workers at Bridgestone/Firestone \nU.S. reached a new high of 80.5 pounds per man-hour and set an all-time \nrecord for pounds warehoused, and the company boasts that it did it \nwith 600 fewer workers.\n  So it is not a problem of either they are not making money or that \nthe workers are not productive. Just the opposite is true.\n  What Bridgestone/Firestone is saying effectively is that their \nworkers are no more than pieces of machinery, to be used, depreciated \nand then thrown out on the trash heap without any concern for their \nfamilies or years of service.\n  But there is an option, and let this be the final warning to \nBridgestone/Firestone. I will read a letter to the editor of the Des \nMoines Register by a farmer by the name of Joe Weisshaar:\n\n       A quick inventory tells me that my tractors, trucks, \n     wagons, combine and cars roll on more than 140 tires. My vow \n     to Bridgestone/Firestone is that if this strike is not \n     settled within 30 days, I will never buy another tire made by \n     them.\n\n  That is just one farmer's view from the State of Iowa.\n  I guess that ought to be the message sent to Bridgestone/Firestone. \nOur consumers have a choice, and if we have to and if Bridgestone/\nFirestone will not settle this in a decent manner, if they will not sit \ndown, if they will not even speak to the Secretary of Labor, then maybe \nwhat the people of this country ought to do is just start rolling along \nanother brand of tires.\n And Bridgestone-Firestone ought to know that we have that option.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the Japanese Prime Minister to take the \nmessage we are sending back to the head of Bridgestone/Firestone, urge \nhim to reconsider his unfortunate decision, and to reopen in good faith \nnegotiations with their workers. It would not only be in the best \ninterests of the workers and their families and communities, but also \nthe relations between our nations and the good will that is so \nimportant to maintain.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I have. I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S751-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S753-S755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           UNFUNDED MANDATES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will soon in this Chamber turn to \nunfunded mandates bill, which is a piece of legislation that has been \nworked on by the Governmental Affairs Committee and by many Members of \nthis Chamber. I wanted today to say a few words about that legislation \nto try to indicate why I support generally the subject, why I have \nworked on it in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and why I think it \nis important that we pass the legislation, but also why I think at the \nsame time we ought to talk about all dimensions of this issue and why I \nintend to offer several amendments to it.\n  First of all, it is absolutely true that it has been far too easy for \nMembers of \n [[Page S754]] the House and the Senate to decide that they want to \noffer amendments that will require someone out there in the country to \ndo something, most specifically a State and local government, but also \nthe private sector, without any given thought about how much the \nmandate would cost. Too often, we overlook the questions of what kind \nof problems the mandate could cause, how heavy the burden will be, and \non whom will it fall.\n  Too often it has been easy to say ``Here is what we impose, and you \nworry about the rest of it. You worry about what it is going to cost.''\n  Well, this legislation simply says that when we are prepared to \nimpose a mandate, we ought to be responsible enough to understand what \nit imposes on someone. What is the cost going to be?\n  Then, if we impose a mandate on State and local government, we ought \nto say, ``Here are the resources with which you can do it.''\n  Senator Domenici and I wrote in this legislation provisions that also \ninclude the private sector. It is not just mayors and Governors who are \nconcerned about mandates. What about the private sector? What about the \nbusinessman and business woman who also get socked with mandates? So \nthere is in this legislation language which Senator Domenici and I \nwrote that includes the private sector. We provide that you must, when \nyou bring legislation to the floor of the Senate, have with that \nlegislation an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office of what this \nis going to cost the private sector.\n  Let us vote with full information. Let us vote with more information \nthan we have ever had in the past to understand what we are doing and \nwhat burdens our laws are imposing on people around this country.\n  Some will, I suppose, support this legislation in a manner designed \nto suggest that everything Government does is largely unworthy. I do \nnot believe that. We have done a lot of things, including imposing some \nmandates that are worthy and important and that I would vote for again \nand again and again. Would anyone here reasonably suggest that we \nshould not have passed the Voting Rights Act? I do not think so. That \nimposed a mandate, and it was perfectly legitimate. It was our \nresponsibility to do it. We did it, and I am proud of it. I can give \nyou other examples.\n  My point is that some mandates are important. Some mandates we ought \nto impose. I can tell you one I would like to see imposed. I have been \ntrying for years. Hopefully, I will get it done. I do not think it is \ngoing to cost anybody very much. Do you know there are nine States in \nthis country where you can get behind the wheel of your car and, with \nyour right hand, put the key in the ignition and, with the left hand, \nhold a bottle of Wild Turkey or Old Crow or your favorite brand of \nwhiskey and drive down the street drinking whiskey, and do so within \nthe law?\n  In my country, I hope that will not last very long. There is not a \nState in this country that ought to allow drinking and driving. Nine of \nthem do. At least nine of them do not have laws prohibiting open \ncontainers in vehicles or prohibiting the driver from drinking. I would \nlike to mandate in every State in this country that no matter where you \nare driving with your family on vacation, you know you are not going to \ncross a State line and find in the next State that someone is drinking \nwhiskey and driving, or drinking beer and driving, and turning into a \nmurderer because the driver is drunk.\n  I would like to mandate that, and I have been trying. I have not been \nsuccessful, but someday I am going to. I do not think it is going to \ncost the States that do not have this law a lot of money to decide they \nshould comply with a reasonable mandate that you ought not drink and \ndrive in this country.\n  I indicated over in the Governmental Affairs Committee that trouble \nruns on a two-way street in this country on the subject of mandates, \nand I said to State and local folks who testified that I support this \nlegislation for the reasons I have just described now here on the floor \nof the Senate. But I also said as I participate in efforts to reform \nthe way the Federal Government does business, we should and we will--\nand this bill will pass and will pass with my vote--require State and \nlocal governments to participate in reform as well. Mandates are a two-\nway street. Even as we talk about the burdens we impose upon them, \nthere are officials out in other levels of government--Governors and \nothers--who are plotting new ways they can hook their hose to the \nFederal tank and suck more Federal dollars out of the Federal tank; how \ncan they get more Federal dollars?\n  I will tell you one way. They have decided to concoct phony schemes \nfor provider taxes in Medicaid. Some states tax their health care \nproviders, which brings in more Federal Medicaid dollars. Then these \nstates reimburse their health care providers. In effect really the \nproviders have paid no tax and the only result is that the states \nincrease the Federal deficit by sucking more money out of the Federal \ntrough.\n  We are going to reform the way we do business. They ought to reform \nthe way they do business. It is not acceptable to me to have people \ncomplaining about unfunded mandates at the State and local level and \nthen to see them in every conceivable way line up to see how much they \ncan pail out of the Federal trough and get more Federal moneys in their \narea, some of it with schemes that are fundamentally phony.\n  Well, my point is, yes, let us change; let all of us change, not just \nthe Federal Government but State and local government as well. The fact \nis we send a substantial amount of money back to State and local \ngovernments, some of it with no strings. I could give a list of \nprograms for which we send billions, literally tens of billions of \ndollars, back to State and local governments in which they have the \ncontrol over the spending and in which there are very few mandates, and \nin some cases none.\n  And I think, again, this is a two-way street. We need to work \ntogether. Let us try to stop imposing unreasonable burdens on each \nother, and let us all act responsibly and all construct the kind of \nbehavior in Government that the American taxpayers expect us to have.\n  The legislation itself is good. There are a number of questions that \nwill be asked about it that I think ought to be answered, and some were \nnot answered in the Governmental Affairs Committee. It is reasonable \nfor us to understand exactly what we are doing even now, as we deal \nwith mandates. So there are a lot of questions. But when all the dust \nsettles and the questions are answered, this legislation, I think, will \nbe improved by some amendments. Then the legislation will pass, and it \nwill pass with my vote because I have helped write part of it, \nespecially including the private sector. But I am going to offer a \ncouple of amendments. Let me describe the three of them.\n  One is, there is a commission described in this legislation to do \nsome studying. It is a new commission. We do not need a new commission. \nThe Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, ACIR, which has \nexisted for a long, long while--I have worked with it, in fact I was \nappointed to serve on it a couple of years ago--is a commission \nexisting to do precisely these kinds of things. We do not need to \nconstruct or produce a new commission. Let us use the commission that \nexists. In fact, the ACIR was the commission in this legislation up \nuntil a few weeks ago and was replaced for reasons I do not understand. \nSo I will offer an amendment to place it back in the legislation.\n  Next, I am going to offer an amendment that deals with a mandate that \nsort of gets under my skin. We have a metric conversion act in this \ncountry. We are forcing America to go metric. It is not that I am \nliving in the last century. It is not that I am backward. It is not \nthat I fail to understand. I have nothing against metric. I do not \nhappen to care how many kilometers it is to the next rest stop. So I do \nnot want them taking down the highway signs telling me how many miles \nit is and putting up signs telling me how many kilometers it is. It \ndoes not matter to me. I want to know how long it takes to get there, \nand I guess I can best measure that by seeing how many miles it is.\n  We do not need a Metric Conversion Act that we enforce through the \nFederal Government, through the Department of Transportation, that will \ntake down all those green highway signs on the interstate and replace \nmiles with kilometers. It is a terrible waste of \n [[Page S755]] money. But more than that, in the deep recesses of the \nbureaucracy, in every agency, there is some metric conversion \nenforcement officer who is now busy at work, scurrying somewhere \nunderneath a pile of paper, trying to figure out how to mess up the \nnext project.\n  In North Dakota, we are going to try to build 20 little houses up on \nan Indian reservation to house Indian Health Service workers. Do you \nknow what? Those 20 houses are held up. Do you know why? Because they \nhave to be built under the metric system; metrification. Twenty houses \nhave to be built under the metric system. I have been trying for 3 \nmonths to get a waiver. You cannot do it. The bureaucracy simply does \nnot bend.\n  I am going to offer an amendment that says let us suspend for 2 years \nthe enforcement of the Metric Conversion Act. Just suspend the \nenforcement of it. Then let us have this commission that is going to \nstudy the other things get back to us and tell us what the Metric \nConversion Act is costing us and why. Of what value is it to build a \nhouse using metric? It is more expensive and takes longer in the \nplanning. This makes no sense to me. I am going to offer an amendment, \nand I hope we add it to this bill, that we suspend for 2 years the \nenforcement of the Metric Act while the study is done, the study which \nI hope will then convince us we ought not to be doing this.\n  Yes, parts of the private sector are going metric because if you want \nto compete in certain areas overseas you ought to do it in metric \nmeasurements. The automobile industry does that when they send cars \noverseas. I see nothing wrong with that. But we do not have to use \nmetric when we want to build a house on an Indian reservation. That \nmakes no sense to me.\n  I am going to offer another amendment, on the Federal Reserve Board. \nThe Federal Reserve Board imposes the ultimate mandate. In fact, I \nthink next week they will decide once again--closing their doors and in \nsecret with their brethren, the banking community, the central \nbankers--decide to increase interest rates. And they will increase the \ncost of paying for the Federal debt by the Federal Government. They \nwill increase the cost for State and local governments, and more \nimportant, they will increase costs on every American citizen. That is \nmandated. They are going to mandate an increase in interest rates that \nwill cost every American citizen additional money.\n  So I am going to offer an amendment that is very simple but will give \nthem an apoplectic seizure, I am sure, because even if you suggest \nsomehow that they are maybe a part of America and we ought to \nunderstand what they are doing behind those closed doors, they say you \nare Fed bashing. I am not Fed bashing. But I am going to offer an \namendment that says when the Federal Reserve Board meets in secret to \ndecide once again they want to increase interest rates, within 30 days \nof that decision they must send a report to Congress and a report to \nthe President that tells us how much that action cost us, what it cost \nthe Federal Government in increased debt service.\n  Incidentally, the Fed's actions last year--again in secret, by the \nFed, the central bankers who control the money supply--their actions \nlast year increased the cost of debt service over the coming 5 years by \nnearly $125 billion. In other words, they, by their decisions, took \nback nearly one-fourth of the deficit reduction savings that we \nagonized over and debated and wrestled over here on the floor of the \nSenate for months the year before. They did not wrestle. They did not \ndebate much. Actually, we do not know that because the door was closed. \nBut I assume they reached a consensus very quickly on behalf of their \nconstituencies. They took back, by their action to increase interest \nrates, about $125 billion in deficit reduction. Said another way, they \ntook action to increase the Federal deficit by $125 billion because \nthey increased the cost of paying for the Federal debt. But it was more \nthan that. They increased the cost of home payments for people who have \nadjustable rate mortgages.\n  My point is this. When the Federal Reserve Board meets and decides it \nis going to mandate another interest rate increase, I just say, within \n30 days you have a responsibility to tell us and tell the President \nwhat this increase will cost. The reason I make this suggestion is that \nI asked at a recent hearing of Federal officials what did this cost, \nyour five or six interest rate increases last year? Do you know what \nwas the cost of it, and who is going to pay it? They had not studied \nit.\n  So I am saying I would like the Fed to study it and give us a report. \nI will offer that amendment as well to this legislation, and I hope \nthat some of my colleagues will support that and that we could add that \nprovision to the unfunded mandates bill.\n  Let me finish where I began on this subject. This is a piece of \nlegislation that I believe will be supported by substantial numbers in \nboth political parties. Most of us understand it has been too easy to \nimpose mandates on others, both State and local governments and, also, \nthe private sector. There are mandates that are important, necessary, \nand which I support. We would not want, I believe, in this country, to \ndecide we will retreat on the question of child labor. We have child \nlabor laws prohibiting the hiring of 12-year-olds and paying them 12 \ncents a hour. We would not want to retreat on that. We would not want \nto retreat on the issues of worker safety. Should we have a safe \nworkplace? Should we have child labor laws? There are dozens and dozens \nof things that we have done that helped create a better country. They \nare important and they have been in mandates.\n  But in recent years it has been too easy. In recent years there has \nbeen a call for us to be more responsible, and that is what this \nlegislation says. Let us understand what this mandate is, who it costs \nand what it costs. If we do understand, we will make this Senate a \nbetter legislative body.\n  I hope that next week when we really debate this bill, Senators will \nnot tell us that this bill is just the way it has to be as it comes out \nof committee and that they oppose all amendments. This bill is not \nperfect. I helped work on it and I know it is not perfect, and that is \nwhy I think we ought to have a free and open exchange, agree to some \namendments where amendments have merit, and get this bill ready for \nfinal passage. We will have accomplished something together as \nRepublicans and Democrats, and we will be responding to what I think is \na real problem.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor, and I make a point of \norder a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  note\n\n  Due to a printing error, the following statement from the Record of \nJanuary 10 is reprinted in correct form at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S753-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S755-S756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            A MAN OF MANY TALENTS--SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Madison in the Federalist No. 53 states, in \npart, as follows:\n\n       No man can be a competent legislator who does not add to an \n     upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of \n     knowledge of the subjects on which he is to legislate. A part \n     of this knowledge may be acquired by means of information \n     which lie within the compass of men in private as well as \n     public stations. Another part can only be attained, or at \n     least thoroughly attained, by actual experience in the \n     station which requires the use of it.\n\n  In the same Federalist paper, Madison writes as follows:\n\n       A few of the members, as happens in all such assemblies, \n     will possess superior talents; will, by frequent reelections, \n     become members of long standing; will be thoroughly masters \n     of the public business, and perhaps not unwilling to avail \n     themselves of those advantages. The greater the proportion of \n     new members and the less the information of the bulk of the \n     members, the more apt will they be to fall into the snares \n     that may be laid for them.\n\n  Mr. President, I speak today of a Senator who has demonstrated \nsuperior talents, a Senator with 22 years of experience in this body--\nMadison, having referred to men of ``superior talents'' and also to the \nadvantages of \n [[Page S756]] ``experience''--and Bennett Johnston is that man of whom \nI speak.\n  There is no department of public life in which the test of man's \nability is more severe than service in this body. Little deference is \npaid to reputation previously acquired or to eminent performances won \nelsewhere. What a man accomplishes in this Chamber, he does so by sheer \nforce of his own character and ability. It is here that one must be \nprepared to answer for the many talents or for the single talent \ncommitted to his charge.\n  Bennett Johnston came to this body 22 years ago as a man of many \ntalents. He did not wrap his talents in a napkin or hide them in the \nearth, as both Luke the Physician and Matthew make reference, but he \nput them to use that they might bear increase for his State, for his \ncountry, for the Senate, and for his fellow man. He has proved himself \nto be a superior legislator. I have served with him these 22 years on \nthe Committee on Appropriations. He has proved himself to be a man with \ncourage, with vision, with conviction, a man who is diligent in his \nwork and faithful to his oath of office.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations during the \nlast 6 years, I found him always to be conscientious and a man of his \nword. Fully aware of the admonition by Polonius that ``those friends \nthou hast and their adoption tried, grapple them to thy soul with hoops \nof steel,'' it is with pride that I call Bennett Johnston friend. It is \nwith sincere sadness that I have heard of his decision and I regret \nthat, with the passing of these final 2 years of his term, the Senate \nwill have witnessed the departure of one who has effectively toiled \nhere in its vineyards and who has earned the respect and admiration of \nhis colleagues. The people of the State of Louisiana chose well when, \nby the exercise of their franchise, they sent him here.

Mr. President, this amendment is fairly simple. It \nwould include Members of Congress in actions that result from missing \nbudget targets that have been set forth under the Budget Act. It would \nsay that if we miss the targets specified and a sequester takes place, \nreductions in accounts across-the-board, or on a specific account, that \nwe would also include Members' salaries; that we would therefore cut, \non a like proportion basis, the salaries of Senators and \nCongresspersons if the Congress failed to achieve its budgetary targets \nof limits on Government spending.\n  The amendment would eliminate a defect in current law that excludes \ncongressional pay from across-the-board cuts or sequesters when \nspending limits are exceeded.\n  Mr. President, the central purpose of the pending bill, the \ncongressional responsibility bill, is to create the same standards for \nMembers of Congress as those applying to other citizens. The bill says \nthat if we are going to impose laws on ordinary Americans, we are going \nto have to live up to those laws we in the Congress, we in the Senate, \nthe same laws as we ask our constituents to obey. That is an important \nprinciple, Mr. President, and it is why I strongly support the \nunderlying bill.\n  Unfortunately, the pending legislation does not put Congress and the \npublic on even par, at least in one very important respect. In fact, \none double standard in place would absolutely surprise the American \npeople if they were more aware of it. And I will take a moment to \nexplain.\n  Under the Budget Act, if Congress exceeds certain limits on spending \nor fails to meet legally-established deficit targets, then the act may \nmandate automatic across-the-board spending cuts to assure that we \nmaintain fiscal discipline. These across-the-board cuts are known as \nsequesters and they can apply to a very broad range of Federal programs \nand benefits.\n  Let us make no mistake. If Congress overspends under the Budget Act, \nordinary Americans get hurt in the process--veterans can lose benefits \nthey earned while fighting for our country; senior citizens with health \nproblems can lose services under Medicare; middle-class students can \nlose the opportunities that student loans afford; and citizens living \nconstantly these days in fear can lose the protection of additional \nlaw-enforcement personnel.\n  And yet, while ordinary Americans' programs are put on the chopping \nblock, when their health, their security, and their educations are put \nat risk, guess who it is that gets off scot-free? That is right. \nMembers of Congress. Their pay is protected, no matter what happens.\n  Mr. President, there is something wrong with saying that, if Congress \nviolates the Budget Act, benefits for ordinary citizens should be cut, \nveterans' services should be cut, senior citizens' Medicare should be \ncut, student loans should be cut; the unemployed job training should be \ncut, but congressional salaries, those are sacrosanct, not to be \ntouched.\n It is not right. If the public knew more about it, they would perhaps \n  be even angrier than they already are.Mr. President, I have been \nbothered by this double standard for some time. In the last Congress, I \nintroduced legislation to eliminate this double standard. I called it \nthe Congressional Overspending Pay Accountability Act. It was designed \nto do what its name suggested: Hold Members of Congress accountable if \nthey overspend and if they violate their own budget rules.\n  This amendment is based generally on that earlier bill. I offer it \ntoday because the Congressional Accountability Act is the ideal vehicle \nfor solving this problem. After all, this bill is about eliminating \ndouble standards. And the loophole that protects Members' salaries from \nspending cuts is the ultimate double standard. Unfortunately, in its \ncurrent form, this bill does nothing about it unless this amendment is \nadopted.\n  So the amendment is very simple. It says that if Congress overspends, \nthe pay of each Member of Congress shall be reduced by the same amount \nas all other affected spending. For example, if we exceed discretionary \nspending targets and trigger a sequester of 5 percent, Member pay for \nthat next year will be cut 5 percent, as well. If the sequester cuts \nother programs by 1 percent, then the pay of Members of Congress will \nbe reduced by 1 percent. I think it is important that if a target is \nmissed, the pain be distributed equally. When cuts are made in \nprograms, opportunities for education or health care are reduced. I \nthink, somehow or other, we in the United States Congress ought to feel \nit some way other than putting a pencil to the paper.\n  We are recommending this amendment. I hope all of my colleagues will \nsupport it. I think it is a show of good faith. I think, otherwise, it \nsmacks a little bit of hypocrisy to say we do not want our pay cuts, \nbut we want everybody else's programs cut. I think it does not ring a \nvery true signal for the American people. This amendment proposes to \ntreat Members of Congress just like all other ordinary Americans who \nget hurt when the Budget Act mandates across-the-board cuts. I believe \nthat is only fair.\n  We have not heard a lot about sequesters lately, Mr. President. In \nthe past, we have seen sequesters as high as 5 percent, such as the one \nthat reduced the military budget by that amount in 1986. Recently, \nCongress has complied with the Budget Act and has made a lot of tough \nchoices. The threat of sequester has now increased substantially. Many \nin this town are intent on both increasing military spending and \nproviding huge tax breaks to the wealthy at the same time we have heard \npromises of huge cuts in total Government spending. Apart from a few \nsmall symbolic programs proposed for elimination, we have not heard \nmuch of the details. We do not know whose benefits will be cut. We do \nnot know whose programs will be eliminated.\n  Mr. President, if Congress locks itself in too tightly in overall \nspending caps, and then refuses to make the tough decisions to cut \nspecific programs, what will happen? Well, one likely result will be a \nsequester. That possibility looms larger now than it has in many years.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of debate now going on about a balanced \nbudget amendment. The reason that that has developed is because all of \nus, whether one is a supporter of the balanced budget amendment or not, \nare anxious to bring this budget of ours under control. So we are \nresorting to techniques, we are resorting to programs instead of \nthoughtful planning on how to do it.\n  What we are saying is let us pass the balancing on to an amorphous \nstructure, something that says if we cannot do it--and I think it is a \nblink of the eye, because we can do it--if we cannot do it, let them do \nit.\n  The case of the balanced budget amendment obviously, at one point \nalong the line, falls to the courts to pick up the responsibilities. So \nI want to establish the fact--and I think my colleagues will agree--\nthat we, too, are at risk in some way if we fail to do what we tell the \npublic we want to do.\n  Mr. President, there will be handouts to the rich. They will be paid \nfor in the end. There is a good chance that they will be paid for by \nordinary Americans, whose Medicare and other benefits are subject to \nsignificant across-the-board cuts. The question I ask is, will Members \nof Congress feel their pain? Under the present structure, it does not \nlook that way. The meat ax may fall, but our heads will not be in the \nguillotine. The blood on the floor will be the blood of lots of \nordinary folks who have worked hard, played by the rules, and tried to \nmake ends meet; but, once again, they will be asked to make or told \nthat they are the ones who will make the sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful the reason we will prevail and we will \navoid that kind of fiscal irresponsibility is the threat is real. If \nthe ax falls, Members of Congress should risk their necks, as well. Mr. \nPresident, even if we never have another sequester, we should eliminate \nthe loophole for Members' pay. It is a matter of principle. It is the \nexact same principle, the principle that motivates this bill. Members \nof Congress are citizens, like everybody else. When we violate our own \nbudget rules, we should not give ourselves any special exemptions.\n  The staff that joins us here in this room, that supports Senators in \ntheir offices and supports Senators in their \n [[Page S758]] committees--hard-working people, people who want to do a \njob and get a decent day's pay--wants to know that their pensions are \nsecure when it comes time to retire. If there is a sequester, they feel \nit in their paychecks when the legislative budgets are reduced. That \nrisk ought to be applied to those who are writing the bills. We ought \nto cut our pay to the same extent that anyone else who works for the \nGovernment might get cut if a sequester takes place.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about reform, this amendment should \npass overwhelmingly. I think that as each of the Members comes up to \nthe well and announces their vote, that it is important the public be \naware of the fact that if they vote ``no,'' or vote against this \namendment, that what they are saying is the old expression that kicks \naround here, ``Do not tax you and do not tax me, tax the guy behind the \ntree.'' That is what we are saying if this amendment fails to pass. I \nam hopeful that we will see it pass, because I think it is an important \ndeclaration of principle to the American people. I think it says to \nthem that we are in the same boat as they are.\n  It is a privilege to serve in this body. We are privileged and \nhonored to have the responsibility of writing the laws that make this \ncountry a better place to live. We will be able to put our imprimatur, \nour signature on this, if we adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, how much time is \nremaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If a quorum call is put in place, how is the time \ncharged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It requires unanimous consent at this time to \nput in the quorum call. The Senator must specify how the time would be \nsplit.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I \nhave pledged to the majority leader that he will have 5 minutes, I \nthink it is, to make his remarks. We will have the time run on our side \nof the clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object. I did not hear the \nunanimous-consent request. Was there one?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There is. The unanimous-consent request is, if I may, \nMr. President, that a quorum call be fully charged to our side because \nthe majority leader has a commitment under the previous order of a 5-\nminute response.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is OK with me.\n  Mr. President, I have 5 minutes under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is my understanding of the unanimous-\nconsent agreement, yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I allocate myself such time as I may consume out of the \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey withhold his \nquorum call?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Has the Senator yielded the floor?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, from the standpoint of a \nphilosophical approach to what the Senator from New Jersey is trying to \nespouse, as his amendment does, I have affiliated myself in the past \nwith some attempts--this is the first time I have heard this approach \nused--but I have offered amendments or cosponsored amendments myself \nthat would say there should be no pay raise for Members of Congress \nuntil we get the budget balanced.\n  I think the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] has offered an \namendment on the floor of this body before that I voted for that \nprobably would have cut our salary a certain period of time until we \ngot to a balanced budget. I voted for that. So I am not unsympathetic \nwith what the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is trying to \naccomplish. But I can say this in regard to the underlying legislation: \nThe underlying legislation attempts to, and I think successfully does, \napply the laws to Congress that we have exempted ourselves from that \npresently and for, in some instances, five decades have applied to the \nprivate sector, so that we no longer have a system of a double standard \nin America: One set of laws is for Congress and another set of laws is \nfor the rest of the Nation.\n  That principle underlying this legislation then is the main argument \nfor our not agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, \nbecause he imposes the requirement of sequestration on the rest of the \nbudget to the salaries of Members of Congress. We are dealing totally \nwithin the public sector here. It has nothing to do with the \napplication of laws that apply to the private sector on Congress from \nwhich laws we have been exempt, because the Federal budget, as an \ninstrumentality of public policy, does not apply to the private sector.\n  So, basically, the same argument can be used against the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey that has been used against the amendments \nthat have been proposed from the other side of the aisle on Thursday \nand Friday of last week, Monday and Tuesday of this week and now we are \nin the fifth day of discussing a bill. It is unrelated. It is a subject \nworthy of discussion, what the Senator brings to our attention, but not \non this legislation. So, consequently, not this time. In the first week \nof April, according to the Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the budget will be discussed in this \nbody, and that is the appropriate place for the Senator from New Jersey \nto offer his amendment.\n  It gives me an opportunity to emphasize then, as I said once today, \nand I have said each and every day this bill has been up, that we are \non our fifth day on a bill that the House of Representatives passed in \n20 minutes on their first day of the session. If there was one clear \nmessage in the last election, it was that we should no longer have \nbusiness as usual, and particularly this issue of the applicability of \nlaws that Congress has exempted itself from to Capitol Hill. That was a \nmajor issue in the last campaign.\n  There is hardly a freshman Member of this body that has not told me \nthat in every one of their campaigns--I am talking about the people \nthat were newly elected on November 8--there is not a one that said \nthis was not a centerpiece of their campaign. Do not take it from those \nof us who have been in this body a while. Take it from those who bring \nsome inspiration to this body to show the people of this country that \nthis body is not going to continue to act business as usual, ignore the \nwill of the people and do our own agenda, because the agenda was set by \nthe American people in this election--and this bill, this underlying \npiece of legislation that we are dealing with and will hopefully pass \nat 5 o'clock this afternoon, the Congressional Accountability Act, \nwhere we cover ourselves by the laws we have exempted ourselves from in \nthe past.\n  So, I am asking my colleagues not to reject the substance of what the \nSenator says, the author of this amendment, but to reject it for the \ntime being, and consider it again when the budget comes up the first \nweek in April.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on this amendment has \nexpired. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \nSenator from Iowa because he is someone who is very thoughtful. We \nserved together on the Budget Committee. He is concerned about what \ntakes place in terms of our acts related to the budget. I know that he \nis sincere when he makes the case for having this done at a later time.\n  I respectfully, however, disagree with my friend from Iowa because I \nthink, A, that there will be no delay in terms of final consideration \nof this bill. There is a unanimous-consent order that is for this \nevening, and any single Senator can prevent that order from being \naltered in any way. So the vote will take place. So there is no further \ndelay that is going to be caused by this amendment.\n  I think that it is quite clear that now--and I once again agree with \nthe \n [[Page S759]] distinguished Senator from Iowa--that we now are saying \nthat this House, this body is subject to the same laws that we write \nfor everybody else, and I agree with that. Therefore, in my view, this \nis the perfect opportunity to say not only will we obey the laws, in \nterms of our performance of our functions within our offices, but we \nare also going to take a personal hit if something goes awry if we do \nnot plan carefully enough to meet the budget targets that we have set.\n  That law has been in place now I guess for 7 years--1986, I am \nreminded, 8 years, 9 years now--and we have had a couple of sequester \nyears. But we have not had as much of a likelihood that a sequester ax \nwill fall as we have facing the next year's budget, because everyone \nknows that we are trying to squeeze things down. In the process, if we \nmiss those targets, we are going to have a sequester.\n  Once again, to overstate the case perhaps, I think that if the \nAmerican people's programs--and we are not necessarily talking about \nthe private sector, we are talking about the public sector, we are \ntalking about senior citizens, we are talking about veterans, we are \ntalking about students--if those programs are diminished, then I see no \nearthly reason why our salaries should not reflect some adjustment for \nthat year that corresponds with the reduction in programmatic dollars \nthat might be available.\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude my remarks. I yield back the remainder \nof my time and hope that we will adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement, what \nis the next order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business will be the Senator \nfrom Nevada will be recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we will check and see if he is on the way \nover, and while he is on the way over I might make some remarks \nparticularly addressed to people on our side of the aisle in that we on \nthe Democratic side are the ones who have had the amendments on this \nlegislation.\n  The distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, was able on his side \nto convince everyone to keep amendments off, with the idea of treating \nthis whole thing expeditiously and getting it through. I certainly \nshare his desire.\n  At the same time, it is within the right of every Senator to put \nforward amendments under Senate rules, whether germane or not. And I do \npersonally think there will come a time in the future when we do adopt \ngermaneness rules so we can keep a lot of extraneous legislation off of \nthe floor.\n  What I wanted to say in addressing our side of the aisle in \nparticular on this bill, we had a number of amendments and people lost \non those amendments. We did not succeed in passing any of them. \nSometimes when you get into debate in the Chamber, it gets into a \nrather heartfelt situation. We have issues about which people care very \nstrongly, and they are not willing to give up easily. And there is a \ntendency sometimes to vote against the underlying legislation because \npeople are in a state of semipique or disagreement or unhappiness \nbecause their particular amendment, which may or may not have been \ngermane, did not pass.\n  Now, I hope if we have anyone on our side of the aisle who is taking \nthat attitude and plans to vote against this bill because their \nparticular amendment was not accepted, we can convince them to put \naside that attitude and vote for this bill.\n  I think this bill is right. I think it is fair. There are a couple of \nthings that are addressed by this bill. One is the perception out there \nin the country that somehow we are above the law; that we treat \nourselves differently, and that is a perception, of course, about which \nwe all must be concerned.\n  But second, the importance of this bill, quite apart from dealing \nwith perceptions, it seems to me, is that you come back to the \nquestion, is it right or is it wrong that we pass this legislation? And \nI say it is right because what it does, it gives the same protection to \nour own Hill employees, those who work for us on Capitol Hill, that we \nhave passed here in years past and said it is good for the rest of the \ncountry; we want to protect the workers out there with OSHA laws and we \nwant fair employment laws and the right to organize--all these things \nthat we say, yes, sir, under the American justice system, this is right \nfor the rest of the country. I would say if it is right for the rest of \nthe country and if people need that kind of protection out there or \nhave rights that need protection, then our Hill employees have those \nsame rights and to treat them fairly we need to pass this kind of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I was asked earlier today by one of the leading \nreporters here that covers the House and covers the Senate on a regular \nbasis, just what difference does this bill make? Well, I think in some \nareas it makes a substantial change and in some areas it does not. \nThrough the years, we have provided some protections in laws in a \nrather haphazard manner, and the haphazard manner has extended also to \nthe process by which an employee could file a grievance of some kind \nand have it dealt with, with various procedures.\n  So what this bill does is to two things. One, it takes all of these \ndifferent laws--in fact, under the antidiscrimination laws we apply \nfour laws, some of which were covered before, some of which were not: \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Age Discrimination, Americans With \nDisabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, all under antidiscrimination; \nunder public services and accommodations under ADA: title II, Americans \nWith Disabilities; title III, Americans With Disabilities; workplace \nprotection laws: Fair Labor Standards Act regulations to be promulgated \nthat will track executive branch regulations on people that work \nirregular schedules or whose schedules depend directly on the Senate \nschedule, OSHA laws, Family and Medical Leave Act, Employee Polygraph \nProtection Act, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act, Veterans \nReemployment Act. Under labor-management relations, chapter 71 of title \nV will apply now.\n  So all of these are laws that we now say will apply, and we give a \nvery specific grievance process that employees can use to address \nwhatever problem they are having or however they feel they are being \ndiscriminated against or dealt with unfairly.\n  So it covers everything. And second, it provides this grievance \nprocess which we have not had before that takes care of some of the \nobjections our Members have had through the years about this separation \nof powers from one branch of Government to the other.\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague from Nevada in the \nChamber, and I am happy to yield to him anytime he is ready to go. I \nwas filling in momentarily here with some comments to people on our \nside of the aisle while the Senator prepared.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I just want to take a moment to commend the \nSenator from Ohio for his statement urging his colleagues to support \nthis legislation notwithstanding the defeat of a number of amendments \nthat were offered and rejected.\n  I might say, just speaking for myself, that a number of the \namendments which were offered, were they to be offered as free-standing \nlegislation, probably would enjoy broad bipartisan support. But we \nshould be clear about what is taking place. There is a momentum that \nhas started in the House of Representatives. There is the Contract with \nAmerica that the majority in the House and the Senate would like to see \nbrought to the floor for debate and disposition. The majority is \ndetermined during that first 100 days to do whatever it can to \nfacilitate that.\n  Now, given the fact that we have different rules in the Senate than \nin the House, they can act much more expeditiously than we can in the \nSenate. The Senate was not designed to act in that fashion. In fact, \nthis institution was designed to slow things down so we could have more \ncareful deliberation than the other body.\n  I must say that even though amendments were offered and rejected, it \ndid \n [[Page S760]] not necessarily reflect upon their respective merits. I \nwould hope that the Senator's colleagues would heed his call for \nsupport for the underlying legislation, not only, as he indicated, \nbecause if a law is right for others it should be right for us. We \nshould also recognize that the motivation for this legislation was not \nonly to impose a sense of equity but also a sense of reality.\n  Someone once described Washington as being a city of marble \nsurrounded on four sides by reality. That is what has been missing for \nthe most part in terms of the reality of the consequences of what we \ndo. We pass legislation from the very highest of motivations. We are \ntrying to help people who are in need of help. We are trying to improve \nworkplace safety; we are trying to improve the health and well-being of \nour constituents; we are trying to do many things on behalf of other \npeople. Yet we do not necessarily do so in a way that is reflective \nenough of the consequences that must be borne by others that we do not \nhave to bear ourselves.\n  So this is not only an issue of equity. I think it really is \nmotivated principally from an issue of reality--that we will be more \naware of the consequences of what we are about to do if we are forced \nto live under the same rules. So I would urge my colleagues to support \nthe recommendation of the Senator from Ohio that, notwithstanding the \nrejection of the amendments which were offered, they lend their support \nto this measure.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Nevada is ready and \nI think he was awaiting the arrival of the distinguished majority \nleader, who was to have a colleague with him, on the subject that he \nwill present.\n  Until the majority leader arrives, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S756-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S760-S761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CALIFORNIA FLOODS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thought it might be in order to give \na very brief status report on the condition of the flooding in the \nState of California. It is a strange and altogether tragic irony that \njust about 1 year ago southern California was hit by wildfire and then \nthe shattering Northridge earthquake. The 1-year anniversary of the \nNorthridge earthquake will be this coming Tuesday, January 17.\n  As we evaluate the recovery and expenditure of nearly $11 billion of \nFederal funding that has been committed to disaster relief in that \nearthquake, record levels of rain are falling in California and have \nbeen since late last week, flooding rivers, washing out roads, causing \nmud slides, knocking out electricity and water supplies, and affecting \nthe lives of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the State.\n  So I rise today, Mr. President, to give a brief status report on that \nrecord rainfall and flooding.\n  To begin with, I have been in contact with FEMA Director James Lee \nWitt, who is currently in California, and my State staff is on alert to \nprovide whatever assistance they can. In addition, Transportation \nSecretary Pena, Housing Secretary Cisneros, and Federal Highway \nAdministrator Slater are on a 1 o'clock flight today to California to \nassess what additional Federal assistance will be necessary in the days \nand weeks ahead.\n  Although the spirit in my State may be temporarily dampened, I am \nreally confident that Californians will once again show the resilience \nand the determination that we have shown in the past and that we will \novercome this disaster as we have the others. Californians have come \ntogether in times of disaster, and we will do so once again.\n  Last night, at about 11:30 p.m. eastern time, less than an hour after \na request from Gov. Pete Wilson, President Clinton declared a Federal \ndisaster for 24 of California's 58 counties. I thank the President on \nbehalf of California for quickly declaring this emergency so individual \ndisaster assistance funds could begin flowing.\n  FEMA started taking calls for disaster assistance as early as this \nmorn- ing. For those that might be watching \nC-SPAN, FEMA encourages all disaster victims to call this number, 1-\n800-462-9029, for information and to register for Federal assistance.\n  Preliminary estimates of the damage are as follows: At least six \npeople are dead; over 1 million have been affected by power outages up \nand down the State. Very preliminary damage estimates exceed $50 \nmillion as of now. This will undoubtedly rise as the waters recede and \na full assessment of damages is made. Thousands of people have been \nevacuated from their homes.\n  According to news reports, California has been hit with 6 months' \nworth of rain in 10 days. Last night I talked with Dr. Joe Friday, the \nDirector of the National Weather Service, and he stated to me that \nalthough there is a brief respite today, heavy rains are apt to \ncontinue through the weekend. More than 50 major highways and freeways \nand hundreds of roads are closed due to flooding. In one 7-hour period \nyesterday, the California highway patrol logged 530 accident calls. \nThat is more than five times the normal level, and by early afternoon \nhad dealt with almost 500 disabled vehicles just in southern California \nalone.\n  What is clear is that in many areas of the State near-record levels \nof rain have fallen with devastating consequences. Let me describe some \nexamples of just what the State is facing. In the Russian River area of \nnorthern California, the entire business district and hundreds of homes \nin the community of Guerneville in Sonoma County have been underwater \nfor the last few days. The Russian River has swelled to record flood \nlevels. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Monday's water flow in \nthe Russian River was the highest ever recorded. The word from \nCalifornia this morning is that the river has begun to recede back to \nnormal levels. However, Sonoma County has been without water, and the \nState is bringing water in. Everybody is being urged to boil their \nwater.\n  All 2,800 residents of Hamilton City in Glenn County were evacuated \nas the Sacramento River rose 3 feet above flood stage. People literally \nare kayaking down the main business street, State Street, in downtown \nSanta Barbara.\n  Many of the communities still recovering from last year's earthquake \nand severe wildfires have been particularly hard hit, such as Malibu \nand many of the canyons in southern California. Everything that was a \nriver or a creek yesterday is a flood basin today. The Pacific Coast \nHighway from Malibu to Santa Barbara has been closed due to mud slides.\n  Pepperdine University and local businesses in the Malibu canyon are \nclosed due to flooding. The Pepperdine campus was used for helicopter \nevacuations of residents in the surrounding canyon.\n  Fortunately, but not for lack of practice, the local, State, and \nFederal responses are timely and effective. The State Office of \nEmergency Services under the direction of Richard Andrews quickly \nestablished a state operations center to coordinate State assistance. \nThe California National Guard has activated 75 trucks, helicopters, \nboats, and 300 personnel, conducting rescue and evacuation operations \nin seven counties.\n  FEMA Director James Lee Witt, already in California, is remaining in \nthe State to coordinate the Federal disaster response. FEMA damage \nassessment teams have been on the ground since the weekend, though much \nof this work is impossible until the water finally recedes after the \nfinal rainfall. We do not know when that will be. FEMA has been \nrequested by the State not to establish disaster assistance centers. \nAll financial assistance to people will be done by teleregistration, \nthrough the number that I gave earlier. I would like to repeat it once \nagain. Anyone who is a victim of the flood and wishes either \ninformation or assistance should call 1-800-462-9029. The \n [[Page S761]] system is in place right now and will be taking calls \nfor as long as necessary. Personnel have been deployed from FEMA's \nInfrastructure, Individual Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Programs \nto California to begin work with State and local officials.\n  As I mentioned, Secretaries Cisneros and Pena are on their way now to \nCalifornia to decide what additional assistance might be warranted. I \nwill work closely with my colleague, Senator Boxer; my colleagues in \nthe House; and you, Mr. President, and others in the Senate. Over 30 \ncongressional districts in California have been affected by this \ndisaster, and we, together, will make sure that Federal response is \nswift, effective, and complete.\n  My heart goes out to the families that have members who have perished \nin this, our latest disaster, and to the many thousands of people that \nhave been affected by the rising waters. My message to them is that \nFEMA will be there until we can get people back in their homes, \nbusinesses back on their feet, and lives back in order.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S760-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S761-S762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Are we back in \nlegislative session now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take just a few moments because \nI understand from the Senator from Ohio that we will for a short period \ngo into recess following my statement, is that correct?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, that is correct. The majority leader said \nwhen we were finished now, we will go into recess until 4:30 when he \nwill come to the floor and have a colloquy with Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thought that while I was here I would \nsummarize this past week for other Senators, and just as important, for \npeople in the country, action of the Senate on some key political \nreform agenda items that were again blocked here in the Senate.\n  The piece of legislation that has been before this body is called the \nCongressional Accountability Act. There were a number of amendments \nintroduced on the floor this week that I think spoke to the heart of \naccountability. Many, many Senators have been talking about reform. I \njust want to summarize for a moment the record.\n  There was the Wellstone-Levin-Feingold-Lautenberg lobbyist gift ban. \nOne of the central political reform item agendas, Mr. President--along \nwith lobby registration and real campaign finance reform--and this was \ntabled on virtually a party-line vote. This was, once again, an \namendment that was connected to what all of us have said we are about, \nwhich is to end this taking of gifts, expensive meals, and vacation \ntravel from lobbyists and other special interests. I believe the \nSenator from Michigan, the occupant of the chair, was actually one of \nthe few from his side who voted for this. But with the exception of the \nSenator from Michigan and a couple of other Senators from the majority, \nit was almost a straight party-line vote.\n  There was another amendment, the Wellstone amendment, to restrict \npolitical contributions from lobbyists who have lobbied a Member within \na year. I think that goes to the heart of this sort of nexus between \nmoney and lobbying, and the extent to which people in the country feel \nleft out of the loop of governing. This, I am sad to say, was not just \na party vote. There was an overwhelming vote against this, and I really \nbelieve we are making a big mistake by not, in a very significant way, \nreforming this political process and doing something about the mix of \nmoney and its influence in politics.\n  There was an amendment by Senator Ford, from Kentucky, to prohibit \nthe personal use of frequent flier miles by Members of Congress and \nstaffers. While Senate rules already prohibit this, this amendment \nwould have codified the rule for us and extended the rule to House \nMembers.\n  Senator McConnell's amendment struck language from the Ford amendment \nthat would have applied the prohibition consistently to the House and \nSenate, allowing House Members to continue the practice of using \nfrequent flier miles for family vacations, expensive meals, and other \nmeans of having their lifestyles subsidized indirectly by their \nofficial travel, paid for by the taxpayer. So Senator Ford's reform \namendment was unsuccessful, voted down in what was largely a party \nvote.\n  There was the Exon amendment to require specificity in how we propose \nto get to a balanced budget and to prohibit outlays in excess of \nrevenues in the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, what Senator Exon was trying to do was say, let us \nhave some truth in budgeting, let us be accountable, let us be honest \nand direct with people about the cuts we are going to be making if we \npass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That amendment \nwas defeated by almost a party-line vote. Now, I opposed that amendment \nfor other reasons, but I do believe that, at a minimum, Members of \nCongress ought to make clear the huge cuts that would be required by \nthe balanced budget amendment before we vote on it. By and large, that \nvote on the Ford amendment was also a party-line vote.\n  Again, what Senator Exon was trying to say for those who were for the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget--I am not--is please be \ndirect and honest with people and let us be clear about how we propose \nto get there. It was voted down on what was, by and large, a party-line \nvote.\n  There was the Kerry amendment to prohibit the personal use of \ncampaign funds. It would have imposed tough new rules to prevent abuses \nby some Members of Congress in this area, including the leasing of cars \nfor essentially personal use in the Washington area, paying for \nrecreational travel, meals, and the like. Again, this amendment was \ntabled.\n  There was another attempt to address the problem of personal use of \nfrequent flier miles by my colleague, the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nGlenn. The Glenn amendment was to extend to the legislative branch the \nsame frequent flier rules that apply to the executive branch. That was \ntabled on essentially a party-line vote.\n  And finally, Mr. President, and I summarize, there was the Wellstone \namendment on children. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave been saying over and over again, ``We are not going to impose cuts \nthat are going to hurt children, that would create more hunger or \nhomelessness among children.'' This amendment asked Senators to go on \nrecord voting for what they have been saying. Believe it or not, that \namendment was tabled on virtually a party-line vote.\n  Mr. President, I just present this summary because somewhere, \nsomeplace in the United States of America, people should know that the \nso-called reformers did not follow through on a great deal of the \nreform agenda; in fact, they are blocking it. Americans should know \nthat there is much that we can and should and must do to make this \nprocess more open, more accountable, more honest. And over and over and \nover again, on many important amendments, we had virtually straight \nparty-line votes defeating these reform efforts by people who ran for \noffice on a reform agenda.\n  Mr. President, I know that the majority leader on ``Face the Nation'' \na couple of weeks ago, in talking about the gift ban said something to \nthe effect that: ``We're in control of the Congress now, and we're \ngoing to set the agenda.''\n  Party control has shifted, and the majority leader is a skillful \nlegislator and a skillful leader. But my question, Mr. President, \nlooking at the past week is: When are we going to get beyond party-line \nvotes? When are we going to get to the merits of amendments if, every \ntime a Senator brings \n [[Page S762]] an amendment to the floor, it is automatically tabled \nbecause the majority leader says that is not what our party is going to \nsupport?\n  My question for my colleagues is: When are we going to see a little \nmore independence?\n  I hope that we follow through on commitments we have made to the \npeople in this country, which is that we are going to be serious about \nreforming this process. The Congressional Accountability Act is a good, \nsound, positive piece of legislation in that direction, but we had an \nopportunity to do much more, and I have given examples of amendment \nafter amendment after amendment that I bet 90-plus percent of Americans \nwould support which were tabled on virtually party-line votes. I \nthought people wanted us to get beyond that. I thought people wanted \neach and every one of us to be independent, to vote on the merits of \nthe legislation, to vote on what we think would be good for the people \nback home.\n  Did Senators vote against an amendment saying we would not do \nanything to create more hunger and homelessness among children because \nthey thought this amendment was not good for the people they represent \nback home? Did Senators vote against gift ban or abuses of frequent \nflier miles or other campaign finance reform measures because they \nthought the people back home whom they represent did not want them to \nvote for these amendments? It was virtually a straight party-line vote.\n  So, Mr. President, we will see, with the unfunded mandates bill that \nwill be before the body within the next day or so, but I certainly hope \nas soon as possible, Senators will consider each and every amendment \nbased on their merits, not based on party calculation--based upon what \nthe people back home would want them to do--or based on their own \npersonal convictions and independence, regardless of what they think \nthe majority of people back home want to do.\n  Different people have different models of how they represent their \nStates. Right now, what I have seen, by and large, is virtually a \nstraight party-line vote, all about control, all about power, and not \nabout the merits of the amendments or the legislation, but a retreat \nfrom the very reform agenda that many of my colleagues said they were \ncommitted to.\n  So I look forward to the next piece of legislation, and I hope that \nwe will do better. I intend to continue to fight for this political \nreform agenda, including lobbying registration and gift ban reform, and \ntough, comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation here in the \nSenate. I commend my colleagues on their work on the Congressional \nAccountability Act, which I wholeheartedly support.

As the majority leader prefers. I am willing to do it \neither way.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think I should respond to the Senator's request.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, yesterday I was prepared to \noffer an amendment to the Congressional Accountability Act, S. 2, which \nwould have made congressional pensions and that of our employees on a \nparity with other Federal civil servants.\n  The distinguished majority leader and I had several conversations on \nthe floor yesterday evening. I received an assurance from him that he \nbelieved that this is an important issue for the Senate to address. I \nknow that it is his intention to do so, and I accept his representation \nthat this is a matter that is going to come before the body.\n  I indicated to the majority leader that I would forbear in offering \nthe amendment. However, if I saw no action by the Easter recess of this \nyear, it would be my intention to offer an amendment on congressional \npension reform, to any piece of legislation which might then be pending \non the floor of the Senate for action.\n  I am satisfied in my own mind that the majority leader shares my \ncommitment to address this and I accept his representation and I thank \nhim for his comments.\n  But I think that our colleagues need to understand, that although we \nare not going to be voting on this today because of the commitment that \nI have had from the distinguished majority leader, this is not an issue \nwe are going to be able to postpone and bury. It is going to come \nbefore the Senate very shortly. I want to acknowledge and express my \nappreciation to the distinguished majority leader for his assurances \nalong that line. I look forward to working with him and our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I know that we have a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwho share the concerns just expressed and \n [[Page S763]] that the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, may wish to say a word at this time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Nevada for his efforts on \nthis subject. This was an area that I had expressed interest in in the \nHouse. In fact, I introduced a bill that almost mirrors word for word \nwhat the Senator from Nevada is doing.\n  This is an important issue of gaining credibility with the American \npublic that we are not going to treat ourselves any different than any \nother Federal employee when it comes to employee benefits. It puts us \non a level no more and no less generous than other Federal employees. I \nthink that is where we should be.\n  There is no reason that we should have a more generous pension system \nhere than other Federal employees. That is what the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada would do. I will join him in cosponsoring his bill.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's intention to allow this to \npercolate through the committee system and give it an opportunity for \nhearings--this is a new subject that has not been discussed in \ncommittee--give it an opportunity to be discussed in committee and \nhopefully be moved through in a speedy fashion. But, if not, we have \nthe opportunity to come to the floor and then offer an amendment to a \nbill here to move this issue to the floor, where I believe it belongs.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding and for his agreement to do \nthis.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know, in addition to the Senator from \nPennsylvania on this side of the aisle, the Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Thompson, has a direct interest in this legislation.\n  I wish to commend Senator Bryan as the prime mover of this effort. I \nthink it should be addressed. It will be addressed, I can assure the \nSenator from Nevada, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and other Senators. \nWe need to find out, we need to determine, we need to make a record to \nmake certain that congressional pensions are in line with other Federal \nemployees. If they are too generous or if they are out of line, then we \nneed to make changes.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Bryan, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, are going \nto introduce legislation today and, if introduced, this legislation \nwill be referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. After \nconsulting some of my colleagues on the committee, including the \ndistinguished chairman from Delaware, Senator Roth, I have every reason \nto believe that the committee or one of its subcommittees will hold \nhearings on the pension reform issue at some point later this year.\n  Now, let me make it very clear--because I know the Senator from \nNevada is acting in good faith, and this Senator is acting in good \nfaith--not only will we have hearings, but we hope something will be \nreported out of the committee. Because, if it is not reported out of \nthe committee, then I am not going to stand here and block an effort by \nthe Senator from Nevada later on if he stands up to offer an amendment \nto something else. I give him that assurance right now.\n  It should come out of the committee with a big bipartisan vote. If it \nis determined changes should be made, it ought to be made on a \nbipartisan basis. It ought to be brought to the floor and we ought to \nact on it.\n  I told the Senator from Nevada last night--he talked about the Easter \nrecess; it may not happen quite that quickly--that I think there should \nbe some pressure, I do not mean it in the negative sense, for the \ncommittee to respond as quickly as possible. I know there are other \nthings that have to be done. But this, too, should be a priority in the \nchain of events, because a lot of people are concerned about this; a \nlot of people write to us about this. So let us address it. Let us face \nup to it.\n  So I just assure the Senator from Nevada, as I did last evening, that \nI am sympathetic to what he is attempting to do and I will be trying to \ncooperate with him every step of the way.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  I might just inquire, in terms of procedure, it originally was my \nintention to make a statement about the bill. I know you have a \nrollcall vote scheduled at this time. I am prepared to make about a 5- \nor 10-minute statement, if that is agreeable to you.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will introduce legislation that will put \ncongressional retirement benefits and that of our employees--I think it \nis important for Members, as well as the public generally, to \nunderstand that what we are talking about is not only Members of \nCongress but our employees are in this same system--that will put our \nbenefits and those of our employees on a parity with other Federal \nemployees.\n Under current law, as has been alluded to on the floor moments ago, \nthe pensions Members of Congress and our employees receive are \nconsiderably more generous than those of other Federal employees. It is \nmy judgment this practice is not justifiable and, in fact, is \n  unacceptable.Under the present retirement system, Members of Congress \nand other Federal employees who were part of the Federal work force \nprior to 1984 are enrolled in the Civil Service Retirement System \n[CSRS].\n  Under 1984 legislation, all Members of Congress, our employees, and \nother Federal employees are enrolled in FERS or the Federal Employee \nRetirement System. This chart illustrates the point that my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania was making just a moment ago. The accrual rate is \nsignificant because the accrual rate multiplied by the number of years \nof service and the final high-3 salary determines your pension. For \nexample, an individual under the old system, who has been a Member of \nCongress or congressional employee, has an accrual rate of 2.5 percent. \nSo for a 10-year period of time, that Member would receive a pension of \n25 percent of their final high-3 salary. Under FERS, the accrual rate \nfor Members is 1.7 percent, therefore, a Member who serves 10 years \nwould have pension of 17 percent of their final high-3 salary. You can \nsee that the old system is considerably more generous than the new \nsystem.\n  The accrual rate for other Federal employees under the CSRS system is \n1.5 percent for their first 5 years; 1.75 percent in second 5 years; \nafter 10 years of service, 2 percent.\n  You can see that throughout the entire system, Members of Congress \nare treated more favorably for purposes of the retirement system. Now, \nit is fair to point out that under the Civil Service Retirement System, \nMembers do contribute 8 percent, non-Members of Congress, nonemployees \nof Congress, contribute only 7 percent. Even though there is a 1-\npercent differential in contribution, the Member's pension is a \nsubstantially enhanced benefit.\n  That same disproportionate formula carries through under the FERS \nsystem where Members of Congress and our employees get a 1.7-percent \naccrual rate, which means in 10 years we would receive a pension of 17 \npercent of our final high-3 salary. The accrual rate for other federal \nemployees is 1 percent, so they would only receive a pension of 10-\npercent of their final high-3 salary.\n  Once again, the contribution rate for Members of Congress and our \nemployees is 1.3 percent, which is slightly higher than the .8 percent \nthat non-Members of Congress and our employees would be contributing.\n  The thrust of this legislation, Mr. President and my colleagues, is \nsimply to put everybody on a level playing field prospectively. Any \naccrued benefit would not be taken away. Service under the old system \nwould be calculated under the old formula. Only future service would be \ncalculated under the new formula.\n  I think it is only fair that we not treat ourselves, as Members of \nCongress, differently from other dedicated public servants who may \nserve in the Park Service or the Department of Transportation, in which \ntheir devotion to public service is no less than our own.\n  Let me give you the practical impact of that, and then I will yield \nthe floor here in a moment.\n  Members will recall I described the FERS system as one for those of \nus who have been hired since 1984. For 10 years of service as a Member \nof Congress, our pension would be 17 percent of the average of the last \n3 years of our service prior to retirement. Those in \n [[Page S764]] the executive branch of the civil service would get only \na 10-percent pension of their average of the last 3 years. In 20 years, \nMembers of Congress get a 34-percent pension; other Federal employees \nunder the FERS system get 20 percent. For 30 years, it is 44 percent, \nand other members that are not Members of Congress or their employees \nreceive substantially less.\n  Under the old system, which existed prior to 1984, 10-year Members of \nCongress get a 25-percent pension of the average of their last 3 \nhighest years; other executive branch employees get 16.4 percent. For \n20 years, Members of Congress get 50 percent and executive branch gets \n36.5 percent. For 30 years, it is 75 percent, and other federal \nemployees receive 56.3 percent.\n  My point is that we seek equality of treatment. It is a principle \nembraced, I think, in the Congressional Accountability Act. That is one \nof the reasons why I had proposed to offer it as an amendment at that \ntime. Let me just say, based upon the assurances of the majority \nleader, which I accept, I have agreed to forbear and not to offer this \namendment. I said by Easter, we would take a look and see if this \nlegislation is moving. If it is, I am willing to give some additional \ntime. This is not an issue that we will be able to dodge. I intend to \nbring it to the floor. I know a number of our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle share a similar perspective.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that I think it is \nabsolutely essential to show the American people that we are not \ntreating ourselves differently from other members of the Federal civil \nservice. Members of Congress should not receive a more generous \nretirement. This is a matter of fairness.\n  I would have to say that in townhall meetings we have in Nevada, this \nissue comes up many times. I have asked why this exists. That is why I \nintroduced legislation along these lines in the last session of \nCongress.\n  How is it that Members of Congress are treated differently than other \ncivil service employees? I think the answer is, it is not defensible. \nWe cannot justify it, in my view. We have an obligation to change it \nprospectively. I am persuaded by the show of bipartisan interest and \nsupport. I think we can change it. We ought to change it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to eliminate what I consider one of the major areas of inequality \nthat exists between the Congress and others who serve in Federal \nservice positions outside of Capitol Hill. We should do it as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nmomentarily the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n       (Purpose: To make technical amendments)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed at this point in the Record:)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the health, safety, and labor \nlaws that now protect workers in the private sector should cover the \nFederal Government. Applying these laws to the Congress is a long \noverdue reform which has my total support.\n  I am disappointed that I am not able to be in Washington this week to \nparticipate in this important legislation. However, I am conducting \nvery critical business for the people of West Virginia that I felt \ncould not be put aside.\n  Early last year, I initiated plans to lead a large trade and \ninvestment mission to Japan and Taiwan beginning January 7. The mission \nwas scheduled for this time to make sure it would take place when the \nCongress was not in session. Unfortunately, the congressional schedule \nwas changed at the last minute by the new leadership, long after plans \nfor this important mission had been finalized and could not be changed.\n  The mission, known as Project Harvest, includes 27 business leaders \nfrom important and different West Virginia industries. Working with the \nU.S. Department of Commerce and the State of West Virginia, the \nDiscover the Real West Virginia Foundation is coordinating our search \nfor export opportunities and high-paying, secure jobs for our State. It \nis, I believe, a historic journey that will reap benefits to the people \nof West Virginia for many years to come.\n  I am proud to be able to lead this historic Project Harvest mission \non behalf of the people of West Virginia, but regret that it takes me \nfrom Washington during this time when we are considering the \nCongressional Accountability Act.\n  In the current rush to reform, we should not overlook that this bill \nis almost identical to legislation drafted by Senators Glenn, \nLieberman, and Grassley in the last Congress. That legislation, known \nas the manager's amendment to H.R. 4822, was blocked from consideration \nin the Senate by stealth objectors.\n  What is now taking place is enactment of legislation previously \nblocked by those who have finally ``seen the light'' in the need for \nthis reform. In the coming months, I am sure we will see other \nconversions from the obstructionism that we saw so frequently in the \nlast Congress to an eagerness to take action. It's unfortunate that \nAmericans had to wait.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that the people of West Virginia have seen \nfit to send me to represent them in the U.S. Senate. There are many \ndedicated and good people who are elected and appointed to serve here. \nAs we press forward to review and reform, we must be mindful to those \nwho have preceded us, and the legacy we will leave to those who follow.\n  [[Page S766]] We should never forget the counsel of the Framers of \nthe Constitution who provided for independence between the branches of \nGovernment. We have the solemn responsibility to preserve and defend \nthat independence.\n  None among us takes that charge more seriously that the senior \nSenator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] who has raised reasonable concerns \nabout the provisions of this bill which will permit investigations and \nreview of the Congress by other branches of the Government. We should \nall be wary of what could become improper meddling in the \nconstitutional system.\n  I share those concerns, and believe we can fully preserve a proper \nbalance of powers between the legislative, the judicial, and the \nexecutive branches of Government, and at the same time, better protect \nour staff. I am satisfied that this legislation strikes the necessary \nbalance. I commend the sponsors of this bill, and am thankful to \nSenator Ford for his leadership in reminding us of our institutional \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, another of our responsibilities in the Senate is to \ncarefully review and improve what may be popular legislation which \noften receives less careful scrutiny in the other body. I am \nastonished, for example, that so many of my colleagues rejected the \nefforts in the past few days to strengthen and improve the \nCongressional Accountability Act. Why should we not seek to finally \ngain enactment of long-delayed gift-ban legislation, approved last \nyear, and then blocked from final passage in the final days of that \nsession? What better time to limit undue influence than this \nlegislation to improve the workings of the Congress?\n  I certainly support this and other amendments aimed at improving the \noperations of the Congress. Unfortunately, all of these improving \namendments were rejected in the past week. I note that none of these \nvotes has been close, and that my vote would not have changed the \noutcome of any proposed amendment.\n  Mr. President, solving the problems of my people in West Virginia has \nmy total attention. That is why I have worked so very hard over the \npast three decades to find and bring well-paying, secure jobs to our \nState, and why I now am away from the Senate. In a changing world and \nglobal economy, our State will need to look far beyond its borders to \nfind the resources we will need to create long-term employment and \nprosperity.\n  I take seriously my duty to participate in the proceedings of the \nSenate, and to exercise the opportunity afforded me to cast my vote for \nWest Virginia on the Senate floor. I am hopeful that the people of my \nState will realize how very seriously I take my responsibilities to \nmake our State a better and more prosperous place to live. Sponsoring \nand leading a delegation of West Virginia business people to Japan and \nTaiwan is part of that effort, and I wanted to insert this explanation \nof my absence in the Senate and why I felt it could not be \navoided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Congressional Accountability Act (S. 2), and to urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote for this legislation. This legislation is way \noverdue.\n  When the American electorate voted in a Republican congressional \nmajority, the public's sentiment could not have been clearer. Their \nmessage to Capitol Hill was straightforward: End business as usual and \nbecome more accountable to the will of the people.\n  The legislation that we are about to vote on is the Senate's first \nresponse back to the American public. In this bill we say to the \nAmerican public that we must live under the same rules and laws that we \nimpose on the rest of the country. For too long, the House and the \nSenate have acted with an arrogance about our institutions. We have, in \neffect, said that we are above the law. Today, that arrogance ends.\n  Under this legislation, Congress is required to comply with the same \nhealth, safety, civil rights, and labor laws that all American \nbusinesses must comply with. And that means compliance with the 57-\nyear-old Fair Labor Standards Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act of 1970; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and a host of \nother laws that Congress has deemed appropriate to impose on American \nbusiness.\n  It is astounding to this Senator that we have waited so long to pass \nthis legislation. There is not a constituent in my State of Alaska who \ncan comprehend how we as legislators can exempt ourselves from the \nhealth, safety, and labor laws that they must contend with. Nor can I.\n  But with the passage of this bill, our message to the American people \nis that Republicans have heard your voice and we are going to change \nhow the people's business is conducted in Washington DC. This is but \nthe beginning, an important first step, but only a step.\n  Tomorrow we will begin debate on another piece of legislation that \nparallels the concepts embodied in S. 2. The legislation we will begin \nconsidering tomorrow (S. 1) will bring to an end the practice of \nWashington sending mandates to the States and local governments--\nordering them to comply with a plethora of new laws and regulations--\nand not giving the States and local governments a single dime to comply \nwith these directives from Capitol Hill.\n  The thread that unfunded mandates and congressional law exemptions \nshare is insular arrogance. It reflects a political philosophy which \nimplies that we in Washington know what is best for the country, but we \nare unwilling to live by the laws we expect everyone else to live by, \nand we are unwilling to share in the costs of complying with the laws \nwe impose on the rest of the country.\n  But with the election of the first Republican congressional majority \nin more than 40 years, Congress' insular arrogance is ending. We will \nlive by the same laws as the rest of the country and we will begin a \ndebate about ending more than three decades of deficit spending by \nchanging our Constitution to put an end to Federal deficit spending.\n  Mr. President, the American public is closely watching this Congress. \nI believe today's vote unmistakably shows that when they put their \nfaith and trust in the new Republican majority, their hopes for change \nwould not be disappointed. I hope that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle will see the wisdom of adopting this legislation on a \nbipartisan basis. There is no excuse for Congress to remain above the \nlaw.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in federalist No. 57, James Madison made the \nfollowing observation. He said:\n\n       [The House of Representatives is] restrain[ed] from \n     oppressive measures [because] they can make no law which will \n     not have its full operation on themselves and their friends, \n     as well as on the great mass of the society. This has always \n     been deemed one of the strongest bonds by which human policy \n     can connect the rulers and the people together. It creates \n     between them that communion of interests and sympathy of \n     sentiments of which few Governments have furnished examples * \n     * * if this spirit shall ever be so far debased as to \n     tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature as well as \n     on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate \n     anything but liberty.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Congress has not always adhered to \nJames Madison's timeless vision of representative Government. For far \ntoo long, Congress has severed its connection with the people, imposing \nnew rules and regulations on the private sector, while seeking to \nexempt itself from those same rules.\n  Not surprisingly, many of our citizens have begun to view the Senate \nand the House of Representatives as\nthe Imperial Congress, as an institution that considers itself above \n  the law and without accountability.This past election day, the \nAmerican people finally decided it was time to shake up the Washington \nstatus quo. Not only do the American people want less Government, less \nregulation, and lower taxes, they also want Congress to clean up its \nown act by living under the very laws we seek to impose on everyone \nelse.\n  Last week, by a unanimous vote of 429 to 0, the House passed its own \nversion of congressional-coverage legislation, taking the first big \nstep toward restoring the credibility of Congress with the American \npeople. And, if all goes according to plan, we could have a \ncongressional-coverage bill on the President's desk as early as next \nweek--the first bill passed by the 104th Congress, and the first bill \nof the new \n [[Page S767]] Congress signed into law by President Clinton.\n  As a result of S. 2, Congress will have to abide by the minimum wage \nand civil rights laws. Congressional offices will be subject to OSHA-\nstyle inspections. Congressional employees will have the right to \nunionize. And they will be entitled to family and medical leave, just \nlike workers in the private sector.\n  To ensure that Congress abides by these laws, S. 2 establishes an \nindependent Office of Compliance with a five-member Board of Directors. \nThe Directors on the Board will be jointly appointed by the Senate \nmajority leader, the Senate minority leader, the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives, and the House minority leader. The Office will also \nhave a general counsel, an executive director, and two deputy executive \ndirectors, one for the Senate and one for the House. Each of the deputy \nexecutive directors will be responsible for promulgating the \nimplementing regulations for his or her respective House.\n  In addition, S. 2 contains an important provision that hasn't \nreceived much attention during this debate. This provision requires \nthat any future legislation affecting private employment must be \naccompanied by a report describing the manner in which the legislation \nwill apply to Congress. If any provision of the proposed law does not \napply to Congress, the report must\n include a statement explaining why this is so. This reporting \nrequirement will help ensure that Congress resists the temptation of \nexempting itself from future regulations and rules.\n\n  Hopefully, Mr. President, S. 2 will herald a new era of regulatory \ncaution, where Congress thinks twice before imposing a new Government-\ncrafted requirement on the private sector. It's one thing for Congress \nto create a new regulatory burden; it's something quite different when \nCongress has to bear the burden too.\n  In fact, S. 2 may have its biggest impact on the private sector, as \nCongress becomes increasingly reluctant to impose more rules, more \nregulations, more redtape.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to congratulate my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Chuck Grassley, for spearheading the congressional-\ncoverage effort here in the Senate. Without his hard work and \ncommitment, S. 2 would not be the priority that it is today. I also \nwant to take a moment to recognize my colleagues, Senators Nickles, \nLieberman, and Thompson, for their important contributions as well.\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are now going to final passage. That will \nbe the last vote today.\n  Then tomorrow, we will start on unfunded mandates, debate only, at 10 \no'clock. We worked out a problem with the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the Democratic leader, I guess based on--because the \nreport was not filed.\n  We are trying to get an agreement, I might say to my colleagues, many \nof whom want to leave here early Friday or even tomorrow evening. If we \ncan get an agreement to lock up all these amendments, I am certainly \nwilling to accommodate my colleagues in these early days, as we did \ntoday, in fact. So help us put that together, because our staff on each \nside is working on it. Do not list every amendment you have ever \nthought of, because we would like to finish it by a date certain next \nweek, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n  So there will be no further votes tonight after this vote.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also want to commend my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, for his outstanding work and expeditious work on this bill, \nand also my colleague, Senator Glenn, for his efforts, and Senator \nLieberman. I know it has taken a long time, there have been a lot of \namendments, and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to \namendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 2) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will do some final work on this bill \nin the sense of some tributes, as well as adding a couple of \ncosponsors.\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Frist and Senator \nDomenici be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Administrative Conference is being \ndirected to study the application of the various laws to the General \nAccounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the Library of \nCongress as well as the regulations and procedures used by these \nagencies to endorse these laws. The study is to evaluate whether the \nrights, protections, and procedures applicable to these agencies and \ntheir employees under these laws are comprehensive and effective. The \nconference is to make recommendations for any improvements in \nregulations or legislation, including regulatory or legislative \nlanguage. I urge the conference to be particularly mindful of conflict \nof interest or other concerns that may arise from the coverage of \nLibrary of Congress employees under the existing Federal sector labor-\nmanagement statutory framework. The bill reflects similar concerns with \nrespect to various categories of congressional employees which may well \nbe equally applicable to Library of Congress employees.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Glenn. He has been here on the \nfloor of this body for 5 days representing the minority party.\n  I also want to thank the new Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, because on our side of the aisle he worked very closely with \nme as cochairman of the working group on this bill, which Senator Dole \nappointed for the Republicans so that this bill could be worked on in \nDecember and be ready for action on the first day of the session.\n  Also, I thank Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, who has worked very \nhard on this bill over the last 2 years and was my main cosponsor on \nthis bill; also, I thank him and his staff for contributing during the \ninterim of the two Congresses to get this bill put together. I also \nneed to mention this about Senator Glenn: He was active in this issue \nlong before most of us even came to the Congress.\n  I also thank Senator Stevens, because in the last several Congresses \nwhen I tried to get this legislation passed, he has wanted us to think \nthrough very clearly what direction we should go in. He has \nlegitimately raised some questions and concerns about this over several \nCongresses. And during this Congress, he was satisfied with the product \nwe put together, and he was also part of the group that worked out \ncompromises between Republicans and Democrats, as well as between the \nHouse and Senate. I thank Senator Stevens for his cooperation.\n  I thank Senator Roth, who was chairman of the committee this time \nthat would have had jurisdiction over this bill, because he did not \ndemand referral.\n  I thank Senators Nickles, Coats, Hutchison, Abraham, and Smith, \nbecause they were also members of the Republican task force.\n  Then regarding the staff people, I want to say thank you to Senator \nLieberman's staff, John Nakahata and Fred Richardson; Senator Stevens' \nstaff, Mark Mackie; Senator Roth's staff, Susanne Marshall; Dennis Shea \nof Senator Dole's staff; Larry Novak of Senator Glenn's staff; Michael \nDavidson, Senate legal counsel, and also of the legal counsel staff, \nClaire Sylvia. Then Gary Kline of my staff was involved in this. I want \nto pay special tribute to Fred Ansell of my staff, not only for the \ntime and work that went into several weeks of December that he worked \non this bill with other staff people, but also for his assuming a \ntremendous amount of responsibility in making sure that we had a \nproduct that was acceptable to the Senate. I think the best measure of \na product that is acceptable to the Senate is that there was no \namendment applicable to the underlying bill, except the technical \namendments that were in the managers bill. So I thank Mr. Ansell for \nhis fine, outstanding work in representing me and the group of \nstaffers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nof the distinguished Senator from Iowa in giving credit to those who \nworked long into the night and do so much work in putting something \nlike this together. It is not easy. They have to do a lot of work on \nthe amendments that were proposed over here, and they did a lot of work \nover the last couple of years in putting this whole package together.\n  It finally came together in a way, with the provisions in here, that \ntook care of some of the previous concerns about separation of powers \nbetween the branches of Government that literally has held up \nconsideration of this legislation since 1978, when I introduced \n [[Page S780]] legislation like this; way back in 1978, it has been \nheld up all this time.\n  Last year, as majority leader, Senator Mitchell indicated to me that \nhe wanted us to move this, if we possibly could, out of committee and \nthe best bill we had was the Grassley-Lieberman bill. We worked with \nthem on that and we put it in the form that was passed here this \nevening. I am proud to have worked with them on that and to be part of \nthe team that got it together.\n  But I want to particularly give them credit for it, as well as the \nother people who worked so hard on the staff through this.\n  On our staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Larry Novey, who \nis with me right here, has done yeoman's work on this. Len Weiss, who \nis our minority staff director, worked on this, but Larry, in \nparticular, really has dedicated himself to this and did a terrific job \non this. So I want to give him credit for working out a lot of the \ndetails on this and making it into what I think is a very important \npiece of legislation that says now for the first time we treat our \npeople here on Capitol Hill with the same fairness, the same rights, \nthat we have thought in the past were important enough to apply to all \nthe rest of the country.\n  And now we have some 36,000 employees here--I just received a rundown \non that a moment ago--36,000 employees total on Capitol Hill or in the \ninstrumentalities that work for the Senate here and the House of \nRepresentatives. Those people now have the same protections and same \nrights under the law, through a different appeals process that we \nworked out here.\n  But I just wanted to give credit to those who worked out all these \ndetails. I think it is a great step forward.\n  Thank you very much and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nthat have already been made here. And also on behalf of the majority \nleader and, I am sure, the membership on both sides of the aisle, I \nwish to congratulate them on the outstanding job that has been done on \nthis legislation.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa has certainly done an outstanding \njob. He has been patient. Amendments have not just been brushed off. \nThey have been considered. But all of them were put aside, at least for \nthe time being, so we could have a good, clean bill that does what \neverybody really wants it to do.\n  I think the evidence of the good job that has been done was the vote \nwe just saw, 98 to 1. I do think that it is important that this is the \nfirst bill of the year; that we have congressional accountability; that \nwe have these laws apply to ourselves. And I think that it is an \nimportant message to the American people that they will agree with.\n  So I just wanted take a moment to commend Senator Grassley; and \nSenator Glenn, who has done yeoman's work on this legislation over a \nlong period of time and did a lot of good work last year. He certainly \nworked very closely with Senator Grassley. Both of them did a great job \nand I think they should be commended for it.\n  So let us just go forward and do this again on the next bill and see \nif we cannot complete it in a little less time.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis kind remarks.\n  Reflecting upon the 98-to-1 vote, I can just simply say the feeling \nof this body has dramatically changed toward this legislation, because \nI remember the first time I introduced an amendment on this and got it \nthrough on a voice vote. There were just a few Members here at that \nparticular time. One Member was so mad at me after I got it passed that \nthe individual said to me, ``Grassley, I hope you are the first one \nsued.''\n  Well, we have to keep diligent to get things done. And I think that \none of the things that I have learned to do is to stick to your guns.\n  Basically, Prime Minister Disraeli, in the second half of the last \ncentury, had this to say as a way to determine success. ``Constancy of \npurpose is the secret of success,'' is what Disraeli said. I think that \nthat is a very good rule for anybody who wants to get anything done in \nthe congressional system that we have in this country. If you stick to \nit and if you are on the right track, you will eventually accomplish \nyour goal. I think that even Senator Glenn has a longer view toward \nthat end than I do, because, as I stated before, he was involved in \nthis before I ever got involved in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I also remember something Benjamin Disraeli \nsaid when a young member of Parliament walked up to him one evening--as \nyou know, better than I, the Parliament meets in the evening. He walked \nup to Benjamin Disraeli, his party leader, and he said, ``Mr. Prime \nMinister,''--there was a particular bill on the floor--he said, ``Mr. \nPrime Minister, such and such a bill is on the floor tonight. I wonder \nwhether you think I should speak tonight on this bill.'' And Disraeli \nlooked at the young member and said, ``Sir, I think it better that the \nHouse of Commons wonder why you did not speak than why you did.''\n  And occasionally I think we are going to find Disraeli's admonition, \nnot as it relates to this particular bill, I suspect we may find his \nadmonition may be well placed in terms of how we conduct ourselves the \nremainder of this session.\n  But I want to make it clear for the record, I am not referring to the \nSenator from Iowa or anyone in particular. But I just hope that on some \nof the legislative initiatives I have heard about, other than the one I \nhave seen tonight, that we follow Disraeli's advice: Sometimes it is \nbetter not to speak than to speak.\n  But I am going to break that admonition myself right now and I am \ngoing to ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed for 10 minutes \nas if morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S762-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S780-S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       PARTIAL LIFTING OF SANCTIONS AGAINST SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to urge the United \nStates to vote at the United Nations against renewing the partial \nlifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro in return for their \nalleged blockade against the Bosnian Serbs.\n  The 100-day probation period for blockade enforcement expires \ntomorrow, January 12, 1995. A positive action in the U.N. Security \nCouncil is necessary to renew the waiver. The language of the U.N. \nresolution granting the waiver stipulates the need for effectively \nimplementing the closure of the border between Serbia and Montenegro \nand the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I repeat, effectively \nimplementing--not trying in a half-hearted way or even trying with good \nintentions. Mr. President, the standard of effectively implementing \nsimply has not been met.\n  On November 18, 1994, I sent a detailed letter to Secretary of State \nChristopher in which I outlined my concerns on this issue. Yesterday--\nnearly 8 weeks later--I finally received an answer from Assistant \nSecretary of State Sherman. I hope that this inexcusable tardiness in \nresponding to my request and desire is not indicative of a desire on \nthe part of the State Department to keep this vital issue out of the \npublic eye.\n  Mr. President, the contents of Assistant Secretary Sherman's letter \nhave only increased my fear that the administration is allowing a new \noverall concept for Bosnia--with which I profoundly disagree--to \ndictate its interpretation of the facts on the ground.\n  What about the stipulated U.N. standard of effectively implementing \nthe border closure? Assistant Secretary Sherman writes:\n\n       On the whole, looking across the 100-day period, we believe \n     it legitimate to say that the border has been effectively \n     closed in the sense that it has become steadily less porous \n     as loopholes were identified and sealed.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is a remarkably creative definition of \n``effective implementing.''\n  I remember back in the early 1980's, we went from talking about tax \nincreases to revenue enhancements. This \n [[Page S781]] makes that euphemism sound ridiculous. It says \n``effectively implementing,'' and he writes, ``On the whole, looking \nacross the 100-day period, we believe,'' and the key point is ``that it \nhas become steadily less porous.'' I assume that means therefore it has \nbeen effectively implemented, in their view. The fact is that the \nborder is more than 300 miles long. It traverses some of the most \nrugged, mountainous country in Europe, and it would be difficult to \npolice even with a large force of monitors.\n  In actuality, however, Mr. President, fewer than 200 monitors have \nbeen deployed. Assistant Secretary Sherman admits the monitoring \nmission ``is still not staffed as fully as we would like.''\n  Most of the crossing points are not monitored 24 hours a day. \nControls on so-called ant trade--carried on by private vehicles that \nsmuggle in fuel for a Bosnian Serb war machine--are, quite frankly, \nlaughable.\n  Perhaps the most ridiculous piece of information is that along parts \nof the Montenegro-Bosnian border, the United Nations has been relying \non the Yugoslav Army, that is the Serbian Army troops, to monitor the \nso-called blockade. Now, call me cynical, Mr. President, but I am \nuncomfortable with involving Mr. Milosevic's troops in the honor \nsystem.\n  The ultimate proof of the ineffective closure of the border is that \nthe Bosnian Serb aggressors have had no difficulty in securing fuel \nwith which to continue their attacks, such as last month's offensive in \nthe Bihac area.\n  Even the price of fuel on the civilian market in Serbian-controlled \nparts of Bosnia has not risen appreciably, an indication that there are \nno serious shortages of fuel. It is still coming in.\n  Mr. President, the whole blockade charade has proven once again that \nMr. Milosevic is the shrewdest politician in the former Yugoslavia. \nThrough his blockade gambit he hopes to weaken the Bosnian Serb leader \nKaradzic, but not significantly to hamper the Bosnian Serb Army. Our \nBritish and French allies and the Russians, eager for peace in Bosnia \nat any time, want to throw Milosevic a bone of renewed sanctions \nrelief, perhaps even to lessen the sanctions further.\n  Worst of all, it now appears the United States is sliding toward the \nappeasement position of the British and the French. Assistant Secretary \nof State Holbrooke, speaking 2 days ago in Sarajevo, indicated that we \nhave retreated from holding the Bosnian Serbs at the ladder of the \ncontact group's peace plank. Now, apparently, we see the plan only as a \nbasis for negotiation. That is, we have prepared to allow the Bosnian \nSerbs to hold on to some of the fruits of their military aggression and \nthe vile ethnic cleansing they have been undertaking.\n  Mr. President, we should have none of this. The United States should \nvote against the extension of the U.S. sanctions waiver. Or, put \nanother way, we should keep the sanctions on, the economic sanctions. \nSuch a vote would not only be a moral statement but also a proper \nreaction to this nonexistent blockade that has provided cover for \nMilosevic and our European allies.\n  Mr. President, although I do not have any real expectation that the \nadministration is going to listen to me any more than they have \nlistened to me in the past on this, or to Senator Dole or to Senator \nLieberman or others, I do want the Record to show that there is no \nserious implementation of the blockade on the part of the Serbian \nGovernment; no cooperation from the Government of Serbia, Mr. \nMilosevic's government; no effective means to monitor whether it is \nunderway; and no proof based upon the availabilities of the commodities \nthat are supposedly being blocked, such as fuel for the war machine, \nthat suggests that it is working, it is being tried, it is being \nimplemented, it is effective.\n  Therefore, it seems to me, Mr. President, the only logical and \nconsistent vote we should cast in the United Nations Security Council \ntomorrow is one that eliminates the extension of the waiver and puts \nback in place the full economic blockade on Serbia.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their willingness to give me \nthis time. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S780-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I ask unanimous consent that a statement on S. 1, the \nUnfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, as reported, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  In order to expedite the business of the Senate, the committee did \nnot file a report. This statement provides the same information as \nrequired by a report and serves as the basis of the legislative history \nof the Senate Budget Committee's actions on the bill.\n   Statement of the Senate Committee on the Budget on S. 1--Unfunded \n                       Mandate Reform Act of 1995\n\n\n                               i. purpose\n\n       The primary purpose of S. 1--the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform \n     Act of 1995''--is to start the process of redefining the \n     relationship between the Federal government and State, local \n     and tribal governments. In addition, the bill would require \n     an assessment of the impact of legislative and regulatory \n     proposals on the private sector.\n       The bill accomplishes this purpose by ensuring that the \n     impact of legislative and regulatory proposals on those \n     governments and the private sector are given full \n     consideration in Congress and the Executive Branch before \n     they are acted upon.\n       More specifically, S. 1 achieves these objectives through \n     the following major provisions: A majority point of order in \n     the Senate against consideration of legislation that \n     establishes a Federal mandate on State, local and tribal \n     governments unless the legislation provides funding to offset \n     the costs of the mandate; a majority point of order in the \n     Senate against consideration of any reported legislation \n     unless the report includes a Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) estimate of the cost of Federal mandates to State, \n     local and tribal governments as well as to the private \n     sector; a requirement that Federal agencies establish a \n     process to allow State, local and tribal governments greater \n     input into the regulatory process; and, a requirement that \n     agencies analyze the impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments and the private sector of major regulations that \n     include federal mandates.\n\n\n                             ii. background\n\n       The controversies that arise between the respective powers \n     of the Federal government and the States date back to the \n     country's origins. Concern about the cost and extent of \n     Federal mandates on State, local governments, and indian \n     tribes as well as the private sector first reached its peak \n     in the late 1970s.\n       With respect to State and local mandates, the Senate Budget \n     Committee acted in 1980 and again in 1981, culminating in the \n     enactment of the State and Local Government Cost Estimate Act \n     of 1981. This law required the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) to prepare\n      State and local cost estimates, but did not provide for any \n     legislative enforcement procedures.\n       Since the enactment of the State and Local Government Cost \n     Estimate Act, CBO has had 12 years of experience in preparing \n     State and local cost estimates. During this period, CBO has \n     examined 6,920 pieces of legislation for the impact of \n     Federal mandates. Twelve percent, or roughly 800 bills, \n     contained some impact on State and local governments. A year-\n     by-year summary of the number of estimates prepared by CBO is \n     displayed in the following table.\n       Although these past legislative efforts were designed to \n     monitor and, presumably, to curtail the growth of Federal \n     mandates, Federal mandates have grown while Federal resources \n     to cover the costs of these mandates have shrunk.\n       While it is difficult to produce precise estimates of the \n     costs of mandates, there is little doubt that these costs \n     have grown and represent a sizeable proportion of the \n     economy. One of the purposes of S. 1 is to, in fact, create a \n     mechanism for better and more current accounting of these \n     costs. One study prepared for the GSA Regulatory Information \n     Service Center in 1992 found the cost of Federal mandates to \n     State and local governments and the private sector was \n     estimated to amount to $581 billion, or roughly 10 percent of \n     GDP. According to the Vice President's report, The National \n     Performance Review, the private sector alone spends $430 \n     billion each year to comply with Federal regulations.\n       During a joint hearing with the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on January 5, 1995, the Budget Committee these \n     concerns from State and local officials regarding the cost of \n     the mandates and the damaging impact of these mandates to our \n     system of government. According to the National League of \n     Cities, over the past two decades, the Congress has enacted \n     185 new laws imposing mandates on state and local \n     governments.\n       In that hearing, the Mayor of Philadelphia, Edward Rendell, \n     on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, testified that \n     314 cities will spend an estimated $54 billion over the next \n     five years to comply with only 10 of these Federal mandates. \n     His testimony included the following remarks on how Federal \n     mandates severely diminish local government's ability to \n     establish priorities.\n       ``The problem with unfunded Federal mandates is that the \n     Federal government has turned State and local officials into \n     Federal tax collectors. We collect the taxes to implement \n     Federal priorities and as a result we are not able to \n     establish and fund local priorities.''\n       ``In my city when I became mayor, we had 19 tax increases \n     in the 11 years prior to my becoming mayor, and we still had \n     a quarter of a billion dollar budget deficit, and we had \n     driven 30 percent of our tax base out of the city.''\n       ``So as a practical matter, I could not raise taxes to meet \n     the new demands and mandates.''\n\n                                         STATE AND LOCAL COST ESTIMATES PREPARED BY CBO: 12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE                                         \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   Total   Average \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal estimates prepared.........................    573    641    533    590    531    686    470    720    551    614    507    504   6,920        577\nEstimates with no impacts........................    496    584    488    543    448    598    404    593    494    522    448    443   6,061        505\n    (Percent of Total)...........................     87     91     92     92     84     87     86     82     90     85     88     88      88         88\nEsimates with some impacts.......................     77     57     45     47     83     88     66    127     57     92     48     51     838         70\n    (Percent of Total)...........................     13      9      8      8     16     13     14     18     10     15      9     10      12         12\nEstimates with impacts above $200 million........     24      6     14      8     22     15      7     20      4     14      9      6     149         12\n    (Percent of Total)...........................      4      1      3      1      4      2      1      3      1      2      2      1       2          2\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office: Bill Estimates Tracking System.                                                                                    \n\n       The Governor of Ohio, George V. Voinovich, made a similar \n     point and concluded, ``* * * the Federal government is \n     bankrupt. And the Congress is on its way to bankupting state \n     and local governments.''\n       Governor Voinovich also spoke to the lack of accountability \n     on the part of Federal officials when mandates are enacted \n     and regulations are promulgated to impose mandates on States \n     and local governments. He cited an example of a Federal \n     requirement that states uses scrap tires to pave their roads \n     with rubberized asphalt that will increase the cost of the \n     State of Ohio's highway program by $50 million, money that \n     could be spent to replace 700 miles of roads or rehabilitate \n     137 aging bridges. His testimony raised questions about the \n     durability of rubberized asphalt and expressed grave concerns \n     about its potentially harmful environmental effects.\n\n\n                        iii. legislative history\n\n       Senator Kempthorne introduced S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate \n     Reform Act of 1995, on January 4, 1995.\n       S.1 is based on similar legislation the Senate Government \n     Affairs committee reported last Congress. Senator Kempthorne \n     introduced s. 993 on May 30, 1993 and this legislation was \n     reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee on August 10, \n     1994. The Senate considered S. 993 on October 6, 1994, but no \n     final action was taken on the bill during the 103d Congress.\n       S. 993 as reported by the Governmental Committee proposed a \n     number of changes in matters that are within the jurisdiction \n     of the Senate Budget Committee. Pursuant to section 306 of \n     the Budget Act, any legislation that affects any matter \n     within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee is subject to \n     a point of order unless it is reported by the Budget \n     Committee. This point of order can only be waived by an \n     affirmative vote of 60 Senators.\n       On November 29, 1994, Senators Domenici and Exon wrote \n     Senators Roth and Glenn regarding the consideration of \n     unfunded mandates legislation and the Budget Committee's \n     jurisdiction over this legislation.\n       During December, the Budget Committee worked with the \n     Government Affairs Committee and Senator Kempthorne to \n     develop the legislation that was introduced at S. 1. The \n     Senate Budget Committee worked to make the following three \n     modifications to S. 993, which are now reflected in S. 1: (1) \n     strengthened the point of order in the bill so that it would \n     apply to all legislation (bill, joint resolution, amendment, \n     motion or conference reports) and not just reported bills; \n     (2) reduced the costs to the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) for its new duties required by the bill by 50 percent \n     (from $8-10 million down to $4.5 million); and, (3) \n     strengthened the bill by incorporating this new mandate \n     control process into the Congressional Budget Act and the \n     Congressional Budget process.\n       [[Page S784]] On January 5, the Budget Committee held a \n     joint hearing with the Governmental Affairs Committee. On \n     January 9, the Governmental Affairs Committee voted 9-4 to \n     report the bill, S. 1, with three amendments. On the same \n     day, after the Governmental Affairs action, the Budget \n     Committee also voted by a vote of 21-0 to report S. 1 with \n     four amendments.\n\n\n                    iv. section-by-section analysis\n\n                         Section 1. Short title\n\n       This section identifies the short title as the ``Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995.''\n\n                          Section 2. Purposes\n\n       This section establishes the purposes of the Act.\n\n                         Section 3, Definitions\n\n       This section amends the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 by Adding Several new \n     definitions. These definitions are applicable to the entire \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. However, one of the Committee \n     amendments restricts their application within the Budget Act \n     to the new Budget Act enforcement mechanisms established in \n     Title I of this Act.\n       The term ``Federal mandate'' is defined as either a \n     ``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' or a ``Federal private \n     sector mandate''.\n       The term ``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' is defined \n     to mean any legislation, statute, or regulation that imposes \n     a legally binding duty on State, local, or tribal \n     governments, unless the duty is a condition of Federal \n     assistance or is a condition or requirement for participation \n     in a voluntary discretionary aid program.\n       The term ``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' is further \n     defined to include any legislation, statute, or regulation \n     that would reduce or eliminate the authorization of \n     appropriation for Federal financial assistance to State, \n     local, or tribal governments for purposes of complying with \n     an existing duty, unless the legislation, statute, or \n     regulation reduces or eliminates the duty accordingly. In the \n     circumstances where the Federal government has imposed legal \n     duties on State, local, and tribal governments and has \n     provided financial assistance to those entitles to comply \n     with those duties, the Committee believes that the Federal \n     government ought to be held accountable when the Federal \n     government subsequently reduces or eliminates the Federal \n     assistance to those governments while continuing to require \n     compliance\n      with the existing duties. This definition, together with the \n     enforcement mechanism established in section 101, will \n     provide this accountability.\n       The term ``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' is lastly \n     defined to include any legislation, statute, or regulation \n     concerning Federal entitlement programs that provide $500 \n     million or more annually to State, local, or tribal \n     governments, if it would either increase the conditions of \n     assistance or would cap or decrease the Federal \n     responsibility to provide funding, and the governments have \n     no authority to amend their responsibility to provide the \n     services affected. This subparagraph relates to nine large \n     Federal entitlement programs, the spending projections for \n     which are shown in the following CBO table:\n\n      ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT CONTAIN INTERGOVERNMENTAL MANDATES      \n                    [Outlays in billions of dollars]                    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPayments to States for AFDC work                                        \n programs.......................     0.9     1.0     1.0     1.0     1.0\nSocial services block grant                                             \n (Title XX).....................     3.1     3.1     3.0     2.9     2.8\nPayments to States for foster                                           \n care and adoption assistance...     3.9     4.3     4.7     5.0     5.5\nRehabilitation services and                                             \n disability research............     2.4     2.5     2.6     2.6     2.7\nMedicaid........................   100.1   111.0   123.1   136.0   149.5\nFood Stamp Program..............    26.0    27.4    28.8    30.3    31.1\nState child nutrition programs..     8.1     8.6     9.2     9.9    10.5\nFamily support payments to                                              \n States\\1\\......................    17.5    17.9    18.3    18.8    19.4\n                                 ---------------------------------------\n      Total.....................   162.0   175.6   190.6   206.5   222.5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Includes AFDC and child support enforcement.                         \n                                                                        \nSource: CBO January 1995 Baseline.                                      \n\n       Any legislation or regulation would be considered a Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate if it: a) increases the stringency \n     of State, local or tribal government participation in any one \n     of these nine programs, or b) caps or decreases the Federal \n     government's responsibility to provide funds to State, local \n     or tribal governments to implement the program, including a \n     shifting of costs from the Federal government to those \n     governments. The legislation or regulation would not be \n     considered a Federal intergovernmental mandate if it allows \n     those governments the flexibility to amend their specific \n     programmatic or financial responsibilities within the program \n     while still remaining eligible to participate in that \n     program. In addition to the nine previously-mentioned \n     programs, also included are any new Federal-State-local \n     entitlement programs (above the $500 million threshold) that \n     may be created after the enactment of this Act.\n       The Committee has included this provision in the \n     legislation because of its concern over past and possible \n     future shifting of the costs of entitlement programs by the \n     Federal government on to State governments.\n       ``Federal private sector mandate'' is defined to include \n     any legislation, statute, or regulation that imposes a \n     legally binding duty on the private sector.\n       ``Direct costs'' is defined to mean aggregate estimated \n     amounts that State, local and tribal governments and the \n     private sector will have to spend in order to comply with a \n     Federal mandate. Direct costs of Federal mandates are net \n     costs; they are the sum of estimated costs and estimated \n     savings associated with legislation. Further, direct costs do \n     not include costs that State, local and tribal governments \n     and the private sector currently incur or will incur to \n     implement the requirements of existing Federal law or \n     regulation. In addition, the direct costs of a Federal \n     mandate must not include costs being borne by those \n     governments and the private sector as the result of carrying \n     out a State or local government mandate.\n       The Governmental Affairs Committee has proposed an \n     amendment change in the definition of ``Private sector''. The \n     revised definition covers all persons or entities in the \n     United States except for State, local or tribal governments. \n     It includes individuals, partnerships, associations, \n     corporations, and educational and nonprofit institutions.\n       The Committee is troubled by the exemption of independent \n     regulatory agencies from the definition of a Federal \n     ``agency''. An amendment by Senator Domenici to delete this \n     exemption was withdrawn because of Senator Simon's request \n     that the Committee and the Senate have an opportunity to \n     study this exemption further. Many of these independent \n     regulatory agencies are a major source of costly unfunded \n     mandates, particularly on the private sector. The Committee \n     notes section 4 of the bill provides a number of exclusions \n     and believes this exemption needs to be, at a minimum, \n     significantly narrowed.\n       The definition of ``small government'' is made consistent \n     with existing Federal law which classifies a government as \n     small if its population is less than 50,000. ``Tribal \n     government'' is defined according to existing law.\n                         Section 4. Exclusions\n\n       This section provides a number of exclusions from this Act.\n       Among these exclusions, the bill contains an exclusion for \n     legislation that ``establishes or enforces any statutory \n     rights that prohibit discrimination.'' The Committee believes \n     this language to mean provisions in bills and joint \n     resolutions that prohibit or are designed to prevent \n     discrimination from occurring through civil or criminal \n     sanctions or prohibitions.\n       In order to maintain the discipline of S.1 to control new \n     unfunded mandates, the Committee believes that the exclusions \n     must be interpreted so that the mandate in legislation \n     completely fits within the confines of an exclusion.\n\n                      Section 5. Agency Assistance\n\n       Under this section, the Committee intends for Federal \n     agencies to provide information, technical assistance, and \n     other assistance to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as \n     CBO might need and reasonably request that might be helpful \n     in preparing the legislative cost estimates as required by \n     Title I. Through the implementation of various Presidential \n     Executive Orders over the last decade, agencies have \n     developed a wealth of expertise and data on the cost of \n     legislation and regulation on State, local and tribal \n     government and the private sector. CBO should be able tap \n     into that expertise in a useful and timely manner. Other \n     Congressional support agencies may also have developed \n     information on cost estimates and the estimating process \n     which might be helpful to CBO in performing its duties. CBO \n     should not attempt to duplicate analytical work already being \n     done by the other support agencies, but rather use as needed \n     that information.\n\n             Title I--Legislative Accountability and Reform\n\n       Section 101. Legislative mandate accountability and reform\n\n       This section amends title IV of the Congressional Budget \n     and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 by creating a new section \n     408 on Legislative Mandate Accountability and Reform. \n     Subsection (a) establishes procedures and requirements for \n     Committee reports accompanying legislation that imposes a \n     Federal mandate. It requires a committee, when it orders \n     reported legislation containing Federal mandates, to provide \n     the reported bill to CBO promptly. The Committee is concerned \n     that this bill imposes significant new responsibilities on \n     CBO to provide a variety of estimates for legislation. \n     Therefore, the Committee would urge the relevant authorizing \n     committees to work closely with CBO during the committee \n     process to ensure that legislation containing federal \n     mandates, as well as possible related amendments to be \n     offered in markup, be provided to CBO in a timely fashion so \n     as not to impede the legislative process.\n       The committee report shall include: an identification and \n     description of Federal mandates\n     in the bill, including an estimate of their expected direct \n     costs to State, local and tribal governments and the private \n     sector, and a qualitative assessment of the costs and \n     benefits of the Federal mandates, including their anticipated \n     costs and benefits to human health and safety and protection \n       of the natural environment.If a mandate affects both the \n     public and the private sectors, and it is intended that \n      [[Page S785]] the Federal Government pay the public sector \n     costs, the report should also state what effect, if any, this \n     would have on any competitive balance between government and \n     privately-owned businesses. One of the Committee's amendments \n     expanded this requirement to include an assessment of the \n     impact of any mandate on the competitive balance between \n     states, local governments, and tribal governments and \n     privately-owned businesses if that mandate is contingent on \n     funding being provided in appropriations Acts.\n       Some federal mandates will affect both the public and \n     private sectors in similar and, in some cases, nearly \n     identical ways. For example, the costs of compliance with \n     minimum wage laws or environmental standards for landfill \n     operations or municipal waste incineration are incurred by \n     both sectors. There has been some concern expressed that the \n     Federal subsidization of the public sector in these cases \n     could create a competitive advantage for activities owned by \n     State, local or tribal governments in those areas where they \n     compete with the private sector. If future mandate \n     legislation causes this to be the case, S. 1 provides that \n     Congress will be aware of this impact and the effect on the \n     continuing ability of private enterprises to remain viable. \n     The authorizing committees are required to provide an \n     assessment in their reports in order for Congress to \n     carefully consider and decide whether the granting of a \n     competitive advantage to the public sector is fair and \n     appropriate.\n       For Federal intergovernmental mandates, Committee reports \n     must also contain a statement of the amount, if any, of the \n     increased authorization of appropriations for Federal \n     financial assistance to fund the costs of the \n     intergovernmental mandates.\n       This section also requires the authorizing Committee to \n     state in the report whether it intends the Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate to be funded or not. There may be \n     occasions when a Committee decides that it is entirely \n     appropriate that State, local or tribal governments should \n     bear the cost of a mandate without receiving Federal aid. If \n     so, the Committee report should state this and give an \n     explanation for it. Likewise, the Committee report must state \n     the extent to which the report legislation preempts State, \n     local or tribal law, and, if so, explain the reasons why. To \n     the maximum extent possible, this intention to preempt should \n     also be clear in the statutory language.\n       Also set out in this section are procedures to ensure that \n     the Committee publishes the CBO cost estimate, either in the \n     Committee report or in the Congressional Record prior to \n     floor consideration of the legislation.\n       Duties of the Director:\n       Section 408(b) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act, as added by section 101, requires the Director \n     of CBO to analyze and prepare a statement on all bills \n     reported by committees of the Senate or House of \n     Representatives other than the appropriations committees. \n     This subsection stipulates, first, that the Director of CBO \n     must estimate whether all direct costs of Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates in the bill will equal or exceed a \n     threshold of $50,000,000 annually. If the Director estimates \n     that the direct costs will be below this threshold, the \n     Director must state this fact in his statement on the bill, \n     and must briefly explain the estimate. Although this \n     provision requires only a determination by CBO that the \n     threshold will not be equalled or exceeded, if, in cases \n     below the threshold, the Director actually estimates the \n     amount of direct costs, this section is not intended to \n     preclude the Director from including the estimate in his \n     explanatory statement. If the Director estimates that the \n     direct costs will equal or exceed the threshold, the Director \n     must so state and provide an explanation, and must also \n     prepare the required estimates.\n       In estimating whether the threshold will be exceeded, the \n     Director must consider direct costs in the year when the \n     Federal intergovernmental mandate will first be effective, \n     plus each of the succeeding four fiscal years. In some cases, \n     the new duties or conditions that constitute the mandate will \n     not become effective against State, local and tribal \n     governments when the statute becomes effective, but will \n     become effective when the implementing regulations become \n     effective. The Committee notes that current Federal \n     comprehensive budget projects are made for five years and is \n     aware that estimates that reach beyond this five year window \n     are more difficult to make with precision. The Committee is \n     concerned about and recognizes the difficulty of making out-\n     year estimates, particularly beyond the five-year window. The \n     Committee notes that the new enforcement procedures are based \n     on thresholds being exceeded. However, if a range of \n     estimates is made and that range estimate is less than to \n     greater than the threshold, the Committee believes the \n     enforcement procedures would apply.\n       The $50,000,000 threshold in this legislation for Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates is significantly lower than the \n     threshold of $200,000,000 in the State and Local Cost \n     Estimate Act of 1981 (2 U.S.C. 403(c)). The threshold in the \n     1981 Act also included a test of whether the proposed \n     legislation is likely to have an exceptional fiscal \n     consequence for a geographic region or a level of government. \n     The bill provides that at the request of any Chairman or \n     Ranking Minority Member of a committee, CBO must conduct a \n     study on the disproportionate effects of mandates on specific \n     geographic regions or industries.\n       If the Director determines that the direct costs of the \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates will equal or exceed the \n     threshold, he must make the required additional estimates and \n     place them in the statement.\n       The Director of CBO must also estimate whether all direct \n     costs of Federal private sector mandates in the bill will \n     equal or exceed a threshold of $200,000,000 annually. In \n     making this estimate, the Director must consider direct costs \n     in the year when the Federal private sector mandate will \n     first be effective, plus each of the succeeding four fiscal \n     years. In some cases, the\n      new duties or conditions that constitute the mandate will \n     not become effective for the private sector when the \n     statute becomes effective, but will become effective when \n     the implementing regulations become effective.\n       Similar to State and local estimates, the Committee is \n     concerned about and recognizes the difficulty of making out-\n     year estimates, particularly beyond the five-year window. CBO \n     has 12 years of experience of including estimates of the \n     impact on State and local governments in its cost estimates \n     for legislation. While CBO has conducted studies assessing \n     the impact of mandates on the private sector, CBO has little \n     experience with providing point estimates on private sector \n     impacts as the part of its cost estimates to committees on \n     legislation.\n       The Committee is aware that the most costly aspect of this \n     legislation is the requirement on CBO to produce estimates on \n     the impact to the private sector and is concerned about the \n     cost of these new requirements. Even so, private sector \n     mandates have an enormous impact on the economy and is \n     critical that Congress understand these impacts as it \n     considers legislation affecting the private sector.\n       If the Director estimates that the direct costs will equal \n     or exceed the threshold, the Director must so state and \n     provide an explanation. If the Director determines that it is \n     not feasible for him to make a reasonable estimate that would \n     be required with respect to Federal private sector mandates, \n     the Director shall not make the estimate, but shall report in \n     the statement that an estimate cannot be reasonably made.\n       If the Director estimates that the direct costs of a \n     Federal private sector mandate will be below the specified \n     threshold, the Director must state this fact in his statement \n     on the bill, and must briefly explain the estimate. Although \n     this provision requires only a determination by CBO that the \n     threshold will not be equalled or exceeded, if, in cases \n     below the threshold, the Director actually estimates the \n     amount of direct costs, this section is not intended to \n     preclude the Director from including the estimate in his \n     explanatory statement.\n       Point of order in the Senate:\n       This section provides two new Budget Act points of order in \n     the Senate. The first makes it out of order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill or joint resolution reported by a committee \n     that contains a Federal mandate unless a CBO statement of the \n     mandate's direct costs has been printed in the Committee \n     report or the Congressional Record prior to consideration. \n     The second point of order would lie against any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     increased the costs of a Federal intergovernmental mandate by \n     more than the $50,000,000, unless the legislation fully \n     funded the mandate in one of three ways:\n       1. an increase in direct spending with a resulting increase \n     in the Federal budget deficit (unless the new direct spending \n     was offset by direct spending reductions in other programs);\n       2. an increase in direct spending with an offsetting \n     increase in tax receipts, or\n       3. an authorization of appropriations and a limitation on \n     the enforcement of the mandate to the extent of such amounts \n     provided in Appropriations acts.\n       The Committee notes that ``direct spending'' is a defined \n     term in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act. The Committee also intends that in order to avoid the \n     point of order under this section, any direct spending \n     authority or authorization of appropriations must offset the \n     direct costs to states, local governments, and indian tribes \n     from the Federal mandate.\n       If the third alternative is used (authorization of \n     appropriations), a number of criteria must be met in order to \n     avoid the point of order. First, any appropriation bill that \n     is expected to provide funding must be identified, Second, \n     the mandate legislation must also designate a responsible \n     Federal agency that shall either: implement an appropriately \n     less costly mandate if less than full funding is ultimately \n     appropriated (pursuant to criteria and procedures also \n     provided in the mandate legislation), or declare such mandate \n     to be ineffective. To avoid the point of order, the \n     authorizing committee must provide in the authorization \n     legislation for one of two options:\n       1. The agency will void the mandate if the appropriations \n     committees at any point in the future provides insufficient \n     funding to states, local governments, and tribal governments \n     to offset the direct cost of the mandate.\n       2. The agency can provide a ``less money, less mandate'' \n     alternative, but this alternative requires the authorizing \n     legislation to specify clearly how the agency shall implement \n     that alternative.\n       When an intergovernmental mandate is either declared \n     ineffective or scaled back because of lack of funding, these \n     changes in the mandate will be effectuated consistent with \n      [[Page S786]] the requirements of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act. This will ensure that all affected parties \n     including the private sector, state, local and tribal \n     governments and the intended beneficiaries of the mandate \n     will have adequate opportunity to address their concerns.\n       The bill provides that matters within the jurisdiction of \n     the Appropriations Committee are not subject to a point of \n     order under this section. However, this is not a blanket \n     exemption for an appropriations bill. If an appropriations \n     bill or joint resolution (or an amendment, motion, or \n     conference report thereto) included legislation imposing a \n     mandate on states, local governments, or tribal governments, \n     such legislation would not be in the Appropriations \n     Committee's jurisdiction. Therefore, these provisions would \n     be subject to the point of order under this section.\n       One of the Committee amendments struck two provisions in \n     the bill regarding determinations and the point of order. The \n     first provision gives the Senate Governmental Affairs the \n     sole authority to determine what constitutes a mandate. The \n     second struck a provision in the\n      bill that is identical to other provisions in the Budget Act \n     providing that the determinations of the levels of \n     mandates would be based on estimates made by the Senate \n     Budget Committee.\n       The language the Committee struck regarding the Budget \n     Committee's role in making determinations on budgetary levels \n     is identical or similar to language in sections 201(g), \n     310(d)(4), 311(c), and 313(e) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act, sections 258B(h)(4) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act, and sections 23(e) and 24(d) of the \n     Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 1995.\n       The Senate, the Senate Parliamentarian's office and the \n     Budget Committees have 20 years of experience with these \n     Budget Act points of order and the Budget Committee's role in \n     making determinations of levels for the purposes of enforcing \n     these points of order. In practice, the Senate Budget \n     Committee's staff monitors legislation, works with the \n     Parliamentarian's office to determine violations, and works \n     with CBO to provide the Parliamentarian's office with \n     estimates to determine whether legislation would violate the \n     Budget Act.\n       S. 1 would establish an identical process for state and \n     local estimates. CBO would produce costs estimates on \n     legislation. To the extent legislation, such as an amendment, \n     did not have a cost estimate, Budget Committee staff would \n     seek such an estimate from CBO, in order to determine whether \n     the bill violated S. 1's point of order.\n       While there is 20 years of history and experience with the \n     Budget Committee's role in determining levels for the \n     purposes of enforcement of Budget Act point of order, there \n     appears to be a precedent, as envisioned in S. 1 as \n     introduced, to provide the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee the authority to make ``final determinations'' on \n     what constitutes a mandate. This provision also raises a \n     possibility where the two committees would have conflicting \n     opinions on the application of this new point of order and \n     needlessly complicates the enforcement of S. 1.\n       Viewing the questions and problems this language creates \n     and the fact that the Budget Committee relies on CBO \n     estimates for the purposes of making these determinations, \n     the Committee amendment struck the language regarding Budget \n     Committees and Governmental Affairs Committees \n     determinations. The Committee does not believe that this \n     authority needs to be explicitly stated in section 408. In \n     the absence of a CBO estimate, the Committee intends that the \n     determinations of levels of mandates be based on estimates \n     provided by the Senate Budget Committee.\n       At the request of the House of Representatives, the \n     Committee amendment retains these provisions for the House.\n\n        Section 102. Enforcement in the House of Representatives\n\n       This section specifies the procedures to be followed in the \n     House of Representatives in enforcing the provisions of this \n     Act.\n           Section 103. Assistance to committees and studies\n\n       This section adds among CBO existing duties under the \n     Budget Act a requirement that the Director of CBO, to the \n     extent practicable, to consult with and assist committees of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives, at their \n     request, in analyzing proposed legislation that may have a \n     significant budgetary impact on State, local or tribal \n     governments or a significant financial impact on the private \n     sector. It provides for the assistance that committees will \n     need from CBO to fulfill their obligations under the \n     provisions of S. 1.\n       This section also states that CBO should set up a process \n     to allow meaningful input from these knowledgeable, affected, \n     and concerned about the Federal mandates in question. Once \n     possible way to establish this process is through the \n     formation of advisory panels composed of relevant outside \n     experts. The Committee leaves it to the discretion of the \n     Director as to when and where it is appropriate to form an \n     advisory panel.\n       This section encourages authorizing committees to take a \n     prospective look at the impact of Federal intergovernmental \n     and private sector mandates before considering new \n     legislation by requiring committees to submit information on \n     mandate legislation as part of their views and estimates to \n     the Budget Committees.\n       The Committee is concerned about the potential workload \n     that such studies could impose on CBO and how this might \n     affect CBO's other responsibilities under the Act and intends \n     that CBO consult with the Committee on the nature, the \n     extent, and the cost of conducting these studies.\n\n              Section 104. Authorization of appropriations\n\n       This paragraph authorizes appropriations for CBO of \n     $4,500,000 per year for FY 1996 through 2002. The Committee \n     recognizes that additional resources and personnel are needed \n     for CBO to fully perform its duties under this Act along with \n     continuing to carry out its current responsibilities. The \n     Committee understands that the current policy and practice at \n     CBO is to rely on in-house personnel to conduct studies and \n     cost estimates, rather than contracting these duties to \n     outside entities. The Committee supports this policy and \n     urges the Appropriations Committee, in funding this \n     authorization, to increase CBO's authority to hire additional \n     personnel in order to fulfill its new duties under this Act.\n       The Committee is particularly concerned that if the \n     Appropriations Committee does not provide sufficient funding \n     for these new duties CBO's existing responsibilities under \n     Title II of the Budget Act should not be impeded.\n\n               Section 105. Exercise of rulemaking powers\n       The Constitution already reserves the rulemaking powers of \n     each House. This section provides that the terms of title I \n     are enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives, and that either \n     house may change such rules at any time.\n\n  Section 106. Repeal of the State and Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981\n\n       This paragraph rescinds the provisions of the State and \n     Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981.\n\n                      Section 107. Effective date\n\n       Title I will take effect on January 1, 1996. One of the \n     Committee amendments provided that this title would apply \n     only to legislation considered on or after that date. This is \n     to give Congress time to enact additional appropriations for \n     CBO and to give CBO and the Budget Committees the necessary \n     time to prepare for implementing the new requirements of this \n     Act.\n       The Committee notes that there has been some confusion \n     surrounding the question of retroactivity in S.1. This \n     section makes clear that Title I only applies to new \n     legislation considered after January 1, 1996. Laws enacted \n     prior to that date are not subject to Title I of this Act. \n     The Committee intends that when Congress considers \n     legislation reauthorizing existing laws that this Title apply \n     to how this reauthorization legislation would change existing \n     mandates or add new mandates.\n\n             Title II--Regulatory Accountability and Reform\n\n                    Section 201. Regulatory Process\n\n       This section requires agencies to assess the effects of \n     their regulations on State, local and tribal governments, and \n     the private sector. This section specifically requires \n     agencies to notify, consult, and educate State, local \n     governments, and tribal governments before establishing \n     regulations that significantly affect these entities.\n\n  Section 202. Statements to accompany significant regulatory actions\n\n       This section sets out requirements for Agencies prior to \n     issuing final regulations. Before promulgating any final \n     regulation with a cost of more than $100 million annually to \n     State, local, tribal governments, and the private sector.\n\n       Section 203. Assistance to the Congressional Budget Office\n       This section requires the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget to collect the written statements \n     prepared by agencies under Section 202 and submit them on a \n     timely basis to CBO. OMB and CBO already work closely \n     regarding the Federal budget. This section will assist the \n     CBO in performing its duties under Title I.\n\n       Section 204. Pilot program on small government flexibility\n\n       This section requires OMB to establish pilot programs in at \n     least two agencies on regulatory flexibility.\n\n                       Title III--Baseline Study\n\n           Section 301. Baseline study of costs and benefits\n\n       This section establishes a Commission on Unfunded Federal \n     Mandates.\n\n   Section 302. Report on unfunded Federal mandates by the Commission\n\n       This section requires the Commission to issue a preliminary \n     report within 9 months of enactment and a final report within \n     3 months thereafter.\n\n                        Section 303. Membership\n\n       This section provides that the Commission shall be composed \n     of 9 members and establishes the requirements for their \n     appointment.\n\n Section 304. Director and staff of commission; experts and consultants\n\n       This section provides for the appointment of the staff and \n     Director of the Commission.\n            [[Page S787]] Section 305. Powers of commission\n\n       This section provides the Commission with the authority to \n     hold hearings, obtain official data, use the U.S. mails, \n     acquire administrative support services from the General \n     Services Administration, and contract, subject to the \n     appropriations, for property and services.\n\n                        Section 306. Termination\n\n       This section provides that the Commission shall terminate \n     90 days after submitting its final report.\n\n              Section 307. Authorization of appropriations\n\n       This section authorizes the appropriations to Commission of \n     $1 million.\n\n                        Section 308. Definition\n       This section defines the term ``unfunded Federal mandate'', \n     as used in title III.\n\n                      Section 309. Effective Date\n\n       This section provides that Title III takes effect 60 days \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n                       Title IV--Judicial Review\n\n                      Section 401. Judicial review\n\n       This section provides that nothing under the Act shall be \n     subject to judicial review.\n\n\n                     v. regulatory impact statement\n\n       Paragraph 11(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate requires Committee reports to evaluate the \n     legislation's regulatory, paperwork, and privacy impact on \n     individuals, businesses, and consumers.\n       S. 1 addresses Federal government process, not output. It \n     will directly affect and change both the legislative and \n     regulatory process. It will not have a direct regulatory \n     impact on individuals, consumers, and businesses as these \n     groups are not covered by the bill's requirements.\n       However, the implementation of S. 1 will likely have an \n     indirect regulatory impact on these groups since a primary \n     focus of the bill is to ensure that Congress assess the cost \n     impact of new legislation on the private sector before \n     acting. In so much as information on private sector costs of \n     any particular bill or resolution may influence its outcome \n     during the Congressional debate, it is possible that this \n     bill may ease the regulatory impact on the private sector--\n     both on individual pieces of legislation as well as overall. \n     However, it is impossible at this time to determine with any \n     specificity what that level of regulatory relief may be.\n       S. 1 does address the Federal regulatory process in three \n     ways:\n       (1) It requires agencies to estimate the costs to State, \n     local and tribal governments of complying with major \n     regulations that include Federal intergovernmental mandates; \n     (2) It compels agencies to set up a process to permit State, \n     local and tribal officials to provide input into the \n     development of significant regulatory proposals; and (3) It \n     requires agencies to establish plans for outreach to small \n     governments.\n       However, with the exception of the third provision, the \n     bill will not impose new requirements for agencies to \n     implement in the regulatory process that are not already \n     required under Executive Orders 12866 and 12875. The bill \n     merely codifies the major provisions of the E.O.s that \n     pertain to smaller governments.\n       The legislation will have no impact on the privacy of \n     individuals. Nor will it add additional paperwork burdens to \n     businesses, consumers and individuals. To the extent that CBO \n     and Federal agencies will need to collect more data and \n     information from State, local and tribal governments and the \n     private sector, as they conduct their requisite legislative \n     and regulatory cost estimates, it is possible that those \n     entities will face additional paperwork. However, although \n     smaller governments are certainly encouraged to comply with \n     agency and CBO requests for information, they are not bound \n     to.\n\n\n                         vi. cbo cost estimate\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 1995.\n     Hon.

Bill purpose: S. 1 would require authorizing committees \n     in the House and Senate to include in their reports on \n     legislation a description and an estimate of the cost of any \n     Federal mandates in that legislation, along with an \n     assessment of their anticipated benefits. Mandates are \n     defined to include provisions that impose duties on States, \n     localities, or Indian tribes (``intergovernmental mandates'') \n     or on the private sector (``private sector mandates''). \n     Mandates also would include provisions that reduce or \n     eliminate any authorization of appropriations to assist \n     State, local, and tribal governments or the private sector in \n     complying with Federal requirements, unless the requirements \n     are correspondingly reduced. In addition, intergovernmental \n     mandates would include changes in the conditions governing \n     certain types of entitlement programs (for example, \n     Medicaid). Conditions of Federal assistance and duties \n     arising from participation in most voluntary Federal programs \n     would not be considered mandates.\n       Committee reports would have to provide information on the \n     amount of Federal financial assistance that would be \n     available to carry out any intergovernmental mandates in the \n     legislation. In addition, committees would have to note \n     whether the legislation preempts any State or local laws. The \n     requirements of the bill would not apply to provisions that \n     enforce the constitutional rights of individuals, that are \n     necessary for national security, or that meet certain other \n     conditions.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would be required to \n     provide committees with estimates of the direct cost of \n     mandates in reported legislation other than appropriation \n     bills. Specific estimates would be required for \n     intergovernmental mandates costing $50 million or more and, \n     if feasible, for private sector mandates costing $200 million \n     or more in a particular year. (CBO currently prepares \n     estimates of costs to States and localities of reported \n     bills, but does not project costs imposed on Indian tribes or \n     the private sector.) In addition, CBO would probably be asked \n     to assist the Budget Committees by preparing estimates for \n     amendments and at later stages of a bill's consideration. \n     Also, at times other than when a bill is reported,\n     when requested by Congressional committees, CBO would analyze \n     proposed legislation likely to have a significant budgetary \n     or financial impact on State, local, or tribal governments or \n     on the private sector, and would prepare studies on proposed \n     mandates. S. 1 would authorize the appropriation of $4.5 \n     million to CBO for each of the fiscal years 1996-2002 to \n     carry out the new requirements. These requirements would take \n       effect on January 1, 1996, and would be permanent.S. 1 \n     would amend Senate rules to establish a point of order \n     against any bill or joint resolution reported by an \n     authorizing committee that lacks the necessary CBO statement \n     or that results in direct costs (as defined in the bill) of \n     $50 million or more in a year to State, local, and tribal \n     governments. The legislation would be in order if it provided \n     funding to cover the direct costs incurred by such \n     governments, or if it included an authorization of \n     appropriations and identified the minimum amount that must be \n     appropriated in order for the mandate to be effective, the \n     specific bill that would provide the appropriation, and a \n     federal agency responsible for implementing the mandate.\n       Finally, S. 1 would require executive branch agencies to \n     take actions to ensure that State, local, and tribal concerns \n     are fully considered in the process of promulgating \n     regulations. These actions would include the preparation of \n     estimates of the anticipated costs of regulations to States, \n     localities, and Indian tribes, along with an assessment of \n     the anticipated benefits. In addition, the bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of $1 million, to be spent over \n     fiscal years 1995 and 1996, for a temporary Commission on \n     Unfunded Federal Mandates, which would recommend ways to \n     reconcile, terminate, suspend, consolidate, or simplify \n     federal mandates.\n       5.

Comparison with spending under current law: S. 1 would \n     authorize additional appropriations of $4.5 million a year \n     for the Congressional Budget Office beginning in 1996. CBO's \n     1995 appropriation is $23.2 million. If funding for current \n     activities were to remain unchanged in 1996, and if the full \n     additional amount authorized were appropriated, CBO's 1996 \n     appropriation would total $27.7 million, an increase of 19 \n     percent.\n       Because S. 1 would create the Commission on Unfunded \n     Federal Mandates, there is no funding under current law for \n     the commission.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       8. Estimated cost to State and local governments: None.\n       9. Estimate comparison: None.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: None.\n       10.

As \n     the federal government tried to cut spending and reduce the \n     federal budget deficit, it passed responsibilities onto state \n     and local governments without providing money to pay for \n     them. I oppose placing unreasonably fiscal demands on states \n     and localities.\n       I am pleased that S. 1 includes provision to study the \n     disproportionate impact mandates may have on rural \n     communities. Last year, during the Government Affairs \n     Committee's consideration of S. 993, the unfunded mandates \n     bill of the 103rd Congress, Susan Ritter of North Dakota, \n     testified that one half of the annual budget of Sherwood, ND, \n     is spent to test their water supply. In April 1994, the Minot \n     Daily News reported that each resident of Mohall, ND, \n     population 931, would need to contribute to a water testing \n     bill of $2,400 for the year. The Minot Daily News further \n     stated that the water testing budget for Minot, ND, was \n     $3,300 five years ago, but had since risen to $26,100. These \n     numbers illustrate the difficulties local governments face in \n     meeting their budgets in the face of federal mandates.\n       The federal government must do a better job of listening to \n     local governments when developing laws and regulations. It is \n     important for Congress to consider the actual impact that \n     federal legislation can have on state and local governments, \n     as well as the private sector. It is always essential to \n     weigh costs and benefits of legislation when enacting new \n     laws.\n       I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1, however I do \n     recognize there are some areas of the legislation which can \n     be fine-tuned. For example, S. 1 amends provisions of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Attempts to amend, or \n     improve, provisions of S. 1, which are incorporated into the \n     Budget Act, will be subject to a super-majority point of \n     order under the Budget Act. Also, we cannot be one hundred \n     percent sure how this legislation will work; it may be too \n     weak or it may be too restrictive. It is for these two \n     reasons that I support including a sunset date for S. 1.\n       It is also my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will \n     join me in a colloquy during consideration of this bill, so \n     that questions regarding application to reauthorization \n     bills, the competitive balance between local governments and \n     the private sector, a sunset provision, and exclusions with \n     S. 1 are thoroughly discussed. Given the fast pace with which \n     S. 1 is moving, it is only appropriate that all aspects of S. \n     1 are addressed to remove concern.\n       I am greatly pleased to see this important issue before the \n     Budget Committee and it is my hope that a fair and \n     comprehensive bill regarding this issue is favorably \n     considered by the Senate.\n   ADDITIONAL MINORITY VIEWS OF SENATOR BOXER ON S. 1, THE UNFUNDED \n                          MANDATES REFORM ACT\n\n       My first elected office in California was in 1976 when I \n     won a seat on the Marin County Board of Supervisors. In that \n     capacity I encountered laws passed by the state government \n     and the federal government that impacted on our governance. \n     Some of these were very good laws, paid for in whole or in \n     part, and some of these were bad laws which made no sense.\n       The example that stands out in my mind was a law which came \n     down from the federal government and was tied to our receipt \n     of emergency planning monies. This law required our Board of \n     Supervisors to plan for the orderly exit from the country of \n     all our citizens in the case of nuclear war with the Soviet \n     Union. It was very clear to public health and law enforcement \n     people as well as all other residents of the county that \n     there was no way a county so close to a targeted Soviet site \n     in San Francisco could survive in any condition worth living \n     under. Yet, that never stopped the federal bureaucracy then.\n       They had certain rules laid out for us. We were to all get \n     in our cars and go to a county to the north which was dubbed \n     the ``host'' county. It was like a party . . . with the Marin \n     County guests and the Sonoma County hosts. We were instructed \n     by the feds to make sure we had cash as we all would have to \n     get gasoline for our cars because the attendants at the gas \n     stations would be quite busy.\n       I am happy to report that the Marin Board of Supervisors, a \n     bi-partisan board at the time, chose to give all the planning \n     monies back to Uncle Sam rather than give our constituents \n     the false hope that they could survive an all-out nuclear \n     war.\n       With regard to S. 1, I think the goal of this bill makes a \n     lot of sense. If a federal mandate places an undue financial \n     burden on state and local governments, then Congress should \n     recognize and address the problem. There should be exceptions \n     to this rule, however, and S. 1 deals with areas which are of \n     vital importance to the nation that should be protected from \n     the provisions of this bill.\n       S. 1 currently shields bills and federal rules that help \n     secure our constitutional rights, prevent discrimination, \n     ensure national security, and implement international \n     agreements such as NAFTA from its requirements. In my view, \n     unfortunately, two other areas of nation-wide importance have \n     been overlooked.\n       I am deeply concerned that bill fails to adequately ensure \n     our ability to protect the most vulnerable members of our \n     society; our children, our pregnant women, and our elderly. \n     Why should we deny our children, pregnant women, and elderly \n     the same protections? I am prepared to offer an amendment to \n     add legislation involving children and others to the list of \n     S. exemptions. It will simply provide that any bill which \n     ``provides for the protection of the health of children, \n     pregnant women, or the elderly'' would not be subject to S. \n     1's point of order and other requirements.\n       I am also concerned that S. 1 fails to distinguished \n     between mandates that affect state and local governments as \n     ``employers'' and state and local governments as \n     ``governments.'' I plan to offer an amendment on the floor \n     that will add labor standards to the list of mandates \n     exempted from S. 1's requirements.\n       I am also disappointed that the bill fails to directly \n     address one of the biggest unfunded federal mandates faced by \n     California: the costs imposed by illegal immigration. I \n     therefore plan to offer an amendment on the floor to ensure \n     that the costs to states and local governments from illegal \n     immigration be addressed in the bill.\n       One point of concern was particularly overlooked and I \n     offered an amendment in the Committee markup to address this \n     area. The amendment which I offered with the support of the \n     ranking member would have added a provision to sunset S. 1 in \n     1998. Since the enforcement mechanisms of the Budget Act will \n     expire in 1998, I believe that it is only reasonable to \n     revisit the unfunded mandates issue at the same time that we \n     revisit the whole budget process to ensure that it is working \n     as it should.\n       However, the Committee rejected this amendment, along with \n     two additional amendments to sunset the bill in 2000 and \n     2002, respectively, by a party line vote. This deeply upsets \n     me. How will we know whether the whole new process will work? \n     S. 1 may simply not work. It is crucial that we set a \n     reasonable time to revisit the bill and make any \n     improvements--either strengthening or weakening--that our \n     experience with it will have shown to be necessary.\n       I do hope that this bill will truly meet its very fair goal \n     of reimbursing the states and \n      [[Page S789]] local governments for laws that we pass. \n     However, I will reserve judgment on final passage of the bill \n     until the amendment process has been completed.\n       Unrelated to the bill, but very timely, I plan to offer a \n     Sense of Senate Resolution that the campaign of violence \n     against women's health clinics must end. My amendment calls \n     on the Attorney General to take all necessary steps to \n     protect reproductive health clinics and their staff. I know \n     all of my colleagues share my views that this violence is \n     deplorable.\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 29, 1994.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC\n       Dear Bill and John: We expect the Senate to consider \n     legislation early in the session regarding Federal mandates \n     on State and local governments and the private sector. We may \n     initiate such legislation in the Budget Committee and we want \n     to work with you to assure that any state, local, or private \n     sector mandate legislation moves quickly and is a \n     constructive improvement to the congressional budget process.\n       Such legislation raised budget and economic issues that the \n     Budget Committee must confront in writing a federal budget \n     each year. Moreover, most versions of this legislation \n     contain a significant expansion in the Congressional Budget \n     Office's responsibilities. In the past, our committees have \n     worked jointly on such legislation. In 1981, our two \n     committees both reported legislation that led to the \n     enactment of the State and Local Government Cost Estimate \n     Act.\n       Some versions of this legislation may be referred to the \n     Budget Committee under the standing order governing referral \n     of budget-related legislation. If the Budget Committee does \n     not report such legislation and it includes provisions \n     affecting the Congressional Budget Office or the \n     congressional budget process, such legislation could be in \n     jeopardy under section 306 of the Budget Act.\n       We want to work with you to assure such legislation is \n     considered expeditiously. Should you have any questions, \n     please to do no hesitate to contact us or our staff (Bill \n     Hoagland at 4-0539 and Bill Dauster at 4-3961).\n           Sincerely,\n     James Exon.\n     Pete V.

A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to ensure \nthat constitutionally protected private property rights are not \ninfringed until adequate protection is afforded by reauthorization of \nthe act, to protect against economic losses from critical habitat \ndesignation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n         the farm, ranch, and homestead protection act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, for generations American farmers have \nworked to provide food, clothing, and shelter to their families. \nFarmers and ranchers in Texas and throughout the United States have \ntilled the soil and cleared the rangeland--and, if they had a good \nyear, they might try to put any money left over back into the land to \nbuy more property.\n  This land is their wealth--their property, which our Government was \nformed to protect, just as it protects our homes from burglary and our \nmoney in banks from theft.\n  Our founding fathers acknowledged that private property rights were \nimportant. They fought foreign rulers to protect it. The Bill of \nRights, drafted after that struggle, says that private property shall \nnot be taken for public use, without just compensation. But, through \noverly zealous environmental enforcement, this constitutional \nprotection is being watered down.\n  Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which enforces the \nEndangered Species Act, proposed that up to 800,000 acres from 33 Texas \ncounties be designated as critical habitat for the golden-cheeked \nwarbler. This action held up land transfers, construction, home and \nbusiness lending. With about 300 species in Texas being considered for \nlisting as endangered or threatened, including 8 flies and 12 beetles, \nlandowners in my State may face a very grave problem again soon.\n  Recent reports about the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's latest Balcones \nCanyonlands Conservation Plan in Austin, TX, are discouraging. \nYesterday, the Interior Department proposed that owners of single-\nfamily lots in Travis County that were subdivided before the golden-\ncheek warbler was listed as an endangered species can apply for a \npermit to construct a single family home for a fee of $1,500. \nDevelopers are expected to pay even more--up to $5,500 an acre--to \nbuild on land that has not been subdivided yet.\n  The permit fees, plus $10 million from Travis County, would be used \nto add to the 21,000 acres in existing wildlife refuges. Well, the \nTravis County residents have voted against spending more money on \nrefuges, in 1993 and the Travis County officials were blindsided. They \nwere not even consulted about this proposal to spend $10 million of \nTravis County's money, when the people have just voted not to put any \nmore money into wildlife refuges.\n  Rather than assuring fair compensation for private property when \nthere is a Government taking, the Service's plan would require \nlandowners to pay ransom to the Federal Government--ransom to the \nFederal Government--for the privilege of building on a lot which they \nhave already bought to build a house--perhaps the house they have been \ndreaming of for years. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has stated in \nthe past that he believes private property is an outmoded concept. The \nFish and Wildlife Service would say, by regulation, that his views are \nright. This would essentially repeal the fifth amendment to our U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Today, Senators Lott, Gramm, Grassley, Nickles, and I are introducing \nlegislation to stop Government overreaching until we have had time to \nrevise the Endangered Species Act. Congressman Lamar Smith is \nintroducing a companion bill in the House.\n  My bill puts a moratorium on the listing of new endangered and \nthreatened species until reauthorization. Right now the Fish and \nWildlife Service is proposing to list a species in the panhandle of \nTexas--the Arkansas River shiner--that is used for fish bait. Water is \nscarce in the panhandle; we cannot afford to give fish bait more \nprotection than people. But once the shiner is designated, it will have \nmore right to the water than the panhandle farmers and ranchers and the \npeople of Amarillo, TX. The people have to have a voice.\n  The bill also puts a moratorium on the designation of critical \nhabitat so that property owners will not lose control of their land. \nDesignating critical habitat puts unjust limits on the use, market \nvalue, and transferability of property. The stigma of critical habitat \nshould not be imposed by a government that claims to protect property \nas a constitutional right.\n  Finally, the bill puts a moratorium on the requirement that all \ngovernment agencies consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service before \ntaking actions, providing permits, or providing funding that may affect \nan endangered species. This will prevent the Fish and Wildlife Service \nfrom further expanding use of the Endangered Species Act to deny FHA or \nVA mortgages, crop insurance, crop support payments, farm erosion \nstudies, or SBA loans. To be fair, they have not done this yet; so far, \nit has only been used on large Government projects. But until this year \nthey had not proposed to designate an area larger than the State of \nRhode Island as critical habitat. But they did it last year in Texas.\n  Property owners should not have to fight the Government to build a \nnew home on their land. They should not have to hire lawyers to tell \nwhat their rights are or convince bureaucrats that their farming is in \ncompliance with regulations. Farmers in my State should not live in \nfear of being treated like the farmer in California who was arrested in \na Government raid for allegedly harming a kangaroo rat while he was \nplowing his field. This rat is designated as an endangered species for \none reason--its feet are a millimeter longer than other, similar \nspecies. There are other alternatives. Instead of seizing land and \narresting farmers, we should encourage private landowners to protect \nspecies and habitat with tax incentives, and whenever possible relocate \nthreatened species to park lands so it does not encroach on the private \nproperty rights nor the ability of a farmer or a rancher to feed his or \nher family.\n  Opponents of compensation for takings of property argue the National \nGovernment cannot afford it. That argument acknowledges what is \nhappending is in fact unconstitutional. If we want to protect the \ncritical habitat of endangered species, we have to pay for it. James \nMadison, in the Federalist Papers, made it clear that the purpose of \ngovernment is to protect private property. He said, ``government is \ninstituted no less for protection of property than of the persons of \nindividuals.''\n  If opponents of compensation are truly opposed to this principle, \nthey have a remedy. They can propose an amendment to the Constitution. \nBut until they do and until it is passed, these acts are \nunconstitutional. We are sworn to uphold the Constitution. Mr. \nPresident, we must do it. The actions on this bill will provide the \nmeans to do it.\n  We need to make the real effect of the Endangered Species Act clear \nto the rulemakers in Washington. Many of them have not even set foot on \na farm since their third grade class field trip. It is no wonder that \nso many of our people spoke in November that ``we cannot take the \nGovernment harassment.'' It is no longer about protecting our treasured \nnatural resources from harm. It is about Government taking control of \npeople's land. We must put a \n [[Page S791]] stop to it, until we have the opportunity to give the \nFish and Wildlife Service a new direction.\n  That is something I hope this Senate will do very quickly before \nuntold damage is done, like what is happening right now in Austin, TX.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 192. A bill to prohibit the use of certain assistance provided \nunder the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to encourage \nplant closings and the resultant relocation of employment, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n        THE PROHIBITION OF INCENTIVES FOR RELOCATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, a bill designed to proscribe the use of \ncommunity development block grant, and other HUD funds for assisting \nbusinesses in moving jobs from one State to another. This measure is \nsimilar to a bill I introduced in the 103d Congress, the Prohibition of \nIncentives for Relocation Act of 1994, and is based upon legislation \nauthored during the 103d Congress by U.S. House Representatives, Gerry \nKleczka and Tom Barrett of Wisconsin, which was approved in the House-\npassed HUD reauthorization legislation, H.R. 3838.\n  Mr. President, the importance of this issue remains a critical one to \nthis day for Wisconsin's economic future, as well as the future of \nother States like ours that possess labor intensive industries.\n  Our concern was generated by an announcement made in 1994 by a major \nemployer in Wisconsin, Briggs and Stratton, that a Milwaukee plant \nwould be closed, and 2,000 workers would be permanently displaced. The \nactual economic impact upon this community is even greater since it is \nestimated that 1.24 related jobs will be lost for every one of the \n2,000 Briggs jobs affected. The devastating news was compounded by the \nsubsequent discovery that many of these jobs were being transferred to \nplants, which were being expanded in two other States, and that Federal \ncommunity development block grant [CDBG] funds were being used to \nfacilitate the transfer of these jobs from one State to another.\n  This is a totally inappropriate use of Federal funds, which this \nlegislation is designed to end. The CDBG Program is designed to foster \ncommunity and economic development; not to help move jobs around the \ncountry. Obviously, during a period of permanent economic \nrestructuring, which results in plant closing, downsizing of Federal \nprograms and defense industry conversion, there is tremendous \ncompetition between communities for new plants and other business \nexpansions to offset other job losses. State and local communities are \ndoing everything they can to attract new business and retain existing \nbusinesses. But it is simply wrong to use Federal dollars to help one \ncommunity raid jobs from another State. There is no way to justify to \nthe taxpayers in my State that they are sending their money to \nWashington to be distributed to other States to be used to attract jobs \nout of our State, leaving behind communities whose economic stability \nhas been destroyed. Thousands of people whose jobs are directly, or \nindirectly lost as a result of the transfer of these jobs out of our \nState are justifiably outraged by this misuse of funds.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is very similar to a provision of the \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, which prohibited urban \ndevelopment action grants [UDAG] from being used for projects intended \nto move jobs from one community to another. Section 5318(h) of Title 42 \nof the United States Code prohibits the use of UDAG if the funds are, \n``intended to facilitate the relocation of industrial or commercial \nplants or facilities from one area to another,'' unless it is \ndetermined that the relocation does not significantly and adversely \naffect the unemployment or economic base of the area from which the \nindustrial or commercial plant or facility is to be relocated.'' \nSimilarly, this legislation provides that no assistance through CDBG \nand other related HUD programs shall be used for any activity that is \nintended, or is likely to facilitate the closing of an industrial or \ncommercial plant, or the substantial reduction of operations of a \nplant; and result in the relocation or expansion of a plant from one \narea to another area. Similar antipiracy provisions are included in SBA \nprograms, Economic Development Administration programs and the Economic \nDislocated Workers Adjustment Act.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue of fundamental fairness, and sound \npublic policy. Federal funding for economic development projects should \nbe directed toward projects that expand employment opportunities and \neconomic growth, not simply move jobs from one community to another. \nThis legislation is designed to ensure that community development funds \nare appropriately used for that purpose. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a forage fee formula on lands under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the \nInterior; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the federal forage fee act of 1995\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am sending legislation to the desk \nthat \n [[Page S792]] changes the way ranchers pay to graze their livestock on \nFederal rangelands. I introduced this bill last Congress, with 14 of my \ncolleagues including my friend who is across the floor today, the \nSenator from Idaho [Mr. Craig]. This bill was not acted on but we think \nit is an important bill that should be reintroduced.\n  The formula included in this proposal was developed by several \neconomists who worked at land grant colleges in the West. The formula \nabandons the old Public Rangelands Improvement Act formula, which has \nbeen much maligned, in favor of a formula that sets a realistic value \non the opportunity to graze livestock on public lands. It will result \nin a fee that is about 23 percent higher than the current fee.\n  Having been very active on this issue for many years, I know \ncongressional debate about grazing fees has been polarized. Opponents \nof the current fee argue that ranchers do not pay fair market value, \nwhile some ranchers would like to maintain the status quo. On the other \nhand, ranchers in many cases think the fee should not go up at all. But \nmany of us who have worked on it believe ranchers are the family \nfarmers of the West. The establishment of a fair and equitable grazing \nfee formula is still necessary to ensure their survival. I also think \nthe rancher is key to the rural Western economy. Not only does this add \nbillions to the Nation's economy, in much of the West, it is the single \nlargest source of economic activity and tax revenue. Every Western \nranching job creates as many as four jobs on Main Street. If those \nranchers go under, so will the tractor, truck and automobile dealers, \nthe gas, grocery and feed store owners, the veterinarians, doctors, and \ndentists, and many others who make up the commercial and social fabric \nof rural Western towns.\n  A fee not based on sound science and careful study will destabilize \nthe entire livestock industry and the rural Western economic \ninfrastructure it supports. The new formula is based on a principle: on \nthe private forage market. It reflects the higher operational costs and \nlower returns derived from Federal lands. This results in a formula \nthat provides economic parity between producers who use Federal land \nand private livestock producers.\n  Secretary of the Interior Babbitt has already said that he intends to \ndrop his efforts to raise grazing fees. He also said that he intends to \nfinalize his regulations within the next 6 months for how our public \nlands should be managed for grazing.\n  It is clear to me that environmentalists care about management \nissues, that is, the Department's ability to effectively steward the \nresources it manages. To cattlemen, however, the single most important \nissue is the fee. If it is too high, ranchers go out of business. The \nranchers I have talked to realize they will eventually have to pay more \nfor the privilege of grazing on public lands, but as business people, \nthey need stability--stability that can only be provided if a bill \npasses to lock a higher fee into place.\n  Many Western Senators believe that the issue of grazing fees should \nbe separated from\n management reforms. This has been done, but it does not mean that our \nGovernment has forgotten that a commitment was made 2 years ago by the \nranching industry to pay their fair share.\n\n  Reintroducing this bill is an attempt to keep our end of the bargain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       That this Act may be cited as the ``Federal Forage Fee Act \n     of 1993''.\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) it is in the national interest that the public lands \n     are producing and continue to produce water and soil \n     conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage and \n     recreation and other multiple use opportunities;\n       (2) rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved \n     long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, \n     public partnerships and flexibility in management programs \n     and agreements;\n       (3) to assure sound management and stewardship of the \n     renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is \n     reasonable and equitable and represents the fair value of the \n     forage provided;\n       (4) the intermingled private-public land ownership patterns \n     prevailing in much of the west create a strong \n     interdependence between public and private lands for forage, \n     water, and habitat for both wildlife and livestock;\n       (5) the social and economic infrastructure of many rural \n     communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas \n     of rural America are highly independent on the protection\n      of the value of privately held production units on Federal \n     lands.\n\n     SEC. 2.

For each year after the first year that \n     the Secretaries calculate the Federal forage fee, the fee \n     shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than 75 \n     percent of the Federal forage fee calculated for the previous \n     year.\n       (e) The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee \n     cost differential shall be updated periodically by the \n     Secretaries so as to reflect as accurately as possible the \n     actual nonfee costs incurred by the cattle and sheep industry \n     that utilizes public lands in the sixteen Western States. The \n     results of the updated survey shall be incorporated into the \n     calculation of the Non Fee Cost Differential as they become \n     available.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           Federal Forage Fee Formula--Narrative Description\n\n       The Federal Forage Fee Formula is based on the premise that \n     the western public lands grazing permittee should pay the \n     fair value of the forage received from federal lands.\n       Two objectives were met in determining the formula for a \n     forage value-based grazing fee: (1) Identification of the \n     value of raw forage as a percentage of the private land lease \n     rate (Private Lease Forage Value Ratio); and (2) an \n     adjustment which reflects the lower animal production derived \n     from federal lands compared to private lands (Net Production \n     Differential), and the additional costs of doing business on \n     federal lands compared to private lands (Non Fee Cost \n     Differential) (e.g., additional infrastructure and \n     operational costs). Because the costs associated with cattle \n     production vary from those of sheep production, sheep costs \n     are figured into the Non Fee Cost Differential (80% cattle, \n     20% sheep). Simply put, the federal forage fee formula is \n     based on the private forage market while reflecting the \n     unique costs of production and relative inefficiencies of \n     harvesting federal forage compared to private land \n     operations. A reasonable grazing fee must reflect the higher \n     operational costs and lower animal production derived from \n     federal lands and, as such, would promote similar economic \n     opportunity between federal land and private land livestock \n     producers.\n       The private land lease rate is weighted by the proportional \n     number of federal AUMs in each of the 16 western states. The \n     rolling three year weighted average of the private land lease \n     rate is used in order to minimize the high and low extremes \n     of the lease scale. This lease rate is calculated on a \n     weighted average of private lease rates for non-irrigated \n     native rangelands.\n       The value of the forage component of private land leases, \n     as determined in a comprehensive 1966 grazing fee study and \n     carried through in the 1992 update of the Grazing Fee Review \n     and Evaluation report is 48.8% of the total private land \n     lease rate. The remaining 51.2% of the private lease rate \n     includes infrastructure and services associated with a \n     private land lease.\n       The Non Fee Cost Differential of the federal forage fee \n     formula is based on the updated analysis of non-fee costs \n     adjusted annually for inflation. This number indicates that \n     for 1991 it cost $1.60 more per AUM to operate on federal \n     lands than private lands.\n       The Net Production Differential of the formula is based on \n     Economic Research Service comparisons of cash livestock \n     receipts from both western federal land ranches and non-\n     federal land ranches which show that, overall, the federal \n     lands generate 12.1% less revenue per animal unit than \n     private lands (thus, the\n      87.9% figure). Every figure in the federal forage fee \n     formula is derived from economic data compiled and updated \n     by federal agencies.\n       Research using historical data reveals that the Federal \n     Forage Fee yields more predictable fee than PRIA, which has \n     fluctuated from a high of $2.41 to a low of $1.35 (a 78% \n     variance) over its 15 year life. A 25% cap on any increase or \n     decrease in the fee from year to year, starting with the \n     current fee is maintained. Additionally, the federal forage \n     fee formula adheres to the guidelines Congress established \n     for determination of federal grazing fee policy as outlined \n     by the Federal Lands Policy Management Act of 1976, the \n     Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 and the Taylor \n     Grazing Act of 1934.\n\n\n                                FIGURES\n\n        Weighted average private land lease rate [WAPLLR]: $8.77\n\n       Derived from 16 state weighted average private land lease \n     rate as surveyed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \n     Economic Research Service (ERS) and adjusted for the number \n     of federal AUMs in each state.

A bill to repeal the Medicare and Medicaid Coverage Data \nBank, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                medicare/medicaid data bank legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce this \nbill, which would eliminate a large and unjustified administrative \nburden imposed on employers by an ill-considered piece of legislation \npassed 2 years ago. Specifically, it would repeal the Medicare and \nMedicaid Coverage Data Bank, section 13581 of OBRA 1993, a law that is \nextremely expensive, burdensome, punitive, and in my view, entirely \nunnecessary.\n  This data bank law requires every employer who offers health care \ncoverage to provide substantial and often difficult-to-obtain \ninformation on current and past employees and their dependents, \nincluding names, Social Security numbers, health care plans, and period \nof coverage. Employers that do not satisfy this considerable reporting \nobligation are subject to substantial penalties, possibly up to \n$250,000 per year or even more if the failure to report is found to be \ndeliberate.\n  According to the law that created the requirement, its purported \nobjective is to ensure reimbursement of costs to Medicare or Medicaid \nwhen a third party is the primary payor. This is a legitimate \nobjective. However, if the objective of the data bank is to preserve \nMedicare and Medicaid funds, why is it necessary to mandate information \non all employees, the vast majority of whom have no direct association \nwith either the Medicare or Medicaid Program?\n  Last year, I introduced S. 1933 to repeal the Medicare and Medicaid \nCoverage Data Bank. Unfortunately, this bill did not pass in the 103d \nCongress, in part because of a questionable Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis that estimated that the data bank would save the Federal \nGovernment about $1 billion. As a result of this scoring, we would have \nhad to raise the same amount in revenues to offset these purported \n``savings.'' However, the General Accounting Office found that ``as \nenvisioned, the data bank would have certain inherent problems and \nlikely achieve little or no savings to the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms.'' Still, due primarily to the fiction that the data bank \nwould save money, S. 1933 was not enacted last year.\n  When it was clear that I did not have the votes to repeal the data \nbank law, I worked with several other Senators to ensure that no \nfunding was appropriated for the data bank in fiscal year 1995. Due to \nour efforts, the Labor and Human Resources Appropriations report \ncontained language prohibiting the use of Federal funds for developing \nor maintaining the data bank. However, this provision by itself did not \nrevoke the requirement that covered entities must still provide the \nrequired information on the health coverage of current and former \nemployees and their families. This would have resulted in the bizarre \nsituation in which covered employers would have had to report the \ninformation, but there \n[[Page S794]] would have been no data bank to process or retrieve it.\n  Finally, in response to the public outcry about this Federal mandate \nand the sentiments of Congress, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration [HCFA] indicated that it will not be enforcing the data \nbank's reporting requirements in fiscal year 1995. It stated that in \nlight of the refusal of Congress to fund the data bank, ``we have \nagreed to stay an administrative action to implement the current \nrequirements, including the promulgation of reporting forms and \ninstructions. Therefore, we will not expect employers to compile the \nnecessary information or file the required reports. Likewise, no \nsanctions will be imposed for failure to file such reports.''\n  This is a major step in the right direction. However, the data bank \nand its reporting requirements are still in the law and are still \nscheduled to be implemented in the next fiscal year. Consequently, \nthere is still a great need to repeal the data bank law.\n  There are those who will argue that, in order to repeal the data \nbank, we still must propose $1 billion in budget offsets. However, as I \nindicated earlier, the GAO found that the data bank would not save \nmoney. Specifically, it testified before the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee that ``the data bank will likely achieve little or no \nsavings while costing millions. Rather, we believe that changes and \nimprovements to existing activities would be a much easier, less \ncostly, and thus preferable alternative to the data bank process. This \nis largely because the data bank will result in an enormous amount of \nadded paperwork for both HCFA and the Nation's employers.''\n  In addition, the GAO report on the data bank law found that employers \nare not certain of their specific reporting obligations, because HCFA \nhas not provided adequate guidance on these obligations. Much of the \ninformation which is required is not typically collected by employers, \nsuch as Social Security numbers of dependents and certain health \ninsurance information. Some employers have even questioned whether it \nis legal for them under various privacy laws to seek to obtain the \nrequired information.\n  The GAO report also found that employers are facing significant costs \nin complying with the reporting requirements, including the costs of \nredesigning their payroll and personnel systems. It cites one company \nwith 44,000 employees that would have costs of approximately $52,000 \nand another company with 4,000 employees that would have costs of \n$12,000. Overall, the American Payroll Association estimated last year \nthat this requirement will cost between $50,000 and $100,000 per \ncompany.\n  I would add that the reporting requirement applies only to employers \nthat provide health insurance coverage to their employees. It is \nunconscionable that we are adding costs and penalties to those who have \nbeen most diligent in providing health coverage to their employees. The \nlast thing that the Federal Government should do is impose \ndisincentives to employee health care coverage, which is one of the \nunintended consequences of the data bank law.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the data bank law is that its \nenormous costs have little or no corresponding benefit. The GAO report \nconcluded that ``The additional information gathering and record \nkeeping required by the data bank appears to provide little benefit to \nMedicare and Medicaid in recovering mistaken payments.'' This is in \npart because HCFA is already obtaining this information in a much more \nefficient manner than that required under OBRA 1993.\n  For example, OBRA 1989 provides for HCFA to periodically match \nMedicare beneficiary data with Internal Revenue Service employment \ninformation--The Data Match Program. Also, HCFA directly asks \nbeneficiaries about primary payor coverage. To the extent that the data \nbank duplicates these efforts, any potential savings will not be \nrealized. It is clearly preferable to require HCFA to use the \ninformation it already has than to require the private sector to \nprovide duplicative information.\n  The GAO report found that ``the data match not only can provide the \nsame information [as the data bank] without raising the potential \nproblems described above, but it can do so at less cost.'' It also \nrecognized that both the data match and data bank processes rely too \nmuch on an after-the-fact recovery approach, and recommended enhancing \nup-front identification of other insurance and avoiding erroneous \npayments. In this regard, it documented that HCFA has already initiated \nthis prospective approach.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government is again imposing substantial \nfinancial burdens on the private sector without fully accepting its \nshare of the burden to implement a program. We should once again expect \nthe worst case scenario to occur: employers will provide the required \ninformation at substantial administrative burden, there will be no data \nbank in which to make use of it, and even if a data bank were funded \nand established, the information stored could not be used efficiently \nto save Medicare or Medicaid funds.\n  I do not want this bill to be construed, in any way, as opposition to \nHCFA obtaining the information it needs to administer the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs efficiently, and obtaining reimbursement from third \nparty payors when appropriate. To assure that HCFA has the information \nit needs, the bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to conduct a \nstudy and report to Congress on how to achieve the purported objectives \nof the data bank in the most cost-effective manner possible.\n  The Secretary's study would have to take into consideration the \nadministrative costs and burden on the private sector and the \nGovernment of processing and providing the necessary information versus \nthe benefits and savings that such reporting requirements would \nproduce. It must also consider current HCFA reporting requirements and \nthe ability of entities to obtain the required information legally and \nefficiently.\n  Too often, Congress considers only the cost savings to the Federal \nGovernment of legislation while ignoring costs to other parties. The \nMedicare and Medicaid Data Bank is a case in point. Congress required \ninformation on millions of employees to save the Federal Government \nmoney. Yet, it will cost employers more money to comply than the \ngovernment saves. Congress must stop passing laws that impose large, \nunjustified administrative burdens on other entities. It must consider \nthe impact of its actions on the whole economy and not just on the \nGovernment.\n  In summary, the reporting requirement for the Medicare and Medicaid \nData Bank is duplicative, burdensome, ineffective, and unnecessary. The \nGAO has characterized it as creating ``an avalanche of unnecessary \npaperwork for both HCFA and employers.'' It penalizes employers who \nprovide health care benefits to their workers--exactly the opposite \ngoal we should be pursuing. The data bank should be repealed and a more \ncost-effective approach should be found to ensure that Medicare and \nMedicaid are appropriately reimbursed by primary payors.\n  Mr. President, last year when I introduced this bill, I included a \nstatement by the Coalition on Employer Health Coverage Reporting and \nthe Medicare/Medicaid Data Bank and several representative letters from \nemployers and employer groups in the Record. These groups continue to \ndemand repeal of this law, and I will not request that their statements \nand letters be published again at taxpayer expense. However, their \nmessage continues to be clear. The Federal Government must stop \nimposing unjustified burdens on businesses.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 195. A bill to amend section 257(e) of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to modify the treatment of losses \nfrom asset sales; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one committee reports, the other committee \nhave 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                THE ASSET SALE BUDGET RULES ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that \nwould modify the budget rules governing the sale of Federal assets. It \nis my hope that Congress this year will review many of the perverse and \nunintended effects of \n[[Page S795]] our budget rules and consider including this legislation \nin a budget process reform package.\n  Under current law, the sale of an asset does not alter the deficit or \nproduce any net deficit reduction in the budget baseline. My \nlegislation maintains this principle. Although an asset sale would not \nbe counted in calculating the deficit, future revenue generated by the \nasset which the government would have received if the asset had not \nbeen sold could be offset by the revenue generated from the sale. I \nwant to emphasize that this rule is narrowly crafted so that revenue \ngained from an asset sale could not be used to offset a separate \nrevenue losing provision.\n  Mr. President, the current budget rules governing asset sales make it \nnearly impossible for the Federal Government to sell assets. For \nexample, during the last several years, both the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations have sought to sell the Alaska Power Administration \n[APA]. The Department of Energy [DOE] has entered into sale agreements \nand negotiated a price of more than $80 million for these electric \ngenerating assets.\n  Unfortunately, legislation needed to implement this sale has been \ndelayed for several years, in part because of the budget rules \ngoverning asset sales. Since the APA takes in approximately $11 million \nper year from the sale of electricity, under our pay-as-you-go rules, \nthe sale is scored by the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] as losing \nthe Federal Government $11 million annually. In other words, even \nthough the Federal Government will receive up-front more than $80 \nmillion by selling the APA, our budget scoring rules require that the \nsale proceeds be ignored, but that the stream of lost future revenues \nbe counted.\n  The end result of these rules is that for the sale to proceed, the \nlost $11 million per year must be offset by other unrelated spending \nreductions. This is Alice-in-Wonderland accounting that has no \nrelationship to the real world. Presumably, the Department of Energy \nnegotiated what it believed was a fair price for the APA assets. \nCertainly DOE factored in the amount of revenue that will no longer be \ncoming to the Federal Government as a result of the sale as well as the \nfact that the Federal Government will no longer have to staff and \nmaintain these operations. Yet when it comes to congressional budget \nscoring rules, all that is counted is the lost stream of future \nrevenues.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would rationalize the asset \nsale rules by allowing the price the Federal Government receives from \nthe asset sale to offset future revenue lost as a result of the \ntransfer of the asset from the Government to private parties. Thus, in \nthe APA example, if over the next 5 years, it is assumed that \nelectricity sales from APA would generate $11 million per year--$55 \nmillion over 5 years--for purposes of the Budget Act, the $83 million \nsale price could offset the $55 million loss of revenue to the \nGovernment. And I want to emphasize that under my legislation, the \nremaining $28 million associated with the sale could neither count \ntoward deficit reduction, nor could it be used to increase spending in \nany other program.\n  I look forward to working with the members of the Budget Committee to \nresolve the current asset sale anomaly. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OFFSETTING LOSSES FROM ASSET SALES.\n\n       Section 257(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 is amended by striking the semicolon at \n     the end thereof and inserting the following: ``. Effective \n     beginning fiscal year 1996, the proceeds from the sale of an \n     asset may be applied to offset the loss of any revenue or \n     receipts resulting from such sale.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 196. A bill to establish certain environmental protection \nprocedures within the area comprising the border region between the \nUnited States and Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n      the united states-mexico border environmental protection act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I introduce the United \nStates-Mexico Border Environmental Protection Act.\n  Our Nation shares a 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Numerous American \nand Mexican sister cities link hands across that border, binding our \ntwo nations in friendship. As friends and neighbors, the United States \nand Mexico have profound responsibilities to one another. Chief among \nthose duties is to respect and safeguard the natural resources our \ncitizen's must share along the international boundary. No activities or \nconditions occurring on one side of the border must be permitted to \nadversely impact the health of people or the environment on the other.\n  Passage of the United States-Mexico Border Environmental Protection \nAct will help us meet our environmental responsibilities successfully. \nIt will do so by providing the resources necessary to protect American \nlives and property from environmental hazards which may arise unabated \nsouth of the border--an important Federal responsibility.\n  Specifically, the bill seeks to establish a $10 million border \nenvironmental emergency fund under the auspices of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The fund would make moneys readily available to \ninvestigate occurrences of pollution, identify sources and take \nimmediate steps to protect land, air and water resources through \ncleanup and other remedial actions.\n  While the EPA can address many problems along the border, some issues \ninvolving the protection of surface waters are under the jurisdiction \nof the International Boundary and Water Commission. The Commission was \ncreated by a treaty with Mexico in 1944 to control floods, manage \nsalinity and develop municipal sewage treatment facilities along \ninternational streams.\n  In my home State, the IBWC has constructed international wastewater \ntreatment facilities in Nogales and Naco, AZ. The Commission's \nauthority, however, to respond to emergency situations involving the \npollution of surface waters is a matter of some doubt. This measure \nprovides the IBWC with explicit authority and resources to protect \nAmerican lives and property from emergency conditions and establishes a \n$5 million fund to do the job. In addition, the Secretary of State is \ndirected to pursue agreements with Mexico for joint response to such \nevents.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to offer an example of why this legislation \nis needed. A few years ago, the breakage of a sewer main combined with \nheavy rains and carried raw sewage into Nogales, AZ via an \ninternational stream. The contamination resulted in a high incidence of \nhepatitis, harmed wildlife, and degraded public and private property, \nprompting the declaration of a State emergency. No definitive and \ncomprehensive action was taken to stem the flow of sewage for several \nweeks due to concerns about the availability of funds and trepidation \nabout the legal authority necessary to take action.\n  Had the emergency fund and response authority I'm proposing been in \nplace, perhaps we could have prevented much of the sickness and \nsuffering visited upon the residents of Nogales. Passage of this \nlegislation will ensure prompt and effective response in the future.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember this measure from last Congress, \nor if they have been here long enough, they may even remember it from \nthe 102d Congress. During this 4-year period this measure has been \nreported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, adopted by the \nSenate on voice vote to the Foreign Authorization Act and passed by the \nSenate as part of the Foreign Authorization Act. Nevertheless, it has \nnever become law.\n  I want my colleagues to realize that should an incident similar to \nthe one in Nogales occur again, we have the opportunity to alleviate \nthe suffering of many people and protect further damage to the \nenvironment. We have had that opportunity for several years but, we \nhave chosen to close our eyes and ignore the plight of Americans living \nin the border region.\n  I would like to note that certain provisions related to the IBWC in \nthis bill are virtually identical to those in the Rio Grande Pollution \nCorrection Act which was signed into law in 1987. Like the bill I'm \nintroducing, the Rio Grande legislation authorized the \n[[Page S796]] IBWC to conclude agreements with Mexico to response to \nsurface water contamination. The United States-Mexico Border \nEnvironmental Protection Act expands the Rio Grande bill to include the \nentire border, as a matter of fairness and necessity.\n  In addition to funding field investigations and rapid emergency \nresponse, the legislation recognizes the importance of communication \nbetween Mexico and the United States and among Federal, State, and \nlocal authorities her at home. The bill seeks to establish an \ninformation sharing and early warning system so that Mexican and \nAmerican officials at all levels will be apprised of environmental \nhazards and risks in a timely and coordinated fashion, so that response \nand remedy, likewise, will be timely and coordinated.\n  Some of my colleagues may be under the impression that this measure \nmay conflict with the environmental side agreement to the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement [NAFTA] or the provisions of the bill may \nalready be addressed by the side agreement. Neither of these statements \nare true.\n  Nevertheless, I wrote to Ambassador Kantor last year during the \ndebate on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill requesting that he \nreview the measure to ensure that it was not in conflict with the side \nagreement. The letter from the Ambassador's office reads ``We see \nnothing in your proposal that would be in conflict with the \nAgreement.'' He went further to say ``in fact, what you propose appears \nto be fully supportive of the Side Agreement.''\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt of our obligation to be a \nresponsible neighbor to Mexico, nor of Mexico's obligation to us. \nConsidering the enactment of the NAFTA treaty which I strongly \nsupported, now more than ever, it's important that we commit ourselves \nto a clean and healthy border environment for the safety and enjoyment \nof Americans and Mexicans who inhabit the region. Enactment of this \nlegislation is an important step to that end.\n  I urge the Senate to consider and swiftly pass this vital \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Carl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup \nDay, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n               the carl garner federal lands cleanup act\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, several years ago I introduced \nlegislation which resulted in the creation of the Federal Lands Cleanup \nAct. This law designates the first Saturday after Labor Day of each \nyear as Federal Lands Cleanup Day and requires each Federal land \nmanaging agency to organize, coordinate, and participate with citizen \nvolunteers and State and local agencies in cleaning and maintaining \nFederal public lands.\n  I was inspired to introduce this legislation by a talented and \ndedicated public servant by the name of Carl Garner. Carl is the \nresident engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers at the Greers Ferry \nLake site in Arkansas. In 1970, he organized a group of about 50 \nvolunteers to clean up trash that had accumulated along the shoreline \nof the lake. The Greers Ferry Cleanup Day was such an overwhelming \nsuccess that eventually it was expanded to other Corps of Engineers-\noperated lakes and other Federal and State lands in Arkansas and became \nknown as the Great Arkansas Cleanup. The cleanup has become so popular \nthat last year more than 24,000 Arkansans participated in it at more \nthan 100 sites.\n  Carl Garner recognized that we must instill in our citizens a greater \nsense of ownership, pride, and responsibility for the care and \nmanagement of our State and public lands. His efforts and the \nphenomenal success of the Arkansas Cleanup Program inspired me to \nintroduce the Federal Lands Cleanup Act of 1985.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will rename the Federal \nLands Cleanup Act and the day in honor of Carl Garner. This bill was \napproved by the Senate in the 103d Congress but was not considered by \nthe House. I am introducing it again so that future generations who \nenjoy and treasure our Nation's forests, national parks, and waterways \nto know that it was the vision and leadership of Carl Garner that was \nresponsible for creating this national cleanup effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress, assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. THE CARL GARNER FEDERAL LANDS CLEANUP ACT\n\n       The Federal Lands Cleanup Act of 1985 (36 U.S.C. 169i-169i-\n     1) is amended by striking ``Federal Lands Cleanup Day'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``Carl Garner Federal Lands \n     Cleanup Day.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Kohl, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 198. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit Medicare select policies to be offered in all States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                extension of the medicare select program\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with \nSenators Feinstein, Hutchison, Kohl, and Dorgan in introducing \nlegislation to extend the Medicare Select Program permanently and to \nmake it available in all 50 States.\n  Based on legislation that I introduced in 1990, Medicare Select is a \ndemonstration project operating in 15 States with more than 400,000 \nparticipants. Under this program, Medicare beneficiaries have the \noption to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance policies--often \nreferred to as Medigap policies--through managed care networks.\n  This program has been a huge success and admirably serves those \nbeneficiaries lucky enough to participate. Recent data continues to \nshow that Medicare beneficiaries who purchase Medicare Select products \npay premiums 10 percent to 37 percent less expensive than traditional \nMedigap products. Moreover, consumer satisfaction with these products \nis extremely high. Of the top 15 Medigap products ranked by Consumer \nReports magazine in its August 1994 issue, eight were Medicare Select \nproducts. Unfortunately, under current law, current Medicare Select \ncarriers will have to halt enrollment in July 1995.\n  Almost all the major health care reform plans introduced during the \npast session of Congress included provisions to expand the Medicare \nSelect Program to all 50 States. While none of these health care reform \nefforts succeeded, my colleagues and I worked at the end of the last \nsession to extend the demonstration program until July of this year, \nuntil we could introduce a bill to extend the program permanently and \nto expand it to all 50 States. As I indicated, the current \ndemonstration program expires in July of this year--before we will be \nable to take any actions on health care reform.\n  Therefore, we need to enact legislation that will allow the current \nsuccessful program to become a permanent option for Medicare \nbeneficiaries and to expand to all States. This bill will do just that, \nand I urge my colleagues to give it their support.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support Senator Chafee's \nproposal to extend the Medicare Select Program, which currently \nprovides Medigap health benefits to roughly 400,000 older Americans by \nusing a managed care model.\n  Like many of the other original cosponsors of this legislation, I \ncome from one of the 15 States where the Medicare Select demonstration \nprogram has proved its popularity during the last 3 years.\n  Medicare Select, which currently provides 100,000 Californians with \nlow-cost Medigap insurance using a managed care model, was enacted in \n1990 as a 3-year demonstration program and has proved to be extremely \npopular, enrolling 400,000 seniors in 15 States.\n  This program used a network of providers to cut premium costs by 10-\n30 percent over fee for service Medigap products--those services and \ncosts not covered by Medicare--according to several reports.\n  In California, roughly 100,000 seniors have signed up for the \nprogram, and Blue Cross of California alone is enrolling an additional \n2,200 per month. These Medicare enrollees are signing up because the \nMedicare Select Program can provide low-cost, high-quality health \nbenefits, while still retaining a high degree of choice over their \nphysician.\n  The reason for the program's popularity are simple. In order to save \nmoney or receive added benefits, more and more older Americans are \nenrolling in managed care plans.\n  In fact, Consumer Reports lists many Medicare Select products as its \nhighest rated values, and extension of the Medicare Select Program is \nstrongly endorsed by California Insurance Commissioner Garamendi, as \nwell as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n  In addition, the Mainstream plan--and nearly every other health \nreform proposed this Congress--provided for a continuation and \nexpansion of Medicare Select and other forms of managed Medicare.\n  Certainly, managed Medicare programs like Medicare Select must be \nimplemented carefully, in order to ensure that Medicare enrollees are \nappropriately informed of the benefits of this program, provided with \nhigh-quality services, and ensured access to highly trained physicians. \nIn addition, managed care programs must be shown to provide lower costs \nto the Federal Government in addition to consumer discounts.\n  However, without the extension of the Medicare Select Program, which \n[[Page S799]] has already proven its initial success, new enrollments \nwill be cut off in July 1995--before additional health care reform will \nhave been enacted.\n  In the absence of national health care reform, I believe that this \nsuccessful and popular managed Medicare program should be allowed to \ncontinue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 199. A bill to repeal certain provisions of law relating to \ntrading with Indians; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                     REPEAL OF INDIAN TRADING LAWS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Arizona, \nJohn McCain, to introduce legislation to repeal the outdated Trading \nwith Indians Act.\n  Originally enacted in 1834 with a legitimate purpose in mind, the \nTrading with Indians Act was intended to protect native Americans from \nbeing unduly influenced by Federal employees.\n  But that act is no longer needed, and is in many cases unnecessarily \npunitive and counterproductive, in 1995. It is wreaking havoc on hard-\nworking employees and their families, and it is bad for reservation \neconomies.\n  The act establishes a virtually absolute prohibition against \ncommercial trading with Indians by employees of the Indian Health \nService and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The prohibition extends to \ntransactions in which a Federal employee has an interest, either in his \nor her own name, or in the name of another person, including a spouse, \nwhere the employee benefits or appears to benefit from such interest.\n  The penalties for violations are severe: a fine of not more than \n$5,000, or imprisonment of not more than 6 months, or both. The act \nfurther provides that any employee in violation be terminated from \nFederal employment.\n  This can result in an employee being subject to criminal penalties \nand termination, not for any real or perceived wrongdoing on his or her \nown part, but merely because the person is married to another \nenterprising individual on an Indian reservation. The nexus is enough \nto invoke penalties. It means, for example, that an Indian Health \nService employee, whose spouse operates a law firm on the Navajo \nNation, could be fined, imprisoned, and/or fired. It means that a \nfamily member can't apply for a small business loan without \njeopardizing the employee's job.\n  The protection that the Trading with Indians Act provided in 1834 can \nnow be provided under the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Government \nEmployees. The intent here is to provide adequate safeguards against \nconflicts of interest, while not unreasonably denying individuals and \ntheir families the ability to live and work--and create jobs--in their \ncommunities.\n  Both Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Interior \nDepartment Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Ada Deer have \nexpressed support for the legislation to repeal the 1834 act. As \nSecretary Shalala pointed out in a letter dated November 17, 1993, the \nDepartment ``agree(s) with the position that the Standards of Ethical \nConduct, along with the criminal statutes at 18 U.S.C. 201-211, provide \nadequate safeguards against conflicts of interest involving Federal \nGovernment employees.''\n  Secretary Shalala went on to note that, ``in addition, the bill could \nimprove the ability of IHS to recruit and retain medical professional \nemployees in remote locations. It is more difficult for IHS to recruit \nand retain medical professionals to work in remote reservation \nfacilities if their spouses are prohibited from engaging in business \nactivities with the local Indian residents, particularly since \nemployment opportunities for spouses are often very limited in these \nlocations.\n  Mr. President, I urge Members of the Senate to join me in this effort \nto promptly repeal an outdated and counterproductive law, and I ask \nthat the text of my bill be reprinted in the Record at this point:\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL.\n       Section 437 of title 18, United States Code, is repealed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 200. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to regulate the \nmanufacture, importation, and sale of any projectile that may be used \nin a handgun and is capable of penetrating police body armor; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     COP KILLER AMMUNITION BAN ACT\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure \ndesigned to ban any handgun bullet capable of piercing body armor, \nregardless of the bullet's physical composition.\n  Mr. President, this legislation grows out of the recent controversy \nover the Black Rhino bullet, which allegedly penetrates tightly woven \nfibers of bulletproof vests and, upon impact with human tissue, \npurportedly disintegrates much more rapidly than a conventional bullet, \ncausing massive damage.\n  Mr. President, Federal law currently outlaws cop-killer bullets based \non the physical description of the bullet. For example, under the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Federal law \ncurrently bans cop-killing ammunition that is: constructed from one or \na combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium \ncopper or depleted uranium; or is larger than .22 caliber with a jacket \nthat weighs no more than 25 percent of the total weight of the bullet. \nThe Black Rhino bullet is allegedly made of ground powdered plastic and \ncoated with a plastic polymer. Based on its alleged physical \ncharacteristics, this bullet would evade the Federal ban.\n  Mr. President, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] has \nnot tested the Black Rhino bullet; thus, I am not sure that this \nammunition can do what the manufacturer claims. Indeed, ATF has not \neven been given sample ammunition to test. Therefore, I am not certain \nthat this ammunition even exists. However, even if these bullets do not \nperform as advertised, it is clear that with the downsizing of the \nmilitary and the resulting application by the defense industry of \nmilitary defense technology for use in the private sector, it is only a \nmatter of time before ammunition that can pierce body armor will be \ndeveloped utilizing construction material that does not fall within the \ncurrent Federal ban.\n  Mr. President, every year about 60 sworn police officers are shot to \ndeath in the line of duty. By industry estimates, body armor has saved \nover 500 officers from death or serious injury by firearm assaults. \nMost police officers serving large jurisdictions report they have armor \nand wear it at all times when on duty. Mr. President, because body \narmor saves lives, the\n development of armor-piercing bullets that sidestep the Federal ban--\nwhether it be the Black Rhino bullet or any other bullet employing \nhigh-technology material--will serve one purpose and one purpose only--\nto put the lives of American citizens and those in blue sworn to defend \nAmerican citizens in jeopardy.\n\n  As a result, Mr. President, I introduce this bill which will \nestablish a performance standard such that any ammunition that is \ndesigned to penetrate body armor will be banned irrespective of its \nphysical characteristics. The bill specifically directs the Department \nof the Treasury and the Justice Department to promulgate a uniform \nperformance standard for testing a bullet's capacity to pierce armor \nwithin 1 year of the enactment of the bill. The manufacture, \nimportation, and sale of any ammunition that fails to pass the \nperformance standard to be promulgated will be banned.\n  Mr. President, cop-killing ammunition that has no purpose other than \npenetrating bulletproof vests has no place in our society. At a time \nwhen gun violence is becoming a national epidemic, the last thing we \nneed is ammunition expressly designed to terrorize our police and \ninstill fear in neighborhoods across New Jersey and this country. I \ntherefore introduce this legislation to ensure that the 24,000 annual \ndeaths attributable to handgun use do not senselessly increase.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                          [[Page S800]] S. 200\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to close the Lorton Correctional Complex, to prohibit \nthe incarceration of individuals convicted of felonies under the laws \nof the District of Columbia in facilities of the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Corrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n            lorton correctional complex closure legislation\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague \nSenator Robb in introducing legislation that will address the problems \nthat exist at the Lorton Correctional Complex.\n  Lorton Correctional Complex is an outdated, deteriorating, \noverpopulated, and undermanaged facility.\n  For years, I and others have worked to provide funds to build a \nprison within the District of Columbia so it could house its own \nprisoners. Our efforts have been blocked in the District of Columbia \nand our efforts to enhance safety and curb illegal drugs and guns at \nLorton have been to no avail.\n  Every day, the local newspapers are filled with appalling reports of \nviolence and drug use among the inmates and the place has been called a \ngraduate school for drug merchants. Lorton's problems may not be unique \namong Federal prisons, but surely they are among the worst.\n  There is no option but to close Lorton.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would relocate 7,300 \nprisoners presently incarcerated at Lorton to other Federal facilities \nover a 5-year period. Once the legislation is passed, all new District \nof Columbia felons will be immediately incarcerated in Bureau of \nPrisons facilities. The District of Columbia Department of Corrections \nwill still have responsibility for juveniles, misdemeanants, and pre-\ntrial detainees.\n  A second important provision of the legislation is the establishment \nof a commission to be known as the Commission on Closure of the Lorton \nCorrectional Complex. The commission will be comprised of locally \nappointed representatives to help devise a plan for the closure of \nLorton. The involvement of the local community is essential in \nestablishing a transition that ensures that local residents will have \nall their concerns heard.\n  I have been informed by a representative of the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons that at this time the Bureau is not taking a position on the \nlegislation. The 7,300 prisoners at Lorton will be a stress on the \nFederal prison system. Sixty percent of the prisoners at Lorton will \nrequire being transferred to a maximum security prison. Also, several \nnew prisons will need to be constructed to house the prisoners along \nwith the additional personnel needed to operate and maintain the \nprisons.\n  It is in the interest of Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government to \ncooperate in resolving the problems at Lorton Prison. As partners, \ncontributing to the reform of this system, these goals can be \naccomplished.\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Warner \nin introducing the Lorton Correctional Complex Closure Act. This \nlegislation provides a vital solution to the problem associated with \nthe Lorton Correctional Complex, located in Virginia.\n  Originally, Lorton was designed as a workcamp and dormitory for \nmisdemeanants and drunkards. Today, Lorton's facilities are outmoded \nand overburdened. The same dormitories which were designed to hold \nnonviolent, minimum security prisoners now house D.C.'s most dangerous \nfelons. In its strapped fiscal state, the District is ill-equipped to \nimprove the facility at Lorton.\n  Part one of our proposal will direct new D.C. felons into Federal \ncorrection facilities, providing an immediate remedy for increased \novercrowding. Then, within 5 years, all remaining felons at Lorton will \nbe turned over to the control of the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons, enabling final closure of the facility. The D.C. Department of \nCorrections will retain responsibility for juveniles, misdemeanants, \nand pre-trial detainees.\n  Part two of the bill sets up a commission of locally appointed \nrepresentatives from the District of Columbia, Fairfax County and \nPrince William County to help devise a plan for closure of the \nfacility, disposal of the property, and future land use. This creates a \nprocess that maximizes community involvement, input and participation \nin inherently local decisions.\n  Under this plan, northern Virginians will have safer communities and \nwill be able to participate in the development of future land use \nproposals for the affected area.\n  Since the land is owned by the Federal Government and the facility is \noperated by the District, local officials and residents in northern \nVirginia have had limited means of impacting the decisions relative to \nLorton. That's why I included a provision giving local residents and \nofficials a voice in expansion proposals during last year's crime bill. \nBut limiting expansion just isn't enough--I've come to the conclusion \nthat the Federal Government must accept its responsibility and devise a \nlongterm solution.\n  We have before us an honest and open attempt to provide a vital \nremedy for the longstanding problems at Lorton. Closing this facility \nwill not be easy--but I look forward to working with the Virginia \ndelegation and the District to develop a reasonable and sound solution \nto the problems posed by the Lorton facility in its present condition. \nI urge quick consideration and passage of this measure.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 203. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nincrease the Federal minimum wage, to establish a Commission to conduct \na study on the indexation of the Federal minimum wage, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                  american family fair minimum wage act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, much has been said and written about the \ndecline in real wages suffered by the majority of working Americans, \nthe troubling rise in income equality, and the emergence of what \nSecretary of Labor Reich has so aptly described as ``the anxious \nclass.''\n  Today, I am introducing legislation which is an important part of the \ninitiatives we must undertake if we are serious about addressing these \nproblems--legislation to increase the Federal minimum wage.\n  The minimum wage should be a living wage. That principle served this \nNation well for more than 40 years. From the enactment of the first \nFederal minimum wage law in 1938 through the end of the 1970's, \nCongress addressed the issue six times. And six times bipartisan \nmajorities--with the \n[[Page S801]] support of both Republican and Democratic Presidents--\nreaffirmed the nation's commitment to a fair level of the minimum wage \nfor America's workers.\n  But in the 1980's, that commitment was abandoned. From 1981 through \n1989, the minimum wage was allowed to fall, in real terms, to the \nlowest value in its 50-year history. The modest increases enacted in \n1989--which brought the minimum wage up from $3.35 to $3.80 in 1990 and \nto $4.25 in 1991, provided some measure of relief to low-wage workers. \nBut those increases restored only about half of the purchasing power \nlost during the 1980's\n  It is unacceptable in this country today that a person who works \nfull-time, year round at the minimum wage--even with the expanded \nearned income tax credit--does not earn enough to bring a family of \nthree above the poverty line. Despite the increases that went into \neffect in 1990 and 1991, the current minimum wage is still a poverty \nwage. At $4.25 an hour, a person working 40 hours a week at the minimum \nwage earns just $170 a week--before taxes and Social Security are \ndeducted.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will raise the minimum wage by \n50 cents a year over the next 3 years--to $4.75 this year, $5.25 in \n1996, and $5.75 in 1997.\n  The first 50-cent increase will merely restore the minimum wage, in \nreal terms, to the value it had in 1991 when the last increase went \ninto effect. In the past 4 years the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage has already declined to the point that a 50-cent increase is \nneeded just to recover the ground lost since 1991.\n  The second 50-cent increase, in 1996, will bring the minimum wage, in \nreal terms, up to the level where Congress sought to put it in the \nlegislation passed by both Houses of Congress which President Bush \nvetoed in 1989.\n  The third 50-cent increase will put the wage, in real terms, within \nreach of what ought to be our ultimate goal--to restore the minimum \nwage to a level roughly equal to half the average hourly wage, the \nlevel that prevailed for decades until the 1980's when it was allowed \nto drastically decline.\n  Finally, the legislation I am introducing creates a Commission to \nstudy and make recommendations on two important issues: First, the best \nmeans by which we can achieve the goal of restoring the minimum wage to \nits historic level, and second, the best means by which we can provide \nregular, periodic adjustments to the wage, in order to avoid long \nperiods of stagnation such as occurred during the 1980's.\n  As we begin this effort to increase the minimum wage, it is likely \nthat we will be confronted by opponents with the same sky-is-falling \npredictions of job loss and damage to the economy that have been made \nevery time the minimum wage has been increased since 1938. The textbook \neconomic theory that increases in the minimum wage necessarily result \nin job losses has never had solid empirical support. Recent studies by \nleading economists who examined the results of the most recent \nincreases in both State and Federal minimum wages have shown the theory \nto be at odds with reality.\n  Economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan Krueger and \nDavid Card of Princeton University studied the impact of those \nincreases on employment. According to their findings, those increases \ndid not have the negative employment effects predicted by opponents. In \nfact, their findings included evidence indicating a positive impact on \nemployment.\n  A survey designed to measure the effects of the recent increase in \nthe New Jersey minimum wage to $5.05 found that employment in New \nJersey if anything actually expanded with the rise in the minimum wage, \nand similar results were found in a studies conducted in Texas and \nCalifornia.\n  Krueger and Card's analysis of the impact of the 1990 and 1991 \nincreases in the Federal minimum wage also found that those increases \ndid not adversely affect teenage employment, and that increases in the \nminimum wage were not offset by reductions in fringe benefits.\n  The increases proposed in this bill will bring long overdue help to \nmillions of workers in America. I urge my colleagues to sponsor this \nlegislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I just wanted to acknowledge the \nwork of Senator Kennedy in crafting this important legislation which we \nare introducing today to increase the Federal minimum wage.\n  I had introduced a similar bill in the last Congress, which would \nhave increased the minimum wage even further than is provided for in \nthis bill, and have been a long-time supporter of making sure that low-\nincome people are paid a decent and just minimum wage. I may be \nreintroducing that bill later this year, because in addition to a \nhigher target wage, it also provided for indexing of the Federal \nminimum wage--a key element of any minimum wage increase legislation, \nin my view.\n  This measure provides for modest, incremental increases over 3 years \nin the Federal minimum wage, and then for a study to be ready at the \nend of the third year to address other key issues like indexation. I am \ndelighted to join as an original cosponsor of this measure.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 204. A bill to provide for a reform of the public buildings \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                      FEDERAL BUILDINGS REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to reform the \nway the Federal Government builds. Ever since my election to Congress, \nI have attempted to improve our unwieldy and often wasteful public \nbuilding program. I do so again this Congress. Building appropriately \nand well is as fundamental a sign of the competence \n[[Page S802]] of government as will be found. Recently, however, we \nhave chosen increasingly to rent, avoiding the up-front costs of \nbuildings and the hard decisions requisite in their construction.\n  The result is that now we house over 40 percent of the Government in \nleased space. Not temporary space. Eternal space. And the cost? Now, \n$2.2 billion a year and rising. There will be nothing to show for this \nmoney when the lease is up, only the prospect of another lease.\n  The point is that we can no longer afford to sidestep the problem by \nrenting; we must face up to the task of building. And to do this, we \nmust reform our public building program. We must plan out rationally \njust what buildings we need, we must build them in the right place, we \nmust build them at the right time, we must build them to the degree of \npermanence appropriate to their mission, and finally, we must build \nthem for a fair price. We are not really that distant from the time it \nfell to me as a young member of the Kennedy administration to draw up \nthe ``Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture,'' which President \nKennedy put forth on June 1, 1962. But in our time the fear of taxpayer \nresentment of the cost of public buildings has been compounded with an \nalmost ideological alarm at the implications of building itself.\n  Building, however, is still cheaper than renting. We are deceiving \nthe taxpayer to say otherwise. Recently, the GSA came to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee asking for 11th-hour approval of \nan office space lease at a yearly cost of $21 million. To build would \nhave cost $70-$100 million. This, however, was a lease in name only, \ncast as such to avoid up-front scoring for the budget. The building had \nyet to be designed, the GSA had not fully planned the space, and yet \nthey were asking approval for an expenditure over the term of the lease \nof $420 million. Several times the cost of building and nothing to show \nfor it after 20 years but a file full of rental receipts.\n  Nevertheless, the decision to stop hiding behind leases is beyond the \nscope of the legislation I introduce today, which aims simply to ensure \nthat what is built is built responsibly and worthy of the Nation. \nBuilding or leasing is the larger question, and it remains to be seen \nwhether this Congress will accept the responsibility or, as is so often \nthe case, put off resolution to the end of a 20-year lease term, when \nfew, if any of us, will be here still.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 205. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to revise and \nexpand the prohibition on accrual of pay and allowances by members of \nthe Armed Forces who are confined pending dishonorable discharge; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE PAY OF DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED MEMBERS OF \n                            THE ARMED FORCES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I were to tell you that the \nPentagon pays full salary to convicted child molesters, rapists, and \nmurderers, you would probably think I was making it up. But I'm not.\n  Each month, the Pentagon pays the salaries of military personnel \nconvicted of the most heinous crimes, while their cases are appealed \nthrough the military court system--a process than often takes years. \nDuring that time, these violent criminals can sit back in prison, read \nthe Wall Street Journal, invest wisely, and watch their taxpayer-funded \nnest eggs grow. While in prison, many military criminals even get cost \nof living raises.\n  I cannot think of a more reprehensible way to spend taxpayer dollars. \nNo explanation could ever make me understand how the military could \nreward rapists, murders, and child molesters--the lowest of the low--\nwith the hard-earned tax dollars of law-abiding citizens. This policy \nthumbs its nose at taxpayers, slaps the faces of crime victims, and is \none of the worst examples of Government waste I have seen in my 20 \nyears of public service.\n  Congress must act now to end this practice. According to data \nprovided by the Defense Finance Accounting Service and first published \nin the Dayton Daily News, the Department of Defense spent more than $1 \nmillion on the salaries of 680 convicts in the month of June, 1994, \nalone. In that month, the Pentagon paid the salaries of 58 rapists, 164 \nchild molesters, and 7 murders, among others.\n  The individual stories of military criminals continuing to receive \nfull pay are shocking. In California, A marine lance corporal who beat \nhis 13-month-old daughter to death almost 2 years ago still receives \n$1,105 each month--about $25,000 since his conviction. He spends his \ndays in the brig at Camp Pendleton, doesn't pay a dime of child \nsupport.\n  I spoke with the murdered child's grandmother who now has custody of \na surviving 4-year-old grandson. She is a resident of northern \nCalifornia. She was outraged to learn that the murderer of her \ngrandchild still receives full pay. ``No wonder the Government is out \nof money,'' she told me.\n  Another Air Force sergeant who tried to kill his wife with a kitchen \nknife continues to receive full pay while serving time at Fort \nLeavenworth. He told the Dayton Daily News, ``I follow the stock \nmarket; I buy Double E bonds.''\n  And believe it or not, Francisco Duran, who was arrested last October \nafter firing 27 shots at the White House was paid by the military while \nin prison after being convicted of aggravated assault. According to DOD \nrecords, Duran was paid $17,537 after his conviction for deliberately \ndriving his car into a crowd of people outside a Hawaii bowling alley \nin 1990. Some of that money may well have paid for the weapon he used \nto shoot at the White House.\n  This policy is crazy, and it has got to stop.\n  At a time when the Republican Contract With America calls for more \ndollars for the Pentagon, let's not go back to the days of throwing \nmoney at the military as long as this kind of wasteful spending \ncontinues.\n  This legislation will immediately halt pay to all military personnel \nwho have been sentenced to confinement and dishonorable discharge.\n  This legislation will save the taxpayers money--millions of dollars \neach year. It will put an end to this egregious waste of taxpayer \ndollars, and it will treat military criminals as they deserve to be \ntreated--as criminals--to be punished, not rewarded.\n  It is my hope that this legislation can be acted upon quickly. I have \ndiscussed this matter with Edwin Dorn, Undersecretary of Defense for \nPersonnel and Readiness, and he agreed that we must correct the \nDepartment's obviously flawed policy.\n  I received a copy of a memorandum from Secretary Dorn today advising \nme that he has convened an internal working group on this issue, and I \ntrust that we can work cooperatively to end this outrageous practice \nimmediately. We must not drag out the process while criminals continue \nto reap unjust rewards.\n  There is no need to take a long time to study this issue. We know the \nproblem, and this legislation offers a workable solution.\n  I will soon discuss the issue with Senator Thurmond and Senator Nunn \nand I trust that they will agree that this legislation deserves to move \nforward.\n  In the course of my investigation into this issue, I have learned of \nseveral other aspects of the military justice system that merit further \ninvestigation. For example, the military has no system in place for \nproviding restitution or other needed compensation to victims or to \nfamilies of military criminals. These are important problems and I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues and the Department to find the best \nsolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two news articles discussing this issue \nbe inserted in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress Assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Duran was on the U.S. Army's payroll\n       Not as a soldier, but as a prison inmate.\n       On Aug. 9, 1990, Duran deliberately drove his red Nissan \n     sedan into a crowd of people who had chased the drunken \n     soldier from the bowling alley at Schofield Barracks on Oahu \n     in Hawaii.\n       Cecilia Ululani Ufano, 49, was tossed in the air and \n     fractured her skull when she landed.\n       Duran was convicted of aggravated assault on Feb. 15, 1991, \n     and sentenced to five years in prison, but the military kept \n     paying him until June 1992. In all, he earned, $17,537 after \n     his conviction.\n       A military court had ordered his pay to stop, but Duran \n     wrote to a commander hearing his appeal, pleading for a \n     paycheck to help his family.\n       ``Rent is outrageous in Hawaii * * *,'' he wrote. ``We \n     still owe on our car.''\n       The commander allowed Duran to keep some of his pay.\n       His five-year sentence would have kept him in prison until \n     1995, but a commander suspended all but 42 months of his \n     sentence.\n       By Sept. 3, 1993, he had been discharged from the service \n     and released from prison early for good behavior.\n       Last month, Duran, 26, was charged with trying to \n     assassinate President Clinton. He faces life in prison if \n     convicted.\n       He was arrested Oct. 29 after he, allegedly fired 27 rounds \n     from a semiautomatic rifle at the White House. Authorities \n     reportedly recovered from his truck a map with the words \n     ``Kill the (prez)'' written on it.\n       While the Army paid Duran, it gave Ufano nothing. Insurance \n     didn't pay all of her medical bills.\n       ``I'm angry about it,'' she said during a telephone \n     interview. ``I'm still under medication. * * * I can't smell, \n     and it's been four years.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Dayton Daily News, Dec. 18, 1994]\n\n  Cashing In Behind Bars--U.S. Military Believes in Paying Soldiers, \n                       Sailors It Sends to Prison\n\n                (By Russell Carollo and Cheryl L. Reed)\n\n       Andre D. Carter choked and raped a cocktail waitress in his \n     Colorado Springs apartment. He went to prison but still was \n     paid $20,788.\n       James R. Lee sodomized three teen-age boys in Illinois, and \n     he was paid even more: $85,997.\n       Rodney G. Templeton molested a 4-year-old girl in the \n     basement of a Dayton church, where the two had gone to hang \n     choir robes. He was paid $148,616.\n       Carter, Lee and Templeton were paid by U.S. taxpayers.\n       They didn't work for the money.\n       They didn't need to. They committed their crimes while \n     members of the U.S. armed forces.\n       They are among hundreds of murderers, rapists, child \n     molesters and other criminals paid by the armed services long \n     after being locked away.\n       A Dayton Daily News examination of payments to military \n     convicts found that in just one month, June, the military \n     spent more than $1 million in pay and benefits to more than \n     665 prisoners in military jails and prisons. Some even got \n     pay raises behind bars.\n       Most of Congress was unaware the military paid prisoners. \n     Even the military had no idea exactly how much it paid, but \n     the newspaper calculated payments by using military computer \n     records.\n       ``Any type of pay to convicted criminals is wrong,'' said \n     District Attorney John Wampler of Altus, Okla., after \n     learning a service member from his area was paid despite a \n     1992 involuntary manslaughter conviction. ``It offends me \n     that the federal government would compensate the person after \n     they've been sent to prison.''\n       Had Carter, Lee or Templeton worked for nearly any other \n     public or private employer, they would have been fired and \n     lost their salaries. But the U.S. military, supporting a \n     tradition dating to the old West, believes if it sends \n     soldiers or sailors to prison it should, in many cases, pay \n     them.\n       Their victims aren't so lucky. Several were left without a \n     dime to pay medical expenses, while their attackers got \n     paychecks to pay bills, start a business or even buy stocks.\n       While the military kept paying Carter, the waitress's boss \n     cut off her pay because she could not muster the courage to \n     return to her job, where she met Carter.\n       ``No, they shouldn't get paid, but what can you do about \n     it?'' she said, adding that she has yet to see a counselor.\n       Ret. Gen David Brahms, former chief military attorney for \n     the Marine Corps and technical adviser for the movie, A Few \n     Good Men, said victims should get something.\n       ``Unfortunately, that isn't the way it is now,'' Brahms \n     said. ``Maybe the Congress should address that question.''\n\n\n                            behind the walls\n\n       At the military maximum-security prison at Fort \n     Leavenworth, Kan., 405 prisoners, or 30 percent of the prison \n     population, were allowed by military courts to keep their pay \n     up to several years.\n       Besides the pay, the military gave to the dependents of \n     those inmates, and to the dependents of others throughout the \n     country, free medical coverage and 20-30 percent discounts at \n     base stores.\n       Those who got checks included 164 child molesters and child \n     rapists, 58 other rapists, 11 convicted of attempted murder \n     and seven convicted murderers.\n       They include people such as Air Force Sgt. Rossel Jones.\n       Jones chased his wife around their apartment at Holloman \n     Air Force Base, N.M., with a knife, stabbing her several \n     times as she warded off the swinging blade with her hands.\n       ``That's how my fingers and hands were cut,'' Deborah Jones \n     told an Air Force investigator the day after the Oct. 7, \n     1991, attack. ``When Rossel stabbed me in the neck, I managed \n     to bend the knife and take it away.\n       ``. .  I fell down and passed out. When I awoke, Rossel was \n     hitting me in the head and body with a table leg.''\n       Jones was convicted nearly three years ago, but the Air \n     Force still pays him $1,152.90 a month.\n       From inside the prison, Jones watches his government pay \n     grow.\n       ``I follow the stock market,'' said Jones, who reads stock \n     and mutual fund listings in the Wall Street Journal and USA \n     Today. ``I buy Double E Bonds.''\n\n\n                       a system from the old west\n\n       Paying convicted criminals is just one of the many \n     anomalies in the military justice system.\n       At a court-martial, the military's version of a trial, a \n     defendant is not judged by peers; he's judged by superiors, \n     mostly officers.\n       Panel members don't elect a foreman; it's the highest-\n     ranking officer.\n       And just about every step in the justice process is subject \n     to approval of the defendant's commanding officer, who often \n     is not a lawyer.\n       No one knows exactly how long the military has paid \n     criminals.\n       Col. Charles Trant, a military law historian and the Army's \n     chief criminal attorney, said the first formal summary of the \n     policy was written in 1880. Soldiers served in remote \n     outposts and when they were sent to jail, their families \n     needed money to return home and resettle.\n       ``The rationale is the same one we use today,'' said Trant, \n     who conceded the practice is outdated. ``It was quite a \n     different Army then.''\n       Generally, civilians, even ones working for the government, \n     lose their jobs when they cannot report to work. Some lose \n     their pay even without an arrest.\n       ``That's one of the starkest differences between the \n     military and civilian systems: We tend to treat them more \n     generously,'' Trant said.\n       On Aug. 16, Dayton police officer Danial Bell was suspended \n     without pay--even though not arrested or charged--when a \n     urine test detected cocaine in his system after he struck and \n     killed a pedestrian.\n       Most state and federal benefits, so-called entitlements, \n     are cut to people in prison. The federal government cuts the \n     bulk of a defendant's Social Security benefits at conviction. \n     It even cuts off workers compensation to federal employees \n     convicted of felony crimes.\n       The military cuts off pay, too, when an employee is jailed \n     by civilian authorities.\n       When Colorado Springs police arrested Carter for rape and \n     held him pending action by military authorities, the Army \n     stopped his pay.\n       But after Carter was transferred to an Army jail, his pay \n     started again, as if he were back on duty.\n       Not all governments pay their military prisoners. With rare \n     exception, the Canadian military stops checks the moment a \n     soldier is arrested by anyone. If a soldier's family requests \n     help, the military will only give them as much as they could \n     receive from government welfare.\n       ``This rule would apply even if they haven't been tried,'' \n     said Maj. Ric Jones, \n     [[Page S804]] spokesman at Canadian Defence Headquarters in \n     Ottawa.\n\n\n                         a check for every cell\n\n       On Nov. 9, 1991, a mother told military police at Wright-\n     Patterson Air Force Base that Sgt. 1st Class Claudio Smith-\n     Esminez molested her 7-year-old daughter several times while \n     baby-sitting.\n       The military's investigation took 20 months, during which \n     time Smith-Esminez earned his full pay of about $2,000 a \n     month, plus housing and food allowances.\n       ``We had all these pre-trial meetings. She had to keep \n     talking about it,'' said the girl's mother, who lives in \n     Dayton.\n       On July 12, 1993, Smith-Esminez was convicted of molesting \n     the girl four times, and his rank was reduced to the lowest \n     in the military, E-1, with a salary of about half of what he \n     was earning.\n       Still, Smith-Esminez got all his pay because military \n     convicts receive full pay until their first appeals are \n     decided by commanders. Smith-Esminez first appeal wasn't \n     decided until March 1994, eight months after his conviction \n     and 28 months after authorities began their investigation.\n       Of the 367 inmates arriving at Leavenworth during the past \n     12 months, 270, or 73.6 percent, were awaiting decisions by \n     commanders on their first appeals.\n       Even the military is questioning the practice. A Pentagon \n     spokesman, Lt. Col. Doug Hart, confirmed that the military is \n     studying whether to stop pay at conviction, but he offered no \n     details.\n       ``At this point, we really don't have anybody who is \n     willing to be interviewed on the subject.'' Hart said.\n                      convicts get paid for years\n\n       Smith-Esminez's pay didn't stop after his first appeal.\n       In fact, Leavenworth records show he could get paid until \n     Dec. 14, 1995, when his enlistment expires.\n       In the military, whether people are paid after first \n     appeals is determined by their sentences. The court can order \n     that some, all or none of the prisoners' pay be cut.\n       The court cut Smith-Esminez's rank, but it didn't take away \n     any of his pay, so he continues to receive more than $800 a \n     month, the amount entitled to him under his new, lower rank.\n       Inmates can have their paychecks sent to the bank or \n     address of their choice.\n       Enlisted service members can be paid a few days to several \n     years after conviction, either until their enlistment dates \n     expire or their final appeals and discharges are decided, \n     whichever occurs first.\n       Officers get paid even longer, until the secretary of their \n     service discharges them after their final appeals.\n\n\n                         severity not a factor\n\n       The severity of the crime--with the exception of murder--\n     seemed to matter little in determining who got paid.\n       Army Lt. Timothy L. Jenkins lost all his pay and was fined \n     $15,000 at a court-martial at Leighton Barracks, Germany, \n     last year. His crime: writing thousands of dollars worth of \n     bad checks.\n       Senior Airman Samuel J. Carter sold drugs and was picked up \n     for attempted theft. At a court-martial at Bergstrom Air \n     Force Base, Texas, he lost all his pay, too.\n       Col. Lee, however, kept his pay, despite a conviction last \n     fall for seven counts of sodomy and 21 counts of indecent \n     acts with teen-age boys from Illinois. More than a year after \n     his conviction, Lee still receives $6,618.30 a month, more \n     than what 98 percent of all Ohio families earned in 1990.\n       Sgt. Edward Higgins kept his pay, too.\n       He was convicted in 1992 of five counts of molesting young \n     women who came to his Air Force recruiting office in \n     Youngstown, Ohio.\n       ``He asked me if I had been checked for scoliosis,'' an 18-\n     year-old woman told a military court in 1992. ``. . . He told \n     me to drop my pants three-to-four inches below from where \n     they were from my waist and bend over and pull up my shirt.''\n       Higgins told another 18-year-old to take off her jump suit, \n     and then he ran ``his hand up and down her back from her neck \n     to her buttocks,'' the woman told military authorities.\n       ``He said he had to get a measurement of my body fat,'' the \n     woman said during an interview. ``We all felt so stupid \n     because we fell for this guy.\n       ``Why should he get paid? . . . That's ridiculous. I can't \n     believe it.''\n       Since he was convicted and sentenced to four years in \n     prison, Higgins has earned $25,499 pay from the Air Force.\n                             Family matters\n\n       In his appeal for pay and a light sentence, Higgins' \n     attorney asked the court to consider ``his family, his wife, \n     his three young children . . . all the Saturdays that his \n     boys wouldn't be able to go to McDonald's for this special \n     time with their father.''\n       The prosecutor made a different plea. ``While he's in jail, \n     he shouldn't be paid. He's no longer a productive member of \n     the Air Force . . . It's not the Air Force's responsibility \n     to take care of his family.\n       ``It was Sgt. Higgins' responsibility. And when he decided \n     to do what he did over that period of time, he reneged on \n     that responsibility.''\n       The court sided with Higgins.\n       The Dayton Daily News examined dozens of court-martial \n     files and found that in every case defendants who received \n     pay had families.\n       Although jurors award pay based on family needs, they're \n     not supposed to.\n       ``There's nothing in the Code of Military Justice that \n     allows that,'' said Nelson, who is now administrator of North \n     Dakota's court systems.\n       Paying any convicted criminal regardless of the reason, is \n     a questionable practice, said Nelson, a military attorney for \n     33 years. ``In crime, one is accountable for their own \n     acts.''\n       Civilian families often get nothing when loved ones go to \n     prison.\n       Mark Putnam went to prison in 1990 for strangling an \n     informant in Kentucky while working for the FBI. His family \n     was forced to ask for welfare.\n       ``You can't expect the FBI to pay benefits to me and my \n     children because my husband committed a crime,'' said \n     Putnam's wife, Kathleen, who now lives in Connecticut. ``I \n     can't see how anyone should pay him when my husband committed \n     a crime.''\n\n\n                            Little oversight\n\n       Although the military often pays its inmates to help their \n     families, it often can't ensure the families get the money or \n     need it.\n       At Sgt. Terry H. Cox's trial at Ellsworth Air Force Base, \n     S.D., last year, the 7-year-old girl he raped stood in front \n     of a jury of adults wearing uniforms and pointed to the part \n     of her body Cox touched.\n       ``Right here,'' the girl said.\n       The testimony was enough to help convict Cox of nine \n     separate acts of rape, sodomy and other indecent acts on the \n     girl, but it wasn't enough to stop his pay.\n       The military decided to keep paying Cox after he asked the \n     court: ``Please help me put a stop to my family's suffering \n     and mine.''\n       Three months after his March 1993 conviction, Cox still had \n     not given his wife written permission to pick up his check. \n     Although he received more than $1,700 a month, he didn't send \n     regular support payments to her.\n       The military also often doesn't verify a family needs the \n     money before granting pay.\n       Unlike in civilian courts, sentencing begins immediately \n     after conviction in courts-martial, leaving little time for \n     the prosecutors to verify a defendant's claim of needing \n     money to support his family.\n       ``The government virtually never goes back and tries to \n     rebut that,'' said Col. Trant, who spent 6\\1/2\\ years as an \n     Army judge before becoming the service's chief criminal \n     attorney.\n       Even though his wife earned $17,000 a year and even though \n     his family had four cars, two boats, a motorcycle and lived \n     in a $110,000 home, the military paid Lt. Col. Templeton.\n       Templeton, who helped oversee a $28-billion weapons program \n     at Wright-Patterson, pleaded guilty in March 1992 to 10 acts \n     of child molestation involving girls, including the Dayton \n     child.\n       In his plea for clemency, Templeton asked the court to \n     consider his family's financial needs. Since he confessed \n     three years ago, Templeton has earned $148,616 and he still \n     gets $4,739.40 a month, which includes a pay raise of $102 a \n     month he received in January. His family is supposed to get \n     about $1,800 of it for support.\n       The Canadian military stops pay to people like Templeton.\n       In Canada, an ``assisting officer'' ensures the family \n     needs money. The family's need and other sources of income \n     also are investigated by provincial welfare officials, who \n     recommended an amount the military should pay.\n       ``So if you're not entitled to anything under the welfare \n     system. . . .you're not entitled to anything under our system \n     either,'' said Maj. Jones, the Canadian military spokesman.\n                          paying for mistakes\n\n       Even when a military court is so outraged by a crime that \n     it cuts all pay, even when the convict has no living relative \n     to support, a service member still can earn his full military \n     paycheck for years.\n       The military didn't want Army Sgt. Ronald Webster to get \n     paid, but he got his money anyway. In 1982, Webster was \n     convicted of rape, burglary, assault, resisting arrest and 10 \n     other charges involving an attack on a fellow soldier in her \n     barracks at Fort Story, Va.\n       He was sentenced to lose his pay, $965.70 a month, but four \n     years after his conviction, Webster said, the military found \n     an error in his case.\n       The error did not earn Webster a new trail, or prove his \n     innocence, but it did earn him the right to resubmit his case \n     for clemency. So the military, he said, paid him four years \n     of back pay.\n       ``I think it was about $38,000 to $40,000 after taxes,'' \n     said Webster, who was released from Leavenworth Nov. 18 and \n     now lives in Cincinnati.\n       Military members who win certain types of appeals, even \n     years after trails, can receive full back pay for the time it \n     took to appeal the case.\n       If a defense attorney can't find a reason to appeal a case, \n     lawyers working for the highest court for military appeals \n     will try to find one for them. Unlike other civilian appeals \n     courts in the country, the military's highest appeals court \n     pays lawyers to search cases for legal errors, even when \n     appeals are not filed.\n       And in case both a defense attorney and the appeals court \n     can't find errors, convicts at Leavenworth can search for \n     themselves, using the prison's 6,000-volume law library.\n       [[Page S805]] ``Lawyers have told us we have a better \n     library than they have in their offices,'' Army spokesman \n     Staff Sgt. Alvah Cappel said as he showed off the prison's \n     facilities during a tour this fall.\n       Webster said he invested some of the money he won in his \n     case.\n       ``I think I had $5,000 in stocks. You can invest in \n     anything you want (in prison). You just can't form a business \n     in there.\n       ``All you do is get a broker. You stay in contact with your \n     broker and do it over the phone. They accept collect calls.''\n       He also used the money to start a demolition company in \n     Cincinnati.\n       ``I think I deserve the money,'' Webster said. ``That's the \n     way the system works. They've been doing it for years. It's a \n     whole different kind of system.''\n       Below is a breakdown of military prisoners receiving \n     government paychecks in June.

A bill to require that any proposed amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to require a balanced budget \nestablish procedures to ensure enforcement before the amendment is \nsubmitted to the States; to the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, jointly.\n\n\n                           right to know act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have the honor of introducing today on \nbehalf of Senator Exon, the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, and other Democratic Senators, the Right to Know Act.\n  The proposal is straightforward. It demands that American taxpayers \nknow what the impact of a constitutional balanced budget amendment will \nbe before State legislatures vote on ratification of the constitutional \namendment. It also ensures that we take immediate steps to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002--the express goal of the constitutional \namendment.\n  Our proposal says that, upon passage of a balanced budget amendment \nby Congress but before States must ratify, we would give States and the \nAmerican people the information they need to make this important \ndecision. Second, under our approach, the actual deficit reduction \nrequired to balance the budget would begin immediately.\n  No State would be required to vote on the amendment until Congress \npasses a concurrent budget resolution committing to actual deficit \nreduction and outlining, through reconciliation instructions to \ncommittees, how the budget would be balanced by the year 2002.\n  It is critically important that Americans understand that passing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget does not reduce the \nnational debt by one penny. Nor does passage of a balanced budget \namendment provide the slightest detail of how the budget could or \nshould be balanced. Only if Congress acts on legislation that \naccomplishes a balanced budget will the precise ramifications be known.\n  We simply cannot afford to wait until 2001 to start complying with \nthe balanced budget amendment. By doing so, we will be adding a far \ngreater burden to our national debt, which already has reached nearly \n$4.7 trillion. Even if we pledge our commitment to continued deficit \nreduction today, we will still need about $1.2 trillion of cuts over \nthe next 7 years to balance the budget by the year 2002. Failure to \nmake these cuts will simply add to the $4.7 trillion debt.\n  If we delay even 1 year, the national debt will increase by over $150 \nbillion as a result of that delay, and the interest on the debt will be \napproximately $50 billion greater. Each year we delay adds another \nenormous sum of our already-astronomical national debt, and increases \nthe percentage of our budget that must be dedicated to servicing that \ndebt.\n  In the last congress, we passed a deficit reduction package that will \nreduce the budget deficit by nearly $500 billion. Given the magnitude \nof our existing debt, it would be irresponsible and profoundly \nillogical not to continue striving toward a balanced budget this year, \nnot next year or the year after.\n  Mr. President, senators on both sides of the aisle are divided on the \nissue of a constitutional balanced budget amendment. We all want to \nbring budget deficits under control, but reasonable people disagree on \nthe way to accomplish that goal, both in terms of budget priorities and \nin terms of the proposal to amend the Constitution.\n  The Right to Know Act offers an approach that senators on both sides \nof the constitutional amendment issue and on both sides of the aisle \ncould--indeed should--support.\n  Senators who support a constitutional amendment to require a balanced \nbudget--and I am one--should know that this proposal is wholly \nconsistent with that position. In fact, if we are serious about \nbalancing the budget, we must be prepared to work with our colleagues \nto ensure that the deficit reduction resumes immediately. We also must \nbe prepared to explain to the American people and the States exactly \nhow we are going to achieve our goal.\n  Senators who may oppose a constitutional amendment, but who believe \nwe need to take serious steps toward deficit reduction and an actual \nbalanced budget, should also find this proposal wholly consistent with \nthat position. The Right to Know Act simply ensures that the balanced \nbudget amendment, if it passes, will not become a gimmick or a hollow \npromise.\n  I strongly urge all of my colleagues, regardless of their position on \nthe underlying balanced budget amendment issue, to study this proposal \ncarefully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Right to Know Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT.\n\n       No article proposing a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution shall be submitted to the States for \n     ratification in the 104th Congress until the adoption of a \n     concurrent resolution containing the matter described in \n     section 2 of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONTENT OF REQUIRED CONCURRENT RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) Contents.--The concurrent resolution referred to in \n     section 1 shall set forth a budget plan to achieve a balanced \n     budget (that complies with the article of amendment proposed \n     by that section) not later than the first fiscal year \n     required by the article of amendment as follows:\n       (1) a budget for each fiscal year beginning with fiscal \n     year 1996 and ending with that first fiscal year (required by \n     the article of amendment) containing--\n       (A) aggregate levels of new budget authority, outlays, \n     revenues, and the deficit or surplus;\n       (B) totals of new budget authority and outlays for each \n     major functional category;\n       (C) new budget authority and outlays, on an account-by-\n     account basis, for each account with actual outlays or \n     offsetting receipts of at least $100,000,000 in fiscal year \n     1994; and\n       (D) an allocation of Federal revenues among the major \n     sources of such revenues;\n       (2) a detailed list and description of changes in Federal \n     law (including laws authorizing appropriations or direct \n     spending and tax laws) required to carry out the plan and the \n     effective date of each such change; and\n       (3) reconciliation directives to the appropriate committees \n     of the House of Representatives and Senate instructing them \n     to submit legislative changes to the Committee on the Budget \n     of the House or Senate, as the case may be, to implement the \n     plan set forth in the concurrent resolution.\n       (b) Reconciliation.--The directives required by subsection \n     (a)(3) shall be deemed to be directives within the meaning of \n     section 310(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Upon \n     receiving all legislative submissions from committees under \n     subsection (a)(3), each Committee on the Budget shall combine \n     all such submissions (without substantive revision) into an \n     omnibus reconciliation bill and report that bill to its \n     House. The procedures set forth in section 310 shall govern \n     the consideration of that reconciliation bill in the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n       (c) CBO Scoring.--The budget plan described in subsection \n     (a) shall be based upon Congressional Budget Office economic \n     and \n     [[Page S806]] technical assumptions and estimates of the \n     spending and revenue effects of the legislative changes \n     described in subsection (a)(2).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S.J. Res. 15. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to allow the President to reduce or \ndisapprove items of appropriations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      presidential line-item veto\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, every day our budget deficit grows \nlarger and larger. In this time of crisis, we need to use every \navailable weapon in our arsenal to fight the growing national deficit. \nIt takes a constitutional amendment that requires Congress to pass a \nbalanced budget; and it also takes a constitutional line-item veto \namendment, which I introduce today.\n  This line-item veto amendment takes as its model the amendment that \nappears in the Constitution of my home State of Illinois. According to \nsome studies, the Illinois State government is able to reduce its \nannual budget by about 3 percent because of the line-item veto. Similar \nsuccess on a Federal level will bring us that much closer to reducing \nthe national debt.\n  My amendment is a simple one. It is a constitutional amendment to \npermit the President to reduce or disapprove any item of \nappropriations, other than an item relating to the legislative branch. \nIf the President does not reduce or disapprove an item of \nappropriations, it becomes law. If he does reduce it, then Congress is \nempowered to override the President's veto by a simple majority vote of \neach House.\n  There are those concerned that the line-item veto takes away power \nfrom the legislative branch and puts it into the hands of the \nexecutive. That might be true if this veto were like all others and \nrequired a two-thirds override. But my amendment is faithful to the \nprinciple of majority rule in passage of legislation. It threatens only \nthose appropriations which do not have majority support and it is those \nappropriations items which often are the least credible in the eyes of \nthe American people and most difficult to justify.\n  Forty-three States now have the line-item veto. As ranking member of \nthe Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I--in \nconjunction with my friend from Colorado, who now serves as \nsubcommittee chairman--hope to devote serious efforts toward securing \npassage of this important piece of legislation. The line-item veto is \nby no means a panacea. It is, however, a big step in the right \ndirection for any serious attempt to put our fiscal affairs in \norder.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S790-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 2\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Frist] and the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 2, a bill to make certain laws \napplicable to the legislative branch of the Federal Government.\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 2, supra.\n\n\n                                 S. 21\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nMurkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 21, a bill to terminate the \nUnited States arms embargo applicable to the Government of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n\n\n                                 S. 45\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 45, a bill to amend the \nHelium Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to sell Federal \nreal and personal property held in connection with activities carried \nout under the Helium Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 91\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coverdell, the names of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Thurmond], the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], and \nthe Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] were added as cosponsors of \nS. 91, a bill to delay enforcement of the National Voter Registration \nAct of 1993 until such time as Congress appropriates funds to implement \nsuch Act.\n\n\n                                 S. 145\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the names of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig] and the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 145, a bill to provide appropriate protection for the \nConstitutional guarantee of private property rights, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 165\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 165, a bill to \nrequire a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate to pass any bill \nincreasing taxes.\n\n\n                                 S. 185\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bumpers, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Pryor] was added as a cosponsor of S. 185, a bill to transfer the \nFish Farming Experimental Laboratory in Stuttgart, Arkansas, to the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S806-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 38--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n            EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD, from the Committee on Appropriations, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nPryor, I am pleased to submit a resolution to provide funding from the \ncontingent fund of the Senate for operational moneys for the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging for the years 1995 and 1996. I am hopeful \nthat the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration will approve this \nfunding request.\n  The amounts contained in this budget request fully comply with the \ndirection of the Rules Committee to reduce the operational budget of \nthe committee substantially below the 1994 budget authorization level.\n  Senator Pryor and I are fully committed to implementing these \nreductions in both the salary and administrative portions of the \ncommittee budget. We believe that the budget submissions we are \nproviding today to the Rules Committee reflect the commitment of \nmyself, as chairman, and Senator Pryor, as ranking member, to make the \noperations of the committee as efficient as possible and to support the \nleadership's goal of reducing the number of Senate staff. We are \nconfident that the\n committee will be able to pursue a very active agenda of oversight, \ninvestigations, and consumer education within these staffing levels.\n\n  The Special Committee on Aging plays a critical oversight function to \nthe Congress and the American taxpayer. While some of the programs and \nissues reviewed by the committee are within the legislative purview of \nother committees, the Aging Committee conducts essential oversight and \ninvestigations of these programs to ensure that they are serving the \nneeds of older Americans and taxpayers.\n  This past Congress, for example, the committee examined a broad array \nof issues affecting the elderly, including major fraud and abuse scams \ntargeting Medicare; drug addicts manipulating the Social Security \ndisability programs; trends of escalating out-of-pocket health care \ncosts of older Americans, including prescription drug and long-term \ncare costs; crime against the elderly; and consumer scams targeting \nsenior citizens. In many instances, findings and recommendations of the \ncommittee with respect to the issues it \n[[Page S809]] examined resulted in major legislative reforms, many of \nwhich have been enacted into law.\n  This year, the Aging Committee stands ready and able to take on a \nhost of issues affecting older Americans. Some of the issues we plan to \naddress this year will be investigating fraud and abuse in the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs and recommending proposals to better protect \nthese programs and their beneficiaries from fraudulent practices; \nevaluating and recommending improvements in the administration of the \nSocial Security disability programs to ensure a more efficient \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars; and evaluating the effects of \nentitlement reform on programs serving the elderly and retired \npopulations. We will also continue to evaluate the effects of health \ncare reform proposals on the elderly, including proposals to assist \nolder Americans and their families bear the exorbitant costs of long-\nterm care.\n  Mr. President, for more than 30 years, the Special Committee on Aging \nhas overseen the needs and trends of our Nation's aging population and \nthe programs that serve current and future generations of older \nAmericans. It has been my great pleasure and honor to serve under the \nable leadership of Senator Pryor as chairman of the Aging Committee and \nI look forward to working closely with him in his new capacity as \nranking member of the committee in a bipartisan, cooperative spirit \nthat has been the tradition of the committee for over 30 years.\n  We look forward to the challenges the 104th Congress will hold for \nthe Aging Committee, and urge the Rules Committee to approve our budget \nrequest.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S808-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S809-S810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 45--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n         EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. ROTH, from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, today I recognize Harry Clemmons, \nKennewick School District's middle school director, for his leadership \nin fighting school violence.\n  Last January, I organized a meeting of over 200 parents, teachers, \nadministrators, and students. At this conference I listened carefully \nto the concerns and ideas of those in attendance. While I heard many \nvaried and different suggestions, one theme was constant. Innovative \nand resourceful programs which educators work hard to plan and execute \ndeserve more recognition. I therefore promised to recognize, on a \nmonthly basis, a school or school program that is outstanding and \ninnovative. The school violence prevention programs that Harry Clemmons \nhas successfully implemented are worthy of such recognition.\n  It is time we took the steps necessary to regain control of our \nNation's schools. In Washington State, for example, violent crimes by \nyouths have doubled in number in the past decade, despite a 3-percent \nreduction in the youth population. Our superintendent of public \ninstruction recently released her annual report of weapons in \nWashington State schools for the 1992-93 school year. A total of 2,237 \nincidents of possession of firearms or dangerous weapons on school \npremises were reported by school districts and approved private \nschools.\n  The prevalence of such incidents is constantly increasing, as is the \nvariation and types of weapons. We must address this problem now.

Mr. President, while American diplomats and \nforeign policy pundits hand-wring over various crises in Eurasia and \nthe American military is hand-holding the doomed in a number of Third \nWorld quagmires, an economic crisis of alarming proportions is \nthreatening to engulf our nearest neighbor to the south. Could there be \na better example of the failure of our foreign policy than the \npotential collapse of Mexico?\n  I believe that charity begins at home. Mexico and Canada are part of \nthe American family. Yes, we bicker. We snipe. We engage in the kind of \nheated battles only family members could get away with, but, in the \nend, it is the family ties that bind.\n  We can no longer take our good neighbors for granted. Our national \nsecurity and our economic well-being are inextricably linked to the \nhealth and stability of Mexican society and the Mexican economy. We \nface a far greater threat from instability in Mexico than we will ever \nface from open conflict or economic chaos in most of the places \nAmerican diplomatic attention and foreign aid are currently focused.\n  We must help the Mexicans stabilize the peso, to renegotiate their \ndebt, and to develop an economic strategy of long-term investment and \ngrowth that will improve the quality of life of all Mexicans, and, by \nextension, the quality of life of all Americans.\n  To do as we have been doing, to focus on the problems of other \ncontinents while ignoring our own, is asking to worrying over a distant \nstorm as wolves gather in our backyard.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S812-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JANUARY 12, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, recently I received a newspaper insert from \nthe St. Louis Post-Dispatch concerning the selection of 2 of our former \ncolleagues as the 1994 St. Louis Men of the Year.\n  Former Senators Tom Eagleton and John Danforth were selected to \nreceive this prestigious designation by 19 of their fellow citizens, \neach of whom had been chosen in the past for this same award. They are \nthe 41st and 42d individuals to be so honored by the St. Louis Post-\nDispatch since the award was first established in 1955.\n  I congratulate the Post-Dispatch on its excellent selections of this \ndynamic duo. Both of these men were shining lights when they served \nhere among us in the Senate, and they have both obviously continued to \nshine and inspire in private life.\n  Jack Danforth was a voice of reason and moderation in the Senate. He \nwas a credit to his party precisely because he was never a slave to the \nparty line. Senator Danforth's calm reasoned approach to the issues of \nthe day, no matter how politically charged gave him enormous \ncredibility of the type that is so needed in the Senate today. His \npresence is sorely missed in the Chamber.\n  Senator Tom Eagleton is a personal friend, and has been for many \nyears, in addition to being an individual for whom I have tremendous \nrespect and admiration. Over the years, Tom Eagleton has stayed in \ntouch with my office, and he is never too busy to weigh in when the \nbattle needs his energy and his force of character. Senator Eagleton \nbrought to this chamber an irrepressible personal and intellectual \nhonesty which was apparent in his floor statements and in the positions \nthat he took on the issues of the day. If one wanted to hear the \nunvarnished truth, no matter how unpopular it might be to utter, one \ncould always look to Tom Eagleton to come to the point, and to state \nwith eloquence and with logic the bottom line. Common sense has been \ncalled genius dressed in its working clothes. Tom Eagleton has an \nabundance of that often too-scarce commodity.\n  I congratulate both Senator Eagleton and Senator Danforth. They have \nbrought great credit to the Senate by their service in the body and now \nas private citizens. St. Louis is much the richer for the Senate's loss \nin the case of these two fine former Members.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an insert from the St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch be printed in the Record at this point.\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch]\n\n  The 1994 St. Louis Men of the Year: Thomas F. Eagleton and John C. \n                                Danforth\n\n                          (By Mary Kimbrough)\n\n       For the second time in its history, the St. Louis Man of \n     the Year Award is given to two men, Thomas Francis Eagleton \n     and John Claggett Danforth, who have represented Missouri in \n     the United States Senate, one who left the Senate in 1986; \n     and one who will officially retire on January 3.\n       The footsteps of the two honorees, one a Democrat, one a \n     Republican, have trod parallel paths. Both are graduates of \n     Country Day School. Both are graduates of eastern \n     universities, Eagleton of Amherst, Danforth of Princeton, and \n     of Ivy League law schools, Eagleton of Harvard University, \n     Danforth of Yale University.\n       Both became practicing attorneys. Both served as attorney \n     general of Missouri.\n       Both carry distinguished St. Louis family names, were \n     intrigued in boyhood by politics and joined lively \n     discussions of national and world issues around the dinner \n     table.\n       Although they did not know one another well in St. Louis--\n     Eagleton was ahead of Danforth's class at Country Day--they \n     became good friends in Washington. Both of them would cross \n     party lines in their voting records.\n       ``We decided that working together for Missouri was the \n     right thing to do,'' said Eagleton. That was their common \n     concern.\n       When Eagleton retired, Danforth paid tribute. ``When most \n     candidates are going negative,'' he said in his remarks from \n     the Senate floor, ``when many candidates are taking cheap \n     shots, Tom Eagleton is and will remain the standard for what \n     politics should be--for decency and fairness and principle.''\n       They will be honored at ceremonies at 10:30 a.m., Friday, \n     Jan. 6, in the John M. Olin School of Business at Washington \n     University. A reception will follow.\n       Eagleton and Danforth were selected by former recipients of \n     the award, established 40 years ago by the St. Louis Globe-\n     Democrat to recognize outstanding civic contributions, \n     leadership and service to the community. When that newspaper \n     ceased publication, previous honorees joined to maintain the \n     annual award and carry on the tradition. For the past eight \n     years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch has served as sponsor of \n     the annual award.\n                           thomas f. eagleton\n\n       Tom Eagleton bounces through life like a sacked Joe Montana \n     jumping off the turf and brushing off the bruises. A devout \n     Cardinal fan--the baseball variety--he charges through his \n     day like Pepper Martin barreling into a hapless catcher. And \n     he's on the telephone more often than Joe Torre calling the \n     bullpen.\n       At 65, Eagleton is many persons. Retired U.S. senator, \n     political scientist, college professor, TV commentator, \n     newspaper columnist. He is the sandlot kid grown to senior \n     status, the urbane civic statesman in shirt sleeves, \n     sometimes disheveled, his gray hair a bit mussed, turning up \n     the volume of his voice as he leads the charge.\n       For the born-and-bred sports buff with a lifelong love \n     affair with politics, a perfect world is an exuberant, \n     scrappy, warm-hearted world of good talk and good friends, of \n     family and a St. Louis Rams-Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl in \n     the new stadium, of rousing arguments and politics and the \n     law and the Democratic party.\n       But he also knows the imperfect world that can be down and \n     dirty, a world of war and want, of crime and poverty and \n     people killing each other on the streets and on the \n     battlefield. From the windows of his law office on the top \n     floor of a sleek downtown office building, he can look \n     through the Arch, symbol of progress, to see poverty and \n     pain.\n       Thomas Francis Eagleton deals with both worlds with humor \n     and energy and grace. And sometimes with righteous outrage.\n       After his retirement from the Senate, he was invited to a \n     partnership in the legal firm of Thompson & Mitchell, with a \n     charge to continue to serve this community. In his eighth \n     year off the political fast track he may have tempered a \n     little--but just a little--the jittery lifestyle described by \n     a Post-Dispatch reporter at the time he left Washington.\n       ``He still bounds around corners talking 90 miles a minute, \n     whips into a room with 40 things on his mind * * * and \n     generally vibrates like an oversized sparkplug.''\n       His lifestyle is much calmer now that he has returned to \n     his legal career. He and his wife, the former Barbara Smith, \n     parents of a grown daughter, Christy, and son, Terence, make \n     their home in Clayton.\n       Barbara, whom he married in 1956, learned to share his \n     political activism during his career. When they moved back to \n     Missouri, she organized the Women's Democratic Forum, now \n     with some 350 members, who meet regularly to hear \n     distinguished speakers on current issues.\n       Neither Christy nor Terence has shown any inclination to \n     enter politics. Christy is in Washington, engaged to be \n     married and working with International Sprint. Terence is a \n     television producer in New York.\n       ``Politics is not for everyone,'' said their father. ``It's \n     a unique profession and for whatever reason, you have to \n     immerse yourself in it. When I was in the Senate, I went back \n     to Missouri nearly every week. That's one of the down sides. \n     I didn't have time to take my children to baseball games or \n     school functions. I didn't have enough leisure time with my \n     children.\n       ``The best politics is back home.''\n       Now that he is relieved of that pressure, he has found the \n     time to write, to teach, to lecture and, as an ardent sports \n     fan, to follow his cherished Cardinals.\n       ``I like the day games,'' he said, with the fervor of a \n     unabashed fan. ``That's old-fashioned baseball. I'm there \n     nearly every Sunday afternoon. I will be thrilled when the \n     Cardinals once again play on grass.''\n       But this year, he has been concentrating on another sport, \n     working with the determination of a bulldozer to bring the \n     National Football League back to St. Louis.\n       At the request of Congressman Richard Gephardt, Mayor \n     Freeman Bosley and County Executive Buzz Westfall, he has \n     headed FANS Inc., a civic committee devoted to persuading the \n     Los Angeles Rams to move here.\n       ``Politics was all consuming,'' he said. Now football is \n     all consuming.''\n       But Eagleton hasn't lost his passion for politics and \n     history, and his love for America and St. Louis. This passion \n     and this love are his heritage. To continue this heritage, \n     the Federal Courthouse now under construction in downtown St. \n     Louis has been named the ``Thomas F. Eagleton Federal \n     Courthouse.''\n       He was born into an Irish Catholic home on Tower Grove \n     Place in South St. Louis, where politics was polished to a \n     fine art, and named for his immigrant grandfather. He and his \n     older brother, Mark Jr., were the sons of Mark D. Eagleton, \n     prominent figure in city politics and one-time candidate for \n     mayor, and Zitta Eagleton, Mark's gentle and soft-spoken \n     wife, who was determined that one boy would be a doctor, the \n     other a lawyer.\n       That's just what they would do. Mark Jr., went to medical \n     school and became a prominent St. Louis radiologist. He died \n     in 1985. Tom also had a half-brother, Kevin, a St. Louis \n     lawyer-businessman.\n       Tom would follow in the career footsteps of his father, a \n     strong-willed, strong-voiced attorney, whose closing \n     courtroom arguments are said to have been heard through open \n     windows up and down Market Street.\n       A Bull Moose Republican, with the progressive stripe of \n     Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Eagleton left his party in 1944 when \n     his hero, Wendell Willkie, was denied re-nomination for a \n     second run at the White House. He became a Democrat, and \n     publicly announced his support of Franklin D. Roosevelt for a \n     fourth term.\n       Four years earlier, the senior Eagleton had taken his son \n     to the party convention in Philadelphia where the exuberant \n     11-year-old met Willkie, Robert Taft, Thomas E. Dewey and \n     other party leaders.\n       ``I decided I was for Dewey because he was handing out more \n     buttons and horns and hats.''\n       Many years later, his eyesight failing, Mark Eagleton would \n     sit in the Senate Gallery to hear his younger son take the \n     oath of office. He would remember and be glad that he had \n     given this rookie senator a good start in their robust after-\n     dinner conversations.\n       Sometimes Zitta finished her meal alone. Tom and Mark Jr. \n     would eat as fast as they could to keep up with their dad who \n     would then escort them into the living room to start the \n     evening discussion.\n       ``Our three favorite subjects were history, baseball and \n     politics,'' Tom recalled. ``Of course, politics had a lot of \n     side issues. Frequently, we argued so much that without \n     knowing it we switched sides to keep the argument going. That \n     is where I first became interested in politics.''\n       All three loved the Cardinals and each year when the boys \n     were quite young, the whole family went to spring training.\n       ``Mother was dragooned,'' said Eagleton. ``She didn't abhor \n     baseball but she sure didn't love it the way we did.''\n       The boys were enrolled in a half-day school in a quonset \n     hut. Zitta would pick them up at noon and take them to Al \n     Lang Field, the ballpark.\n       ``We would stay in the Bainbridge Hotel where all the \n     players stayed and eat in the dining room with them. I \n     remember especially Pepper Martin, Terry Moore and Howard \n     Krist, a relief pitcher. Krist was very kind to us.\n       ``Dad was a member of the St. Louis Board of Education and \n     he used to take me with him to meetings at 911 Locust. That \n     was between 1937 and 1943. I would sit out in the audience.\n       ``Those were very exciting times. There were great \n     arguments and debates and I said to myself, `Wouldn't it be \n     interesting doing something like that?'\n       ``I had begun to focus on the Senate when I was in high \n     school at Country Day. But there, and in college, I was the \n     tactician, the pseudo Jim Farley. I didn't run for anything. \n     I was interested in the strategy.''\n       After graduating from Country Day, Tom went to Amherst \n     where he received his bachelor of arts degree before going on \n     to Harvard University for his law degree.\n       Then, after graduation and a stint in the Navy at Great \n     Lakes, he came back to St. Louis, carrying with him that \n     dream of public office.\n       Over the next 12 years, he was elected, in turn, St. Louis \n     circuit attorney, Missouri attorney general and Missouri \n     lieutenant governor, chalking up aggressive and noteworthy \n     records in each office.\n       No longer was he a young Jim Farley. Now he was learning to \n     plan his own career strategy, sometimes a bit homespun, \n     sometimes \n     [[Page S814]] more costly in shoe leather than in \n     sophisticated political advertising. He talked to the people \n     face to face. That was, and is, the Eagleton style. His sense \n     of humor was his trademark.\n       So in 1968, at the age of 39, according to an informal \n     biography from his office, ``Tom Eagleton loaded his wife, \n     two children and the family dog into his station wagon and \n     headed for Washington.''\n       He had reached his ultimate career goal. ``I had achieved \n     that. I didn't lust (to use President Carter's word) for \n     anything higher.''\n       Despite that, in one of the low spots of his career, he \n     almost snagged the brass ring in 1972 when George McGovern, \n     the Democratic nominee, chose him as his running mate. Three \n     weeks into the campaign, he pulled out after revealing, with \n     true Eagleton candor, that he had been undergoing medical \n     treatment for depression.\n       ``People thought it would get me down,'' he said. ``It did \n     not overwhelm me. I took it as a facet of life, a difficult \n     facet of life, but I never viewed it as irreparably \n     catastrophic.\n       ``I never had any great ambition to be vice president nor \n     did I ever have any notion I would run for the presidency.''\n       He would be re-elected to the Senate twice, and in June \n     1984, he announced he would not seek a fourth term.\n       Now, after eight years as ``Tom Citizen,'' he looks back on \n     those days, surrounded in his office by shelves filled with \n     books on history and politics. In 1974, he added his own to \n     America's library of public servants' books, ``War and \n     Presidential Power; A Chronicle of Congressional Surrender.''\n       On his wall are photographs, many of which picture his \n     special presidential heroes, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry \n     S Truman.\n       Eagleton also brought back to St. Louis many happy memories \n     of special triumphs and bitter disappointments, but he \n     carries no nostalgic desire to return to the thick of \n     government and the partisan warfare in the Congress. In fact, \n     he has seen both parties ``atrophy.''\n       ``The two-party system is almost deceased. Back then you \n     were proud to be a member of your party. You supported the \n     platform.\n       ``The only current need of the two-party system is to \n     nominate someone for the presidency every four years, but the \n     strength of the two parties has just withered away.''\n       Was there a single moment, a single vote by his colleagues, \n     that made him want to pull out of politics? No, he said, it \n     was more a build up of disillusionment. The joy in the job \n     had not dimmed, but the cost of campaigning had grown and the \n     campaigns had grown ugly and ``everlastingly long.''\n       ``As I raised funds for my last race, in 1980, by \n     contemporary standards it was cheap. It was $1.2 million \n     compared to today's standards of $5 million and up.\n       ``I found fund raising to be increasingly distasteful. Back \n     in those years you could raise practically all you needed in \n     Missouri. But as politics was developing during that era, the \n     fund raising became all the more intense. You had to go \n     nationwide with a tin cup begging for funds.''\n       In the early days, it was easier and a lot more fun.\n       As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works, he led in the enactment of the Clean Air and Clean \n     Water acts. On the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, he \n     authored the ``Right to Read'' program. His Older Americans \n     Act is the basis of federal social services for the aging.\n       But he is especially proud of one piece of legislation, the \n     so-called Eagleton amendment to the American involvement in \n     the war in Southeast Asia.\n       ``We had withdrawn from Vietnam but we were still carpet \n     bombing in Cambodia. The Eagleton amendment stopped that. For \n     all practical purposes that ended American participation in \n     that dreadful war.''\n       As Charlotte Grimes wrote in the Post-Dispatch at the time \n     of his retirement, ``It, along with the War Powers Act that \n     limited presidential authority to send troops into combat, \n     was a culmination of sorts: Eagleton had campaigned for the \n     Senate on a platform calling for an end to the war in \n     Vietnam.''\n       Even though he is no longer a lawmaker, Eagleton keeps a \n     close eye on the Congress and, especially, on America's \n     continuing involvement in foreign affairs.\n       An astute observer and prognosticator, he predicted before \n     the November elections that the Democrats ``would take a \n     pretty good licking.\n       ``We will have gridlock government for two years. It will \n     be a war of words between the White House and the Congress.''\n       As for engagements abroad, he continues to be, as he was in \n     the Senate, a centrist able to cross party lines.\n       ``I was opposed to sending military forces to Haiti but so \n     far it has worked pretty well. But the problem is how do we \n     get out of there. We will have to leave some troops and a lot \n     of money. Haiti can no more be made into a democracy today \n     than I can fly to the moon.\n       ``Democracy is a very sophisticated form of government. The \n     Haitians are not sophisticated people. They have an 80 \n     percent illiteracy rate.\n       ``I think the two philosophical extremes are both wrong. \n     One is that we are the world's policeman, that it is our job \n     to intervene in all sorts of places, send our army, send our \n     air force and bring peace and justice to anyone we think \n     ought to have it.\n       ``Then there is the old, stale position of Robert Taft, \n     that our only business is between the Atlantic and the \n     Pacific, maybe Canada and Mexico, but nothing else is any of \n     our business.\n       ``That is equally wrong. We have some global \n     responsibilities, for instance, the Middle East. I was never \n     embarrassed to say that when President Bush went to Kuwait, \n     the reason was oil because oil is indispensable to Europe and \n     Japan, and to us, so that is an area where we were obliged to \n     do something.\n       ``There are finite limits to what we can do and what we can \n     undertake. There is no magic line to be drawn. You cannot put \n     in 50 words or less where we should go, how we should go. To \n     define American foreign policy in 50 words cannot be done. \n     You have to decide case by case if this is something in the \n     direct American interest.\n       Then, turning the telescope around, he focused on problems \n     closer to home.\n       ``I think we are in a very ugly, negative time,'' he said. \n     ``I have never seen the public so turned off not only by \n     politicians as such but by the political process. Federal, \n     state, county, municipal. They want no part of it.''\n       However, he said, ``I think that 90 percent of the people \n     in the House and Senate are there, in their own minds, to do \n     the right thing.\n       ``The work is stimulating, challenging, exciting. Dealing \n     with situations where you think maybe you are doing the right \n     thing: that outweighs the shortcomings.\n       ``We are called a participatory democracy. That means that \n     for its strength and vibrancy people have to participate. \n     Write your congressman. That's a participatory democracy. But \n     instead of that, we are sort of a complaining, griping \n     democracy.\n       ``In time, we will work ourselves out of this mood. I don't \n     know when; it won't be overnight. But unless the people have \n     some degree of confidence in the public decisionmaking \n     process, there will be great agony. There is simply not that \n     degree of confidence today.''\n       A man of Tom Eagleton's optimistic nature can't stay grumpy \n     long. But he is also a realist.\n       ``I really hate to say this, but in all candor I see things \n     getting worse before they get better. Maybe there has to be a \n     shared sense of sacrifice. If things are not going well, \n     we've got to get together and turn this thing around. There \n     was such a shared sense during the Great Depression. Everyone \n     had a shared sense of `We've got to get out of this.' We \n     don't have that now.\n       ``But the economy is pretty darned good. It ought to be \n     good enough for someone to get re-elected president.''\n       For St. Louis, he has the same mix of optimism and realism. \n     ``I am generally optimistic about the greater metropolitan \n     area. I wish I could be more optimistic about the inner city. \n     When Ray Tucker was mayor, we had 900,000 people. Now it's \n     down to 380,000. The tax base goes down and the needs for \n     public services continue or even increase.\n       ``What would I do if I were selling the city of St. Louis?\n       ``Transportation. Railroads. Airlines. MetroLink is a real \n     plus. Fine universities. Fortune 500 companies. Excellent and \n     aggressive banks. A skilled workforce.\n       ``But the St. Louis school system isn't what it should be. \n     Housing in the city is not what it should be. Distribution of \n     health care is uneven. Well, you say, there are Clayton and \n     Ladue and other county communities. But if the urban center \n     atrophies, the area as a whole atrophies.\n       ``Simply because you live in Clayton or Ladue, you cannot \n     be smugly complacent and say everything is fine. Everything \n     isn't fine. We are all in this together. If the city of St. \n     Louis goes down, it will, in time, take the rest of the area \n     with it.''\n       But Eagleton, the sports buff, has done more than his share \n     to lure what he believes would be a real plus for St. Louis--\n     NFL football.\n       ``It is an indicia of a town's future. Right or wrong, St. \n     Louis, to be a city of the future, has to have the \n     identification of major sports teams.''\n       With his undying enthusiasm and positive outlook, every \n     time he goes to a Cardinals baseball game, he's thinking home \n     run.\n       Now, he's added another word to his wish list.\n       Touchdown!\n\n\n                            John C. Danforth\n       It was a few days after the November elections. Voters had \n     swept the majority party out of power like fragile leaves \n     blown away by the autumn wind. With the Republicans' stunning \n     victory, Missouri's senior senator, Jack Danforth, could have \n     known even greater power and influence than he has acquired \n     in his 18 years on Capitol Hill.\n       But this is not what he wanted. To serve in the Senate had \n     been his dream since boyhood. After three terms, however, he \n     decided against running another time and opted to leave the \n     promised land on the Potomac to discover ``life after \n     politics.''\n       He will find that life in St. Louis. Jack Danforth is \n     coming home to stay.\n       On this autumn afternoon, relaxed and comfortable in a red \n     plaid woodsman's shirt and rough trousers, he sat in his \n     Clayton office and talked of his political and personal \n     philosophy, of the career he was leaving behind, and of the \n     new chapter of his life.\n       His manner was reflective and deliberate. His deep voice \n     carried power without a hint of bluster. He often paused to \n     consider an answer, then spoke with the decisiveness of a \n     [[Page S815]] man who harbors no doubt about his convictions, \n     but his conversation was brushed with humor and a grin often \n     lightened his face.\n       At 58, though his graying hair has caught up with the \n     distinctive white forelock, he is young enough to make a \n     major change in the focus of his life.\n       ``I had always thought I wanted there to be an end to my \n     political life and a beginning of something after my \n     political life,'' he said. ``There was just a sense that I \n     didn't want my self-identity, the way I viewed myself, as a \n     person who had to be in public office, who had to win the \n     next election. I wanted there to be life after politics.''\n       And so, the Lincolnesque figure, nurtured in childhood by a \n     grandfather who dared him to reach for the best, and loving \n     parents who helped spur him on his way, has traded the \n     nation's Congressional halls for the St. Louis law firm of \n     Bryan Cave and his Washington mailing address for one in \n     suburban St. Louis.\n       Thus he is returning to his roots as St. Louis is a part of \n     him and of his heritage. He was born and reared here, \n     grandson of the late William H. Danforth, founder of Ralston \n     Purina, son of the late Donald and Dorothy Clagget Danforth, \n     brother of Dr. William H. Danforth, retiring chancellor of \n     Washington University (1977 Man of the Year), business leader \n     Donald Danforth Jr. and Dorothy Danforth Miller.\n       He graduated from Country Day School before entering \n     Princeton University and, later, Yale Law School and Yale \n     Divinity School. He married the former Sally Dobson, who \n     lived across the street when they were teen-agers. Their four \n     daughters and one son, though living their early lives in \n     Washington, have maintained their ties to St. Louis and three \n     of them make their home, here.\n       The Danforths are a close clan, bound not only by family \n     ties but also by their obvious affection and respect for one \n     another.\n       But even with this major change in his life, for John \n     Claggett Danforth, scion of this distinguished St. Louis \n     family, reared in comfort and affluence, one essential part \n     of his life will not be altered or be left behind--his deep \n     and personal religious faith.\n       A politician in priestly robes, with a bachelor of divinity \n     degree and a law degree, Danforth has conscientiously carved \n     time from his senatorial duties to give early morning \n     communion to parishioners in St. Alban's Episcopal Church in \n     the shadow of the Washington Cathedral. In this new chapter \n     of his life in St. Louis, he will carve time from his legal \n     duties to continue to serve his church.\n       But Danforth is no pious recluse from the world. Rather, he \n     is a quiet-spoken, resourceful activist, a low-key \n     missionary, translating his faith in God into work for man.\n       That's why he has founded InterACT, a project for St. Louis \n     congregations of all faiths, designed to create opportunities \n     for church members, as organized groups, to give help to boys \n     and girls of the inner city. This will be a major emphasis of \n     his life in St. Louis.\n       ``I hope it all works out,'' he said. ``There is a big leap \n     between a concept and actually doing it. I just want to be \n     the catalyst.\n       ``InterACT is built around three interrelated concepts. The \n     first is that religious people have a claim on them to live \n     beyond themselves. It is the love commandment, `Love your \n     neighbor as yourself,' but the opportunities to do it aren't \n     always apparent.\n       ``The second premise is that religion, a word that comes \n     from the same root as ligaments, should hold things together. \n     Religion should be something that binds society but so often \n     it is the opposite.\n       ``I think there are a lot of opportunities for religious \n     people to do things beyond themselves, not as individuals \n     only but as members of congregations.\n       ``The third is the obvious need of kids in the inner \n     city.'' Danforth calls them the 20th century ``widow and \n     orphan'' of Biblical days.\n       A staunch believer in the separation of church and state, \n     Danforth does not base his political opinion solely on the \n     doctrine of his Episcopal denomination. But neither can he \n     ignore his moral and ethical convictions inculcated in \n     childhood, honed as a divinity student and solidified as a \n     minister of the gospel.\n       While he is a loyal and committed Republican, he has known \n     the political risk every senator on both sides of the aisle \n     must face, of voting one's conscience if it conflicts with \n     the party's position. He also has heard the screams from the \n     press and voters who disagree with him. But that's nothing \n     new for an office holder and Danforth has thickened his skin.\n       ``There is a lot of room for humility in working out your \n     political position because as the Bible says, `My ways are \n     not your ways and your thoughts are not my thoughts.' You \n     can't claim that your position on tax legislation or trade \n     legislation or the crime bill is something that directly is a \n     pipeline to God. It's more of a question of just trying to do \n     your best and work things out.''\n       Still, he has kept his finger on the pulse of his \n     constituents, even as he views the world around him not as a \n     narrow, militant partisan but as a moderate, and politics as \n     the art of compromise.\n       ``People think politicians have lost touch with the voters. \n     Not true. They are completely in touch. They can fly back and \n     forth to seek constituents. They can take polls. They can \n     have focus groups, find out within a margin of error of three \n     percentage points what people think. They're very much aware \n     of the next election, maybe too much so.\n       ``However, having said all that, it's also important to be \n     something more than a weathervane or someone who has his \n     finger out to see where the currents are blowing. Because \n     then you stand for nothing and all you want to do is to get \n     yourself elected.\n       ``What it really comes down to, if there is a conflict, of \n     course you have to vote your conscience. But you do it with a \n     lot of agonizing and a lot of listening and a lot of \n     recognition that on some of the things you vote for you may \n     be wrong. Particularly, if you view politics as the business \n     of compromise, there are really few things you view as \n     absolutely terrific.'' The crime bill, he said, would be an \n     example.\n       ``It was a mix, with good things and bad things. You do \n     your best and you listen to the public. But a lot of people \n     were phoning in saying to vote against it and I voted for it. \n     All complex legislation is like that.''\n       He supported former President Carter and voted with many \n     Democrats on ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty because \n     he considered it ``the only responsible vote to cast.''\n       ``Some issues are hard. That one was not. It was a very \n     clear case as far as I was concerned. It would have been such \n     a mess had we not ratified the treaty, I did not view this as \n     a party line issue.\n       ``I am very comfortable with the basic Republican concept \n     that government should be limited and the fundamental \n     Republican principles that government should operate with a \n     light touch and not a heavy hand. The one thing that keeps \n     the Republicans together is economics, trying to keep taxes \n     low, trying to keep spending low.''\n       Moving with steady grace, Danforth has risen through his \n     party's hierarchy, taking on more responsibilities and \n     gaining power and prestige. At the time of his decision to \n     leave the Senate, he had attained the rank of 21st in \n     seniority among the 100 senators.\n       He was senior member of the Finance Committee, the ranking \n     Republican member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and \n     Transportation, which he chaired in 1985-86, the first \n     Missouri senator to chair a major legislative committee since \n     World War I.\n       He was a principal author of legislation to require strict \n     on-the-job testing for drug and alcohol use by key \n     transportation workers, to strengthen federal and state laws \n     against drunken driving, to improve the inspection of safety \n     equipment on commercial trucks and buses, to establish \n     national standards for licensing professional drivers, to \n     increase the safety of passenger vehicles, and to expand and \n     modernize airports and the air transportation system.\n       In the 102nd Congress, he was the principal sponsor of the \n     Cable Television Consumer Protection Act to stimulate \n     competition in the cable television industry and provide \n     local authority over rates in markets where service is a \n     monopoly.\n       He has also been concerned with health care costs, with \n     efforts to improve education, to stimulate rural economic \n     development, to encourage soil conservation, to increase \n     Federal support for basic scientific research and to reduce \n     world hunger and malnutrition.\n       Of all his achievements as a senator, he is most proud of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1991, providing for fairness in \n     hiring, promotion and other employment practices.\n       Recent Supreme Court decisions, ``had really turned the \n     clock back on civil rights.\n       ``I don't think you can do that. I wanted to remedy that.'' \n     Also, he wanted his party in the forefront of the fight for \n     civil rights.\n       A major disappointment was the 1986 tax act. ``It started \n     out as a good concept and turned sour. The problem was that \n     in order to come up with additional revenue to make the \n     numbers add up in conference, the bill had to scuttle more \n     and more from the tax code that I felt was important.''\n       As co-chairman with Senator Bob Kerry of a commission to \n     study entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and \n     the Federal Retirement System--he has concluded that \n     entitlement spending will consume in the next couple of \n     decades all tax revenues ``except for what we pay for \n     interest on the debt and by about 2030 we won't even be able \n     to pay interest on the debt.''\n       What can be done? ``There is a variety of things, all of \n     them painful. You could means test or adjust the cost of \n     living formula. It is like a disease. The earlier you deal \n     with it, the less painful the cure, the longer it goes, the \n     more painful the cure.''\n       The commission's findings describe the economic future that \n     will confront Americans during the first quarter of the 21st \n     century if the Nation fails to act.\n       ``The picture that they paint is unsettling. The findings \n     are not, however, a prediction of the future. They are merely \n     the product of current budget policies if our course is not \n     changed. A better future for America can be secured if the \n     country embarks on the course of long-term reform.''\n       However, he said, ``We have a system of government which is \n     ingenious and brilliantly devised more than 200 years ago by \n     people who really put it together right. We have this very \n     diverse country with all of these people, all of these \n     different backgrounds and beliefs, and they come here from \n     all over the world and bring so much.''\n       The complex issues with which he has dealt in the Senate \n     could not have occurred to the boy Jack Danforth nearly a \n     half-century ago as he sat in the Senate gallery to listen \n     and watch. Certainly, he could not \n     [[Page S816]] have envisioned himself among those men. But \n     that trip to Washington changed his life.\n       ``My parents had taken Don and me East partly to attend \n     Bill's graduation from Princeton. I remember going to the \n     Senate chamber, sitting in the balcony and thinking, `Gee, I \n     would like to do that sometime.'''\n       And so in that hour was born a dream that would not be \n     denied. Neither of his parents was interested in politics as \n     a career but it was typical of them, Jack said, that they \n     supported and encouraged whatever their children chose.\n       ``It was a wonderful childhood. They were both very loving \n     and supportive of us. They thought of us as different \n     individuals. They were non-directive. They didn't tell us \n     what to do. Rather, they encouraged our strengths.\n       ``Donald Danforth was really a wonderful father, a very \n     kind man and very loving. Every memory I have of my father is \n     of a loving father, of a man who liked to hug us a lot.\n       ``With my brothers and sister and me, it was never fear \n     that motivated us. It was a desire to make our parents proud. \n     That, to me, is the great motivator. Even now that they are \n     gone, I want to make them proud and make my wife proud, and \n     our kids proud.\n       ``For our children, it is the same. We are very proud of \n     them. They are also very different. And they are really good \n     kids. They have good values and are nice people.''\n       None has chosen to follow him into politics although two \n     have followed him into the law. The eldest, Eleanor (Mrs. \n     Allan IV) Ivie, lives here and keeps busy rearing her three \n     sons. Mary (Mrs. Thomas) Stillman has her law degree and is \n     assistant dean at Washington University. She is the mother of \n     a boy and girl. Dorothy (Mrs. Johannes) Burlin, known to the \n     family as D.D., also is a lawyer, practicing under the name \n     of Danforth. Johanna (Mrs. Timothy) Root, known as Jody, is a \n     hospice nurse in Connecticut. Thomas is a senior at St. Olaf \n     College in Northfield, Minn.\n       ``In our family, the dinner table was and is important. \n     That was the time you knew the family would be together. We \n     weren't going to watch television. We would sit there and \n     talk.\n       ``At the Senate I frequently got home late but it was still \n     important for us to be together. I would always ask the \n     children, `Tell me about your day.' Sally is the same way. \n     It's important just to find the chance to show interest in \n     kids and to take pride in them, to find something they can do \n     well and appreciate that, to let them know you feel they are \n     terrific. Everyone has something that you can appreciate and \n     praise.''\n       Although Jack's desire to go into the ministry did not \n     blossom until his college days at Princeton when he happened \n     to have a free hour in his class schedule and a faculty \n     advisor suggested a religion course in ethics. ``I liked that \n     course and took another and ended up majoring in religion. I \n     was really interested and decided between my junior and \n     senior years that I wanted to go into the seminary so I \n     entered Yale Divinity School.\n       ``It was soon apparent that this was not for me as a full-\n     time career. The parish ministry was something I was not \n     equipped for so I reverted to my original idea to go to law \n     school and by the time I started unwinding my career path I \n     was two years into Divinity School.'' So in 1963, he received \n     both degrees.\n       But Jack Danforth had a third string to his bow--politics. \n     In 1968, in his first race for public office, Missouri \n     attorney general, he achieved the first Republican victory in \n     a statewide race in more than 20 years and began a period of \n     reform and two-party politics in Missouri.\n       He was re-elected in 1972, went to the Senate four years \n     later and was re-elected in 1982 and 1988.\n       In this public life, he has received numerous honors. The \n     most recent--as co-recipient with Chancellor Danforth--is the \n     Regional Commerce and Growth Association's Right Arm of St. \n     Louis award.\n       In 1988, one of the greatest honors in America--the vice \n     presidency--might have been his, rather than Dan Quayle's.\n       James Baker, who was handling George Bush's 1988 campaign, \n     asked him to submit material as a potential choice for the \n     office, and although he was far from enthusiastic, he sent \n     it.\n       ``I was at the convention just one day. I had just returned \n     home when I got a call from Bush saying he had selected \n     Quayle as his running mate. ``I said, `I'm happy to hear \n     that.' Bush said in disbelief, `You are?'''\n       Even the top office has never tempted him. ``It would be \n     too pre-emptive of my life. The only reason to run for \n     president is to win and if you win, that's all you are for \n     the rest of your life.\n       ``No, once I am out of the Senate, I am not a senator. You \n     are not a senator for the rest of your life. You close the \n     book on that even though it was a wonderful chapter.''\n       Now that John Claggett Danforth has come home again, the \n     book is opened again for the next chapter.\n\n\n                          selection committee\n\n       Thomas F. Eagleton and John C. Danforth were selected as \n     the 1994 St. Louis Men of the Year by 19 citizens, each of \n     whom had been chosen in the past for the award.

Madam President, within the past week, the State of \nTexas has executed a man named Jesse Jacobs for murder in a case which, \nin an unusual twist, will severely hamper law enforcement and thwart \nthe use of the death penalty as a deterrent against murder.\n  In this case, the State of Texas first convicted Jesse Jacobs on a \nmurder charge and then convicted his sister, Bobbie Jean Hogan, for the \nsame murder, articulating very different factual circumstances as to \nhow the murder was committed.\n  In the first trial involving Jesse Jacobs, the State of Texas \ncontended that he had, in fact, committed the murder, based largely on \nhis confession. At the time of trial, Jesse Jacobs recanted his \nconfession and said, in fact, that he was trying to protect his sister. \nThe jury convicted him of murder in the first degree with the death \npenalty, which was later imposed. Between that trial and the execution \nof Jesse Jacobs, which occurred within the past week, the State of \nTexas indicted his sister, Bobbie Jean Hogan, and said that she, in \nfact, had committed the murder, and she was convicted of homicide in \nthe second trial.\n  When the case reached the Supreme Court of the United States, the \ncourt refused to hear the appeal of Jesse Jacobs on the ground that \nJacobs had presented no newly discovered evidence requiring Federal \nreview, which is a very startling finding under the facts of this case.\n  The decision by the Supreme Court not to review Jesse Jacobs' case \nwas 6 to 3. And Justice John Paul Stevens said this in asking the \nSupreme Court to review the case: ``It would be fundamentally unfair to \nexecute a person on the basis of a factual determination that the State \nhas formally disavowed,'' because when Jacobs was convicted of murder, \nit was on the State's representation that he had, in fact, pulled the \ntrigger. Later, the State found different facts, that it was not Jacobs \nwho had pulled the trigger but that it was his sister, Bobbie Jean \nHogan, whom he had sought to protect.\n  I submit, Madam President, that this case poses a very material \nproblem in a number of directions. First, on the facts, I think that \nJacobs was entitled to have the case reviewed because of the very \nunusual circumstances where a later investigation disproved his \nconfession and in fact showed that what he had said at trial when he \nrecanted--that is took back his confession--that it was his sister, was \ntrue, because the State then proceeded to prosecutor the sister. Beyond \nthe palpable unfairness to Jacobs, who was executed, without the \nSupreme Court even reviewing the case, this is a real threat to the \ncontinued use of the death penalty, which I believe is very important \nfor law enforcement in the United States.\n  I served as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia for some 4 \nyears, tried many cases of violence, robbery, murder, rape, and later \nwas district attorney of an office handling 30,000 prosecutions a year, \nincluding some 500 homicide cases. I have found in that experience that \nthe death penalty is a very effective deterrent against violence.\n  The death penalty has been imposed relatively little since 1972 when \nthe Supreme Court of the United States in a case called Furman v. \nGeorgia, said that the death penalty was unconstitutional, unless very \nstringent standards were set where the State proved a series of \naggravating circumstances which overbalanced any mitigating \ncircumstances which the defendant might produce--that is, that it was a \nvery horrendous offense. And all the people on death row at that time \nhad their convictions invalidated. During the course of the intervening \nyears since 1972, there have been other Supreme Court decisions which \nfurther limited the applicability of the death penalty. So that in the \nmost recent statistics available, with some 2,800 people on death row, \nonly 38 cases had the sentence of death carried out.\n  The statistics show that when the death penalty was being enforced, \nthe homicide rate was much less than it is in the period since 1972 \nwhen the death penalty had not been enforced. In my own State of \nPennsylvania, there has been no carrying out of the death penalty since \n1962.\n  My conclusion, as a former prosecuting attorney, that the death \npenalty is, in fact, a deterrent was based on many, many cases, where I \nsaw professional burglars and robbers who were unwilling to carry \nweapons because of the fear that they might commit a killing in the \ncourse of a robbery or burglary, and that would constitute murder in \nthe first degree, as a felony murder.\n  There is a vast volume of evidence to support the conclusion that the \ndeath penalty is an effective deterrent, although I would say, at the \nsame time, that many people disagree with the statistics, and there are \nmany people who have conscientious scruples against the imposition of \nthe death penalty, which I respect. But it is the law of 36 of the \nStates of the United States that the death penalty is valid and in \neffect.\n  There is a move in many other States--in New York now, with the newly \nelected Governor; in Iowa at the present time, and other States--to \nreinstitute the death penalty because of the conclusion of most people \nthat it is an effective deterrent against violent crime and we should \nuse every weapon at our disposal to try to curtail crimes of violence, \nwhich is the most serious problem facing the United States on the \ndomestic scene.\n  I submit, Madam President, that if we impose the death penalty in a \ncallous or unreasonable fashion that we are going to lose the death \npenalty. The death penalty remains a penalty which the American people \nwant enforced, as demonstrated by poll after poll, with more than 70 \npercent of the American people favoring the death penalty. In the U.S. \nSenate during the recent votes, more than 70 United States Senators \nconsistently voted in favor of the death penalty, as they did on my \nTerrorist Prosecution Act, for the imposition of the death penalty for \nterrorists anywhere in the world who murder a U.S. citizen.\n  But if we are to retain the death penalty, we are going to have to \nuse it in a very careful way. If we are to find cases like the Jacobs \ncase, where a man is executed after the State represents, in an \naffirmative way, on the subsequent trial of his sister Hogan that, in \nfact, the materials presented to the jury in the Jacobs case, where the \njury imposed the death penalty, were false, then that is going to \nundermine public confidence in what we are trying to do.\n  For the past 5 years, I have tried to change the Federal procedures \non Federal review of death penalty cases because today it is \nineffective. There are some cases which go on in the Federal courts for \nup to 20 years, where the death penalty is not imposed because of \narcane and illogical decisions in the appellate courts; where the case \ngoes from the State courts to the Federal courts, back and forth on \nmany occasions, because of the Federal procedural law which requires \nwhat is called exhaustion of State remedies. The case will go to the \nFederal court, which will send it back to the States, saying there has \nnot been an exhaustion of State remedies, and back to the State and \nback to the Federal courts.\n  So that the legislation which I have pushed would give the Federal \ncourt jurisdiction immediately, on the conclusion of the State supreme \ncourt that the death penalty is imposed with time limits providing \nfairness to the defendant, but an end to the ceaseless round of \nappeals.\n  My bill was passed by the Senate in 1990, but was rejected by the \nHouse. I believe in this Congress, the 104th Congress, there is an \nexcellent opportunity to have those changes made in the application of \nFederal procedures so that the death penalty will again be an effective \ndeterrent. And it is effective only if it is certain and if it is \nswift, \n[[Page S818]] which is not the case at the present time. The death \npenalty is, in effect, a flagship of punishment under our criminal \njustice system. So, that the when the criminals know that the death \npenalty is a laughing stock, it impedes law enforcement in a very \ngeneralized way.\n  So when I read about the execution of Jesse Jacobs in Texas under \ncircumstances which are going to undermine public confidence in the \ndeath penalty, may make it harder to get a reform of Federal law to \nhandle the cases in a timely way so that they are decided in \napproximately 2 years instead of 20 years, and where the use of the \ndeath penalty may be undermined generally, that is very counter to the \ninterests of society and effective law enforcement.\n  It is obviously fundamentally unfair, as Justice John Paul Stevens \nsaid and three Justices who wanted the Supreme Court of the United \nStates to review this case.\n  I believe that the Congress is going to have to enact legislation to \ncorrect what is happening in the Supreme Court on these procedural \nmatters. When they hand down decisions on constitutional grounds, that \nis it, unless there is a constitutional amendment. But when they \nestablish their own procedural rules as to when they will review a \nState case involving the death penalty, that is a matter where the \nCongress can legislate because we can establish the standards under \nwhich jurisdiction attaches and under which the Supreme Court and the \nother Federal courts will consider these cases.\n  This case has not received the kind of attention which is really \nwarranted. There are so many events that happen every day and so many \nmatters which come across the television screens and in the newspapers \nand on the radio that there is not a great deal of opportunity to focus \non this kind of a matter.\n  I had been looking for a few minutes when the Senate was not \notherwise engaged. I regret keeping people here for a few minutes, but \nI think this is an important matter which will require the attention of \nour Judiciary Committee so that there will be some realistic and \nreasonable standards by the Supreme Court of the United States in the \ninterest of fundamental fairness to defendants, and also so that we can \nretain the death penalty and speed up the process so that it can be an \neffective weapon for law enforcement\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the attending staff, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/11/senate-section/article/S817-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
