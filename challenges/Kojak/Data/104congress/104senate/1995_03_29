Mr. President, I wish to commend, first of all, Senator \nNickles and Senator Reid for their leadership over the last couple of \ndays. The legislation that the Senate will be voting on a little later \non is legislation that I believe enjoys broad bipartisan support. It \ndoes so because it is moderate, because it addresses a serious problem, \nand because it gives us a tool with which to work more effectively \nthrough the regulatory morass that has existed now for a long period of \ntime.\n  I think it is equally clear that the moratorium is dead. We have \ndriven a wooden stake through the heart of the moratorium. It is dead \nand I say good riddance.\n  This legislation, were it to come up again out of conference, would \nsuffer the same consequences. I want everyone to understand the great \ndisappointment that would be felt on our side were the moratorium to \ncome back at some later date or in some other form. We have negotiated \nand worked in good faith, and I think we, as a result of that good-\nfaith work over the last couple of days, have come up with an \nalternative to the moratorium, something that we expect to be an \neffective tool, something that we strongly support on this side of the \naisle.\n  We have laid out the adverse consequences of a moratorium. I believe \nthat both Republicans and Democrats want to ensure that we do not \njeopardize meat safety, that we do not jeopardize children with \ndangerous toys, that we do not jeopardize women with the loss of good \nmammography, that we do not jeopardize people with the problems that a \nmoratorium would \n[[Page S4750]] have created in our efforts to achieve clean air and \nclean water.\n  So we recognize that a moratorium is an extreme measure that, \nfrankly, does not work. It is an extreme measure that may have been \npart of a 100-day plan in the House. Nevertheless, I do not care \nwhether we take 1,000 days in the State, it is not something that we \ncan support here.\n  Let me also commend Senators Glenn and Levin for their work over the \nlast couple of days. They have improved the original version of the \nregulatory veto in a very significant way. I think their efforts have \ngiven even greater life and support to the concept that Senators Reid \nand Nickles have presented to the Senate in the regulatory veto.\n  Let me just say in closing, Mr. President, that this is an example of \nthe moderating influence of the Senate. We have seen extreme measures \nacted upon in the House over the last couple of months. Those extreme \nmeasures are not ones that we feel very comfortable with on this side \nof Capitol Hill. Indeed, we had similar reactions to the House \nproposals on unfunded mandates, congressional coverage, and line-item \nveto, and a number of very important pieces of legislation.\n  Because of the moderating influence of the Senate, because of the \nability of Democrats and Republicans to work together more effectively, \nwe have been able to take the extreme proposals and put them away, \nhopefully for good, and pass legislation that many of us are very \npleased to support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4749-6", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4750-S4755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this year we are going to be involved in \na very significant debate about the Conservation Reserve Program. From \ntime to time, I want to address the Senate on various agricultural-\nrelated issues. Perhaps one of the most important of all is the \nConservation Reserve Program. It has touched nearly every facet of life \nin rural States, including that of the distinguished Presiding Officer. \nIt has reduced soil erosion, it has substantially increased wildlife \nhabitat, it has improved water quality, and it has reduced crop \nsurpluses.\n  As I look back at the many programs that Congress has contemplated, \nconsidered, and ultimately enacted in the last 10 years, I think one \nwould be hard pressed to find a program that has worked better than the \nCRP. No program has more effectively invested Federal dollars in \nnatural resources than has the CRP. As a consequence of the program's \ntremendous success, it enjoys broad support from agricultural groups, \nconservation groups, environmental groups, and virtually everybody else \nin rural America.\n  Mr. President, 2.1 million of the 36.4 million acres enrolled in the \nCRP are located in my State. In South Dakota, the erosion rate on CRP \nland fell from 12 tons an acre to just over 1 ton an acre over the last \n10 years--a dramatic reduction in destructive and wasteful erosion. All \ntold, the CRP has generated a reduction of soil erosion in my State \nalone of over 22 million tons.\n  Nationwide, soil erosion has decreased by 19 tons per acre. So the \nprogram has had an even greater effect in other States than it has had \nin South Dakota.\n  Chart 1 shows where the bulk of the success has been. The red depicts \nthose areas where we have seen significant soil erosion reduction--the \nMountain States, the southern plains, and the northern plains, which \nincludes, of course, South Dakota. We have seen about 126 million tons \nof soil erosion reduction in the Mountain States; 145 million tons of \nsoil erosion reduction in our area of the country; and in the southern \nplains, we have seen the greatest success story of all, 170 million \ntons in soil erosion reduction.\n  So in every part of the country, we have seen a substantial degree of \nprogress in reduction of soil erosion. But if you look more carefully \nat the chart you will see that where the greatest potential lies for \nsoil erosion, where we saw the greatest consequences of soil erosion in \nthe past, we have now seen the greatest progress. That really, in one \npicture alone, depicts what I consider to be the success story of CRP \nover the last 10 years.\n  Simply looking at the topsoil savings really does not tell the whole \nstory, however. Costs to society of impaired water quality from \nfarmland erosion are $208 billion a year. We are substantially \npreserving and improving water quality through the CRP because it idles \nso much highly erodible land.\n  The CRP has also had a significant positive effect on several species \nthat were endangered. The prairie chicken and the sharp-tailed grouse \nwere threatened and endangered species. Those have come back to \nflourish as a result of the efforts in CRP.\n  More than 85 percent of the CRP acres have now been planted to \ngrasses. The CRP also has fostered tree plantings on 3,600 square \nmiles. That, Mr. President, is the equivalent of Yosemite and Glacier \nNational Parks combined. In a sense, with the CRP, we have actually \ncreated the equivalent of two new national parks, if you just consider \nthe effect in tree plantings alone. So the program has created a \nsubstantial new incentive to plant trees and, obviously, when trees are \nplanted, it is far less likely that the enrolled land will come back \ninto production in the future.\n  In my State, of course, pheasants are very prominent, and we are very \nproud of the fact that we are probably the pheasant capital of the \nworld. We have attracted 128,000 hunters in 1993 who spent more than \n$50 million in our rural communities. More than $13 billion in \nresource-based benefits to society have been generated by the CRP over \nthe life of the program.\n  So I guess the short summary is, Mr. President, if you look at \nendangered species, if you look at the tree plantings, if you look at \nthe consequences for recreation and tourism--and in my State, something \nI love personally to do, the opportunities for more pheasant, goose, \nand duck hunting--CRP has vastly expanded the opportunities to do the \nkinds of things that we go out West to do each and every year.\n  CRP has also had significant consequences with regard to reductions \nin Federal spending. We have saved the Federal Treasury $16 million in \nsubsidy payments just in 1 year alone by removing the marginal lands \nfrom production. We save money in large measure because the CRP gives \nfarmers an opportunity to do something other than plant for the program \non their highly erodible acres. It is no longer necessary for producers \nto plant their erodible land just to get deficiency payments, to get \ndisaster payments, or to get whatever other payments the Federal \nGovernment may have. Now, CRP gives them an ecologically and \neconomically sound alternative.\n  In South Dakota, nearly 1.5 million cropland base acres were enrolled \ninto the CRP. If commodities had been planted on this land, taxpayers \nwould have paid crop subsidy payments on these acres, and the figure \nwould have been millions of dollars more than what it is right now.\n  Chart 2 depicts really the anticipated result of what would happen if \nwe lost the CRP in the future. The post contract CRP land uses have \nbeen the subject of a good deal of discussion. What we see here is that \nall of the green would be what we anticipate going back into \nproduction. There would be plant to crop, 43 percent; cash rent to \nother farmers, 13 percent; annual set-asides, 4 percent; and, of \ncourse, some would go into the 0/92 program.\n  In essence, you have a good percentage of current CRP acreage that \nwould go back into the same kind of production activity that we \nexperienced in the mid-1980's, that massive production was one of the \nprimary causes of the cataclysmic economic situation that rural America \nexperienced in the mid-1980's.\n  The contracts begin to expire this year, and over half of the CRP \ncontracts will expire by 1997. All will expire by the year 2001. Only \n63 percent of contract holders now plan to return the CRP acres. That \nis this green that I have mentioned. Only 9 percent would voluntarily \nkeep their land in wildlife habitat or trees. That is something we hope \nto expand dramatically. Obviously, 9 percent is a good start, but we \nhave to go a lot further than 9 percent if, indeed, the CRP will have \nthe lasting benefits that we all hope it will have.\n  The third chart depicts, Mr. President, the effect of the CRP on the \nactual farm program itself.\n   [[Page S4751]] When all CRP contracts expire, wheat and sorghum \nprices may actually fall by 36 cents. The effects of CRP on farm \nprogram expenditures and prices are even more impressive in the \naggregate. This chart depicts the millions of dollars we can save with \nthe continuation of the CRP. As you can see, continued enrollment of 50 \npercent of the CRP acres are depicted in the purple; 100 percent in the \nred. For example, if in 1996, 100 percent of the CRP acres are \nreenrolled, as we hope they will be, we could actually save about $100 \nmillion in farm program expenditures. But the real savings come in the \noutyears. The program could generate savings in the years 2000 and 2001 \nof over $1.5 billion a year. As you can plainly see, a substantial \namount of savings is generated as a result of the CRP.\n  I am very hopeful that people will understand that CRP generates \nthose savings, in large measure, because the program effectively helps \nmanage the supply of many program crops. If we lose this supply \nmanagement tool, sorghum prices would fall 36 cents; barley prices \nwould fall 53 cents; corn prices would fall 6 cents; and oats prices \nwould fall 17 cents. Without the CRP, we would, once again, be forced \nto consider more dramatic efforts to try to bring balance to commodity \nprices by increasing farm program benefits and outlays.\n  CRP can certainly be improved, Mr. President. We want rental rate \nreform. We want expanded economic uses of CRP acreage, including \nlimited haying and grazing. We want partial field enrollments. We want \nmanagement to control noxious weeds. We want competitive bids for \nenrollment. We want sensible reform. And I think we can build a strong, \nbipartisan consensus in support of continuing the CRP and reforming it \nto ensure that its benefits will grow in the future.\n  I know that there are those who are here to resume debate and \nconsideration of amendments on the Reid-Nickles legislation.\n  At this time I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think time is now controlled. I wonder if \nthe Senator from Nevada will yield me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say to my friend from Oklahoma, \nit is my understanding that there is a Republican Senator who wishes to \nspeak for a couple minutes; Senator Boxer wishes to speak for a couple \nminutes; and Senator Levin for 6 minutes. It is my understanding that \nthe majority leader also wishes to speak prior to the vote. Is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 10:50 \na.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, with the approval of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, the Senator from Michigan wishes 2 minutes; the Senator \nfrom California, 2 minutes; the Senator from Texas, 2 minutes. Is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Could we have that, and the remainder of the time will be \nsplit between me and the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American people are winning a double \nvictory today here in the Senate. First, we are defeating the \nregulatory moratorium. This bill that came over from the House was a \nreckless and arbitrary bill. It caught all new regulations in its web. \nEven health and safety regulations would have been stymied, which are \nimportant to gaining uniform, high-quality mammograms; new regulations \nthat would have protected children from unsafe toys; new regulations \nthat would have protected the American people from E. coli bacteria. \nAll of those would have been caught and stymied in the House regulatory \nmoratorium. It was a bad, reckless, arbitrary bill. It is important \nthat the Senate stop it, and we did stop it. For that, I think the \nAmerican people can claim victory No. 1.\n  Victory No. 2 is that we are passing legislative veto or legislative \nreview. It is long overdue that Congress take the responsibility to \nlook at the regulations which come out of the regulatory process and to \nhave a realistic opportunity to veto those regulations which are \nexcessive, which cannot be justified by the benefits, and which are not \ncarrying out legislative intent.\n  For 15 years, I have fought for legislative veto. When I came here, I \nintroduced and got passed, with Senator Boren and others, legislative \nveto legislation. Today's generic legislative veto or review \nlegislation is a great victory for the American people. It will put the \nresponsibility here to look at regulations one on one, not to sweep all \nregulations into a net and to sweep out the good with the bad, but to \nforce Congress to take responsibility to look at regulations one on one \nand to veto those which are excessive or cannot be justified by the \nbenefits.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must make sure that in conference this so-\ncalled moratorium stays dead. It does not belong on the books, and it \nis now up to the Senate not just to win these two victories for the \nAmerican people today, but to maintain these two victories as we \nproceed to conference with the House.\n  I congratulate the Senators from Oklahoma and Nevada for this \nlegislative review mechanism. It is a very significant achievement. \nThey are to be congratulated for their efforts. I also thank Senator \nGlenn for the work he has put in on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Senators Reid and \nNickles for drafting the alternative to the regulatory moratorium bill \npassed by the House. The truth is almost anything would be better than \nthe House bill, but in fact the Nickles-Reid bill is a very reasonable \nresponse to the problem of unreasonable regulations.\n  It is good to see the Senate playing the role the Founding Fathers \nintended for it. We have rejected a poorly conceived and inadequately \nconsidered House bill and offered instead a reasonable and workable \nsolution, one that does not relinquish our responsibility to public \nhealth and safety.\n  Unfortunately, this responsible alternative must be conferenced with \nthe draconian House bill. Our Republican colleagues say they will try \nto convince House conferees that the Nickles-Reid bill is a better \napproach, but they also say they continue to support the moratorium \nitself. Let me be very clear about this: I oppose a regulatory \nmoratorium, and if the conferees return to the Senate with anything \nlike it, I will filibuster it.\n  A moratorium would bring to a dead stop scores of sensible rules, \nincluding safety standards to protect our children from food poisoning, \nour workers from cancer-causing indoor air pollution, and our elderly \npeople from deadly contaminants in tap water.\n  A moratorium is bad for California and bad for the Nation. It would \nstop needed health and safety standards and do nothing to address the \nunderlying problems that produce unreasonable, burdensome, or \nunnecessary regulations.\n  Let us look at some of the standards that would be stopped by the \nHouse bill.\n\n\n                    safer meat and poultry products\n\n  The moratorium would stop new meat and poultry inspection rules \nproposed by the USDA. These rules would help end the threat that has \nkilled hundreds of Americans in the past few years, including Eric \nMueller, a 13-year-old from Oceanside, CA.\n  In late 1993, Eric died from eating a fast-food cheeseburger tainted \nwith the E. coli bacteria. Eric had been his class president, on his \nschool's honor roll, captain of his soccer team, an assistant coach for \nhis little sister's soccer team, a member of his school's surfing team, \na member of the school band, and a member of Oceanside's all-star \nLittle League baseball team.\n  Death by E. coli poisoning is a very painful and tortuous death. \nEric's father recently testified before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to protest the regulatory moratorium. He told the committee:\n\n       As a parent standing by and watching my only son go through \n     incredible agony and pain before he lost consciousness and \n     died, was something I don't even wish on my worst \n     [[Page S4752]] enemy. Immediately before slipping into \n     unconsciousness, Eric screamed, ``Get my Dad!'' Those were \n     the last words he ever said. I couldn't do anything for him. \n     I am haunted daily by this incredible, totally senseless \n     tragedy.--Statement of Rainer Mueller before the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, February 22, 1995.)\n\n  Implementation of the USDA's proposed rules to improve meat and \npoultry inspection would help prevent or reduce the 20,000 illnesses a \nyear and 500 deaths a year from E. coli bacteria. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, foodborne illness from all food sources \nrange from 6.5 million to 81 million cases each year, and up to 9,000 \ndeaths. We cannot afford to impose a moratorium that would simply cause \nmore needless death and injury from contaminated meat.\n\n\n                   protection from lead contamination\n\n  The moratorium would also leave American children vulnerable to the \nravages of lead poisoning. This is a totally preventable tragedy that \nstrikes families all across the nation.\n  In 1990 the Sauser family bought a 67-year-old home in Kalamazoo, MI, \nwhich they decided to renovate themselves. The Sausers were never \ninformed of the possibility of lead-based paint hazards. The family \nrefurbished hardwood floors, repaired cracks in the plaster, and \nscraped and sanded old paint from the windowsills, door frames, and \nwalls, unaware that renovation work that disturbs lead-based paint can \ncreate serious lead poisoning hazards.\n  Six months into the renovations, 2\\1/2\\-year-old Jonathan began \nacting up--he was easily excited, easily frustrated, and violent. Soon \nafter Jonathan's negative behavior change, Margaret Sauser became \npregnant with their second son. Although Cameron was born a little \nearly, he seemed healthy. Then, at 11 months, his weight and height, \nwhich had been in the 95th percentile at his birth, dropped to the 25th \npercentile. It also became clear that he was not progressing in speech \nor movement as a healthy baby should. Meanwhile, Jonathan was still \nthrowing himself into walls.\n  Eventually both boys were diagnosed as lead poisoned. The poisoning \nhad come from their home's lead pipes and by the dust created by their \nhome's renovation. The lead hazard in the home was so severe that no \nmatter how much cleaning, mopping, and washing the parents did, the \nboys' blood lead levels continued to climb.\n  The family could not afford to move and eventually had to declare \nbankruptcy in order to get the boys into lead-safe housing. At age 2, \nCameron Sauser has hearing loss and is developmentally delayed. His big \nbrother Jonathan, now age 6, is still hyperactive and doctors believe \nhe has attention deficit disorder due to lengthy exposure to lead and \npossible neurological damage.\n  Some 1.7 million American children have blood lead levels high enough \nto cause reading and learning disabilities, reduced IQ and\n attention span, and growth, behavioral, or developmental problems. The \nprincipal source of lead exposure is lead-based paint.\n\n  Regulations that are set to become effective October 28, 1995, \nrequire that people be notified about the potential danger associated \nwith lead-based paints used in homes built prior to 1978. Until the \nregulations are in place, the kind of tragedy that happened to the \nSauser's will happen again and again. In fact, after the house that \npoisoned the Sauser's two sons was repossessed, it was sold to another \nunsuspecting family with three young children.\n  According to HUD, approximately 57 million pre-1978 housing units \ncontain lead-based paint, of which 13.2 million contain chipping and \npeeling lead-based paint. EPA has proposed certification and training \nstandards for lead-based paint testing and abatement work. These \nregulations will ensure such work will be done in a safe manner, but \nwould be delayed by a moratorium.\n\n\n                        drinking water standards\n\n  Public health in the United States also continues to be threatened by \ncontaminated drinking water. Under the current Safe Drinking Water Act \nthat is being criticized as overly burdensome--a law approved by a \nRepublican-controlled Senate by a vote of 94 to 0 and signed into law \nby President Ronald Reagan--people all across America have been getting \nsick and even dying from drinking tap water.\n  In 1987, 13,000 people became ill in Carrollton, GA, as a result of \nbacterial contamination in their drinking water. In 1990, 243 people \nbecame ill and 4 died as a result of E. coli bacteria in the drinking \nwater in Cabool, MO. In 1992, 15,000 people were sickened by \ncontaminated drinking water in Jackson, County, OR. And in late 1993, \nover 400,000 people in Milwaukee became ill and 120 died as a result of \ndrinking the water from their taps.\n  The House regulatory moratorium bill would disrupt efforts to \nestablish a new rule on microbiological contaminants in drinking water \nsupplies. The new safety standards, produced by a team consisting of \nindustry, State, and local government and citizen representatives would \nprotest against cryptosporidium, E. coli, and other contaminants. The \nmoratorium would delay the information collection necessary to finalize \nthe standards.\n\n\n                           second-hand smoke\n\n  The moratorium would also delay OSHA's proposed rule to protect \nworkers against second-hand smoke in the workplace. According to the \nAmerican Lung Association, environmental tobacco smoke causes an \nestimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths, 12,000 non-lung cancer deaths, and \n35,000 to 40,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease each year. The \nAssociation also estimates that 14 million to 36 million nonsmoking \nadults are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke at work. Those \nworkers are 34 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than those \nwho work in smoke-free environments.\n  I should say a word about some of these regulations and the argument \nthat the moratorium might not affect them. As the\n Senate sponsor of the moratorium says, the rules on E. coli and \ncryptosporidium might come under the ``imminent threat to public health \nor safety'' exemption of his bill. But he has been asked repeatedly for \na definition of ``imminent threat'' from the bill's backers and has yet \nto respond. Would the rules on lead contamination or indoor smoke come \nunder the exemption? What about the bay-delta water accord that is so \nimportant to my State of California? Because we have no definition of \nimminent threat it is impossible to say.\n\n\n                     san francisco bay-delta accord\n\n  I believe that the exemption would not apply to rules like the one \nimplementing the historic bay-delta agreement--an agreement that will \nhave major repercussions in California and all across the country.\n  Late last year, California farmers, bankers, municipalities, and \nenvironmentalists all came together to approve a plan to provide the \ncertainty they need to allocate water in the San Francisco Bay-Delta \namong competing users. The agreement is a direct result of years of \nnegotiation, and provides a blueprint for managing fresh water \nsupplies, minimizing water quality impacts on San Francisco Bay, and \nproviding the assurances that the financial community needs to support \neconomic activities throughout California.\n  The beneficiaries of the agreement, memorialized in an EPA rule \nfinalized in January, are the consumers of food produced with delta \nwater--45 percent of the Nation's fruit and vegetable production--and \nthe 20 million Californians who rely on the delta for drinking water.\n  Due to the lack of an agreement, no new investment decisions had been \nmade with respect to new canals, major construction projects, water \nallocation, alternative sources of water supply, canal systems, or \nreservoir management in the bay-delta for the last 20 years.\n  The moratorium could void the agreement and eliminate the opportunity \nit offers to maintain the delta as a viable source of drinking and \nirrigation water. Long-term use of the bay-delta as a viable source of \nwater would be threatened because of over-use and lack of coordination \namong the millions of users of bay-delta water, especially during \ndroughts. Vacating the agreement could threaten the State of \nCalifornia's credit rating and our economy.\n\n\n                       truth in poultry labeling\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, the moratorium would stop a very simple rule \ndesigned to protect consumers against fraud every time they go to buy a \nchicken or turkey at the supermarket. \n[[Page S4753]] Current law allows poultry that has been frozen hard as \na bowling ball to be thawed out and labeled ``fresh'' for sale to \nconsumers--consumers who will pay significantly more for a fresh \nproject.\n  In January the Agriculture Department proposed a commonsense rule to \nrestrict the use of the term ``fresh'' to poultry that has never been \nkept frozen. In fact, this was actually just a reissuance of a rule \nthat was first proposed at the end of the Reagan administration and \nthen shelved. The moratorium would\n add at least another year to the delays that began in 1988. While 8 \nyears is far too long for consumers to wait for basic truth in \nlabeling, the 45-day review period contemplated by the Nickles-Reid \nbill is not unreasonable.\n\n  Mr. President, like many of the provisions of the Contract With \nAmerica, the regulatory moratorium may look at first glance, but it \nbegins to look pretty ugly upon closer examination. The moratorium is \nnothing more than a valentine to industry, to polluters, to the tobacco \ncompanies, and others who would prefer not to live up to the \nresponsibilities we all share to our neighbors, our communities, and \nour Nation.\n  Our responsibility is to improve the lives of all the American \npeople, not just the bottom line of the corporations. We must do the \nhard work to produce real regulatory reform--not walk away by putting a \nstop to all regulations, reasonable and unreasonable alike.\n  I agree with Senator Glenn that we should simply declare the \nmoratorium dead. The 45-day review provided in the Reid-Nickles bill \nwill give Congress another chance to stop the unintended consequences \nof well-intentioned regulations before they burden the American people. \nIf the bill comes back from conference in this form, I will give it my \nfull support. However, if it comes back looking like a moratorium, on \nbehalf of the people of my State and the 49 others, I will stand on \nthis floor as long as it takes to stop it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Texas 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on the day that President Clinton gave the \nlast State of the Union Address during which he talked about reducing \nthe regulatory burden, his administration published over 300 pages of \nnew regulations in the Federal Register. In fact, in the first 2 years \nof the Clinton administration, the level of regulatory burden, as \nmeasured by the number of pages in the Federal Register, has been \nhigher than the first 2 years of any President in the history of the \nUnited States. Despite all of the rhetoric to the contrary, the Clinton \nadministration is imposing more regulations than any administration at \na comparable point in that administration's term in the history of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I congratulate our leader here, Don Nickles, for bringing to a final \nvote a bill that does make some marginal improvement. But this bill is \na far cry from the original bill. I think a regulatory moratorium is \ncalled for. I think it is something that is needed. I am still strongly \nin support of it. And while you might say this is a kiss, it is a kiss \nfrom your sister and not your sweetheart.\n  This is not something that is going to dramatically change American \nGovernment. The Congress is already burdened with doing what it is \ndoing. The idea that we will be able to go through regulations and \nassess them, I think, is fairly unrealistic.\n  There will be one positive result that will come out of it, however. \nThat is, we will be able do zero in on some items where clearly the \nFederal Government is dramatically increasing the cost of doing \nbusiness, dramatically limiting our ability to create jobs, and making \ndecisions through regulations that do not make any sense.\n  So, this is a marginal improvement. This is a long way from a \nvictory. I think the House approach was better. I intend to vote for \nthis because it is an improvement on the current procedure.\n  This is not the end of this debate. This is the first short step in \ntrying to bring rationality to Government regulations which, today, \ncost the average American family $5,000 a year.\n  Something has got to be done about these regulations. This is a \nmarginal improvement. This is a long way from victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Texas 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his leadership on this issue.\n  I was one of the original cosponsors of the moratorium bill. I would \nlike to say to my senior colleague from Texas that I agree with \neverything he said. But I would just add that a kiss from your sister \nis better than no kiss at all.\n  I think it is very important that we understand that we are taking a \ngiant first step toward reining in regulators that have gone far beyond \ncongressional intent.\n  Some people say, ``We really do not have the right in Congress to \nassess what regulators do.'' To them I would say, ``If we do not have \nthe right, who in the world does?''\n  Why are the regulators out there? They are out there implementing \ncongressional legislation. If Congress does not rein them in and say, \n``You are not doing what we intended for you to do in implementing our \nlaws,'' who will? The answer is, no one will.\n  It is our responsibility to rein in regulators to whom we have \nauthorized implementation of the laws that we pass. The buck stops \nhere.\n  With this bill today, we are taking the responsibility that we have \nto the people of America, to the small business people of America. We \nare saying ``We are going to look at everything the people we have \ndelegated our authority are doing, and hopefully we are going to bring \ncommon sense into the process.''\n  I hope our colleagues will vote for this today. It will give Members \nthat first measure to say the regulators have gone beyond where we \nwanted them to go, and we are going to have a say.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Chair advise the Senator from \nNevada and the Senator from Oklahoma how much time we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). There are 3 minutes on each side \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Business Week on the 23d day of January of \nthis year, wrote, among other things:\n\n       Lately there has been a wave of creative regulatory reform \n     at both State and Federal levels, relying on such devices as \n     free competition under price caps and mandated cost sharing \n     by competitors. Such reforms are designed to reconcile the \n     contradictory goals of universal service and increased \n     competition.\n\n  Mr. President, the reason I mention this is that we have a magazine \nsuch as Business Week, we have entities such as the chemical \nmanufacturers saying regulations are good if they are handled properly. \nAnd that is what this substitute deals with. If we handle regulations \nproperly, as we will do after this, this is a giant step forward for \nthe American business communities and the American people, in general.\n  I believe, as I have stated on this floor the last 2 days, that there \nwill be by the Federal bureaucracy, a more stringent review of \nregulations than we intend to promulgate. Why? Because we legally have \nthe right to veto those regulations.\n  This, Mr. President, is good. It is an indication that bipartisan \nwork in this Chamber can produce good legislation. This final product \nis the result of not only the work of the Senator from Oklahoma and \nthis Senator, but also the good work done by the Senator from Michigan, \nthe Senator from Ohio, the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and a \nnumber of individuals on both sides of the aisle who have worked toward \nmaking this more meaningful legislation.\n  I indicated yesterday I appreciate the work of the Senator from \nOklahoma. I want to reiterate that. The work that he has done has been \nexemplary in being able to listen to both sides and then make \ndecisions. We have been able to work together on this.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, will go a long way to meeting what \nthe American public said they want. That is, they want product without \npeople taking credit for it. There is no party that can take credit for \nthis legislation. It is a product of the Senate of the United States. \nWe will work very hard to make sure that this bill that will pass out \nof here by a very large margin is the final product that comes \n[[Page S4754]] out of this Congress and be sent to the President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Nevada, Senator Reid, for his leadership not only on this \namendment but on several other issues that we have had the pleasure of \nworking on in the past.\n  Also, Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Bond and Senator \nHutchison for their cooperation and leadership, as well as Senator \nLevin and Senator Glenn for their contributions in making this bill a \nreality. Hopefully, this bill will become law.\n  Mr. President, during this process I have heard a several comments \nregarding this legislation. Some people are still debating the \nregulatory moratorium passed by the House. I have heard that it is bad \nand reckless and if it passed we will have E. coli in meats, and we \nwill have cryptosporidium in our water, and people are going to die.\n  I disagree with that assertion. The original regulatory moratorium \ndid have problems, but frankly it was not that it was too strong but \nthat it had numerous exceptions that could have left the bill \ninadequate.\n  I want to get the attention of my friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, \nbecause I think this is a better bill than the original regulatory \nmoratorium.\n  One of the reasons is because the strength of original moratorium has \nmischaracterized by saying such things as saying E. coli regulations \nwould be stopped. That is false, because there are broad exceptions to \nexempt regulations such as the E. coli regulations. The bill that \npassed the House and the bill that passed the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee had lots of exceptions--enough exceptions to drive trucks \nthrough.\n  We started out with 8 exceptions, and it ended up 10 or 12, and \nfrankly these exceptions gave the President complete discretion to \ndetermine any exception that he would want.\n  Also, I might mention and tell my friend from Texas that the House \nbill was temporary, it would only last until we passed permanent \nregulatory reform. That is probably going to happen in 60 days. It is a \ntemporary moratorium.\n  The bill the Senate is about to adopt is a permanent moratorium on \nnew significant regulations. If this bill becomes law, it will still be \nin effect 3 years from now, 5 years from now. And so Congress will have \na chance to review significant regulations. It is a moratorium on \nsignificant regulations of 45 days. During this 45-day moratorium, \nCongress would have the opportunity to repeal those regulations and \nreject them if we felt it was necessary.\n  I think this is a vital improvement to regulatory process. It is not \na panacea. It is not a cure-all, but this gives Congress a chance to \ncarry out its oversight responsibility in making sure that excessive \nregulations can be stopped.\n  We also have the opportunity, I might tell my colleagues, to review \nthe regulations that are not classified as significant but yet we find \nare troublesome or confusing or do not make sense. We would have a \nchance to review those, to reject those, to repeal those.\n  So I would just urge my colleagues to take a close look. I will urge \nmy colleagues in the House to look at this legislation and to realize \nthat their temporary moratorium would have no effect probably in 60 \ndays because we will pass comprehensive regulatory reform legislation.\n  The bill before us today has a chance to become law and have a \nsignificant impact for the for years into the future, and therefore, in \nmy opinion, is a far superior piece of legislation than the original \nregulatory moratorium legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt it. I think it is a big step in the \nright direction. I also want to say that we have had good support from \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  This idea, I might mention, came from a State representative in the \nState of Oklahoma, Danny George, who contacted my staff. I think it is \nan excellent idea. I am hopeful it will be agreed upon by a very large \nmargin, that the House would concur, the President would sign it, and \nwe would take a giant step toward real regulation reform this year. I \nthank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to make two points regarding \nthe efforts made in the Senate to craft meaningful regulatory reform.\n  First, let me say I support the efforts we are making in the Senate \nto reform Government regulations and I look forward to participating in \nthis bipartisan effort to make Government more effective and \nmeaningful. Everyone has examples of Government regulations that have \ngone too far, become too onerous, or have otherwise disrupted peoples' \nlives. This is not the goal of the House-passed regulatory moratorium \nproposal, however, which brings me to my second point.\n  I have serious objections to any measure that would jeopardize public \nhealth and safety by suspending Federal rules on health, safety, or the \nenvironment. As a legislative body, our job is not to police the rest \nof Government; but it is to enable legislation that sets in motion \nsolutions. It would be irresponsible to paralyze the Government process \nwith a regulatory freeze, or by imposing costly, inflexible, and \nbureaucratic procedures.\n  In yesterday's debate, my colleagues brought to the floor reams of \npaper representing regulations recently approved by Federal agencies. I \nwas reminded of the piles of paper that Vice President Gore saved \nthrough the streamlining of the National Performance Review. It seems \nwe are all working for the same thing--to make Government work better \nfor people. We need to reduce paperwork, and repetitive, unnecessary \nregulations are a good place to do it, but only so long as we do not \ncompromise public health or safety.\n  Some regulations are necessary and beneficial for the public. In my \nState of Washington, we saw first hand how dangerous ineffective \nregulations can be during a deadly outbreak of E. coli contamination in \n1993. Tragically, four children died and many more children and adults \ngot sick from eating hamburger contaminated with this virulent \npathogen. In the absence of a single clear Federal standard ensuring \nthe safety of the food supply, a host of insufficient regulations \noffered poor protection at best. Subsequent to this epidemic, USDA \nproposed reforms of its meat and poultry inspection system to bring \nthese inspections into the 21st century. USDA's proposal would require \nthe Nation's 9,000 slaughter and inspection plants to adopt \npreventative, science-based inspection systems. A regulatory freeze \nsuch as that imposed by the House or by S. 219 as passed out of \ncommittee would have prevented USDA from responding to this public \nhealth emergency.\n  Moreover, I have concerns that the proposal passed by the House would \ntie the hands of the fisheries management councils around the country. \nI commend the amendment approved in committee by my colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens. Without such a provision, the recently enacted \nhalibut and sablefish ITQ Program would be negated. Furthermore, the \nNational marine Fisheries Service would not be able to manage the \nopening or closing of fishing seasons, thereby gutting the oversight \nauthority of a very credible agency.\n  Our deliberation about this moratorium proposal is just the beginning \nof the broader debate about regulatory reform. In fact, the alternative \nproposal offered by Senator Reid and Senator Nickles, allowing Congress \nto veto new regulations, has generated support, having passed the \nSenate Government Affairs Committee unanimously. I am confident that \nthis body can address the need for regulatory reform without resorting \nto a heavy-handed moratorium, which could threaten the public good.\n  I support the Nickles-Reid amendment and hope that we can reach a \ncompromise with the House in conference.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to announce my support for \nthe substitute amendment offered by Senator Nickles and Senator Reid \nand offer my name as a cosponsor of this amendment. This amendment \nstarts the Senate down the road toward regulatory reform. While I view \nour action today as an important step, I look forward to a more \ncomprehensive regulatory reform bill which is working its way through \nthe Senate.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the \nFederal \n[[Page S4755]] Government places burdensome regulations on State and \nlocal governments as well. Often times these regulations tie the hands \nof these governments in their attempt to address the needs of their \ncitizens. That is why I introduced S. 88, the Local Empowerment and \nFlexibility Act of 1995, on the first day of this Congress. The need to \nprovide flexibility to local and State governments is enormous. While I \nintended to offer S. 88 as an amendment to the legislation on the \nfloor, I did not want to delay passage of this bipartisan bill. \nHowever, I will continue to offer the Local Empowerment and Flexibility \nAct as an amendment to legislation which comes before the Senate. I \nwill also work with other Members to push this legislation forward as I \nbelieve it addresses regulations which are often overlooked and are as \nburdensome as those that this amendment addresses.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to \npass legislation establishing an expedited procedure for congressional \nconsideration and, where necessary, disapproval of regulations. I \nbelieve this is the right choice. The original legislation, which \nprovided for a moratorium on regulations, was fraught with difficulty. \nIt was legislation which could not pass this body and which, if it did, \nwould probably have been vetoed. The approach we take today holds far \ngreater promise for responsible review of regulations. And I applaud \nthe efforts made by Senator Nickles, Senator Reid, and Senator Glenn \nwho floor managed and perfected this legislation.\n  However, there was one provision inserted in the legislation \nyesterday that deserves further scrutiny. That provision would require \nthe General Accounting Office to provide a report to Congress on each \nand every significant regulation promulgated by an agency informing \nCongress whether the agency has performed its job. Among other things, \nGAO's functions would include checking out whether the agency consulted \nwith State, local, and tribal governments under the unfunded mandates \nlegislation recently signed into law as well as checking on the \nagency's compliance with cost-benefit and risk analyses requirements \nunder Executive Order 12866 and under legislation the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs last week ordered reported.\n  We are now in conference on the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. In \nneither body was a single vote cast against that legislation. We all \nagree the Government generates too much paperwork. While the central \ncomplaint concerns burdens on the public, there is also the recognition \nthat Government imposes needless paperwork requirements on itself. In \nfact, Senators McCain and Levin added important provisions to the \npaperwork legislation that would reduce unnecessary reports to \nCongress.\n  Now before those provisions even have a chance to get enacted, the \nSenate contradicts itself, mandating the creation of about four GAO \nreports every working day of the year, the vast majority of which will \nbe unnecessary and unread. These reports will cover functions already \nassigned to OIRA and in some cases duplicate the mission of independent \npeer review provisions in legislation ordered reported by the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  Moreover, we all need to be reminded that serious discussions are \nunderway to cut the budget of GAO by 25 percent. By its own admission, \nGAO lacks expertise in the area of regulatory review. This would be a \nnew mission for that agency coming at a time when we need to see how \nthe present core mission of GAO can be preserved on a smaller budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4750-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by new information \nreported in the New York Times and elsewhere linking the CIA to those \nresponsible for the murders of United States citizen Michael DeVine and \nEfrain Bamaca Velasquez, the Guatemalan husband of United States \ncitizen Jennifer Harbury. At this point, we do not have all the facts \nnecessary to get a full picture of what occurred, but these preliminary \nreports raise serious questions.\n  For most of the last 30 years, systematic human rights violations \nhave been committed with impunity against Guatemalan civilians. The \npolitical repression and deplorable practices of the Guatemalan \nmilitary--extrajudicial killings, political kidnappings, and death \nthreats--have taken the lives of at least 100,000 citizens since the \nearly 1980's.\n  It is because of Guatemala's miserable human rights record that I \nhave closely followed the cases involving U.S. citizens, including the \ncase of Jennifer Harbury's husband and Michael Devine. Over the last 2 \nyears, I have taken several steps to find information regarding the \nwhereabouts and status of Mr. Bamaca, Mr. DeVine and others who have \ndisappeared or been murdered in Guatemala. I have written letters or \ninquiry to the President, the National Security Council, and to the \nPresident of Guatemala, Ramiro De Leon Carpio, expressing my concern \nwith these cases. Last year, I also introduced legislation urging the \nneed for greater protection of human rights in Guatemala.\n  Throughout these efforts, and specifically on the case of Jennifer \nHarbury, I have been told that every attempt was being made to \ninvestigate her case, so that she could finally know the fate of her \nhusband. Likewise, Congress has pressed time and again to resolve the \nquestions surrounding the killing of Michael DeVine, an American \ninnkeeper who was brutally murdered in Guatemala in 1990.\n  And now it is being reported that a Guatemalan Army colonel linked to \nthe deaths of Michael Devine and Jennifer Harbury's husband was, in \nfact, employed by the CIA and twice trained by the United States Army.\n  According to Thomas Stroock, who served as United States Ambassador \nto Guatemala from 1989 til 1992, our Embassy, having investigated Mr. \nDeVine's murder, came to the conclusion that Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez \nwas behind it. Reportedly, Ambassador Stroock then told his staff at \nthe Embassy that they were to have nothing more to do with the colonel. \nNonetheless, reports indicate that the CIA station chief in Guatemala \nkeep Col. Alpirez on the payroll for nearly 2 more years. The reports \ngo on to indicate that much later the CIA, in 1992, paid Alpirez a lump \nsum of $44,000 for intelligence work done for the Agency, nearly 46 \ntimes the average yearly income in Guatemala. If these reports are \ntrue, it is difficult to understand how and why the policy carried out \nby the CIA was so clearly at odds with the policy established years \nearlier by the U.S. Ambassador. How could the CIA justify providing \nU.S. taxpayer dollars to this criminal? And whom did the CIA station \nchief answer to, if not the U.S. Ambassador?\n  The Clinton administration must continue to push the Guatemalan \nGovernment to prosecute Alpirez and any others who were involved in \nthese murders. And if the reports I have described here are true, the \nCIA must be held accountable for their deeply troubling involvement.\n  It is equally of concern to me that Col. Alpirez evidently oversaw \nthe killing of Michael DeVine just 6 months after Alpirez had graduated \nfrom an elite course for senior officers at the School of the Americas, \na U.S. Army School in Fort Benning, GA. It was the second time that \nU.S. taxpayers paid to train Col. Alpirez, who evidently then went on \nto thank this country by ordering the murder of one of our own \ncitizens.\n  [[Page S4756]] It remains unclear how long and for what reasons the \nCIA knew information related to the fate of Jennifer Harbury's husband, \nand withheld it from those within the administration who had explicitly \nsought it.\n  Serious questions have been raised about the CIA's involvement in \nboth of these cases, and a full accounting is in order. Congressman \nTorricelli, in making information related to these cases public, has \nsaid, ``This is the single worst example of the intelligence community \nbeing beyond civilian control and operating against our national \ninterest.''\n  A central United States objective in Guatemala is to contribute to an \nimproved human rights environment in that troubled nation. If the \nreports of recent days are true, then clearly the CIA has failed to \nembrace this goal and may, in fact, be part of the problem in \nGuatemala. Mr. President, Congress and the taxpayers deserve answers to \nall of these questions.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4755-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE AMERICAN CITIZENS HELD IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to share my strong concerns about \nthe safe and prompt return of two American citizens currently being \nheld in an Iraqi prison.\n  William Barloon, the brother of one of my constituents in Minnesota, \nand David Daliberti unintentionally strayed into Iraqi territory on \nMarch 13 while seeking to visit friends in the demilitarized zone \nbetween Kuwait and Iraq.\n  They were allowed to pass through two check points, one run by the \nUnited Nations and the other by Iraqis, before they were arrested for \nnot possessing appropriate visas to enter Iraq. Thus, the very \nvulnerable position in which these men found themselves was not \naltogether of their own making.\n  Following their arrest, Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti were given a \nrushed trial with no Americans present and without satisfactory legal \ncounsel. An Iraqi court sentenced them to 8 years in prison, a very \nsevere and disproportionate punishment for what was, at most, simple \ncarelessness and neglect.\n  Mr. President, I also rise in strong support of the amendment offered \nyesterday by the gentlemen from Iowa to condemn the conviction and \nsentencing of Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti. We must send a loud and \nclear message to the Iraqi Government: Under no circumstances should it \neven attempt to link its unjustified detention of the Americans to \nother international issues.\n  The Iraqi Government must be made to realize that the longer they \nhold these two men, the more they will heighten tensions and damage \nrelations with the United States and the rest of the international \ncommunity.\n  If Iraqi hopes to use American citizens as bargaining chips in \nnegotiations on U.N. economic sanctions, it is sadly mistaken. Nothing \nless than the immediate release of Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti will \nbe satisfactory.\n  Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank those countries \nthat are assisting the U.S. Government on this matter. Poland, in \nparticular, deserves our gratitude for making sure that its diplomats \nhave visited the Americans in prison and were present at their trial. I \nhope other countries will prove to be as cooperative as we work to \nresolve this situation.\n  Mr. President, as we all work to gain the quick release and safe exit \nfrom Iraq for Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti, our prayers and thoughts \nare with them and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4756-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4756-S4757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COASTAL INSTITUTE IS WELL UNDERWAY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to object to any amendment affecting \nCooperative State Research Service funding that would rescind funds, \nalready obligated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for building \neducational facilities at the University of Rhode Island.\n  USDA already had obligated $6.2 million, appropriated in fiscal year \n1993, fiscal year 1994, and fiscal year 1995 for the Federal matching \nshare of funds to build the University of Rhode Island's Coastal \nInstitute. I have been personally involved in this project since the \n1980's, but it will be destroyed if these funds are rescinded.\n  Both the Senate Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee and the full \nAppropriations Committee decided not to rescind this $6.2 million. \nThese funds represent the authorized, appropriated, and obligated \nFederal share of an ongoing agricultural education building project.\n  Rhode Island already has completed construction of one Coastal \nInstitute building and I plan to attend a formal groundbreaking for the \nsecond building in about 3 weeks. These buildings constitute the State \nmatch--totaling $12.56 million--for a third building to be built with \nanticipated Federal matching funds.\n  Mr. President, it strikes me as poor policy for the Federal \nGovernment to require Rhode Island to spend $12.56 million to receive a \nlike amount of Federal funds only to reneg on the Federal share once \nthe State had spent more than enough funds to meet its match.\n  I also want to emphasize that this is not a project that came in \nthrough a backdoor. The University of Rhode Island's Coastal Institute \nwent through the most rigorous USDA feasibility review, including a \npeer review, and its funding has been approved step by step in the \nappropriations process for more than 5 years.\n  I would like to tell you just a bit about why the USDA approved \nmatching funding for the Coastal Institute and what the facilities can \ndo for both Rhode Island and the Nation. First and foremost, I want to \nunderscore why the coastal area is clearly an agricultural concern.\n  The coastal area includes the continental shelf, the shore area--\nincluding highly productive estuaries and wetlands, and the land areas \nwhich make up the first tier of inshore watersheds.\n  This encompasses rich agricultural lands, forest resources, and both \nurban and rural communities. Coastal lands are among the most \nproductive and the most heavily populated on the earth.\n  The primary mission of the Coastal Institute is to carry out research \nand analyze policies to better enable society to manage its coastal \nresources wisely. This research and analysis includes such USDA \npriorities as agricultural production, aquaculture production, rural \nwelfare, watershed management, and the maintenance of water quality.\n  USDA is concerned about nonpoint source pollution from agriculture \nand rural homes--pollution which hurts the productivity of our coastal \nestuaries. The Coastal Institute will investigate the origins, \ntransport, and fate of these contaminants and will develop improved \npractices to reduce them.\n  It also will evaluate policy alternatives for implementation that \nrecognize the legitimate interests of all groups involved, especially \nthe rural and farm communities.\n  USDA also must address management of water resources in complex \ncoastal areas. The Coastal Institute will investigate salt and other \nloadings of drainage water from irrigated agriculture and subsequent \neffects on soils, rivers, streams, and adjacent wetlands. It also will \ninvestigate salt water intrusion as a result of ground water \nwithdrawals--a worldwide problem. The Coastal Institute will follow \nthrough by evaluating improved management practices and mitigating \npolicies.\n  The Coastal Institute also will focus on fish and aquaculture as an \narea of intensive research.\n  The Coastal Institute will be working to develop aquaculture first, \nas a source of affordable fish for consumers; second, as a way to \nreduce our annual trade deficit of almost $3 billion in fisheries \nproducts; third, as a potential market for feed products such as \nsoymeal; and fourth, as a means to provide employment and increase the \nwelfare of our rural communities.\n  Mr. President, I regret to say that, in general, the United States is \nlagging behind other nations in technological innovations that will \nallow the expansion of aquaculture systems.\n  Scientists of the Coastal Institute will continue: first, to develop \nenvironmentally sustainable aquaculture technologies for new species \nand for multiproduct aquaculture systems; second, analyze international \ntrade and \n[[Page S4757]] help U.S. producers capture larger market shares; and \nthird, evaluate the impact of U.S. regulatory policies on the industry.\n  The facilities which are being built by Rhode Island, along with \nthose recommended for Federal financing, are not a duplication of \nfacilities anywhere. The emphasis of the Coastal Institute is on a \nmultidisciplinary teams to address complex problems in a holistic \nmanner. The facility is designed to take advantage of the information \nsuperhighway and long distance interactive communication.\n  The private sector has been involved in the concept and design of \ncomponents of the facility, such as the policy simulation laboratory, \nand is expected to be an active participant in its programs. The \nCoastal Institute is the outgrowth of decades of research which has \ngained international stature. The facilities are a logical next step \nand are in the Nation's interest.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4756-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             COL. JOSEPH MARM, JR.: TRUE PROFILE IN COURAGE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a little more than a month from now, on \nApril 30, 1995, in Willow Grove, PA, a gallant American will formally \nretire from the Army after nearly 31 years of extraordinary service to \nhis country.\n  His name is Walter Joseph Marm, but everyone knows him as Joe. For my \npart, I know and respect him for his willingness to lay down his life \nfor his country. Many times, he almost did.\n  Joe Marm is a part of the Helms Senate family due to his having had \nthe good fortune to be married to the former Deborah Yelverton of North \nCarolina who served in our Washington office for 9 years. We were sad \nfor us but glad for Debbie when she departed in 1987 to become the \nbride of Colonel Marm and move to Pennsylvania to be with him.\n  Mr. President, Colonel Marm has earned so many medals and awards that \nit takes awhile to identify all of them. I'll start with the \nCongressional Medal of Honor and then return to it after I have \nidentified some of the others in the chronological order in which Joe \nwas awarded them:\n  The Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster; the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Air Medal \nwith two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Meritorious Service Medal with four Oak \nLeaf Clusters, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Ranger Tab, the \nParachute Badge, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Department of the \nArmy Staff Officers Badge, the Cross of Gallantry with Palm, the Cross \nof Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation, the Republic of Vietnam Ground \nCampaign Unit Citation, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Republic of \nVietnam Campaign Unit Citation, the Army Service Ribbon and the Vietnam \nService Medal.\n  And then, Mr. President, on December 19, 1966, Joe Marm was awarded \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Needless to say, Mr. President, all of us are proud of Col. Walter \nJoseph Marm. And I am personally delighted that he and Debbie may \nshortly move to North Carolina.\n  His present responsibility with the Army is in Willow Grove, PA, \nwhere he serves as the Senior Army Adviser for the 79th Army Reserve \nCommand.\n  Mr. President, in honor of our friend, Col. Joe Marm, and as a matter \nof interest to all who peruse the Congressional Record, let me now read \ninto the Record the text of the Congressional Medal of Honor awarded to \nJoe:\n\n       The President of the United States in the name of the \n     Congress takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to \n     MARM, Walter Joseph, Jr.\n       Rank and organization: First Lieutenant (then 2d Lt.), U.S. \n     Army, Company A, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry \n     Division (Airmobile). Place and date: Vicinity of Ia Drang \n     Valley, Republic of Vietnam, 14 November 1965. Entered \n     service at: Pittsburgh, Pa. Born: 20 November 1941, \n     Washington, Pa. G.O. No.: 7, 15 February 1967. Citation: For \n     conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life \n     above and beyond the call of duty. As a platoon leader in the \n     1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), 1st Lt. Marm demonstrated \n     indomitable courage during a combat operation. His company \n     was moving through the valley to relieve a friendly unit \n     surrounded by an enemy force of estimated regimental size. \n     1st Lt. Marm led his platoon through withering fire until \n     they were finally forced to take cover. Realizing that his \n     platoon could not hold very long, and seeing four enemy \n     soldiers moving into his position, he moved quickly under \n     heavy fire and annihilated all 4. Then, seeing that his \n     platoon was receiving intense fire from a concealed \n     machinegun, he deliberately exposed himself to draw its fire. \n     Thus locating its position, he attempted to destroy it with \n     an antitank weapon. Although he inflicted casualties, the \n     weapon did not silence the enemy fire. Quickly, disregarding \n     the intense fire directed on him and his platoon, he charged \n     30 meters across open ground, and hurled grenades into the \n     enemy position, killing some of the 8 insurgents manning it. \n     Although severely wounded, when his grenades were expended, \n     armed with only a rifle, he continued the momentum of his \n     assault on the position and killed the remainder of the \n     enemy. 1st Lt. Marm's selfless actions reduced the fire on \n     his platoon, broke the enemy assault, and rallied his unit to \n     continue toward the accomplishment of this mission. 1st Lt. \n     Marm's gallantry on the battlefield and his extraordinary \n     intrepidity at the risk of his life are in the highest \n     traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon \n     himself and the Armed Forces of his country.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4757-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4757-S4758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  UCLA AND STANFORD IN THE FINAL FOUR\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the tradition and success of \ncollegiate athletics in California is as deep and rich as our academic \nexcellence. Three different California universities have won the \nnational championship in both men's and women's basketball in the past \n53 years, and over a century of football competition has been played. \nOver the years our universities have been equally adept in producing \nwinners of Olympic medals as Nobel prizes.\n  California is home to more division 1 schools than any other State. \nSo it should come as no surprise California has sent a team to both the \nmen's and women's college basketball Final Four. It also should not be \na surprise that those two teams are the University of California, Los \nAngeles, and Stanford University, my alma mater.\n  These two teams are not unique among Golden State colleges, rather \nthey are representative of numerous schools with great academic and \nathletic traditions. In this past year California has provided the \nnational champions in men's tennis, men's water polo, women's \nvolleyball, and men's golf. California's universities and colleges have \nproduced such sports legends as Jackie Robinson, Bill Walsh, Matt \nBiondi, Jackie-Joyner Kersee, Marcus Allen, Cheryl Miller, Arthur Ashe, \nBill Russell, Dwight Stones, Rafer Johnson, and Kathy Jordan.\n  The UCLA basketball program is one of the finest in the Nation, and \nis currently the No. 1 ranked team. It has won more national \nchampionships than any other school. More than Kentucky, Kansas, North \nCarolina, or Indiana.\n  Under the leadership of John Wooden, the UCLA men's basketball team \nwon 10 national titles in 12 years. To follow in Wooden's footsteps has \nbeen difficult at UCLA. The last time they went to the Final Four was \n1980, where they lost to Louisville, coached by Wooden protege Denny \nCrum.\n  Coach Jim Harrick has returned them to the Final Four now, for the \nfirst time in 15 years. But, maybe what is more impressive, at least to \nthe Senator from California, is that it is a team of Californians. Four \nout of five starting players are from California, Tyus Edney from Long \nBeach, the sensational siblings Charles and Ed O'Bannon from Lakewood, \nand freshman Toby Bailey from Los Angeles. Other Californians on the \nteam are J.R. Henderson, Bob Myers, Kris Johnson, and Kevin Dempsey. I \nam proud to say that not only is it a California school, it is a \nCalifornia team.\n  Rounding out the team are Cameron Dollar, George Zidek, Ike Nwanko, \nomm'A Givens. The players on this team are worthy successors of the \ngreats of a generation ago Alcinder, Johnson, Walton, and Hazzard. In \nfact Marques Johnson's son, Kris, is a member of the current team.\n  Stanford women's basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer is creating a \nlegend of her own. In the 10 years since she took over the Stanford \nprogram they have gone to the Final Four four times and won the \nnational championship twice.\n  Rachel Hemmer and Anita Kaplan are the senior low-post players who \nlead the way with aggressive defense and consistent offense. Kristin \nFolkl, a two-sport star who was part of the national championship \nStanford volleyball team this fall, got her first \n[[Page S4758]] start of the year this past Saturday, and she knocked \ndown ``clutch'' three pointers for her team to advance to next weeks \ngame against the No. 1 ranked women of the University of Connecticut. \nKate Paye paces the team from the guard position, while Kate Starbird \nleads the team in scoring.\n  Also contributing to the team effort are Olympia Scott, Jamila \nWideman, Vanessa Nygaard, Regan Freuen, Charmin Smith, Bobbie Kelsey, \nTara Harrington, Naomi Mulitauaopele, and Heather Owen. Their 30-2 \nrecord this year is a mark of dedication and talent. The trip they make \nto Minnesota to be in the Final Four is a deserved reward.\n  I salute these two teams and all the student athletes from \nCalifornia, and wish them the best in both competition and scholarship.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4757-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (ii) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect \n     the requirement under subsection (a)(1) that a report must be \n     submitted to Congress before a final rule can take effect.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--A rule described \n     under paragraph \n     [[Page S4759]] (1) shall take effect as a final rule as \n     otherwise provided by law (including other subsections of \n     this section).\n       (e) Treatment of Rules Issued Before This Act.--\n       (1) Opportunity for congressional review.--The provisions \n     of section 104 shall apply to any significant rule that is \n     published in the Federal Register (as a rule that shall take \n     effect as a final rule) during the period beginning on \n     November 20, 1994, through the date on which this Act takes \n     effect.\n       (2) Treatment under section 104.--In applying section 104 \n     for purposes of Congressional review, a rule described under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated as though--\n       (A) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--The effectiveness \n     of a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be as otherwise \n     provided by law, unless the rule is made of no force or \n     effect under section 104.\n       (f) Nullification of Rules Disapproved by Congress.--Any \n     rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or \n     effect by the enactment of a joint resolution under section \n     104 shall be treated as though such rule had never taken \n     effect.\n       (g) No Inference to be Drawn Where Rules Not Disapproved.--\n     If the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 104, no court or agency may infer \n     any intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the \n     Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint \n     resolution of disapproval.\n\n     SEC. 104. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) Joint Resolution Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution introduced during the period beginning on the date \n     on which the report referred to in section 103(a) is received \n     by Congress and ending 45 days thereafter, the matter after \n     the resolving clause of which is as follows: ``That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the ____ relating to ____, \n     and such rule shall have no force or effect.''. (The blank \n     spaces being appropriately filled in.)\n       (b) Referral.--\n       (1) In general.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be referred to the committees in each House of Congress \n     with jurisdiction. Such a resolution may not be reported \n     before the eighth day after its submission or publication \n     date.\n       (2) Submission date.--For purposes of this subsection the \n     term ``submission or publication date'' means the later of \n     the date on which--\n       (A) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     section 103(a)(1); or\n       (B) the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n       (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which is referred a \n     resolution described in subsection (a) has not reported such \n     resolution (or an identical resolution) at the end of 20 \n     calendar days after the submission or publication date \n     defined under subsection (b)(2), such committee may be \n     discharged from further consideration of such resolution in \n     the Senate upon a petition supported in writing by 30 Members \n     of the Senate and in the House upon a petition supported in \n     writing by one-fourth of the Members duly sworn and chosen or \n     by motion of the Speaker supported by the Minority Leader, \n     and such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar of the House involved.\n       (d) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or when a committee is discharged \n     (under subsection (c)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution, and all points of order \n     against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the \n     resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion \n     to recommit the resolution is not in order.\n       (3) Final passage.--Immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a resolution described in subsection (a), and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall \n     occur.\n       (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair \n     relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the \n     procedure relating to a resolution described in subsection \n     (a) shall be decided without debate.\n       (e) Treatment if Other House Has Acted.--If, before the \n     passage by one House of a resolution of that House described \n     in subsection (a), that House receives from the other House a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), then the following \n     procedures shall apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The resolution of the other House shall \n     not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Final passage.--With respect to a resolution described \n     in subsection (a) of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the other House.\n       (f) Constitutional Authority.--This section is enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution described in \n     subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 105. SPECIAL RULE ON STATUTORY, REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL \n                   DEADLINES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of any deadline for, relating \n     to, or involving any rule which does not take effect (or the \n     effectiveness of which is terminated) because of the \n     enactment of a joint resolution under section 104, that \n     deadline is extended until the date 12 months after the date \n     of the joint resolution. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect a deadline merely by reason of the \n     postponement of a rule's effective date under section 103(a).\n       (b) Deadline Defined.--The term ``deadline'' means any date \n     certain for fulfilling any obligation or exercising any \n     authority established by or under any Federal statute or \n     regulation, or by or under any court order implementing any \n     Federal statute or regulation.\n\n     SEC. 106.

As used in this paragraph, \n     ``rule'' has the meaning given such term by section 551 of \n     title 5, United States Code, except that such term does not \n     include any rule of particular applicability including a rule \n     that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, \n     prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or \n     financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or \n     acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures \n     bearing on any of the foregoing or any rule of agency \n     organization, personnel, procedure, practice or any routine \n     matter.\n\n     SEC. 107.

APPLICABILITY; SEVERABILITY.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--This title shall apply notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law.\n       (b) Severability.--If any provision of this title, or the \n     application of any provision of this title to any person or \n     circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such \n     provision to other persons or circumstances, and the \n     remainder of this title, shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 109. EXEMPTION FOR MONETARY POLICY.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall apply to rules that concern \n     monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open \n     Market Committee.\n     [[Page S4760]] SEC. 110. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act and shall apply to any rule that takes effect as \n     a final rule on or after such effective date.\n                     TITLE II--TERM GRAZING PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this title \n     as the ``Secretary'') administers the 191,000,000-acre \n     National Forest System for multiple uses in accordance with \n     Federal law;\n       (2) where suitable, one of the recognized multiple uses for \n     National Forest System land is grazing by livestock;\n       (3) the Secretary authorizes grazing through the issuance \n     of term grazing permits that have terms of not to exceed 10 \n     years and that include terms and conditions necessary for the \n     proper administration of National Forest System land and \n     resources;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     has issued approximately 9,000 term grazing permits \n     authorizing grazing on approximately 90,000,000 acres of \n     National Forest System land;\n       (5) of the approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued \n     by the Secretary, approximately one-half have expired or will \n     expire by the end of 1996;\n       (6) if the holder of an expiring term grazing permit has \n     complied with the terms and conditions of the permit and \n     remains eligible and qualified, that individual is considered \n     to be a preferred applicant for a new term grazing permit in \n     the event that the Secretary determines that grazing remains \n     an appropriate use of the affected National Forest System \n     land;\n       (7) in addition to the approximately 9,000 term grazing \n     permits issued by the Secretary, it is estimated that as many \n     as 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by permit holders \n     to the Secretary in favor of a purchaser of the permit \n     holder's permitted livestock or base property by the end of \n     1996;\n       (8) to issue new term grazing permits, the Secretary must \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other laws;\n       (9) for a large percentage of the grazing permits that will \n     expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, the \n     Secretary has devised a strategy that will result in \n     compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     and other applicable laws (including regulations) in a timely \n     and efficient manner and enable the Secretary to issue new \n     term grazing permits, where appropriate;\n       (10) for a small percentage of the grazing permits that \n     will expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, \n     the strategy will not provide for the timely issuance of new \n     term grazing permits; and\n       (11) in cases in which ranching operations involve the use \n     of a term grazing permit issued by the Secretary, it is \n     essential for new term grazing permits to be issued in a \n     timely manner for financial and other reasons.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to ensure that \n     grazing continues without interruption on National Forest \n     System land in a manner that provides long-term protection of \n     the environment and improvement of National Forest System \n     rangeland resources while also providing short-term certainty \n     to holders of expiring term grazing permits and purchasers of \n     a permit holder's permitted livestock or base property.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Expiring term grazing permit.--The term ``expiring term \n     grazing permit'' means a term grazing permit--\n       (A) that expires in 1995 or 1996; or\n       (B) that expired in 1994 and was not replaced with a new \n     term grazing permit solely because the analysis required by \n     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 \n     et seq.) and other applicable laws has not been completed.\n       (2) Final agency action.--The term ``final agency action'' \n     means agency action with respect to which all available \n     administrative remedies have been exhausted.\n       (3) Term grazing permit.--The term ``term grazing permit \n     means a term grazing permit or grazing agreement issued by \n     the Secretary under section 402 of the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1752), section 19 of \n     the Act entitled ``An Act to facilitate and simplify the work \n     of the Forest Service, and for other purposes'', approved \n     April 24, 1950 (commonly known as the ``Granger-Thye Act'') \n     (16 U.S.C. 580l), or other law.\n\n     SEC. 203. ISSUANCE OF NEW TERM GRAZING PERMITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, regulation, policy, court order, or court sanctioned \n     settlement agreement, the Secretary shall issue a new term \n     grazing permit without regard to whether the analysis \n     required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other applicable laws has been \n     completed, or final agency action respecting the analysis has \n     been taken--\n       (1) to the holder of an expiring term grazing permit; or\n       (2) to the purchaser of a term grazing permit holder's \n     permitted livestock or base property if--\n       (A) between January 1, 1995, and December 1, 1996, the \n     holder has waived the term grazing permit to the Secretary \n     pursuant to section 222.3(c)(1)(iv) of title 36, Code of \n     Federal Regulations; and\n       (B) the purchaser of the term grazing permit holder's \n     permitted livestock or base property is eligible and \n     qualified to hold a term grazing permit.\n       (b) Terms and Conditions.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (c)--\n       (1) a new term grazing permit under subsection (a)(1) shall \n     contain the same terms and conditions as the expired term \n     grazing permit; and\n       (2) a new term grazing permit under subsection (a)(2) shall \n     contain the same terms and conditions as the waived permit.\n       (c) Duration.--\n       (1) In general.--A new term grazing permit under subsection \n     (a) shall expire on the earlier of--\n       (A) the date that is 3 years after the date on which it is \n     issued; or\n       (B) the date on which final agency action is taken with \n     respect to the analysis required by the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and \n     other applicable laws.\n       (2) Final action in less than 3 years.--If final agency \n     action is taken with respect to the analysis required by the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.) and other applicable laws before the date that is 3 \n     years after the date on which a new term grazing permit is \n     issued under subsection (a), the Secretary shall--\n       (A) cancel the new term grazing permit; and\n       (B) if appropriate, issue a term grazing permit for a term \n     not to exceed 10 years under terms and conditions as are \n     necessary for the proper administration of National Forest \n     System rangeland resources.\n       (d) Date of Issuance.--\n       (1) Expiration on or before date of enactment.--In the case \n     of an expiring term grazing permit that has expired on or \n     before the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     issue a new term grazing permit under subsection (a)(1) not \n     later than 15 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Expiration after date of enactment.--In the case of an \n     expiring term grazing permit that expires after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue a new term \n     grazing permit under subsection (a)(1) on expiration of the \n     expiring term grazing permit.\n       (3) Waived permits.--In the case of a term grazing permit \n     waived to the Secretary pursuant to section 222.3(c)(1)(iv) \n     of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, between January 1, \n     1995, and December 31, 1996, the Secretary shall issue a new \n     term grazing permit under subsection (a)(2) not later than 60 \n     days after the date on which the holder waives a term grazing \n     permit to the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 204.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING AMERICAN CITIZENS HELD IN \n                   IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Saturday, March 25, 1995, an Iraqi court sentenced \n     two Americans, William Barloon and David Daliberti, to eight \n     years imprisonment for allegedly entering Iraq without \n     permission.\n       (2) The two men were tried, convicted, and sentenced in \n     what was reported to be a very brief period during that day \n     with no other Americans present and with their only legal \n     counsel having been appointed by the Government of Iraq.\n       (3) The Department of State has stated that the two \n     Americans have committed no offense justifying imprisonment \n     and has demanded that they be released immediately.\n       (4) This injustice worsens already strained relations \n     between the United States and Iraq and makes resolution of \n     differences with Iraq more difficult.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--The Senate strongly condemns the \n     unjustified actions taken by the Government of Iraq against \n     American citizens William Barloon and David Daliberti and \n     urges their immediate release from prison and safe exit from \n     Iraq. Further, the Senate urges the President of the United \n     States to take all appropriate action to assure their prompt \n     release and safe exit from Iraq.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again I wish to thank my colleague, \nSenator Reid, but also I wish to thank Senator Hutchison and Senator \nBond, Senator Levin, and particularly, on Senator Levin's staff, Linda \nGustitus, and Senator Glenn.\n  In addition, I wish to thank several of my staff members who have \nworked on this for the last couple of months--Diane Moery, Mark \nWhitenton, Les Brorsen, and Bret Bernhardt--for their tireless efforts.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a good bill, one that in my opinion is \na significant improvement over the House, and \n[[Page S4761]] I will be urging our House colleagues to adopt the \nSenate approach.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to make sure that those people who \nworked on this side of the aisle on the last piece of legislation, \nwhich I believe is some of the best work we have done this year in the \nSenate, have proper recognition.\n  We spent most of the last 2 days working out problems that developed \nin the legislation. It could not have been accomplished without my \npersonal staff representative, Paul Henry, and especially the former \nchief of staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Len Weiss, who \nwas instrumental in our being able to develop and craft various \namendments, and also the person who had as much to do as anyone with \nour being able to pass this important legislation, Linda Gustitus, who \nhas been with Senator Levin since he has been in the Senate. Her help \non this matter was vital.\n  I wish to make sure the Record reflects again that this was a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, not only as the vote indicates but \nalso as indicated in the statement made by Senator Nickles and me. The \nstaff was also bipartisan.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield, I just wanted to associate \nmyself with the remarks of the Senator from Nevada about the staff \nmembers on both sides. On something like this, there are a lot of \ncontroversial items. I see Senator Nickles still in the Chamber. The \nstaff of the Senator from Oklahoma and all of our staff members--we get \ncredit for a lot of things done around here, but the staffs are the \nones who put these things together and spend the long hours back and \nforth working out all the details.\n  There has not been anything pass through the Senate in some time that \nrequired more negotiating back and forth, I think, than we did in this \nlegislation--all done in good faith by staff. We trust them. I am glad \nthe Senator from Nevada chose to honor them. They deserve it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, let me also \nthank him and Senator Nickles and their staffs for the work that they \nput in on this bill and for taking the time, both of them, to thank the \nstaffs for the tremendous work that they have done. We thank them for \ntheir own work and for recognizing the importance of our staffs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4758-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4761-S4776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1158, the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Disaster Assistance Act. The clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1158) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for additional disaster assistance and making \n     rescissions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1995, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senate now has under consideration \nlegislation to provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency with an \nadditional $1.9 billion in fiscal year 1995 and $4.8 billion for fiscal \nyear 1996 for emergency disaster relief and to make savings in prior \nyear appropriations through rescissions and other actions by a total of \napproximately $13.5 billion.\n  The supplemental appropriation is recommended in response to the \nPresident's request of February 6, 1995. The President requested a FEMA \nsupplemental of $6.7 billion for disaster relief efforts in California \nand 40 other States. The House has recommended a reduced amount of $5.3 \nbillion, all in fiscal year 1995 supplementals. Our Senate committee \nrecommends $1.9 billion for fiscal year 1995, which is the amount most \nimmediately required, and an advance appropriation for fiscal year 1996 \nof the balance of the $4.8 billion. The committee makes this \nrecommendation as a first step in establishing a new procedure for the \nprovision of disaster relief.\n  As noted in our committee report, Mr. President, funds appropriated \nfor FEMA disaster relief have escalated sharply in recent years. \nBetween 1990 and 1994, 195 disasters were declared by the President and \nnearly $15 billion was appropriated in emergency supplements for \ndisaster relief. We should not abandon Federal disaster assistance for \npeople and communities in need, but we cannot afford to continue this \nlevel of spending.\n  Senators Bond and Mikulski are making a good start in the right \ndirection, and they are to be commended. They are the chair and the \nranking minority member of the Subcommittee on HUD and Independent \nAgencies, under which FEMA comes for its funding.\n  Most of the attention given this measure has been directed at the \nrescissions we are recommending. I think there has been a considerable \ndegree of overreaction to our proposals. We are not engaged in a barn-\nburning exercise. In the main, the rescissions and other savings we \nrecommend on the Senate side are reductions in the rate of increase, \nrather than a true cut.\n  Let me underscore that. We read in the media, see on the television, \nand we hear from many voices that the House or the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has cut these funds; we are putting the poor \nout in the street; we are doing all these things because we have cut \nfunds, making it appear as though we have excised the account dealing \nwith that particular human need.\n  We have also undertaken to take the unobligated balances which have \nlanguished for years after their initial appropriation. We call that \nthe pipeline money and we have taken them as rescissions.\n  So let us get our nomenclature clarified that the cuts are reducing \nthe rate of growth. We are not, in effect, dislocating people or \nignoring the needs of people.\n  So what we bring to the Senate today, Mr. President, represents the \ncommittee's considered reevaluation of prior year funding levels, based \non a renewed commitment to thoroughly scrutinize every spending \nproposal.\n  This is not to say that scrutiny did not exist before. It did. But we \nshould always be willing to take a second look, and that is what the \nSenate is doing.\n  Some of those unobligated funds we found in the pipeline were \nunobligated transportation funds from 1982, 13 years ago. It was our \nfeeling it was better to take those unobligated funds out of the \npipeline for our rescissions and, at the same time, to recognize, as an \nexample, low-income energy assistance for people of need in \nparticularly cold weather.\n  It is not unusual for us to do this type of thing. Our committee has \nrecommended rescissions and the Congress has enacted rescissions in \nevery year for the past 20 years. Rescissions are not an innovation of \nthe Executive. Since the rescission process entered and the Budget Act \nwas created--now that is 1974--Congress has enacted into law a grand \ntotal of $92,940,296,915 in rescissions in that period of time, which \nis $20 billion more than we have been asked to rescind by Presidents \nFord, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.\n  I want to focus on that again. In the parlance of today's \ncommunications, it is the Congress that is the big spenders; it is the \nCongress that has to be brought under control. And yet, at the same \ntime, in this 20-year period, we have rescinded $20 billion more than \nthese Presidents, five Presidents, have asked for.\n  Nor is the size of the package we bring to the floor today \nunprecedented. In 1981, when I was first honored to be chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, we brought to the Senate a $15 billion \nrescission package. There may be others who find this a novel \nexperience, but I do not.\n   [[Page S4762]] Mr. President, I think we also have to recognize \nthat, as noted in our report, we have amendments to offer today to \nchange the committee's recommendations. We expect those and we welcome \nthem. We welcome them up to a degree, not an unlimited welcome. Some \nwill want to restore funding. Some will want to cut more. We will \nengage in those debates and invite those amendments. But I hope there \nwill not be an effort to unduly delay this legislation.\n  I believe we all share a desire to reduce Federal spending. We know \nvery significant reductions are coming in fiscal year 1996 and the \nyears beyond, and every dollar we are able to save today will make \ntomorrow's task easier. It is time we begin, and this is the beginning.\n  To honor the request I have made to move this bill along \nexpeditiously, I am very happy to say that two Senators, who are on the \nfloor, have indicated that they will agree to a time limit; some more \nand some less. But, nevertheless, we are starting out right by trying \nto get time agreements and not to have open-ended affairs that can drag \nthis bill on and on ad infinitum. So I wish to thank the Senators who \nhave indicated they would consider a time agreement. When we get ready \nfor those amendments, we hope to have that agreement.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield to the ranking member of our \nCommittee on Appropriations and former chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd, of West Virginia, for any opening statement \nthat he wishes to make.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee reported this emergency \nsupplemental and rescission bill, S. 617, on Friday, March 24. The \nmotion to report the bill also included the committee's authorization \nfor the chairman to offer S. 617 as a complete substitute for the \nHouse-passed companion measure, H.R. 1158. This was an unusual, but by \nno means unique, action by the committee. In order to facilitate \ncomparison of the differences between the committee substitute and H.R. \n1158, the committee report on S. 617, a copy of which is on each \nSenator's desk, contains comparisons between the committee's \nrecommendations and the House-passed bill. The report to which I refer \nis Senate Report 104-17.\n  As has been the practice in the past, I, as the ranking minority \nmember, joined Chairman Hatfield during the markup in urging members of \nthe committee to withhold controversial amendments, in order to \nexpedite the markup of this emergency supplemental and rescission bill. \nThat request was largely accommodated, but there were a number of \nconcerns expressed about the bill by various members of the committee \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Among those concerns was the need to find a way to fund disaster \nassistance programs, such as the $6.7 billion appropriation for the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] contained in the committee \nsubstitute. In his supplemental request, the President designated this \n$6.7 billion FEMA supplemental as an emergency appropriation under \nsection 251(b)(2)(D)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985. Senators will recall that under the terms of the \n1990 budget summit agreement, Presidents may designate discretionary \nappropriations as emergencies and, if Congress so designates in \nstatute, such appropriations are, in effect, not charged against \ndiscretionary spending caps in any year.\n  In this instance, President Clinton exercised his authority to\n   designate the $6.7 billion FEMA request as an emergency requirement. \nThe House chose to appropriate $5.4 billion for FEMA and to designate \nthis amount as an emergency. However, the House-passed bill also \ncontains rescissions and other reductions totaling $17.4 billion in \nbudget authority. These rescissions are far in excess of what would be \nrequired to offset the cost of the FEMA supplemental.\n\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee's substitute, as set forth in S. \n617, recommends an emergency appropriation of $1.9 billion for FEMA for \nfiscal year 1995, together with an additional $4.8 billion which would \nbecome available for fiscal year 1996. These funds would become \navailable only after receipt of an official budget request for a \nspecific amount of the $4.8 billion and only if such amount includes a \ndesignation as an emergency requirement.\n  What we have attempted to do, then, is to provide the amount needed \nby FEMA for fiscal year 1995, namely $1.9 billion, and to establish a \ndisaster relief emergency contingency fund into which $4.8 billion \nwould be deposited for use in amounts which Congress and the President \nagree to in fiscal year 1996 and beyond.\n  I am certain that the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe VA-HUD Subcommittee, Senators Bond and Mikulski, will talk further \non this issue during the debate on the bill.\n  The committee substitute also contains rescissions and other spending \nreductions totaling $13.5 billion, or approximately $4 billion less in \nrescissions than the House bill. The major differences in rescissions \nbetween the two bills are as follows:\n  One, for the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, the House bill rescinds a total \nof $5.9 billion; the committee substitute recommends $3.05 billion, or \n$2.85 billion less in rescissions.\n  For the VA-HUD Subcommittee, the House bill rescinds $9.3 billion; \nwhereas the committee substitute proposes rescissions totaling $6.8 \nbillion, or $2.5 billion less than the House bill.\n  For the Military Construction Subcommittee, the House bill contains \nno rescissions, but the committee substitute would rescind $231 million \nin military construction funding.\n  For Transportation, the House bill recommends rescissions totaling a \nlittle over $700 million and the committee substitute recommends \nrescissions totaling $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion more in cuts than \nthe House bill.\n  Mr. President, these are very difficult times for the portion of the \nFederal budget that is controllable by the Appropriations Committees; \nnamely, discretionary spending. As noted on page 3 of the committee \nreport accompanying S. 617, discretionary spending has decreased from \n14.4 percent of GDP in fiscal year 1968 to less than 7.7 percent of GDP \nin fiscal year 1995. This fact should be ample evidence to those who \nbemoan Federal deficits and the resulting massive increase in the \nnational debt that discretionary spending--other than the Reagan \ndefense buildup--has not caused the deficit increases. The additional \n$13.5 billion in discretionary spending cuts recommended in this bill \nare further evidence that, as painful as it is to cut Federal spending, \nthe Appropriations Committee has always done its share, and more than \nits share.\n  Nevertheless, I am certain there will be a number of amendments \noffered to this measure which will propose restoration of funds for \nmany worthwhile programs. I shall withhold judgment on such amendments \nuntil I can determine their merits on a case-by-case basis and to see \nwhether offsets are provided and whether the offsets are reasonable \nthat are provided.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I compliment the chairman, Senator \nHatfield, for his leadership in bringing this measure to the Senate \nexpeditiously, in order to allow the Senate to work its will on the \nissues that are raised in the bill, some of which, I fear, will be very \ntroublesome to a number of my colleagues.\n  I also thank the members of the staffs, the dedicated members of our \nstaffs, both in the majority and in the minority, for their usual fine \ncooperation and excellent advice and dedicated effectiveness as they \nhave worked so hard to help the chairman and myself and the members of \nthe committee to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I thank all subcommittee chairmen and all ranking members, Mr. \nPresident, for a job well done. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I want to express my deep appreciation \nto the ranking member of the full committee. As is traditional in our \ncommittee, we have worked in a very bipartisan spirit. It has been with \nthe \n[[Page S4763]] support of the ranking member and members of that side, \nas well as our own Republican colleagues, that have made this product \npossible today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 420\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I submit this amendment on behalf of the \nCommittee on Appropriations, pursuant to a rollcall taken in the \ncommittee. This is a substitute for the House bill that we received on \nthis particular subject.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on an \namendment to be offered by Senator Mikulski, the ranking member, and \nSenator Bond, the chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies, that there be 2 hours equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 421 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this substitute \nwhich I feel greatly improves the manner in which Congress deals with \nthe disaster assistance. I call it the Truth in Disaster Budgeting Act.\n  Before I describe my amendment in the nature of a substitute, I would \nlike to thank the chairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee, Senator Bond, for all of the courtesies that have been \nafforded me, my staff, and other people on this side of the aisle.\n  I believe that Senator Bond, in the approach he used, tried to do the \nbest with the deck that was dealt him. But I do not think it was a \ngreat deck. We essentially feel like we are a couple of cards short.\n  Mr. President, let me go through the principles of the bill, and I \nwould like to amplify my remarks.\n  First, what this amendment does is replaces title I and it offsets \nthe earthquake relief aspects by applying a 1.7-percent across-the-\nboard cut to all discretionary spending, except VA medical care, \nnutrition programs, Social Security, Medicare administrative costs, and \ndefense readiness. It also, as the second part, requires Congress to \nset up a rainy day fund.\n  Let me explain where we are. The President has declared the need for \na Federal emergency management supplemental to the tune of $6.7 billion \nto pay for the disasters that the United States of America has faced--\nlike in Northridge, CA, and the remaining aspects of Hurricane Andrew. \nThat is the good news. The bad news is that Congress is being asked to \npay for it out of one appropriations subcommittee, the subcommittee \ncalled VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies. These are 25 different \nagencies.\n  So essentially, one subcommittee within the U.S. Senate becomes the \nbank to fund disaster relief, and it is being done out of the \nrescission bill, when we do not have the money unless we take it from \nthose programs that have already been appropriated.\n  I disagree with the President in taking and funding emergency \ndisaster relief out of one subcommittee. That is the reason I am \noffering my substitute. I believe that natural disasters, which are \nacts of nature, should be funded and all the Government should bear the \nburden and not just a few programs.\n  Therefore, what my substitute does is replace the rescission \ncontained in the bill with an across-the-board cut of 1.72 percent. \nThis across-the-board cut will raise the $6.7 billion necessary to \noffset the cost of providing disaster assistance to complete the \nrecovery efforts in Northridge, CA, and for previously declared \ndisasters in 46 other States.\n  My substitute also specifically exempts those four areas which I feel \nshould not bear any more cuts. First, VA medical care. Promises made, \npromises cut. Let us not cut VA medical care. Second, it exempts \ndefense readiness because I believe we need to be able to stand sentry \nand have our force structure ready.\n  The other is that it exempts food and nutrition programs at the \nDepartment of Agriculture, like Meals on Wheels and school lunches. It \nalso exempts the administrative costs related to Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, though the President has declared this FEMA \nsupplemental to be a disaster, under the rules of the Senate we do not \nhave to pay for it. It would be off budget. I believe people on both \nsides of the aisle agree that it should be paid for, and I agree that \nit should be paid for. I also agree with the principle that my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, is doing, which is to essentially establish a \nrainy day fund--only I want to establish this rainy day fund for rainy \ndays, both literally and figuratively, prospectively out of this \nsubcommittee.\n  The reason I say that is the recent disasters like Hurricanes Hugo, \nAndrew, Iniki, floods in the Midwest, the Northridge earthquake, and \nthe Loma Prieta earthquake, have proven a compelling need to reevaluate \nFederal disaster assistance policy. The first crucial step is to \nestablish the rainy day fund so that we can respond and meet our \nresponsibilities.\n  What the Mikulski substitute does is to direct the appropriate \nauthorizing committees to establish both the mechanism and the source \nof funding for a rainy day fund before the start of fiscal year 1996.\n  I am offering this substitute because I have, as I said, two serious \nconcerns with the bill reported to us: The bad precedent set by \nrequiring that disaster assistance be offset by cuts in spending in \nother areas. Second, the dangerous precedent by taking all of these \noffsets or sources of funds from one subcommittee, VA, HUD, \nAppropriations Committee. VA, HUD is 25 different agencies. It funds \nall of veterans, all of housing, all of EPA, administrative expenses of \nFEMA, National Science Foundation, and even agencies like Arlington \nCemetery.\n  I believe that we should not be the bankroll. I am also concerned \nthat it would come out of primarily HUD and EPA, National Service, and \nVA medical care.\n  Mr. President, I am all for reducing the deficit, but what we must \nunderstand is that requiring offsets in discretionary spending to cover \nthe cost of disaster assistance represents a fundamental change in \nFederal disaster policy. This was established with the enactment of \ndiscretionary budget caps and the pay-as-you-go and the balanced budget \nand emergency deficit control of 1985.\n  This longstanding policy is based on the principle that natural \ndisasters are unprecedented acts of nature, and nature cannot be \naccommodated in the standard appropriations process. By definition, \nthese acts are extraordinary and catastrophic and beyond the scope of \nwhat we could normally confront in the annual battle with both the \nweather, elements, and the battle of the budget.\n  Historically, since 1988, Congress has enacted seven major disaster \nsupplementals, and they total $22.5 billion to aid virtually every \nState in the Union. The Appropriations Committee \n[[Page S4764]] never had to come up with offsets, and the Senate \ncontinually rejected amendments which called for offsets. It was funded \noff budget. Our guiding principle was to provide relief to those who \ndesperately need it.\n  Whether it was Hugo, the riots in Los Angeles, CA, flooding in \nChicago, the terrible floods in Missouri, we never adopted offsets. \nEach of these was sudden, unforeseen, and funded outside of the budget \ncaps.\n  I do not want to argue that. I believe, along with my colleague, and \nI believe the majority of my colleagues, that we should pay for it. But \nI believe we should pay for it across the board and not out of the bank \nof one subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, all of this is going to change if the offsets are the \nname of the game. I believe they should. But natural and national \ndisasters should be a national responsibility. Therefore, that is why I \nestablish this rainy day fund.\n  The bill before us establishes a second precedent which is that the \nsource of FEMA will be the VA, HUD. I think it is outrageous that one \nsubcommittee needs to pay for what happened in California, Florida, \nMissouri, Maryland, or any other State. What is about to happen is a \ndisaster for the appropriations. What do I mean?\n  Well, first, out of that $6.7 billion, $4.6 billion will come from \nHousing and Urban Development, the one agency in our Federal Government \nthat has primary responsibility for the needs of the elderly, children, \ndisabled, and homeless. Also, $1.3 billion would be taken from EPA \nprograms designed to assist States in complying with safe drinking \nwater and wastewater treatment standards. It also will come from \nnational service, veterans care, and the National Science Foundation.\n  I know that the Senator from Missouri, in taking the money from HUD, \ntried to protect the most vulnerable--the homeless and the elderly--and \nI thank him for that. But still, it will take HUD's annual budget, \nwhich is over $26 billion, and this represents a 20-percent cut.\n  The VA subcommittee cannot be either the bank or the will-call window \nfor disaster relief. I believe it is bad policy. I also believe it is \nabsolutely unfair. What happens the next time disaster strikes? Will we \ncontinue to take it from HUD? Will we eliminate the National Science \nFoundation? Will we just shut down a few hospitals out of VA? I do not \nknow what will be done. What I do know, though, is that we anticipate \nmore disasters. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the probability of \nearthquakes only escalating and that there is a 80 to 90 percent \nprobability of another major earthquake in California within the next \n20 years.\n  There is the strong probability of earthquakes in San Francisco and \nother areas. How are we going to pay for this? I believe we need a \nrainy day fund. I believe we need an earthquake fund. That is why I \ndirect the authorizers to come up to deal with this.\n  This amendment is about fundamental fairness. Who pays? Who pays for \nnational disasters? Who pays for natural disasters? That is why I \nbelieve it should be borne by the entire Nation.\n  So, Mr. President, what this amendment does is try to show that it is \na new world order. We should not just fund things off budget and make \nout they do not exist, because we cannot keep racking up the deficit.\n  But, at the same time, I believe that one subcommittee should not be \nthe bankroller. That is why I offer what I originally called my 2 \npercent solution. I was able to lower that, and it essentially now is a \n1.72-percent across-the-board cut, exempting VA medical care, nutrition \nprograms, defense readiness and those administrative costs, and Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I could elaborate more on this. In the interest of \nmoving in an expeditious way, I will yield the floor, yet reserve the \ntime remaining for my side.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may require. I ask \nunanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in order on this \namendment prior to the motion to table, which I will make at the end of \nthe expiration of the time or yielding back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to thank my ranking member, Senator \nMikulski, and commend her.\n  I have appreciated her courtesy and the continuing cooperation that \nwe have had. I had the pleasure of serving on this committee when she \nwas the chair. I have only recently found how large a job it was.\n  She mentioned something about the hand we have been dealt. Both of \nus, as chair and ranking member, now have a very difficult hand to \nplay.\n  Senator Mikulski is extremely well informed and dedicated to the \nprograms in this subcommittee. Her congressional role as an \nappropriator and an overseer she does with extreme skill and dedication \nand concern. I have the highest regard for her and her staff. We have \nworked together to try to obtain information on these programs, which \nhas not been provided to members in a timely manner by the agencies, \nparticularly by HUD.\n  Having said that, I could not disagree more strongly with the \namendment that the Senator has offered. As I indicated, I will, at the \nappropriate time, move to table the amendment because, No. 1, this \namendment does nothing toward deficit reduction.\n  The message I believe the people of America sent last November is \nthat we have to get the deficit under control. That is No. 1. No. 2, \nand I think even more serious, is that this substitute for the measure \nreported out of the Appropriations Committee totally fails to address \nthe vital need to stop the out-of-control commitments by the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development for future spending which this \nCongress and this budget cannot afford.\n  That is why I think that this measure should be tabled. I will urge \nmy colleagues to do so.\n  Now, let me say something about the proposal of the VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies Subcommittee in the FEMA disaster relief \nsupplemental and rescission bill.\n  This chapter, our chapter, rescinds more than $6.8 billion and \nincludes a supplemental for FEMA disaster relief of $1.9 billion for \nthe current fiscal year and provides the balance of $6.7 billion \nrequested as an advance appropriation for FEMA for fiscal year 1996. \nThis will enable the Congress to monitor the utilization of the amount \nprovided before further releases of the contingency appropriation for \nthe next fiscal year.\n  With respect to the rescissions, the subcommittee's total of $6.8 \nbillion is more than half of the rescissions contained in this bill. As \nmy ranking member pointed out, this is a level that is almost double \nthe subcommittee's proportionate share of total nondefense \ndiscretionary spending.\n  However, the committee's recommendation is less than the House-passed \ntotal of $9.3 billion; it also substantially exceeds the President's \nrequest of only $648 million in rescissions.\n  Mr. President, the committee's recommendation reflects the urgency of \nbeginning the long and difficult task of curbing Federal spending. I am \nmindful that the Appropriations Committee has direct jurisdiction over \nonly one-third of the Federal budget, which is discretionary spending.\n  I certainly agree with those who point out that a balanced budget \ncannot be achieved in any way solely through cuts in discretionary \nspending. Let me be clear about that.\n  There can also be no doubt that further reductions can and must be \nmade in these activities if we are ever to erase our budget deficit, or \nhope to do so, and to stop passing on to our children and our \ngrandchildren the burdens of the debt that we were too profligate to \nstop running up during our stewardship of the Federal Government and \nits resources.\n  The formulation, the putting together of this large package of \nrescissions, has been difficult. The committee was limited in its \nrecommendation to funds which have not been obligated and which are not \nconstrained by concerns over disruption of important ongoing \nactivities.\n  Necessarily, we directed our focus toward rescissions which would not \nonly curb expenditures in the short term, but which would yield the \neffect of redirecting programs and terminating \n[[Page S4765]] activities to yield further savings in future years.\n  Finally, the committee's recommendations reflect our attempt to be as \nbalanced and as fair as possible. No major agency within our \njurisdiction was spared. Out of NASA, we took $150 million. Out of the \nNational Science Foundation, we took $132 million. Out of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, we took $100 million.\n  As noted, the largest reductions were taken in the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, $4.6 billion; and in the Environmental \nProtection Agency, from which $1.4 billion was taken--not because of a \npolicy of determination against these activities, but simply because of \nthe fact that these two agencies have the largest unobligated balances \nwhich can be rescinded and which will curb future year expenditure \ngrowth.\n  Now, a number of these reductions are painful. I have discussed these \nwith officials in the administration who wonder why we are making these \ncuts.\n  I have had calls especially with respect to termination of new \ninitiatives, such as the Community Development Financial Institutions \nProgram and halting previously planned expansions, such as National \nService or AmeriCorps. I also know that many of my colleagues would \nrather not deal with reductions in popular programs such as VA medical \ncare, no matter how modest.\n  However, Mr. President, let me be clear: If we are going to cut, we \nhave to cut something. There is nothing in this budget that was put in \nbecause people did not like it. Everything that was put in here was put \nin last year or in the years before because somebody argued \nsuccessfully that it was a good idea. We cannot cut spending without \ncutting things that have some support.\n  Frankly, with the budget crisis that we face, one of the things we \nhave had to do is put a hold on new commitments. Given the state of our \nbudget deficit and the tremendous debt that we have driven up, a debt \nwhich will hit $5 trillion and require Congress to raise the debt \nceiling before the summer is over, we have to start making some cuts no \nmatter how difficult they are.\n  It is clear we must make reductions now or face even greater cuts and \ndislocations in the future under a very constrained allocation for \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, two additional concerns have been raised over the \ngeneral approach of this supplemental and rescission measure. The first \nrelates to the prevailing sentiment that all supplementals, even \nemergencies which are or can be procedurally outside the caps, should \nbe offset by reductions in other discretionary spending. I accept and \nsupport this greater standard of budgetary discipline because we need \nto do it. It is a necessary step toward balancing our budget.\n  But we should be mindful that this revision in our current budgetary \npractice demands a reappraisal of how subcommittee allocations are \ntreated, since the bulk of emergency supplementals are provided for the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, which just happens to fall within \nthe jurisdiction of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee.\n  The fact that we have to increase appropriations for FEMA, in my view \nshould not mean that in the future we have to make cuts from very \nimportant programs in HUD, VA, NASA, and other agencies which are \ndisproportional to the cuts taken by other domestic discretionary \nprograms.\n  There is no way that our subcommittee can, in the future, be expected \nto pay for supplemental emergency requests for FEMA disaster relief. \nThe number of Presidential-declared disasters and the amount of funding \nfor such emergencies have been dramatically rising in recent years. A \ntotal of $14.8 billion has been appropriated in the last 5 years.\n  The pending supplemental bill carries the request of $6.7 billion, \nwhich is almost 10 percent of the entire discretionary allocation of \nthe subcommittee. We cannot be expected to offset such massive requests \nwithout dramatic impacts on other ongoing activities within our \njurisdiction in future budgets.\n  These are national disasters. My ranking member has pointed out the \nscope of these disasters. If they are paid for, resources should be \nidentified on a Federalwide basis, not just by one subcommittee which \nhappens to have FEMA within its jurisdiction. Matching such \nsupplementals with rescissions within the subcommittee should not and \ncannot be a precedent for how such needs will be addressed in the \nfuture.\n  Let me move to the second point, which is more complicated but has an \nequally clear answer. That is the concern that we are rescinding too \nmuch from HUD. The answer is simply ``no,'' we are not. Some have \nquestioned why HUD is being cut more than $4.6 billion, or two-thirds \nof the total rescission of $6.9 billion for the subcommittee. The \nanswer is simple. The cut is roughly proportionate to the Department's \navailable budgetary resources. Although HUD received new appropriations \nfor fiscal year 1995, that is the current spending year we are in, of \n$25.7 billion, HUD represents about 39 percent of the funding for our \nfour major agencies--almost $2 out of every $5--it also carried into \nthis fiscal year $35 billion in unobligated prior year balances. In \nfact, it carried more money in unobligated balances than we \nappropriated for this year. We could have the anomaly, even if we wiped \nout all new authority for HUD, that HUD could spend more than its \ncurrent year appropriation because of the unobligated balances. In \nother words, HUD has more than double its current fiscal year \nappropriation available in budgetary resources when you include the \nmassive amount of unspent, unobligated HUD funding.\n  Simple mathematics do not tell the whole story. We have to cut HUD. \nWe have to stop spending new dollars. The chairman of the committee, \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon, made the point very clearly. \nWhen we say ``cut'' in this context, we are not talking about throwing \npeople out of housing or imposing burdens on people now being served. \nWe are talking about cutting new commitments, additional spending \nrequests, commitments that could be extremely expensive over time and \nare not now undertaken.\n  We have to begin now, if there is any hope of surviving the very \nconstrained freeze minus future for discretionary funds that we expect \nto see throughout the appropriations committee and even in our \nsubcommittee.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recently analyzed the HUD reinvention \nblueprint and discovered that the cost of HUD-subsidized housing will \nincrease by over 50 percent under the President's plan over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Let me point out that currently, this year, we are spending $26.4 \nbillion. That is how much we are spending this year. The Congressional \nBudget Office--which as we will all recall, the President in 1993 said \nis the independent scorekeeper, the objective scorekeeper to whom we \nmust turn for the most honest, most accurate estimates of spending--\ntook a look at the information HUD provided at the time of the budget \nsubmission. There have been subsequent discussions and submissions, but \nbased on what HUD, through OMB and the President, presented to us, HUD \nspending would increase to $28 billion next year, $30.7 billion the \nfollowing, then $33.8, then $38.9 billion; by the year 2000, HUD-\nassisted housing would be $39.9 billion--50 percent more than we are \nspending this year. And, also, incidentally, the total of all these \nfive red bars would come to about $39 billion. So we would be adding \n$39 billion to the national debt over 5 years, according to CBO's \nestimate.\n  Unless we act now to curb the spiraling growth in outlays, we are \ngoing to have to make some very draconian cuts in the near future and \nbe in a position where we cannot honor commitments made to those in \npublic and assisted housing.\n  As I have indicated, I have had meetings with the Secretary of HUD \nand the Director of OMB. We have gone over many of these questions. \nThey have promised us additional details, which we have not yet had an \nopportunity to see and analyze. They have said they will meet with the \nCongressional Budget Office to explain and perhaps even suggest \nrevisions. But let me point out, even under the President's own budget \nsubmission, the President asked for HUD to be increased by $20 billion \nin budget authority over the next 5 years \n[[Page S4766]] and by $14 billion in outlays. The President is asking \nus, at a time when we know that discretionary spending must be kept \nunder control, to increase outlays, to increase actual spending, by his \nown numbers, by $14 billion.\n  I suggest there is no way we can do that. I suggest we are faced with \na difficult--but a simple--solution, and that is turn off the pipeline \nof new subsidized units. That is the fundamental focus of the \ncommittee's recommendations for this rescission bill. We are also \nrecommending a portion of the funds rescinded by the House be restored, \nand that we redirect resources to another urgent priority; namely, the \nrestoring of budgetary sanity to this out-of-control department. We say \ngo ahead with the programs to demolish the failed housing developments \nand put the rest on a sound footing to survive the competition and the \nsubsidy reductions coming down the pike.\n  Some of my colleagues have said we do not need to deal with severely \ndistressed public housing. This is one area where I believe I agree \nvery strongly with the Secretary of HUD. There is no greater problem in \nmany of our communities than the uninhabitable, often vacant, \nthoroughly unlivable, large public housing units in many of our \nmetropolitan areas today. Too many of them have become havens for \ncrime, for drugs, and violence. They are not only not a safe place to \nraise a family, they are a great danger to the neighbors who live in \nthe vicinity and they are tremendous blots on the landscape of our \nmajor metropolitan areas.\n  To me, this is an investment in the future which must be made now if \nwe are to stop some of the spread of blight that has been generated by \npoorly maintained and poorly conceived projects of the past.\n  Amid all the debate over the future of HUD, it is important to keep \nin mind that over 4.8 million families receive Federal housing \nassistance, and over half of them are elderly or disabled. It is also \nimportant to note that such housing assistance is expensive.\n  As I said, $26 billion in current year fiscal year 1995 outlays and \ncurrent costs are rising. In fact, with the long-term contractual \ncommitments previously made by HUD the Government is currently \nobligated to pay over $187 billion over the life of these contracts, \nsome stretching out 40 years.\n  Many of my colleagues have approached me to express grave concern \nover some of the battles of the press releases in the State \ndemonstrations characterizing those of us who wish to cut HUD's new \ncommitments as being ready to throw people who are getting assisted \nhousing out on the street, having no concern for the people who are \nassisted by HUD. I am told that C-SPAN carried a program this weekend \nthat featured HUD officials but it also featured special interest \ngroups and local officials who want to spend as if there was no \ntomorrow, who think that we cannot spend enough money on HUD and its \nprograms to satisfy them.\n  Frankly, let us be clear that we are sensitive to and very concerned \nabout the obligations and the undertakings of HUD. That is why we want \nto make sure that they do the job properly. It is I think not helpful \nfor those who would be advocates for the programs of HUD to make the \nkinds of irresponsible charges that some local officials have made. \nThat does not advance the level of discussion. That does not assist in \nhelping us formulate responsible programs given the long-term nature of \nthe obligations and commitments. Halting the budgetary growth of the \nDepartment can only be accomplished with a focused, determined, \nmultiyear effort. Unless we begin now with this bill we will lock \nourselves into another multibillion-dollar chunk of long-term budget \nobligations.\n  This is only a first step, one of many in which we will go beyond the \nlimited fixes in cuts that can be accomplished in a rescission bill. We \nhave to enact through the authorizing committee major reform \nlegislation later this year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Appropriations \nCommittee, my colleagues on the authorizing committee and other \ninterested Members in this body in formulating a responsible program. \nBut we are not going to be able to adopt a responsible program if we \nallow the budget to continue to spin out of control to run up \nobligations and commitments now that will cost us billions of dollars \nwe do not have in the future. Only if we put a tourniquet on the \nbleeding and stop the new commitments can we make sure that our \nrestorative work, our surgery and our treatment of the patient, a very \nsick patient of HUD, can be successful.\n  I will ask my colleagues to join me in a motion to table. But for the \nmoment, I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 47 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know that there are others who wish to \nspeak. While we are waiting for them to come, I want to comment on the \ncomments of my colleague, the Senator from Missouri.\n  First, the Senator said that the Mikulski substitute does nothing for \ndeficit reduction. I respectfully disagree with that because you see \nunder the rules of the 1985 Budget Act, disasters, if declared by the \nPresident as an emergency, do not have to be paid for. President \nClinton declared these disasters in the FEMA supplemental an emergency. \nSo, therefore, under the rules of the Budget Act, they could be placed \non the discretionary spending. Yes. Added to the deficit but it will \nnot count against the appropriation.\n  My bill maintains the President's declaration of an emergency and a \ndisaster. But in the interest of deficit reduction we are willing to \npay for it. Therefore, this $6.7 billion does not go off into some \nlimbo and yet add to the deficit. It will be both through my substitute \na pay-as-you-go. It will be a one-time only pay-as-you-go through this \nacross the board with the prospective establishment of a rainy day \nfund.\n  So you see. I believe that the Mikulski substitute which is a pay-as-\nyou-go substitute does reduce the deficit by $6.7 billion. There is a \ngreat deal of debate about what this rescission money will be used for. \nIs it going to be used for deficit reduction or is it going to be used \nfor tax cuts to be offered by the other party? There are those of us \nwho support deficit reduction and, therefore, know that if that is the \npoint of the rescission package we will look for elements to do the \ndeficit reduction, but here is a whole other substantial school of \nthought within this institution led by the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Robert Byrd, who says ``yes'' to deficit reduction but ``no'' \nfor the savings to be done on tax cuts. I will not debate the points \nthat Senator Byrd wishes to bring to the body's attention later this \nafternoon. He will do it in his own usual eloquent, persuasive way. But \nI believe the Mikulski substitute does, because we are doing pay-as-\nyou-go not by putting it off budget but with $6.7 billion for deficit \nreduction.\n  Do I go as far as the House? No. Do I go as far as the Hatfield-Bond \nlegislation? The answer is no. The House went to $17 billion. The \nefforts by the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nHatfield, and the subcommittee, Senator Bond, goes to $13 billion. But \nwhen I knew I was going to try to deal with this problem by an across-\nthe-board cut, I did not want to gouge other subcommittees by paying--\nfor the fact that we do not have a mechanism for a rainy day fund. So I \nkept it under what I called the Mikulski 12.2-percent solution. Sure. I \ncould have come up with more rescissions to do an across-the-board. But \nI did not want to gouge the criminal justice system. I did not want to \ngouge Labor, HHS. I did not want to gouge the important funding that \nneeds to go on in defense.\n  So that is why my amendment is so modest. It is 1.7 percent. It is \nabsolutely modest. I say to my colleagues, I do not like across-the-\nboard cuts either. Hopefully we can do this with line-item evaluations. \nIt is natural disaster funding that should be borne by the Nation doing \nthis across-the-board cut.\n  I can comment on other aspects of it. But I note that the \ndistinguished chairman, ranking minority of the authorizing committee, \nSenator Sarbanes, is on the floor. He is interrupting his other \nimportant work to be here.\n   [[Page S4767]] So I will yield the floor and yield to Senator \nSarbanes such time as he might consume to elaborate on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 41 minutes and 67 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield me 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \namendment that has been offered by my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland, the substitute amendment to the supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  First of all, traditionally we have considered disaster relief \nmeasures as an emergency supplemental and handled that way, if I am \ncorrect. I believe that is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The last six or seven disaster supplementals over the \nlast few years have all been handled in that fashion, I believe.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is correct. They total $22 billion. They have been \nfunded off budget as prescribed by law as the President declares it an \nemergency disaster.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, the President declared this \nsupplemental request an emergency disaster.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The President has declared it an emergency disaster and \ntherefore follows the same procedure under the law.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is happening is that there is a move afoot to, in \neffect, cover the amounts needed for the disaster relief.\n  Now, I have obviously some questions about this decision on the basis \nof past practice, but let me pass beyond that issue and simply address \nthe manner in which disaster spending is being covered in the proposed \nsupplemental appropriations bill before us. A very heavy proportion of \nthe disaster spending amount in the supplemental is being taken out of \nthe allocation to the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in which the \nFEMA funding is located.\n  Now, it is my understanding that more is coming out of that \nsubcommittee than the cost of the disaster relief that is before us. \nSo, in effect, this particular subcommittee, which by chance has \njurisdiction over FEMA, is absorbing the entire additional amount given \nto FEMA for disaster relief out of the allocations for the other \nagencies under its jurisdiction.\n  This just does not make sense. It leads to great inequities that a \ndisproportionate burden is borne by the other agencies within the \njurisdiction of that subcommittee.\n  I am particularly concerned because I have a responsibility with \nrespect to the authorization of housing programs. The housing \ndepartment finds itself within that grouping of agencies that are \ncovered by the arbitrary differentiations that are made within the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  If there is anything that calls for the kind of approach that the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland has taken, it is handling disaster \nrelief. Obviously, if you are going to cut other programs to pay for \ndisaster assistance, the burden of these cuts ought to be borne across \nthe board. There is no rationale, no logical or rational reason, why \npaying for the disaster relief ought to come out of those few agencies \nthat happen to be grouped with the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nfor purposes of handling an appropriations bill.\n  Providing for disaster relief must be done; I support this \nsupplemental for disaster relief. In fact, I would support doing it as \nan emergency the way the President submitted it to the Congress. If, in \neffect, the cost of the disaster is going to be covered by diminishing \nother accounts--and we are talking about the very fiscal year in which \nwe find ourselves--I do not think that the disaster spending ought to \nbe covered out of those agencies that are grouped within this \nparticular Appropriations subcommittee. That is illogical, not logical, \nand that is inequitable, not equitable.\n  The amendment that has been put before us would recognize that \nnational disasters are a national responsibility. It would avoid \nsetting a precedent, that you are going to pay for disasters out of the \naccounts of this particular subcommittee. With the bill before us, you \nare going to establish a precedent that makes this particular \nsubcommittee the window to which you go for all future disaster relief. \nWhat is the logic in that? We could just as easily put FEMA over into \nthe Defense Subcommittee. We could combine FEMA with emergency \npreparedness which covers not only disaster relief, but other \nemergencies. At one point, FEMA's prime responsibility was to address \nquestions of how we would react to a nuclear attack. So maybe FEMA \nshould be put in the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and then, if \nyou followed the principle that is being used here, when we have a \nnational disaster, we would pay for it entirely out of the defense \nbudget.\n  I am not arguing that should be done. I am only making that point to \nillustrate the lack of logic of what has been done in the supplemental \nappropriations bill that is before us. This is not the way to handle \nthe funding of disasters. I very much hope the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Maryland--which I think provides a much more equitable way of \npaying for disasters--passes. This amendment is an across-the-board cut \nwith respect to all agencies and departments. It is a much more \nsensible way to go about this at this time. An across-the-board cut may \nnot be the best way to pay for disasters in the future. I know the \nSenator from Maryland has pushed the notion of providing an \nanticipatory mechanism to meet future disasters. Under that approach \nyou would set up a fund and appropriate to it in anticipation of future \ndisasters since it is fairly reasonable to hypothesize that there will \nbe natural disasters at some time. Natural disasters do occur on a \nperiodic basis, and we need to address them. An advanced funding \nmechanism would be a better way of doing it.\n  However, that is not now before us. Confronted with the problem that \nwe have, I think this amendment makes a great deal of sense and is \ncertainly a far preferable approach than the one contained in the \nlegislation that is now pending.\n  Therefore, I very strongly support Senator Mikulski's substitute \namendment and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for speaking in behalf of this \namendment. He makes excellent points, particularly the consequences to \nthe housing programs and the compelling needs we have to meet. I thank \nhim for interrupting his schedule.\n  How much time would the Senator from California like to have?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Seven minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the distinguished Senator from California, \nwho has faced her share of earthquakes and slides and really knows what \nthese issues are, 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I thank her for her \nleadership in giving this Senate a really fine alternative to the bill \nthat is before us. I certainly want to associate myself with Senator \nSarbanes' remarks, and I will try not to repeat them but to be very \nspecific on why I feel the Mikulski substitute is so preferable to the \ncommittee-reported bill.\n  First of all, why are we here? We are here on this bill because we \nhave had disasters in this Nation, certainly in California more than \nour fair share, that required payments to the local governments, the \nlocal people. We have buildings that need to be repaired from \nearthquakes. We have buildings that need to be repaired from floods. \nThis is happening not only in California but across this great Nation. \nWe have predictions, as the Senator from Maryland said, for other \ndisasters, and I wish to make a point to my colleague, Senator \nMikulski, of which perhaps she is not aware.\n  If I might make a point to the Senator on this issue of the future \nprojections of disasters, what is very interesting is that the USGS has \nlooked at the earthquake situation and not only do they predict a \nterrible earthquake in California sometime in the future, but they also \ntalk about a devastating earthquake in Seattle and one in the \nmidsection of the country from the Tennessee fault.\n   [[Page S4768]] So I stand here as a Californian, but I also say to \nmy friend that other areas in this Nation are very apt to be visited by \nthese crises. I wonder if she was aware of that study.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am aware of the study. We spoke about \nthe work being done by the Geological Survey of the Department of the \nInterior that is trying to develop sophisticated methods for earthquake \nprediction. They are predicting future--within the next decade or so--\nsevere earthquakes on the west coast but possibly in the Midwest \nitself. I might add, you never know when an earthquake is going to hit. \nAs the Senator knows, the State of Maryland is not an earthquake State. \nWe are more a hurricane State.\n  Yet we had earthquakes in a small county in the Baltimore \nmetropolitan area. It was shocking. Fortunately, we had no major loss \nof property and no loss of life.\n  So, yes, we have to be ready to stand centrally on the whole issue of \nearthquakes, but we do need that rainy day fund.\n  I thank the Senator for reiterating the report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it is so key here, because when \nsomeone who is an expert says that this country is going to be visited \nby floods and earthquakes and other disasters, we cannot just throw up \nour hands.\n  Why are we doing this particular bill at this particular time? \nClearly, the President asked for $6.7 billion. The U.S. Senate has \ndecided to go beyond that and cut out $13 billion--$6.7 for FEMA, the \nadded extra billions just because they wanted to cut more.\n  I point out, as Senator Mikulski has, that since 1988, Congress has \nenacted seven major disaster bills and none has been offset. This has \nbeen done over earthquakes and floods and storms across this Nation, \nwith Republican Presidents as well as Democratic. I suggest to my \ncolleagues, this is not a partisan issue.\n  We need to be ready for these disasters. So I support that part of \nthe bill to be ready for the disasters. But, on the other hand, I have \nto say to my friends, we should make this a clean bill. We should give \nthe President the money that he needs to meet these disasters and then \nhave another bill that looks at rescissions and not hold these \ncommunities hostage.\n  Let me explain what I mean.\n  What we are doing, for the first time in history, is going beyond \nwhat even the President has asked and cutting all these other programs. \nI know a lot of my colleagues are thrilled to do it. They are thrilled \nto do it. But I want to point out what it does to California.\n  It hurts my people. And I hear, ``Well, wait a minute, Senator. You \nare the ones who have all these disasters.'' That is true, and we need \nthat FEMA money.\n  But you should see what these cuts do to the people of California, to \nthe children, to the children of California-- taking computers that \nwere going into classrooms. They are not going to be able to put them \nthere. Rescinding the summer jobs program for our kids, which is so \nimportant.\n  I visited some of these young people who had the benefit of these \njobs. What a way to slash and burn, using as an excuse, you know, the \nFEMA requests.\n  The House bill was even worse. I compliment my friends. They made \nthis a little bit better. But it still hurts. It hurts business. It \nhurts jobs.\n  Let me tell you, the Community Development Financial Institutions \nFund program account, this gives credit to businesses to expand, to \ncreate jobs. Cut severely. EDA creates jobs. We are looking at a cut in \nCalifornia here and across the Nation. The National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, these are funds that help our manufacturers. \nIt is very successful. It is cut. It is going to be hurt. And that is \ngoing to hurt my State's economy.\n  Slashing funds from the Base Alignment and Closure Commission, needed \ndesperately to clean up these bases, to move them into productivity. \nCut, slashed, and burned.\n  EPA, safe drinking water. Some people do not like it. They say it \ngoes too far. Well, let me tell you what is going to happen here. We \nare going to have big problems in my State. In L.A., in Lake County, in \nSan Diego, water cleanup. We need to clean up the water. People need to \nbe able to drink the water. This bill slashes that program.\n  Agriculture: $1.5 million cut from the new USDA salinity research \nlab. And all farmers know that controlling that salt water incursion is \nvery important to them. That is going to hurt our farmers.\n  Interior: We know that some of our threatened species will not be \nlisted. Again, some people here hate this Endangered Species Act. They \nwant to see it destroyed. Well, do not back-door it by doing these \nkinds of cuts. Let us have the debate. Let us find out where the \nAmerican people are on saving the bald eagle. I will take you on in \nthat fight any day. But, no, it sneaks in this bill back-door.\n  There is a $35 million cut from solar and renewable energy research. \nThat makes a lot of sense. The biggest cause of our trade deficit is \nimported oil. Why do we want to hurt these alternative energy programs? \nAgain, if you want to debate it, let us bring it on to the floor. But \nthis is done in a back-door approach.\n  I told you about education--$6 million in Federal funds lost to my \nState to be used for innovative programs emphasizing math and reading.\n  How about a cut in title I funds for educating our most disadvantaged \nkids? Mr. President, 8,500 California students are going to suffer from \nthis cut.\n  How about this one: Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program for drug \nprevention. I cannot believe that Senators want to cut that program. \nEveryone stands up here and says, ``Drugs, they are a curse on our \nsociety.'' It is in here, a $100 million cut from that program. My \nState loses $10 million. Ninety-seven percent of all school districts \nin California benefit from this program, keeping drugs away from kids \nby teaching them. I do not get it. I do not get where that makes sense \nfor this great Nation.\n  Sixty-nine million dollars for teacher training under the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program--Eisenhower, a great Republican \nPresident who understood the need for math and science. As a matter of \nfact, it was Eisenhower who wrote the Defense Education Act. And do you \nknow what he said, a military man? ``You can have all the bombers you \nwant. If you do not have smart kids who can read and can write and can \ndo math, this country will never be the greatest country on Earth.'' \nWell, they are slashing and burning from that program too.\n  I told you about computers in the classroom. I know many of us go \naround to schools. These computers open up the eyes of these children. \nOh, we are cutting that program, too, $5 million for education \ntechnology programs. We are going to lose $500,000 in our State. That \ngoes a long way.\n  You know, if there is any consensus around this place, I would have \nhoped it would have been around the children.\n  There is a $42 million cut from Head Start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator for an additional minute to wrap up.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator an additional minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have cuts in Head Start. We have cuts in child care. \nWe have cuts in national service--national service. Again, I urge my \ncolleagues, go speak to those volunteers from AmeriCorps. And my friend \nSenator Mikulski was so instrumental in that. I cannot believe we are \ncutting that program, because it was working out there. I have so many \npersonal stories I could tell about AmeriCorps.\n  I met a young man who was shot in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. \nAn Americorps volunteer visited him in the hospital every single day, \ngot him on the right path, got him back to school. And we are going to \ncut AmeriCorps.\n  So let me just say, in closing, I thank my friend, Senator Mikulski, \nfor giving us a chance to substitute spending cuts that are fairly done \nacross the board, that do not hurt the children, that do not hurt the \nbusinesses, that do not hurt jobs, that do not hurt the environment. I \ncannot tell the Senator how pleased I am to support her in this \namendment.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n   [[Page S4769]] Let me just follow up on some of the points so \neloquently made by my good friend from California. She was kind enough \nto invoke the memory of President Eisenhower. You have to have a pretty \ngood memory, because after World War II, I believe that was probably \nabout the last time we balanced a budget around here and stopped \nrunning a deficit that adds to the debts of our children.\n  She has made a very strong argument for every spending dollar that we \nhave. She said it is all being spent just properly and we can take an \neven cut across the board. Frankly, I hope that we have come beyond \nthat point where we can say that the only way to cut is to \ncut across the board. We have seen examples in recent years \nof how various agencies can look at programs and \nmake cuts to programs that are not working or that have been \noverappropriated.\n  The current administration calls it Reinventing Government. The \ncurrent administration has asked that we cut $5 billion from NASA, not \nacross the board, not across from everything. They are asking the \nAdministrator, and I believe we are going to support him, to take a \nlook at where cuts can be made, not across the board, not off of \neverything, but combined activities, combined areas where cuts can best \nbe made because we cannot keep spending like money is going out of \nstyle or our dollar will go out of style.\n  Our friend from California mentioned taking computers away from \nchildren. Computers are very important for children, but I have been in \nschools where I have seen rows and rows of computers sitting on empty \ndesks with no children in front of them.\n  I cannot address all of the cuts made in other parts of the bill, and \nI will rely on my colleagues who serve on those subcommittees to talk \nabout those, but let me talk about the cuts in EPA. We have cut money \nthat was funded for a program that was not authorized last year. We \nhave left in the safe drinking water funds for EPA the amount of money \nthat the administration has requested for next year on the hope that we \nwill reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act and be able to spend that \nmoney. We are not cutting jobs, we are cutting money that cannot be \nspent.\n  My colleagues talked about the hurt, what a tremendous hurt is being \nimposed by cutting off some of the Federal spending. Let me tell you \nabout the hurt that is going to be inflicted on our country and on \nfuture generations if we continue to build this deficit. We have a \ncommitment to spend far more than we are taking in and, unfortunately, \nwe have no leadership from the President in cutting that spending. He \nraised taxes and promised to cut spending, and his budget projections \nshow our spending increasing $366 billion over the next 5 years. He \nwould add $1 trillion to the national debt.\n  What about the hurt of that $1 trillion added on to almost $5 \ntrillion that we have now? That is a tremendous burden for future \ngenerations to carry, and we have seen what happened to our neighbor to \nthe south when they spent more money than they had. The international \nmarket said the peso is weak. They did not get their economic house in \norder, and there is a crisis in Mexico.\n  What has happened in Mexico to the peso could happen in the United \nStates to the dollar. The dollar has fallen against the value of the \nyen, lost almost a third of its value because the international markets \nthink we are not getting serious about cutting spending.\n  We are cutting spending here to get our house in order, and we are \nalso trying to fund supplemental emergency appropriations for \ndisasters. Disaster spending over recent years has been about $19 \nbillion. I am pleased that we heard about how important it is to \nCalifornia, because you know how much of that went to California? Mr. \nPresident, $11 billion. Sixty percent of the money that we have spent \non disasters has gone to California--$11 billion.\n  We are stepping up to the table to meet the needs of our friends and \nneighbors in California, as this body stepped up to help the people in \nthe State of Missouri and the Midwest when we were struck by floods. \nBut when we make those cuts, Mr. President, I suggest that the only \nresponsible way to make cuts is to eliminate low-priority items, to \neliminate money that is not being spent or that does not need to be \nspent or, as we are doing in this bill, to cut spending that we cannot \nafford for the future.\n  That is why I believe that all these wonderful arguments do not hold \nany water when you look at the cuts that are made in the portion of the \nbill before us today; that is HUD, VA, and independent agencies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President. I know we are awaiting to \nhear from the leadership their advice on the hot line as to when they \nwish to establish the vote. I believe the vote will occur sometime \nwithin the next half an hour.\n  While we are waiting for that, I know one other Senator wishes to \nspeak.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Mikulski \namendment.\n  I am concerned that the programs of the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee are taking an inordinate cut in the rescission package \nbefore us. If we are to pay for disasters, and not declare these as \nemergencies, then the spending for these should come from a broader \nbase of programs. The Mikulski amendment's 1.72-percent cut is an \nappropriate way to spread the cost of natural disasters.\n  The amendment would exempt important accounts from the cut. This \nacross-the-board cut would not hit administrative costs for Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It would not cut defense readiness. It would not \ncut veterans medical care. It would not hurt the food and nutrition \nprograms.\n  I am particularly concerned about the rescission package because the \nbrunt of the cuts will fall on the programs of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. This bill before us would cut $4.6 \nbillion from HUD's programs. This cut represents 18 percent of HUD's \n1995 appropriation and 35 percent of this entire rescission package.\n  This cut would injure important HUD programs like public housing \nmodernization, an important pension fund demonstration, and section 8 \nvouchers that help us meet the housing needs of the poorest of the \npoor. All of these programs are serving to help us with reforming HUD. \nModernization is critical for fixing up public housing, the pension \nfund demonstration is helping us dispose of the HUD-owned inventory, \nand the vouchers are important tools in helping us solve the problems \nof mixing the elderly and the young mentally disabled in public housing \nas well as helping us relocate people when we tear down the older, \ndilapidated stock.\n  I also urge the Members to look at the situation that these specific \ncuts will set up for next year. Many are sighing a sigh of relief that \nthe cuts in the Senate bill were not as draconian as the House cuts, \nbut by taking these resources away today, the programs in the VA-HUD \nsubcommittee will be under even greater pressure next year--these \ninclude not only HUD and EPA, but also NASA and veterans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Mikulski amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we debate this substitute, I want to, \nagain, say that there are two issues that the Senator from Missouri and \nI absolutely agree on. First, that we need to reform HUD, and the \nother, that FEMA must have a rainy day fund.\n  If I can just comment on the need to reform HUD, the Senator from \nMissouri is absolutely right about the need to organizationally reform \nHUD and then to deal with the conflicting and confusing budget \ninformation we receive that is demonstrated on the Senator's charts \npresented by CBO.\n  First, what my colleagues might be interested to know is that I was \none of the ones to talk about reforming HUD before the Cisneros plan \ncame in. When I chaired the subcommittee, I actually commissioned a \nreport by the National Association of Public Administrators to identify \nwhat are the areas to do that. I am happy that the Senator from \nMissouri and his very competent staff have also picked up on that.\n  In essence, what they said was that HUD was an organizational \ndisaster. They have over 240 different programs, sometimes serving such \na narrow need \n[[Page S4770]] that it becomes dysfunctional from a managerial \nstandpoint. HUD has been crippled not by us trying only to meet \ncompelling human needs, but HUD has been crippled by the passion of \nboth Members of the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle to \npursue trophies: ``Let's come up with a program for this. The new \ntrophy is new programs.'' A line item for this, a line item program for \nthat.\n  So I look forward to working with the authorizing committees, as well \nas my colleague on the Appropriations Committee, to move HUD from these \n240 different programs often with their own bureaucracy to six programs \nand that needs to be done in an orderly, methodical, prudent way.\n  Then there is the second issue about the question about the so-called \nCBO scoring and about OMB.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of time, I will not go through these \ndetailed commentaries that I have received from the Office of \nManagement and Budget. But there is a great deal of difference between \nwhat the assumptions are by the Congressional Budget Office and by the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  They use technocratic words and I believe I like to use diner \nvocabulary. Essentially, from the diner's standpoint, we need to get \nOMB and CBO to resolve their assumptions. The Senator is right, there \nis absolute confusion over what we need to pay for, what we need to pay \nfor in the future and whether there is a train wreck.\n  So I do not dispute the nature of his argument, nor am I here to \ndefend OMB against CBO. Believe me, I am going to let those people with \ngreen eyeshades and bifocals far better calibrated than mine to get \ninto a room and actually advise the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee and myself as to what are the real assumptions, so that we \ncan come up with a real appropriation.\n  However, at the request of Dr. Rivlin, I will put into the Record her \nconcerns about the differences between CBO and OMB.\n  What I am concerned about, though, is the $4 billion cut. While we \nunderstand that the prospective aspects are troubling, two programs are \ncut: $835 million for modernization of public housing, though it does \nleave $2.5 billion in this account; $90 million for lead-based paint \nhazard reduction.\n  Mr. President, I have been concerned for some time that HUD itself, \nin many cities, is the biggest slum landlord in that town. It often has \nlead paint that has been there for a number of years, and we do know \nthat lead paint and flaking of lead paint does have negative health \ndamages. Also, we know that much of the public housing is obsolete and \nis very much in need of modernization if it is going to be fit for \nduty. Those two items, I believe, would give one cause and concern \nabout that.\n  The other areas that I am concerned about is the issue of national \nservice. I have often been teased and called the mother of national \nservice, and I honor that because, you see, national service is not \njust one more Government program. Many might think that, but it was \nmeant to be a new social movement. It was designed to deal with certain \nissues before us. No. 1, that for many college students, their first \nmortgage, their first debt, is their student loans. Many of our young \npeople are loaned $10,000, $15,000, $20,000. Also, we are faced with \nthe declining ethic of voluntarism in our society, and also such \ncompelling need that we cannot meet it all by more Government programs.\n  So, therefore, what national service is--and it was a bipartisan \neffort that passed it; and, yes, President Clinton amplified it--it \nenables young people to volunteer and work in the service of the United \nStates of America, primarily working in nonprofits, to pay off student \ndebt, but also to make a sweat equity investment in the United States \nof America.\n  Last year, we funded it for $200 million. I believe over 20,000 \nvolunteers are now working. It is the first year that the program is \nfully operational. I am concerned that the cut in national service \nwill, No. 1, devastate the program and, No. 2, be a deterrent for \nvolunteers, community service people, even applying because they think \nthe money will not be there.\n  This is not some Great Society program. This is not a handout or \nanother Government gimmick and social engineering. It is about \ninstilling the habits of the heart in our young people, making sure \nthat they help and volunteer, getting lots of benefit out of their \nvolunteer community service. I really like the fact that it is \nprimarily in nonprofits and not in big bureaucracies and that we now do \nnot know the full impact of helping these young people learn these \nhabits of the heart. Because like with the Peace Corps, long after they \nleft volunteer service in a foreign country, they came home and kept \nthat spirit of voluntarism right here and made important contributions \nin the private sector in philanthropic work. I am concerned about the \ncuts in national service. I could elaborate, but I believe the time is \nshort.\n  I am going to yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time \nand see if the leadership has decided that they would like to vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think there has been agreement on both \nsides that the vote occur at 1:15 p.m. today. I have just a few \ncomments. I do not believe there are any further speakers on this side. \nI had a few comments, and after that I will be prepared, if my \ndistinguished ranking member is, to yield the remainder of the time, \nask for the yeas and nays, and ask unanimous consent that the vote be \nheld at 1:15.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object. I will not object to the \nconsent. I have been notified that Senator Baucus of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee wanted to speak between 1 and 1:10. So if I \ncould not yield back all of my time and reserve the right, should he be \nhere, I am in absolute agreement to having the vote at 1:15.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of \n1:15 I be recognized to offer a motion to table and that after the yeas \nand nays are granted, there be a vote at 1:15 on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my ranking member for accommodating me. This is a \nvery important amendment because it does go to the philosophy of the \napproach that was taken in the Appropriations Committee. The ranking \nmember has offered a different approach.\n  I just want to touch very briefly on a couple of things she mentioned \nso that my colleagues will understand what we are doing.\n  We took $90 million out of lead paint. Why did we do something like \nthat? Are we not concerned about lead paint? You bet we are concerned \nabout lead paint. There is an ongoing $10 million study of the best way \nto establish standards for removing lead paint. Yes, we need to get \nlead paint out, but we are not going to spend that $90 million until we \nknow the best way to do it. I ask the distinguished occupant of the \nchair if he remembers the tremendous amount of money we spent and \nwasted on removing asbestos because we acted first, without thinking \nabout it and without planning and getting the best scientific \ninformation? Yes, we took $90 million out, but it is $90 million that \nwe cannot spend.\n  Modernization for public housing. Yes, we recommended taking $836 \nmillion out of the modernization fund, about 20 percent--a little more \nthan that--and it would still leave over $3 billion. We also proposed \nto do something also to let local housing authorities do the \nmodernization without playing ``mother may I'' with HUD.\n  HUD is an agency that cannot manage itself, and it has not done a \ngood job of managing the decisions of local public housing authorities. \nI will be proposing in the authorizing committee a bill to change the \nway we do this and to say that unless the public housing authority \nfails on the basic standards that we set, the PHMAP standards we set \nseveral years ago, we are going to let them exercise their discretion \nin how to utilize funds made available. We believe that even with $836 \nmillion less, they can do a far better job if HUD is off their backs.\n  My distinguished ranking member has mentioned the national service, \nor AmeriCorps, a program very near and dear to her heart. Let me say \nthat we have cut almost in half the proposed rescissions proposed by \nthe House. The House wanted to slash it deeply. In our \n[[Page S4771]] committee, we are asking that the funding be kept level \nso we can find out if the program works. Yes, they are spending money \nright now. They have hired people. We would allow them to continue \nthroughout this year. But I think before we go charging down the road \nand say we can have a 40- or 50-percent increase, actually in the year \nbeginning with the school year, we ought to find out if it works. I \nhave had people call me and tell me about one or two instances where \nvery good things were done. I like to encourage volunteers. There have \nbeen instances where the National Service Corps volunteers have worked \nwith true volunteers, not people being paid, but people who are really \nvolunteers.\n  I like the concept of VISTA, because VISTA enabled us to provide \nresources to organize volunteers. I believe in voluntarism. We have \nliterally hundreds of millions of people who are volunteers every year, \nand not because they are paid in a program that provides over $25,000 a \nyear, more than the median wage. That is not a volunteer, that is a \npublic employment job.\n  I have heard other questions raised and suggestions that maybe \nAmeriCorps, national service corps is not working well. I suggest that \nwe not throw a lot more money at it until we see if it works. That is \nwhy we are willing in the measure before us that was passed out of the \nAppropriations Committee, to let the program continue throughout this \nyear, so we can find out how it works and to see whether the \nsupporters, my ranking member, or the skeptics, myself and others, are \nright and make the decisions then.\n  That is the philosophy, Mr. President, that we followed, trying to \ncut things where spending was not critical, trying to stop commitments \nfor new spending that will bankrupt America in the future. That is our \nphilosophy.\n  I also want to mention that I have had discussions with the ranking \nmember. We are working on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to set up a \nrainy day fund or a California disaster fund, and to encourage a study \nof the way we do it, to begin to set aside money to start reforms in \nFEMA.\n  I believe that this is the road we must go. A report was prepared by \nthe task force which the Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, and I \nchaired last session, to report on the confused and conflicting means \nthat the Federal Government has gone about assisting in disasters.\n  Is it really assistance or have we thrown a lot of money out the \ndoor? We need to take a hard look at that disaster assistance approach \nand make sure that the money we spend on disasters is well spent.\n  There is no question about the outpouring of concern and sympathy in \nthis body when a severe disaster strikes. And FEMA has gotten much \nbetter. They get the dollars out the door very quickly.\n  First, we need to look and make sure the dollars are going where they \nactually do some good and are not wasted; and, second, we need to keep \nour control on the Federal budget to make sure we do so in a \nresponsible way.\n  I think something like the rainy day fund that my colleague from \nMaryland has suggested is a good idea, so we would set aside a set \namount of money each year. We do not know where the disasters will \nstrike. We do not know whether it is a flood, hurricane, tornado, or an \nearthquake. Earthquakes are not just located in California. Earthquakes \ncan hit the east coast. Earthquakes have occurred, of a very \nsignificant magnitude, in my home State of Missouri in the Midwest.\n  There are many, many, types of disasters each year. They are \ndifferent kinds, and we know $1 to $2 billion will be spent. Maybe we \nought to have a separate line in the budget, a 14th department that is \ndisasters, and set it aside. It could be appropriated so that it comes, \nnot from this one subcommittee's jurisdiction, but from across the \nboard.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Maryland and other \ncolleagues as we attempt to reform FEMA to make sure the money is spent \nwell and within the budget constraints.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Mikulski amendment which \nwould replace the rescissions in the supplemental appropriations bill \nwith a 1.72-percent across-the-board reduction of domestic spending to \npay for the $6.7 billion in emergency disaster relief activities to \ndeal with the 1994 earthquake in California.\n  The legislation before the Senate cuts too deeply into necessary \nprograms, particularly those affecting children and low-income \nfamilies. We should and must be prepared to pay for emergency \noperations of the Federal Government during such natural disasters as \nthe earthquake, and the numerous hurricanes, floods, fires, and other \ndisasters which like this one have national scope. Also, we should and \nmust be prepared to reduce the size of government and to continue the \nbudget discipline necessary to reduce the size of the Federal budget \nand to continue the 3 consecutive years of reduction in the Federal \ndeficit. However, this should not be used as an excuse for a hard-\nhearted and mean reduction of programs which affect the Nation's least \nfortunate and most vulnerable citizens, especially children, programs \nwhich the American people approve of.\n  I do not believe that most Americans want a cut in Head Start, \neducation reform, the National Service College Scholarship Program--\nAmeriCorps, safe and drug-free school programs, the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program, the Childcare Block Grant Program, title I programs \nto improve reading, writing, and math skills for educationally \ndisadvantaged kids, impact aid, the TRIO Program for first generation \ncollege students, and the safe drinking water revolving fund.\n  Nearly 650,000 low-income children, including more than 30,000 in \nMichigan participate in Head Start which has been shown to increase the \nlikelihood of healthy development, improved educational achievement and \nto be related to decreased involvement in criminal activity in later \nyears. Over 600,000 young men and women will lose the opportunity for \nsummer jobs, and 17,000 young Americans working to give something back \nto their communities through the national service AmeriCorps Program \nwhile receiving some assistance toward obtaining a college education \nwill lose that chance.\n  The disproportionate and unfair impact of this legislation on the \nleast fortunate among us is made all the worse by the indication that \nthe majority in the Congress intends to use the funds to pay for a tax \ncut targeted to benefit the most well off. The $189 billion tax cut \nproposed in the Contract With America according to a Department of the \nTreasury analysis would provide more than 51 percent of its benefits to \nthe wealthiest 12 percent of families.\n  The Mikulski amendment would also maintain funding for important \nprojects already announced and underway, such as the EPA center in Bay \nCity, MI, and the Job Corps Center in Flint, the CIESIN facility in \nSaginaw, and Sea Grant zebra mussel research.\n  Many important projects such as those are caught up in this \nrescission bill, despite the fact that they are of proven value and \nhave already obtained strong community support and are underway.\n  The Milukski amendment would pay for disaster relief which under the \nlaw and the President's emergency designation need not be paid for by \nreductions in other spending. By paying for the relief, the deficit \nwill be reduced. The Mikulski amendment does this in a more equitable \nway by effecting domestic spending broadly rather than targeted on \neducation, children, and housing programs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nMikulski's amendment to replace the emergency spending and rescission \nbill the Senate is now considering with a more equitable across-the-\nboard cut. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, HUD and \nIndependent Agencies is responsible for the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency's budget--but it is not and cannot be held \nresponsible for bankrolling disaster assistance.\n  About half of the cuts in both the House and Senate rescission bills \ncome from programs under the jurisdiction of the VA-HUD Subcommittee. \nVeterans and lower income Americans should not be asked to foot the \nbill for California's earthquakes or flooding in the Midwest. The \nburden of paying for these costly disasters should be shared among all \nFederal programs--not just \n[[Page S4772]] those under the jurisdiction of the VA-HUD Subcommittee.\n  While I support the Mikulski amendment, I would have preferred that \nthe Pentagon chip in. Senator Mikulski's across-the-board cut goes a \nlong way toward bringing some equity to the proposed cuts. Including \ndefense in those cuts would go even further.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nReducing appropriations accounts across the board as proposed in the \namendment would have the effect of freezing in place the spending \npriorities established in the previous Congress by the former majority \nparty. We must begin the process of reordering some of the budget \npriorities established in the last Congress. Unless we do so, it will \nbe virtually impossible to control spiraling Federal spending in fiscal \nyear 1996 and beyond.\n  I am especially concerned that we get a handle on the looming budget \ncrisis at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. For example, \ncutting spending across the board wouldn't do a thing to help us to \nbegin controlling now future obligations to renew expiring section 8 \ncontracts. These obligations will reach $20 billion annually by the \nyear 2000.\n  This rescission package takes a reasonable approach to the HUD \nbudget, which had been among the fastest growing in the Federal \nGovernment over the past few years. We target the HUD rescissions to \nnew obligations and commitments, such as section 8 incremental \nassistance. No one currently receiving assistance should lose that \nassistance as a result of the rescission of this funding.\n  But if we fail to rein in new obligations now, it is likely that down \nthe road--in a year or two--we may be faced with the reality of not \nrenewing section 8 contracts or recapturing turnover section 8 units as \nthey become available because we will not have the money to do it. That \nwould truly represent a reduction in the housing assistance we now \nprovide to 2.8 million families receiving section 8.\n  As a rule, I would agree that all budget accounts should share \nequally in meeting national disaster needs. However, at this point, \nthere is merit in achieving the reductions in other ways that will \nreduce our future obligations.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from Maryland \nfor her leadership on this and many other issues.\n  The Senator, as usual, raises arguments which are, substantively and \ninstitutionally, absolutely correct. Simply stated, the HUD-VA \nSubcommittee programs--for housing, veterans, and the environment--\nshould not be singled out to pay for emergencies which under law are to \nbe considered emergency spending. As my colleagues know, the President \nhas declared the catastrophes being funded in this supplemental \nappropriation as emergency in nature, and thus eligible for funding \noutside of the discretionary caps.\n  Since the Appropriations Committee refused to handle this emergency \nfunding in that normal way, the VA-HUD Subcommittee was forced to \ndrastically reduce fiscal year 1995 funding for housing programs by \nmore than $4.6 billion, environmental funding in excess of $1.4 \nbillion, national service $210 million, veterans programs $100 million, \nand NASA by $150 million. There is no rational explanation for such \nlarge reductions in already appropriated funds solely from these \naccounts.\n  As a reasonable alternative, the Senator from Maryland now seeks to \nimpose an across-the-board cut of 1.72 percent in all discretionary \nfunding except for veterans' medical care and a few other accounts. \nWhile I do have reservations in general about across-the-board \npercentage reductions and their meat-ax approach, in this case, the \nmedicine is totally justified.\n  The committee bill would pay for this emergency funding by reducing \nhousing, veterans, and environmental programs. There is simply no logic \nto doing this and not at the same time, equally distributing the \nfunding reductions to other accounts. We will look back on this day and \nregret this action.\n  I do believe that we need to continue to attack the deficit \naggressively, and so I continue to seek every reasonable opportunity to \ndo that.\n  At the same time, I will oppose the motion to table the Mikulski \namendment because of my very strong opposition to forcing multibillion-\ndollar--and what must be called draconian--cuts on housing and \nenvironmental needs. This is a dangerous precedent that we set by \ninsisting that unforeseeable, catastrophic events must be paid for \nsolely by reductions in a very few accounts--most notably veterans, \nhousing, the environment, NASA, and national service.\n\n\n                   ENVIRONMENTAL SIMULATION FACILITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment would unfairly rescind \nbuilding and facilities money that was finally committed 2 years ago to \nthe Environmental Simulation Facility at the University of Wyoming. \nYears ago, the Wyoming Legislature resolved to assist the University of \nWyoming in matching the Federal grant of $9.2 million. This amendment \nwould rescind $1.1 million, a most vital part of the commitment made by \nCongress to this important environmental project.\n  The laboratory, which is now in the final planning stages, would \nprovide research in surface and groundwater contamination caused by \nagricultural chemicals. It will give us a testing facility in which we \ncan control key environmental conditions and apply serious \nenvironmental management techniques to evaluate their effectiveness and \ncost. As we work to bring about increased efficiency in our \nagricultural conservation efforts--this facility will be of high \nnational importance and value.\n  But the issue here is not whether this is a ``worthy'' project, but \nrather that the University of Wyoming and the State legislature have \nfully supported this proposal through its planning stages and now that \nwe are nearly ready to break ground, Congress is considering pulling \nthe plug and chucking all the time and money already spent down the \ndrain. I would urge that you carefully consider the investments and \ncommitments that have previously been made and vote against this \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Mikulski \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time does the Senator desire? A vote is set at \n1:15.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, the amendment by the Senator from Maryland makes \nsense. It is a commonsense amendment.\n  The Senator's amendment would spread the pain of the cuts across all \nareas of the government to pay for the recent natural disasters. Under \nthe present system, all of the cuts needed to pay for these disasters \nmust come from her Appropriations subcommittee--that is, the VA, HUD \nSubcommittee. That is not fair. It does not make sense to cut programs \nin this subcommittee over $6 billion to pay for these disasters.\n  Mr. President, I strongly agree that we should pay for these disaster \nsupplementals. We should make cuts in spending to pay for them and not \nadd to the deficit. We have to pay for them and we should pay for them. \nBut, again, these cuts should not come only from the programs in this \nsubcommittee.\n  So the amendment before us would spread these cuts across all \nprograms. It would spread these cuts evenly.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly talk about the underlying \namendment. I do not agree with many of the cuts proposed in the \nunderlying amendment. Some programs would be dramatically cut. For \nexample, the safe drinking water revolving loan funds that States and \ncommunities really need, or clean water funds for sewage \n[[Page S4773]] and waste treatment projects that States and communities \nrely on.\n  Mr. President, we just passed an unfunded mandates bill. An unfunded \nmandates bill that said we are not going to add new mandates if we do \nnot have the funds.\n  The result of the cuts proposed in the underlying amendment would \nresult in a sort of defunded mandate. We will unfund mandates that \nexist. That is, we will take money away and dramatically cut safe \ndrinking water revolving loan funds and waste water treatment projects.\n  I disagree with that. Mr. President, it seems we are not looking at \nthe policy reasons for these cuts. Sometimes I think we make cuts \nsimply to say we did so.\n  Mr. President, I have noticed that our actions around here are \nentirely budget driven with no thought to the policy considerations. We \nneed to find ways to reduce spending and reduce the deficit. But we \nneed to do it wisely. Let us stop and think before we act. Let us think \nabout the implications of our actions.\n  Mr. President, I want to stress again that the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Maryland is an effort to reduce the budget deficit and \ncut spending but spread the pain around. Everybody has to be part of \nthis effort to pay for these disasters.\n  Mr. President, our national motto is ``e pluribus unum,'' one out of \nmany. We are all Americans, we are all in this together. We all have to \nfind solutions together. That is what the people who elected us want us \nto do--be reasonable. Not partisan; not do just what the Republicans \nwant to do; not do just what the Democrats want to do--but think. We \nneed to exercise common sense.\n  Most people in my State of Montana do not care whether a candidate is \nRepublican or Democrat. They vote for the person--the right person. \nThat is what the people want us to do. I strongly urge Senators to \nconsider the commonsense nature of the Mikulski amendment. I urge they \nsupport the able Senator from Maryland and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \nremarks. I thank him for his support of this amendment. He has had a \nvery difficult job, trying to bring the authorizing legislation to the \nfloor. I know there were many roadblocks placed in the way of his \nexcellent skills, in both content and parliamentary procedure. So I \nthank him for this support and upholding of the principle.\n  Mr. President, I have no further remarks on the content of this \nlegislation. I think one could see the very nature of this debate is we \ncould disagree on content, on precedent, and yet at the same time \nmaintain great civility. I hope the Senate learned a lot in listening \nto the exchanges here and, of course, I hope my view prevails. But I \nwould like, again, to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the \ncourtesies. We have a long row to hoe to the next fiscal year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my ranking member for her kind \ncomments. We have a lot more battles to work on. We are working \ntogether on many things. I would conclude by pointing out some of the \ndifferences in our approaches.\n  As I said, the Senator from Maryland would cut across the board, cut \nacross the board. Her proposal, as best we can calculate it, would take \nanother $2.589--almost $6.2 billion in budget authority from defense \nand $1.243 billion, or $1,243,000,000 out of outlays for defense.\n  We are working right now on a defense supplemental which is vitally \nneeded if we are not to deprive our fighting men and women of the \nsupport, the ongoing assistance, that they need. This would be a \ndisaster. We cannot take more out of defense than we just did in the \ndefense supplemental that is pending in conference right now.\n  My good friend from Montana said it makes no sense; our proposal is \nnot policy driven. Unfortunately, he is talking about something that is \nnot before us because we have based the recommendations in this measure \nbrought from the Appropriations Committee on policy. He was not able to \nget safe drinking water authorized for the last 2 years. The money has \nnot been used. What we are rescinding is safe drinking water money that \nis not even authorized. We have left in the $500 million that the \nadministration requests for next year, in hopes we finally can get safe \ndrinking water reauthorized. I strongly support the reauthorization. \nThere is no sense in leaving money which cannot be spent because there \nis no authorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is recognized for the purposes of making a motion.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment before us.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 421, offered by the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 32, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 118 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--68\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 421) to the \namendment (No. 420) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Now, Mr. President, I would like to propound a \nunanimous-consent time agreement for the Wellstone amendment which will \nbe now offered by the Senator from Minnesota, a 20-minute time \nagreement to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 422 to Amendment No. 420\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 422 to amendment No. 420:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new title:\n\n              TITLE   --IMPACT OF LEGISLATION ON CHILDREN\n\n     SEC.    1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact \n     or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President; and I thank the clerk for \nreading the amendment. It is very simple and straightforward.\n   [[Page S4774]] Mr. President, since I have had this amendment on the \nfloor, I believe we have had four votes, and this will be the fifth \nvote. The last vote, I believe, received 47 or 48 votes for the \namendment. This is my effort to just make a personal, from-the-heart \nappeal to my colleagues. I want to give it context.\n  I do not think I will need more than 20 minutes because I have spoken \nabout this amendment before, except for the fact that I think I can \nbring it up to date with some more evidence which is based upon what \nhas happened in the House of Representatives, which is why I believe \npeople in the country are looking for the U.S. Senate to really go on \nrecord to give them some assurance about what we are going to do and \nnot do here.\n  Again, this amendment says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress should not \n     enact or adopt any legislation that will increase the number \n     of children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Mr. President, may I have order in the Chamber, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator may \nproceed\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, the Children's Defense Fund issued their \nannual report, ``The State of America's Children Yearbook, 1995.''\n  And, by the way, I say to my colleagues, there is a quote on the \nfront of this report that captures the spirit of this amendment.\n\n       Dear Lord, be good to me. The sea is so wide and my boat is \n     so small.\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday I went over these statistics. In my State of \nMinnesota, Minnesota's children at risk, 1989 to 1991, 60,615 children \nlacked health insurance. There were 27,462 reported cases of child \nabuse and neglect, 1992; 116 young men died by violence, 1991; 48 \nchildren were killed by guns, 1992; only 71.4 percent of 2-year-olds \nwere fully immunized, 1990: 35 percent of the fourth grade public \nschool students lacked basic reading proficiency, 1992.\n  Mr. President, I am absolutely convinced that the ultimate indictment \nof what we have been doing during the decade of the 1980's and, on \npresent course, part of the decade of the 1990's, is the ways in which \nwe have abandoned children in this Nation, not invested in children, \nand devalued the work of adults that work with children.\n  In this report, ``The State of America's Children Yearbook, 1995,'' \nsome key facts on hunger speak directly to this amendment.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors survey of 30 cities found that \nemergency food requests from families with children increased by an \naverage of 14 percent between 1993 and 1994. Emergency food requests \nfrom families with children increased by an average of 14 percent \nbetween 1993 and 1994. A record level of 14.2 million children received \nfood stamp benefits in 1993, up 51 percent from 1989.\n  Please remember, Mr. President, we are now moving toward about one \nout of every four children being poor in America. Every 30 seconds, a \nchild is born into poverty in our country, and one out of every two \nchildren of color are poor in the United States of America.\n  The Women, Infants, and Children Programs provided nutrition \nassistance to 6.5 million women, infants, and children in 1994, only 65 \npercent of those who are eligible.\n  Here we have a program, Mr. President, if we are going to talk about \nhunger and malnutrition, that makes sure that women who are expecting \nchildren have a good diet. It is a program that makes sure that \nchildren at birth, infants, have adequate nutrition, and only 65 \npercent of the women and children who are eligible are receiving this \nassistance right now.\n  That is why I want the U.S. Senate to go on record that surely we \nwill not take any action that will increase the number of hungry or \nhomelessness among children in America.\n  At least 2.1 million children were served by the Summer Food Service \nProgram in 1994, less than 9 percent of those who participated in the \nSchool Lunch Program.\n  Mr. President, on homelessness, one in four people reported as \nhomeless is a child younger than 18. One in four people reported as \nhomeless is a child younger than 18. Nearly half of poor households pay \nmore than 50 percent of their incomes for housing. An estimated 1.2 \nmillion families are on waiting lists for public housing and claims of \ndiscrimination against families with children account for 23 percent of \nall housing discrimination complaints.\n  I bring this amendment to the floor of the Senate for the fifth time \nwith a sense of history in the making right now. Mr. President, I want \nto give it in context.\n  Last week in the House of Representatives--and let me just read, if I \nmay, from some major newspaper stories about what was done in the House \nof Representatives in the name of welfare reform.\n  The Washington Post, Saturday, March 25, 1995. Introduction: ``It \nwas, perhaps, an unfortunate choice of images.'' Representative--I will \nnot use his name on the floor of the Senate--from Florida ``held up a \nsign on the House floor yesterday bearing the admonition `Don't Feed \nthe Alligators'--wise advice in his State, he said, because ``if left \nin their natural state, alligators can take care of themselves.''\n\n       Welfare worked the same way, he explained, because \n     ``unnatural feeding and artificial care create dependency.\n       ``Now people are not alligators,'' he added, ``but I submit \n     that with our current handout, nonwork welfare system we've \n     upset the natural order.''\n\n  Mr. President, from the Philadelphia Inquirer, ``Debate in House Gets \nEmotional and Nasty.'' And here, right at the side bar, ``Those \nreceiving welfare were likened to animals.''\n  Mr. President, let us be clear who we are talking about when we are \ntalking about welfare families, the AFDC Program. We are talking about \nwomen and children--sometimes men, but in the main, single parents and \nchildren. Likening women and children to animals is pretty vicious. In \nfact, I think there is no place for it.\n  But, Mr. President, this was the harsh rhetoric that led to some very \nfrightening cuts.\n  And I would again cite another source, authoritative source, lest \nanybody think this amendment is just symbolic. The Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities estimates that this welfare reform bill would provide \n$2.3 billion less for the School Lunch Program than under current law. \nThat would mean that 2 million children would lose their school lunch \nin the year 2000. For Minnesota alone, 7,280 children could lose their \nchild care by the year 2000.\n  By the way, I have met, I say to my colleague from Oregon, with child \ncare providers. I had a very dramatic meeting, heartfelt testimony. \nThey were saying to me, ``Senator, don't cut into this nutrition \nassistance because if we do not get that kind of funding, if we do not \nget that kind of funding, we are not going to be able to make sure \nthese children have adequate nutrition.''\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. First all, I associate myself with the Senator's \ncomments relating to priorities for children.\n  But, I say to the Senator, there is no rescission relating to any of \nthose subjects in this bill that we now have under consideration. In \nfact, you will find in this bill that we have restored programs such as \nthe Low-Income Energy Assistance Program that had a rescission.\n  So I think if you go through this bill, this argument, this debate, \nthis issue would be more appropriately raised on a vehicle in which \nsuch action is proposed, but not on this vehicle.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Oregon that \nI appreciate his remarks. Let me make a couple of points.\n  I am fully aware of the fine work he has done. Let me tell you, I \nalso had dramatic meetings with people back in Minnesota who were \nterrified about the zeroing out of LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. They, and I, are very appreciative for what the \nSenator has done. I appreciate some of the fine work he has done. That \nis why I am actually referencing this amendment based upon what was \ndone in the House of Representatives last week.\n   [[Page S4775]] I have offered this sense-of-the-Senate amendment on \nany number of different vehicles because I fear the worst is yet to \ncome, and I am trying to get us, the U.S. Senate, to provide some \nreassurance to the Nation by going on record that we do not intend to \ntake action that will create more hunger and homelessness. This is not \nmeant to be a direct critique or criticism of this rescissions package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe it was 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I will yield time to the Senator to \nconclude his subject.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Oregon. I will also say to my \ncolleague, there will be, as we go along this week, maybe this week, \nsome alternatives and discussion about some of the specific \nrescissions. But this amendment, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, is \nan amendment to which I am very committed.\n  I am taking a look at what has happened in the House of \nRepresentatives. I believe that really all eyes of the Nation are on \nthe U.S. Senate. I think it is our responsibility to make sure that \nwhat we do as we move toward deficit reduction, as we move toward the \ngoal of balancing the budget, though I have always argued that 2002 is \nan unrealistic date. I have never heard anybody, especially once you \ntake Social Security and put it aside, talk about how you really could \ntake $1.7 trillion out of this economy over 6 or 7 years without an \nenormous contraction and without inflicting widespread pain across a \nbroad section of the population.\n  But I believe in the goal of balancing the budget. I certainly think \nwe have to do better on deficit reduction. But what I am saying today, \nI say to my colleague from Oregon--a Senator I admire and respect and \nwhose vote I hope to get on this--as I look at what is happening in the \nHouse of Representatives, as I analyze where these cuts are taking \nplace, I see a tremendous amount of meanness and harshness, and there \nis tremendous concern in the country.\n  So when I read the Children's Defense Fund report, No. 1, about the \nstate of children, when I see Minnesota children at risk, when I have \ncome to know my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, and \nbelieve that is not what we are about but it is, in fact, worsening the \nsituation of children in America, when I then see some of the action \nthat has taken place in the House of Representatives and I look at the \neconomic analysis of that action, I realize full well that if there \never was a time that people in the United States of America are looking \nto the U.S. Senate for balance, it is now.\n  If there was ever a time that people in the United States of America \nare looking to the U.S. Senate to make sure the Congress does not go \ntoo far, it is now. If there ever was a time that people in the United \nStates of America are looking for some reassurance that, in the name of \ndeficit reduction, in the name of reducing debt for our children today, \nwho will be adults in the future, we do not savage children now, it is \nnow. That is the why of this amendment.\n  I say to my colleague that as I look at the proposed cuts coming out \nof the House of Representatives, I ask the basic question, which is a \nquestion near and dear to people in this country, and it has to do with \nfairness.\n  I said this the other day. There is a budget deficit, but there now \nis a spiritual deficit. Who decided that we were going to cut into \nnutrition programs for children but we are not going to cut subsidies \nfor oil companies?\n  Who decided that we were going to eliminate benefits or dramatically \nreduce benefits for disabled children? I am now meeting with their \nfamilies from Minnesota, and they are terrified. I do not want anybody \nin the Senate to say I have tried to frighten people. People are \ncalling me and people are terrified on the basis of what they read.\n  Who decided to cut into support for disabled children in this country \nbut not to cut subsidies for pharmaceutical companies?\n  Who decided to cut into educational programs for children but not to \ncut into subsidies for coal companies?\n  I will say it one more time, some people are very generous with the \nsuffering of others.\n  So I say to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, this is the fifth time that I have brought this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment to the floor. When I brought this amendment to the \nfloor at the beginning of the Congress, there were colleagues who said \nthis is just symbolic.\n  Each time I have brought this amendment to the floor of the Senate, I \nhave referred to the House of Representatives. This does not directly \nreference the work of the Senator from Oregon in this rescissions bill. \nI have some concerns about some of the housing cuts, to be sure. But I \nunderstand the job that you have done, and I respect what you have \ndone. But this is an amendment that fits in with what is going on in \nthis Congress.\n  I say to my colleagues, my colleague from Oregon and my colleague \nfrom Mississippi, both of whom I respect, that I really believe that \npeople are looking to us for balance. People are really looking to the \nU.S. Senate to make sure we do not go too far. People are really \nlooking to the U.S. Senate to make sure that this does not become a \nmean season on children.\n  People are looking for reassurance. I have tried to get a majority \nvote. I made a promise to myself, I made a promise to my colleagues, I \nmade a promise to children's advocates, I made a promise to children \nthat I will keep bringing this amendment to the floor of the Senate to \nhave votes.\n  I will conclude by reading this one more time:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress should not \n     enact or adopt any legislation that will increase the number \n     of children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  I do not know why we cannot support that. The last time, Mr. \nPresident, there were a number of my colleagues from the other side who \nsupported this amendment. It is my fervent hope that today I can get a \nmajority vote. I think it would be a wonderful message. I think it \nwould be reassuring to people in the country.\n  I have no ``hidden agenda.'' I just feel strongly about what these \nstatistics mean in personal terms. I just feel strongly that part of \nwhat we are doing in this Congress is going in the wrong direction. I \njust feel strongly that if there is going to be deficit reduction and \nwe are going to move toward balancing the budget, we ought not go the \npath of least political resistance.\n  You have been a leader, I say this to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, on these issues. This is no lecture aimed \nat you. You are somebody who I look up to. But my concern is that what \nis going to happen, Mr. President, is that when it gets down to where \nthese cuts take place, we are going to go the path of least political \nresistance. That is to say, all too often the cuts are going to be \naimed disproportionately at those citizens who are least able to \ntighten their belts. But the reason they are going to be aimed \ndisproportionately at citizens least able to tighten their belts, \nstarting with children--I can also include the elderly and also include \nother citizens--is because they do not have the political clout. They \nare not considered to be the heavy hitters. They are not considered to \nbe the players. They are not the big campaign contributors. They are \nall too often invisible. They are all too often faceless. They are all \ntoo often voiceless.\n  But there is a lot of goodness in this country, and there is a lot of \ngoodness in this Chamber. I think that if the U.S. Senate goes on \nrecord just supporting the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that I have \noffered today, it will be a positive, unifying vote for this Nation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, what is the time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has less than 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S4776]] Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nfor 2 minutes to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I understand the thrust of the amendment \nof the Senator, and I do not think anybody can disagree with the \nessence of it. It is a sense of the Senate, or a sense of the Congress. \nLet me also indicate, Mr. President, I think the message that the \nSenator wants to send to the public is that we have stated an action in \nthis bill, for we have not in this bill rescissions relating to the \nsubject matter of children. Therefore, I think we can say that this is \na powerful statement the Congress is sending to the people as well.\n  I want to just indicate two or three items as an example of the focus \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee put on the rescissions. First, the \nrescissions were basically in the unobligated funds. Second, we were \nnot only concerned about children and young people. We have in this a \nfar, far different document than the rescissions on student aid, as it \nrelates to the elderly and the needs of the elderly and low-income \nenergy assistance.\n  I think this document represents a very powerful statement to the \npublic of this country that we have put a focus upon people's needs, \nand that we have shown the compassion, the concerns, for people's needs \nin this particular document.\n  At the same time, we have reduced our spending for this particular \nfiscal year by $13.5 billion.\n  So I am ready to accept the amendment offered by the Senator as a \nsense of the Congress and take it to conference.\n  I thank the Senator for his compassion and for his passionate plea on \nbehalf of this. I think it certainly is in concert and certainly \nrepresents the work of the Appropriations Committee in focusing upon \npeople's needs--not just children, but the elderly and other people, as \nwell.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nmay have another minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, actually, what I would like to do is I would like to \nget to this vote. But first I would like to suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, the \ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee. I have been at \nthis a long time with this amendment, and I am very, very pleased with \nthis result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 422) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4761-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4776-S4777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, all Members in \nthe Senate are faced with making difficult decisions almost daily. This \nday marks one of the most difficult decisions I have been faced with \nduring my 16-plus years in this body. After wrestling with this \ndecision for some time, I have decided not to seek reelection in 1996, \nand to retire from elective office at the end of my term. Simply put, \nthe time to pass the torch to another generation is near.\n  I have undergone a series of medical examinations by specialists in \nrecent months. While I have problems, nevertheless, my health is good, \nand I am assured I face no predictable crisis. I continue to work as I \nhave throughout my adult life. While in Washington, I spend 6\\1/2\\ days \na week in the office; and while in Alabama, a similar amount of time is \ndevoted to Senate duties. My health problems have not slowed me down, \nand I do not expect any change in my work habits in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  This has not been an easy decision because I have always enjoyed \ncampaigning, and the desire to once again hit the campaign trail is a \npowerful urging. I have been particularly gratified with the \noverwhelming offer of volunteered support from Democrats, Republicans, \nand independents alike urging me to run again. I believe I can be \nreelected, perhaps not with the high percentage of more than 60 percent \nof the vote that I have received in my last four primary and four \ngeneral statewide elections, but I am confident I could win by a good \nmajority.\n  There are numerous factors that have entered into my decision. There \nis no compelling reason to go into detail about these factors, other \nthan to say that in fairness to any who may seek to succeed me the time \nto make my announcement is now.\n  At the conclusion of my term, I will have served the people of \nAlabama for 24 years, and I hope that I will be looked upon as a public \nservant who has served with dignity, integrity, and diligence, worthy \nof the confidence and trust that the people of Alabama bestow upon me.\n  Throughout my years in the Senate, I have endeavored to stay in touch \nwith the people. I have visited each of the 67 counties in Alabama at \nleast once a year, except for one year when I spent considerable time \nin the hospital during the recess periods. I have listened to \nAlabamians from all walks of life on every conceivable issue in over \n1,000 town meetings and 500 high school visits.\n  I have endeavored to represent Alabama in a studied, impartial, and \nfairminded manner. My record certainly indicates at least an \nindependent streak. I hope Alabamians know that my decisions were based \non what I thought was in the best interest of my State and Nation. \nWhile some may argue or disagree with my decisions, I was convinced \nthat I was right. And I believe most Alabamians felt that nothing more \ncould be expected of me.\n  My service in the U.S. Senate has been rewarding, and I trust of \nbenefit to the people of America and Alabama. I am indeed grateful that \nAmerica faces no immediate threat to her borders from foreign military \npowers. I am particularly proud of the role that I played in rebuilding \nour Armed Forces and military strength during the aftermath of the \nVietnam war. This commitment on the part of our Nation contributed to \nthe collapse of the old Soviet Union and its Communist philosophy. This \ncommitment proved itself again during the Persian Gulf war. With my own \nexperiences in World War II and observations since that time, I felt \ncompelled that we must at all times endeavor to obtain lasting peace, \nand that the only road to achieving this goal was and is through \nstrength.\n  I am particularly proud of my efforts in other areas, such as \nagriculture, the judiciary, education, improved race relations, \ntechnology advancements, medical research, family values, the war \nagainst crime and drugs, the space program, ethics in government, and \nmany other fields.\n  The agriculture community, while small in number, is considerably \nbetter off today than when I came to the Senate in 1979. During my \nyears on the Agriculture Committee, we have been able to craft farm \npolicy which provides market stability and allows U.S. farmers to \naggressively pursue international markets. At the same time, these farm \nprograms have dramatically reduced the cost to the U.S. Treasury. This \nyear may prove to be the most crucial for the American farmers with the \nwell-organized effort in this Congress to abolish farm programs that \nhave worked well for the consumer as well as the farmer.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I came to this body after serving as \nChief Justice of Alabama. I brought to the Senate a desire to achieve \nmuch \n[[Page S4777]] modernization and reform in our Federal courts. My \nefforts have been focused on improving the Federal judicial system and \nrelieving court congestion in criminal and civil matters. I have always \nsubscribed to the expression, ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' We \nhave been successful to a major degree in our efforts to achieve these \ngoals. However, much remains to be done. This country's system of \njustice today faces one of its greatest threats in the Congress. The \nfoundation of our civil justice system and more than 500 years of the \ndevelopment of common law are under attack, including the right of \ntrial by jury. We will continue the battles to improve the \nadministration of justice, as well as maintain its historic role of \nprotecting the weak, the minorities, and the defenseless.\n  Mr. President, for 13 years I served on the Senate Ethics Committee--\ntwo periods as chairman. My service on the Ethics Committee can be \ndescribed with many adjectives, none of which include enjoyable. From \nthe description ``of how it used to be,'' I would have to say that I am \nconvinced that the Senate has made great strides in ethical behavior \nand standards during my time in this body. While there is still room \nfor much improvement, I am, nevertheless, convinced that the Senators \nnow serving are the most ethical in the history of the Senate.\n  During the last several decades, including the time that I have spent \nin the Senate, there has been much improvement in civil rights. \nHowever, race relations continue as a divisive issue in numerous ways. \nThe path toward the achievement of equal opportunity for all persons, \nregardless of race, color gender, or creed, has many miles to go. We \nfoster democratic principles throughout the world and have seen \ndemocracy make great strides in many nondemocratic countries. Yet our \nown democracy faces its greatest threat from within. Elected officials, \nmedia personalities, elements of political parties, and other \norganizations strive to pit one group of Americans against another. We \nmust set a new course in this Congress and across the land--a course of \nmoderation, tolerance, responsibility, and compassion. We need to \nreturn to the traditional value of being just plain neighborly. Not \nuntil we become genuinely ``one Nation under God, indivisible, with \nliberty and justice for all,'' can this country realize its potential \nfor true greatness.\n  I am proud of my staff. I have always been proud of my staff. Most of \nthem have come from Alabama but, regardless, all have worked with \ndevotion, dedication, and professionalism. They have worked with me to \nassist thousands of Alabamians--and I might say thousands of Americans \noutside of Alabama--in every imaginable area. Staff members seldom \nreceive praise, but I thank them from the bottom of my heart for the \ngreat job that they have done and the job that I know they will \ncontinue to do during the remaining months of my service in the Senate.\n  No one knows what the future will be, but I plan to return to my \nbeloved Alabama and devote more of my time to the people in my life \nthat I treasure the most--my devoted and lovely wife Elizabeth Ann, who \nis affectionately also know as ``Mike''--my son Tom and his wonderful, \ntalented, and beautiful wife Cornelia--and, Mr. President, the two \nfinest grandchildren a person could be blessed with, Wilson Carmichael \nHeflin and Mary Catherine Heflin. Wilson is known to his ``Pop'' as \n``Wil,'' and he calls his sister ``K.K.'' because he says Mary \nCatherine is too much of a mouthful. I do not wish to omit from the \ntreasured list my other friends and relatives in Alabama, particularly \nthose in the Shoals area.\n  I will enjoy living the remainder of my days in my hometown, for \nTuscumbia, AL, is a wonderful little town to be from and it is the best \nlittle town in America to go home to.\n  Mr. President, while my career and work here in the Senate is yet to \nbe completed for I still have much to do, I, nevertheless, thank the \npeople of Alabama ``who I so dearly love'' for the faith and trust \nbestowed upon me which allowed me to serve as Chief Justice of Alabama \nfor 6 years and as a U.S. Senator for three terms. I also thank my \nCreator for the blessing of health during my three score and thirteen \nyears thus far, and for having the opportunity to serve this great \nNation and my fellow citizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4776-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4777-S4784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, as most Members of this body, I received \nword of Senator Heflin's retirement just a few moments ago. As I began \nto contemplate his service here, I wondered what was the single word \nthat best epitomized Senator Heflin's service. Mr. President, the word \nthat came to mind first was ``wisdom.''\n  Wisdom is a rare thing. It is acquired genetically, and our Creator \nhas been very generous with Senator Heflin in endowing him with a huge \namount of wisdom and a huge amount of ability.\n  It also is born of experience, and having served the people of \nAlabama now, both as chief justice and as a Member of this body, for \nsome 23-plus years, he has acquired both the skill and the knowledge, \nalong with that genetically inspired wisdom, to be, indeed, one of the \nwisest Members of this body.\n  In fact, if the Senator from Alabama rises on any issue in this \nSenate, not only do Members of the Senate listen, but as far as this \nSenator is concerned, he almost always follows, because Senator Heflin \nis seldom wrong and is someone whose wisdom is greatly to be emulated. \nIndeed, Mr. President, if I had to make a two-word speech against term \nlimits, it would probably be ``Howell Heflin,'' because Howell Heflin's \nleaving this body will make it a decidedly lesser place.\n  There are other words that come to mind when you think of Howell \nHeflin. Clearly integrity has to be one, because his is an integrity so \nstrong that nobody would ever seek to disparage it. Indeed, no one \nwould seek to defend it. I mean, you do not have to say Howell Heflin \nis a man of integrity because that would be redundant. Everyone knows \nthat. It emanates from every pore in his body, from his history and \nfrom his lifetime of work.\n  He was, indeed, the first choice of almost everyone to be a member of \nthe Ethics Committee.\n  Mr. President, clearly in describing Howell Heflin, you would have to \nrefer to his sense of humor. It is legendary. It occasionally erupts \nhere on the floor of the Senate. More commonly, in political speeches \nback in Alabama. I would hate to be the object of his wit, either in \nAlabama or anywhere else, because, while it is gentle and while it is \nfunny, it can be, indeed, devastating.\n  I will never forget the story of the Grey Poupon, the way that Howell \nHeflin could describe to those who thought themselves too sophisticated \nto be from Alabama, and the way he could use that humor to not only \nenlighten and to lighten the debate, but also as a tremendous political \nweapon.\n  Mr. President, this Senate will not be the same when Howell Heflin \nleaves. It simply will not. It will be a much lesser place. I will be \nleaving as well. So it is not that I will miss him. I will enjoy \nservice with him for the next year and 8 months. I hope he completes \nhis agenda, as I hope I complete mine.\n  But, Mr. President, for I think decades to come, people of Alabama \nwill revere the service of one Chief Justice Howell Heflin and one \nSenator Howell Heflin, one of the most outstanding Members this body \nhas ever produced.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there is one word that comes to my mind, \nI say to the Senator from Louisiana, and that is character. Certainly, \nHowell Heflin is an individual with the highest of integrity and, yes, \nhumor. But it has to be said, I am glad the Senator from Louisiana did \nnot continue on about Howell's humor, because most of those stories \ncould not be told on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  We should all remember his work on the Ethics Committee and the \noutstanding job that Howell Heflin did as chairman. It is a very \nthankless task.\n  The idea of any kind of farm legislation and, as the Senator \nmentioned earlier, anything concerning peanuts. \n[[Page S4778]] He will knock all of these desks to the floor to make \nsure the peanut farmers are taken care of.\n  In addition, we have been blessed with his incredible expertise as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. We know him as a former chief \njustice, the most outstanding of the State chief justices, elected so \nby his own confreres. At international conferences, he has supported \nthe United States in Europe and NATO with tremendous distinction.\n  But in addition to honoring his outstanding record, let me just dwell \non two things: First, I traveled the State of Alabama during the \nPresidential race some 10 years ago. And in my travels, I found out was \nthat Howell Heflin is a common man of uncommon abilities. He knows \neverybody in that State. I can tell you, he is not leaving because he \ncannot get reelected. That fellow could walk back in here. The rest of \nus have to fight our way.\n  Incidentally, I am not joining you two at all. I am fighting to stay \nhere. But Senator Heflin knows them all. He knows every element of that \nsociety. He has never outgrown--being a chief justice or U.S. Senator--\nhis humble beginnings in Tuscumbia. That always impressed me, because I \nmet with people in every county in that particular State and every \nparticular group, from the legislature to the Governor, down to the \ncivic organizations and the defense organizations at Huntsville, where \nHowell has been a leader.\n  But I want to emphasize his message here. I am quoting what he just \nsaid:\n\n       We foster democratic principles. Throughout the world \n     scene, democracy has made great strides in many nondemocratic \n     countries. Yes, our own democracy faces its greatest threat \n     from within. Elected officials, media personalities, elements \n     of political parties, and other organizations strive to pit \n     one group of Americans against another. We must set a new \n     course in this Congress and across the land, a course of \n     moderation, tolerance, responsibility, and compassion.\n\n  When I first got over here, we were seated on those last two seats. I \nwas seated next to Bobby Kennedy. We had better seats in ``My Fair \nLady.'' We were voting, and I got a tap on the shoulder. I looked \naround, and it was the senior Senator from Kentucky who was tapping me \non the shoulder. He said, ``Fritz, change that vote, change that \nvote.'' I said, ``John, what do you mean?'' He said ``Well, they got a \nlot of horsemen there in South Carolina, and I know many.'' He said, \n``That would be a bad mistake. They like you, and I would hate to see \nyou get in trouble with them.'' John Cooper had come all the way around \nthe Chamber. He had a seat way on the back of the other side and had \ncome over to this side.\n  The tremendous change that Senator Heflin has emphasized here in his \nannouncement of departing is certainly noteworthy. In these times, it \nseems as if we meet in ambush every Tuesday to get the other side.\n  A perfect example of what I am talking about can be seen by focusing \non what happened with the line-item veto. I have sponsored line-item \nveto legislation for some 10 years. I have a bill, S. 238, that was \nreferred to the Rules Committee just this year. The Republicans had an \nintramural between themselves over two different rescission bills, and \nwhen they worked out a compromise, they had basically settled on my \nbill. It is in the Rules Committee, a separate enrollment line-item \nveto. But I never claimed that on the floor of the Senate. I was afraid \nthat the partisanship was so violent that some would vote against it if \nthey heard that my name was even connected with the blooming thing. It \nhas gotten that bad.\n  I think in this distinguished statesman's departure, he is \nemphasizing an awfully important thing--American industry and catching \nup with the global competition. We have learned, in quality production, \nthat the best way to compete is to have the lowest elements involved in \nproduction and working in teams. I have seen the Japanese, and have \ncome to see that teamwork in individual industries in my own State of \nSouth Carolina. Industry now has learned how to get quality production.\n  The political body has gone totally in the other direction, with no \nidea of working together. Who can get whom? Who can get on the 7 \no'clock news? Who can catch the other fellow? And whatever else it is. \nThe legislation that we spew out shows it. It is not quality. It is not \nproduction.\n  Howell Heflin has left us a most important message. I will not read \nall of it. I know others here are waiting. But our distinguished \ncolleague was president of the Alabama State Bar Association. He was \nselected the Most Outstanding Appellate Judge in the United States in \n1976. He served his chairman of the National Conference of Chief \nJustices; was a member of the college faculty at William & Mary, the \nUniversity of Alabama, and the University of North Alabama. He received \nthe Outstanding Service to Science Award from the National Association \nof Biomedical Research; National Veterans Award; the Henry Jackson \nSenate Leadership Award; the Justice Award and Harley Award, American \nJudicature Society; the Wernher von Braun Space Award; the James \nMadison Award of the National Broadcast Editorial Association; 12 \nhonorary degrees.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is exactly right. If I had to answer this \nnonsense of term limitations--which incidentally is included in the \nU.S. Constitution, but seems like a new idea--I would answer it with \ntwo words. ``Howell Heflin.''\n  I thank you for that expression. That is exactly what I have in mind.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sorry to get the news of the \nretirement of my good friend and distinguished Senator from Alabama. I \nhope on this side of the aisle that I can claim the right to miss him \nmore than any other Republican might miss him, because for 15 years, I \nhave had the chance of working with him on a subcommittee of Judiciary. \nAt various times, the committee has been entitled Administrative \nPractice and Procedure; at another time, Courts, and this time, \nOversight and Courts, I guess. I was chairman of it from 1980 to 1986. \nHe was chairman for the last 8 years, and when the Republicans gained \ncontrol of the Senate, I became chairman again.\n  So I have either been ranking member or chairman with the \ndistinguished Senator for now going on my 15th year.\n  I can say that it has been a pleasure working with him. It has been a \npleasure because there has not been any friction. It has been a \npleasure because he does not think in a partisan way. It has been a \npleasure because he knows a great deal about the law and, for a \nnonlawyer like me, it gives me an opportunity to have a great deal of \nconfidence that the product that comes out of that committee, whether I \nam chairman or whether he is chairman, is going to be a good product. I \nthink an example of that good product is the bankruptcy reform \nlegislation that was passed over in the last Congress.\n  Not too many people in this body pay too much attention to bankruptcy \nlegislation. It is not the sort of legislation that keeps you awake \nwhen you are reading and considering some of its aspects. But he worked \nreal hard on that, and I hope I worked helping him as the ranking \nmember to get a bill that would be passed.\n  That is one example of the hard work that he has done where there is \nnot public attention given to it. But he does not do his work because \nhe cares about the public attention. He does his work because he wants \nto do the job right and according to the Constitution and what is good \npublic policy. I have known that to be his characteristic in these \nyears that I have worked with him on this committee. But most \nimportantly through the work on the committee, I have been able to \ndevelop a friendship with him. It is the sort of friendship that is \ngoing to have a crack in it when he is not here in succeeding \nCongresses. He knows there is a lot of legislation he is going to be \nworking on with me over the next 20 months. I look forward to working \nwith him. But I was also looking forward to working with him much \nbeyond that. So I am going to miss him but I wish him well.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Just let me add a few brief words in salute to Howell Heflin--truly a \nson of the Old South who I think is of as much distinction as all of \nthe other great southerners who have served in the U.S. Senate. He is \nfar more than just a southern Senator. He is a U.S. Senator.\n   [[Page S4779]] Certainly I wish to say to Mike and Howell Heflin \nfrom both myself and my wife, Pat, we came here together and we will be \nleaving together. When I think about things like that, Mr. President, I \ncannot tell you about anyone in this body that I think more exemplifies \nthe term a true workhorse and not a show horse of the Senate.\n  Mike and Howell Heflin have been close friends and associates of the \nExons lo these many years. However, it is far more than just our \npersonal relationship I have treasured. I have treasured also the \nprofessional working relationships we have had in the Senate. And I \nthink when the rollcall of votes are summarized you will likely see \nthat Howell Heflin and Jim Exon probably voted as close alike as any \nother Members of this body, which I know we have been very proud in \nserving.\n  I wish to cite something personal about Howell Heflin that not very \nmany people know. A few years ago I had an opportunity to lead a \ndelegation to the Pacific area. Howell Heflin went along. We stopped in \nGuam for refueling en route to Manila, and there was to be a brief \nceremony for Howell Heflin that I knew nothing about when we landed \nthere.\n  It was anything but a brief ceremony. It was obviously one of the \nmost important ceremonies that the Island of Guam had had, I suppose, \nsince the American forces drove out the Japanese from that island \nduring the war in the Pacific. There was a big entourage of cars. I \ncould not imagine what was going on. Finally, I began to get the feel \nof things. They wanted to take us out to the beach where the American \nmarines landed when the United States of America started taking back \nthat very important and strategic island.\n  We went out to the beach, and we saw where they landed, the \ndifficulty they had in landing there with the coral reefs that had not \nbeen researched very well obviously from a landing standpoint. We went \nto the museum out on the beach. This was all about Howell Heflin. When \nwe went over to the beach itself, there was a small Navy band. There \nwas a small tent with people from the Island of Guam who were there \nwhen the Americans landed.\n  A very touching sight. There was a big sign out there that I shall \nnever forget. It said, ``Welcome Back Our Liberating Hero, Lt. Howell \nHeflin.'' The mayor was there; the Governor was there; a little Navy \nband was there. They gave us a flag. And, of course, the big man of the \nmoment was Howell Heflin.\n  Because of all his other accomplishments, Howell Heflin, without very \nmuch fanfare--and I suspect maybe most of his colleagues in the Senate \ndo not even know about it--early on he was one of those marines, Lt. \nHowell Heflin, who was part of the assault force of the Americans \nlanding to take Guam from the Japanese. He was wounded in the initial \nassault and kept on fighting. He pointed out the hill to me where he \ntook his second hit. He spent relatively little time there because he \nwas evacuated to the United States where he spent considerable time in \nthe hospital.\n  This is a side of the proud Howell Heflin that I know. That is a side \nthat I want his colleagues to know about and Americans to know about in \naddition to all his other outstanding accomplishments. He is one of \nthose who serves his country in time of need, and we must never forget \nthat.\n  So to you, Howell, and to Mike, the best from Pat and I for our close \nassociation. And I point to people like you, Howell, as I have talked \nabout before. One of the most wonderful things about being involved in \npolitics--and I have been involved in it about the same amount of time \nas you--were it not for my involvement in politics there is not one \nchance in 2 trillion that I would have ever met Howell and Mike Heflin. \nHaving met them, having known them, known of their stature, their \ncharacter, having had them as friends, means a lot to one as you look \nback on your life and see what really has been important.\n  I am not going to cite all of your accomplishments, Howell, because \nthat has been done so very, very well by your friends and colleagues \nwho have spoken before me in this Chamber in this regard today.\n  I simply say that one of the great treasures of my life has been \nknowing you, seeing you serve with such distinction, knowing of the \ngreat gratitude of your fellow Senators on both sides of the aisle for \nthe important role that you have played in the Senate, representing \nyour great State so very, very well, but even more so by an excellent, \noutstanding individual who responded to duty early in life when you \nserved in the Marines; saw and discharged your duties as well here in \nthe Senate as you did in Guam. God bless and God keep you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise as well to express my \ndisappointment but as well my very best wishes to our dear colleague, \nHowell Heflin, with his announcement this afternoon. I have known him \nas a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee for a long period of \ntime, and all of us have had the good opportunity to work with him in \nso many different capacities over the last 18 years.\n  We come to this Chamber as Republicans and Democrats, R's and D's, \nbut I think once we are here we become known not as R's and D's \nnecessarily but C's or D's, constructives or destructives.\n  There are some who for whatever short-term political gain may be \ninclined to be destructive to the political or legislative process. \nUnfortunately, there are all too many cases that come to mind as we \nthink about destructive efforts that have gone on sometimes with no \ngood reason.\n  But then there are those constructive leaders who come to this \nChamber with a true belief that they can do good for others, with an \nunderstanding of the importance of Government, and with the belief that \nwe can really look forward to making the next generation and the \ngeneration after that one better than the one that is currently \noccupying this great land. I think that was what Howell Heflin came to \ndo 18 years ago.\n  As I look over all of our colleagues in the Senate, I must say I \ncannot think of anyone who has been more constructive in his approach. \nThe tributes that have already been made here on the Senate floor to \nthe character of Senator Heflin, I believe, are illustrative of that \nfact.\n  Democrats and Republicans understand the contribution that Howell \nHeflin has made. They understand his constructive approach. They \nunderstand why it is he came here in the first place. They understand \nthe tremendous reputation that he has established as a result of that \napproach. And they are fond of calling him their friend.\n  We look forward to at least 18 more months of that kind of \nconstructive participation, that kind of leadership, the kind of \ndedication to his job that he brings to work each and every day. And we \nhave that realization that we have the good fortune to work with him \nfor at least 18 more months in this capacity and perhaps in other \ncapacities in public life, as well.\n  But I want to share my best wishes and hope that he and his family, \nas wonderful as they are, have many, many years to enjoy the wonderful \nlife that Howell has dedicated not only to this Senate but to them as \nthey go forth with their new future.\n  Someone once said that life has no blessing like that of a good \nfriend. Howell Heflin has been a good friend to the people of Alabama, \nto the people of this Chamber, to the people who have had the good \nfortune to know him now for some time. I wish him well.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I was in my office when my press secretary \ncalled and said, ``Howell Heflin is announcing he is not going to run \nagain.'' I turned on that TV set to hear at least part of what he had \nto say.\n  Howell Heflin has made a real contribution to this body and to the \nNation. One of the ways he has made a contribution is that he has taken \nhis job as Senator seriously, but he has not taken himself too \nseriously. And I think that is very important.\n  He has a great sense of humor. Well, there may be some disagreement \non that here, whether he has a great sense of humor or not. But, you \nknow, you get talking with him about an issue and all of a sudden he \nwill say, ``Well, \n[[Page S4780]] that reminds me of the Methodist minister,'' and you are \non a story. And all of a sudden, the tension in the situation has been \ndeflated. That sense of humor and ability to laugh at yourself and \nstill take your job seriously, I think, is important.\n  Both Senator Grassley and Senator Hollings mentioned something else \nthat I think is important, and that is he is partisan but not \nexcessively partisan. We have too much partisanship today in this body. \nWe have to be looking at issues and making judgments on issues. I am \nnot suggesting either party is more guilty of this than the other. We \nboth have our problems here.\n  I can remember very distinctly when I first met Howell Heflin. I was \nasked to go down to speak in the State of Alabama. Hubert Humphrey, \nsome of you will remember, got cancer. For speaking engagements, they \nwould reach around to others. When they really got desperate, I was \nover there in the House, and I went down to Alabama.\n  They said, ``We have this really fine chief justice down here who is \nthinking about running for the Senate.'' I met Howell Heflin at that \ndinner. He has probably forgotten that day, but I remember it very, \nvery well.\n  I learned, in just a brief conversation with him that evening, one \nother factor about Howell Heflin, and that is he a genuine \nhumanitarian. He wants to help people. That is what this business is \nall about.\n  Robert Byrd gets criticized periodically for helping the people of \nWest Virginia. He has never had a critic in Paul Simon for helping the \npeople of West Virginia. I applaud him for doing it.\n  Howell Heflin has helped the people of Alabama, but he has helped the \npeople of our whole Nation.\n  Then, finally, he is both a scholar and a good judge of humanity. I \nremember when we had a well-publicized nominee before the Judiciary \nCommittee. I sit next to Howell Heflin on the Judiciary Committee. I \nremember he was asking this nominee a question. As the nominee answered \nthe question, Howell Heflin leaned over to me and said, ``He's lying.'' \nI knew right then how Howell Heflin was going to vote on that nominee. \nHowell Heflin knows the human character.\n  But he also looks at the details of legislation. He gets that \npencil--he usually works with a pencil, not a pen--he gets a pencil \nout, and on his finger, he has a little knob on it. It is a little red \non the end of that finger. It looks like he took a Band-Aid off of it. \nHe gets that pencil out and he starts scribbling things down. Then, all \nof sudden he will say, ``Mr. Chairman, what about section 3 on page 18? \nWhat does this mean?'' And all of a sudden he has shifted the whole \ndiscourse.\n  He has made a tremendous contribution. I am proud to be his friend. \nIt is an honor to serve in the U.S. Senate with Howell Heflin. The \npeople of Alabama ought to be very, very proud of their decision to \nsend Howell Heflin to the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak later in greater detail about \nSenator Heflin, but I would like to say a couple of words about my good \nfriend Howell Heflin.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I went to \nHowell Heflin and said, ``I'm going to need your help and advice \nregarding commodities from your area. As we write farm bills, I'm going \nto need to know how they will affect Alabama.'' I knew, even after a \nshort while, I could always call on him for such help.\n  I sit next to him on the other side from Paul Simon in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I have had the advantage sometimes of a running \ncommentary from Judge Heflin. I have often thought that some of the \nthings he is whispering in my ears in the Judiciary Committee would \nmake far better reading than what was in the official transcript, and \nit sometimes influenced me a heck of lot more than what was in the \nofficial transcript.\n  I also had an advantage on the Senate Agriculture Committee where I \nlooked at him and Senator Pryor as the voices of Southern agriculture \non our side of the aisle.\n  Senator Heflin invited me down to Alabama. He vouched for me. He even \noffered to do a simultaneous translation for me while I was speaking. \nHe told me I could give a 10-minute speech while he translated it into \nSouthern. He said it would take 30 minutes to repeat it, so I should \nnot talk too long.\n  Mr. President, it was amazing. We went out into small towns. We did a \nhearing in someone's barn, as I recall. Now, this was a Senate hearing. \nI brought Republicans and Democrats with me.\n  We knew where the barn was, because all the signs were not ``Welcome, \nSenate Agriculture Committee,'' not ``Welcome, Chairman,'' or anything \nelse. It was, ``Welcome, Howell,'' or ``Welcome, Senator Heflin,'' or \n``The farmers of'' whatever county it was--I still remember that barn; \nI cannot remember the name of the county--``welcome Senator Heflin.''\n  We went there, and then went on to what understood would be a small \ndinner. Well, we went into this school and the place was a mob scene.\n  They were asking the tall bald guy to get out of the way because they \nwanted to see the real--the real--Senate agriculture expert, Howell \nHeflin. We went in there, and, Mr. President, I heard Senator Heflin \nspeak about going back to his hometown, and he said, ``It's a wonderful \nlittle town to be from; it is the best little town in America to go \nhome to.''\n  Having seen him in Alabama, and having seen the way he feels the \nroots of his State, I truly believe that.\n  In fact, I listened to that with some understanding, because as he \nknows from traveling with me, I feel the same roots in my own State of \nVermont. We are blessed because we both know we have a hometown to go \nhome to. He will get there a little bit ahead of me, but I think how \nfortunate he is to have that. How fortunate his own State of Alabama \nhas been to have him, a voice of sanity, of reason, of moderation, in \nthe best sense of the word, on the Senate Judiciary Committee; a voice \nwhere he is a strong advocate for his State but still looking to be an \nadvocate in a way that can help reach consensus with other Senators. \nHis goal was not to win for the sake of winning, but to win because it \nwas the right thing.\n  I admire that as I admire both he and Mike have been good friends of \nMarcelle and myself.\n  We have had great times, from him asking me how I justified smoking a \nCuban cigar--I told him I was burning Castro's crops and treating that \nCommunist the way we should--to him coming to me and saying on a couple \nof occasions, ``You know, you may not be able to get exactly this bill \nthat you want, but I wouldn't be surprised if you modified it a little \nbit here, if you spoke to this Senator, this Republican and this \nDemocrat, we can work it out,'' and we always did.\n  Mr. President, I feel, as others who have spoken, that we have been \nblessed and benefited by serving with Senator Heflin. I have enjoyed \nthat service. I have looked forward to the times we have been in \ncommittee meetings sitting beside each other. I admire him as a \nSenator. I respect him as an intellectual giant in this body, and \nespecially I have so much affection for him as a good friend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I was in the office of Senator Daschle a \nfew moments ago visiting with Senator Daschle and some of our \ncolleagues about issues coming before the Senate this week and down the \nline, and one of our trusted staff members came in and made the \nannouncement that Senator Howell Heflin, of Alabama, was on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate announcing that he would not run for reelection.\n  There was, I must say, shock and sadness and dismay in that room at \nthat time. As we came to the floor of the Chamber to hear the last part \nof the remarks of our friend from Alabama, I could not help but be \nreminded of a part of the creed of the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce \nthat we used to recite at our noonday luncheons, and I quote:\n\n       We believe that service to humanity is the best work of \n     life.\n\n  I think that service to humanity is something that will be the \nhallmark of this great son of Alabama. It was my pleasure and my \nprivilege to come to \n[[Page S4781]] the Senate with Senator Howell Heflin and his wonderful \nwife, Mike, in 1979. I will never forget that we had a class structure; \nthat our Senators in that particular class from time to time would have \nmeetings, we would go to each other's homes for perhaps a potluck \nsupper. We would have speakers, and they would come and give us what \nthey thought were the great issues of the day. It seems almost like the \nblink of an eye, when I had the privilege of beginning to get to know \nthis fine man, this fine gentleman from Alabama.\n  I remember, too, Mr. President, that when Judge Heflin, as we have \naffectionately called him over these some 16 or 17 years, I remember \nthe day that he was stricken ill. I will never forget the stillness \nthat overcame this building, the Senate office buildings as Senators \nand staff members and elevator operators and policemen stopped to pause \nand to reflect and perhaps even to pray about their friend, Howell \nHeflin.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on the Agriculture Committee with \nSenator Heflin for these 16 years, and I can tell you that the farmers \nin Alabama, the farmers in Arkansas, the farmers in Michigan or West \nVirginia, Hawaii, or wherever it might be, have never had a better \nfriend nor a stronger advocate than Howell Heflin, of Alabama.\n  Mr. President, finally, I had the high honor of serving as a member \nof the Senate Ethics Committee--not an easy responsibility--with the \nvery great chairman of many years of that committee, Senator Howell \nHeflin. And many, many times during the deliberations, most of the \ntimes behind closed doors, in trying to deal with some of the extremely \nsensitive issues that faced individuals in this body or that faced this \nbody as a whole, it was always Judge Heflin who brought us back to the \ncenter of the argument and the center of the issue as he said time and \ntime and time again, ``Ladies and gentleman, we must do what is good \nfor this institution.''\n  This institution--this institution--Mr. President, I think, has been \nso much better because he has graced this institution with his \npresence. He has made us laugh, he has made us cry but, above all, he \nhas made us think. He is truly, I think, one of the greatest Members \nthis body has ever had. And it has been a high privilege and honor for \nme to have had the privilege of serving with him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, my distinguished colleagues of the Senate \nhave spent much time this afternoon sharing their words of gratitude, \ntheir words of affection, their words of admiration for that gentleman \nfrom Alabama, Howell Heflin. Everything that has been said is fully \njustified.\n  He is a man of distinction, one of the great jurists of our Nation. \nHe is a great legislator, successful and effective.\n  But whenever I see my dear friend, Howell, I think of another \noccasion when another great American gave his farewell address.\n  This happened about 30 years ago and his name was Douglas MacArthur. \nGeneral MacArthur in his farewell address to the cadet corps of West \nPoint uttered three words that have become part of America's bright \npages: Duty, honor, country.\n  Whenever I think of Howell Heflin, I think of that moment 50 years \nand 9 months ago when, as a captain of the Marine Corps, he lead the \nfirst wave of marines on the island of Guam. He will never be forgotten \nfor that. On that first attack, he was wounded. And at that point, most \nmen would have said, ``I have done my part.'' But, no, Captain Heflin, \nthough seriously wounded, continued to lead his men up the steep hill \nuntil he was once again wounded. This time he had to be evacuated. For \nCaptain Heflin, duty was an important word. Honor was part of his \ncharacter. And country was his first love. For that, he received two \nPurple Hearts and the Silver Star for bravery. And so on this day, I \nwould like to remember him as one old soldier of World War II to \nanother old soldier. Godspeed, sir.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join the ranks of those who are \nsaddened to hear the announcement of our good friend from Alabama, and \nmost of the things that any one of us would have wanted to say have \nalready been said. But Howell and Mike Heflin have been close personal \nfriends and will be close personal friends to me and Catherine for a \nlong time to come.\n  I think most of us now today are thinking of the times that we have \nsat with Howell in the Ethics Committee, and I, too, served with him \nthere, or traveled with him, along with my good friend from West \nVirginia, to deal with foreign parliamentarians or to NATO.\n  Senator Heflin has a special spot in Alaska, too, because he has, \nfrom time to time, played hooky with me and dropped a line in a few \nrivers of Alaska. That is how I am going to cherish the memory of my \nfriend. As a matter of fact, Mike caught most of the fish, but Howell \nand I did most of the fishing. We have had a wonderful time together in \nterms of just learning to know one another.\n  This is a strange body to many people. We are 100 different \nindividuals. As the Senator from West Virginia says, ``our friends go \none by one.'' But the friendships that we are able to form here, \ndespite the tensions and the conflicts, and despite the politics, and \ndespite the fighting that goes on from one side of this aisle to the \nother, those friendships are really what the Senate is all about, in my \nopinion. From a personal point of view, it has really been a great \nprivilege to all of us to have served with Judge Heflin. We are going \nto be here for another 18 months or so, so we are not saying goodbye, \nHowell.\n  Mr. President, it is one of the rare privileges that some of us have \nin this democracy to be able to come together with distinguished \ncitizens of other States and get to know them, get to know their State \nand their ways--the ways of the people of their State through them. I \nknow of no State that has sent a better representative to the Senate in \nthe time I have been here than Alabama when they sent Howell Heflin \nhere. And, as I said, we are going to be saddened to see him leave.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me join those who have expressed \ntheir good wishes to Senator Heflin on this occasion. One of the \ncoincidences of my service with him here in the Senate is that when we \nwere first elected in 1978 and came to the Senate that following \nJanuary, we were assigned to the same committees--he on the Democratic \nside, of course, and I on the Republican side. We were assigned to the \nEthics Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the Agriculture \nCommittee. So on all three assignments we served together. It did not \ntake long to come to know him as a person of much intelligence and \ngreat commitment, with a conscientious sense of duty to the people who \nsent him here to represent their interests as effectively as he \npossibly could. And effective he was during debates on agriculture \nlegislation, where I can remember his taking on one of the more \nexperienced, able and articulate Members on our side, Senator Dick \nLugar of Indiana, in a tough debate on the peanut program. It was one \nof the finest discussions of a legislative issue that I have ever \nheard, before or since. Each argued very persuasively from different \npoints of view about this issue that was before the committee. Howell \nHeflin did an exceptionally good job, and he won. It was a close vote. \nHe may get to do that again this year. So he ought to dust off his \nyellow legal pad. He had written out the remarks he was going to make, \nin his own handwriting, page after page after page, on a yellow legal \npad. I hope you can find it if you need it.\n  Mr. President, in the Ethics Committee, some very difficult decisions \ncame before that committee, and he was our chairman. He was a freshman \nmember but was selected to be the chairman. As a brandnew Member of the \nSenate, that is quite an interesting honor and an indication of the \nesteem in which he was quickly held by those who had the responsibility \nfor making those decisions.\n  On the Judiciary Committee, his wisdom and his experience were \nbrought to bear very quickly on all of the matters that came before \nthat committee. But above all, I came to respect him and appreciate him \nas a friend, someone who is congenial, courteous, very much a \ngentleman, and someone who appreciated the Senate and its role.\n   [[Page S4782]] As you know, he had an uncle, Thomas Heflin, who \nserved in the U.S. Senate. I heard him one day on the floor--or maybe \nit was in committee--say that his uncle had been called ``Cotton Tom \nHeflin'' because he was such a strong proponent of the cotton interests \nin agriculture legislation. He started calling me ``Cotton Thad'' \nbecause I was taking up for cotton farmers, too.\n  We are going to miss Howell Heflin very much. The Senate is going to \nmiss Howell Heflin very much. We are going to, I think, appreciate more \nas time goes on, the mark he has made here. I join others in wishing \nhim well and expressing my affection for him on this occasion.\n  We truly regret his decision not to seek reelection next year.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have to join in terms of expressing my \nsorrow at the announcement of the Senator from Alabama, Howell Heflin, \non his intended retirement. It seems like this is a virus that is \ncatchy here on the floor of the Senate. I have to face that question \nmyself in the same timeframe. I have not quite reached that conclusion. \nBut Senator Heflin has been referred to as an effective member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Ethics Committee, and any committee he serves on. \nI have seen him in action here on the floor of the Senate.\n  As a nonlawyer, I have been able to understand some of these legal \nquestions that are debated with greater clarity when Howell Heflin has \nexplained them. So I am grateful for his role as a mentor for us laymen \non high and sometimes elusive legal points.\n  I want to talk a few moments about Howell Heflin in another role. We \nhave, on Wednesday morning, a Senate prayer breakfast.\n  It is usually presided over by someone selected by acclamation and/or \nby the person who is absent that day, that he is selected as the year-\nahead chair of this group.\n  Senator Heflin and Senator Stevens started a tradition of cochairing \nthe Senate prayer breakfast. Now, there is one place in the Senate \nwhere we leave our masks, our labels--moderate, liberal, conservative, \nour party identification--at the door. Probably there is no other part \nof the Senate institution in which people feel so comfortable in being \nthemselves. It is never published. It is not open to the public. It is \na very private session of spiritual reflection.\n  Senator Heflin comes from the South. I have come to the conclusion \nthat the people who are the best storytellers, their geographic origins \nare Southerners and New Englanders--the dry humor of Vermont and the \nmarvelous storytelling capability of Southerners.\n  I remember Howard Baker, who was our majority leader and minority \nleader at one time. He could make a point so effectively by telling a \nstory. That is true with Senator Heflin as it relates to some biblical \ntruths that we like to discuss. We get into some--not heated \ndiscussions--but we get into some repartee in terms of Scripture and of \nbiblical truths.\n  Howell Heflin has that great capability of going to the heart of a \nmatter and making a point with a marvelous sense of humor, at the same \ntime with a very profound conclusion or analysis.\n  Let me illustrate: One day we were talking about a subject I do not \neven remember. Senator Heflin says, ``Well, that reminds me,'' and he \nstarts out slowly, as we know, in his speech. ``That reminds me of the \nSunday school teacher'' down in his southern part of the country who \nwas teaching the children one day at Sunday school about the evils of \nalcohol and the evils of drink. Whereupon one little student raised his \nhand and said, ``But, Teacher, Christ turned the water into wine.'' And \nthe teacher said, ``Yes, and I would have thought a lot more of him if \nhe hadn't done it.''\n  It made a very major impact upon the discussion of that moment. I \nremember the illustration without remembering the subject.\n  I want to say this is a side of Howell Heflin that I wanted to, at \nleast, thank him and pay tribute to him for having contributed to the \nspiritual life of this body in the informal sessions that meet.\n  If anyone thinks Senator Heflin and Senator Ted Stevens make an odd \ncouple in leading a spiritual group, that gave it more authenticity. It \nwas not just bipartisan, but we had certainly an interesting \ncombination of personalities and dedication.\n  I want to say to Senator Heflin not only will we miss you, sir, but \nmost especially, too, we will miss Mike.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was just downstairs, Mr. President, doing a satellite \nfeed to a group back home. The group was a group of REA members. I \nheard that Judge Heflin had decided not to run for reelection. My first \nthought was, ``What an incredible loss for this Senate. What an \nincredible loss for the country, and what an incredible loss for the \nrural electrics.''\n  I thought this is really appropriate that I am talking to a rural \nelectric group when I find out that Judge Heflin has decided not to run \nagain, because Howell Heflin has been a champion for rural electric. He \nhas been a champion for the little guy. He has been a champion for the \nfarmers. He has been a champion for rural people.\n  All of that has flowed from a real commitment to the people that he \nrepresents. I was thinking of the remarkable career of Howell Heflin, \nchief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for 6 years; somebody who \nwas selected in 1975 as the finest appellate judge in the entire United \nStates; somebody who came to the U.S. Senate and became known as the \nspokesman for southern agriculture.\n  Let me just say that was deserved because I serve on the Agriculture \nCommittee with Howell Heflin. Nobody is a more determined spokesman, a \nmore effective spokesman, or someone for whom his colleagues have more \nrespect than the man I always call Judge Heflin.\n  When he spoke about a matter that was important to his constituency, \nwe all listened. And we listened because he presented his case in terms \nof substance but also with a sense of humor. I think of so many times \nhe brought a smile to my face on that committee. I can remember the \ntime we were talking about drought aid. Different commodities were \nbeing considered. After we had pretty well completed the package, \nHowell Heflin raised his hand and said, ``Mr. Chairman, what about \npeaches?\"\n  Well, no one had thought about peaches. We were not going to include \npeaches in that package, but after Howell finished, we included \npeaches, and we did it because Howell Heflin convinced members it was \nthe right thing to do. How many times he convinced members that what he \nwas advocating was the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, to me it is a real sense of loss that brings me to the \nfloor, because Howell Heflin has not only been somebody I teamed up \nwith on things that I thought were important to the people I represent, \nbut I also believe that Howell Heflin is really the best kind of \nelected representative. He cares deeply about doing a good job of \nrepresenting the people that sent him here. He always has that great \nair of integrity and fairness.\n  I remember when he was chairman of the Ethics Committee and handled \nsome of the most difficult cases that have ever come before this body. \nI do not think there was a Member in this Chamber who did not know that \nHowell Heflin was going to treat people fairly. Whether they were on \nthe other side of the aisle or on this side of the aisle, Howell Heflin \nwould treat them fairly. He would treat them equally.\n  We are going to miss Howell Heflin, a real champion for the people of \nAlabama and a real champion for the people of America. Howell, I do not \nknow anybody in this body who deserves a good retirement more than you \nand Mike do. But I must say you will be missed in the U.S. Senate. I \nthank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I was in a committee when I learned that \nmy colleague from Alabama, Senator Heflin, had made a statement that he \nwas not going to seek reelection for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate.\n  As his junior Senator--which he used to remind me he wanted me to \nremain the junior Senator for a long time, and I acquiesced. I said, \n``I want you to remain the senior Senator for a long time.''\n  I want to remind Members that he is not leaving today. He has nearly \n2 years that he will be with the Senate, \n[[Page S4783]] and his presence will be known, his presence will be \nfelt.\n  I will, as his colleague from Alabama, appreciate every day his \ncounsel, his maturity, and his, at times, recommendations of what to do \nand not to do and how to do it.\n  In 1970--it seems just a few years ago--Howell Heflin was elected to \nthe office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama. On that \nsame day, I was elected to my first term in the State senate. I had the \nopportunity to get to know Judge Heflin better, to work with him, to \nwork with him on modernization of the courts of Alabama, for which he \nwon a national award for his leadership and was greatly recognized for \nthat.\n  In 1976 he chose not to run for reelection as chief justice of the \nSupreme Court of Alabama. Somebody said, ``Well, he is retired.'' We \nknew, Judge, you had not retired. You were just going into some other \nthings--maybe the practice of law, maybe teaching, which he did for \nawhile. But, in 1978, he ran and was elected to the U.S. Senate from \nAlabama, the first time. Again, our paths crossed. I was elected to the \nU.S. House of Representatives on the same day that he was elected to \nthe Senate. He was sworn in to the U.S. Senate. I was sworn in across \nthe road here, to the U.S. House of Representatives. So we continued to \nwork together. With his leadership here, he was the senior Senator, I \nworked with him the 8 years I was in the House. Then, when I was able \nto join him in 1986, I continued to work with him.\n  He has served not only Alabama, our State, but the Nation with \ndistinction. We are not going to miss him for awhile because he is \ngoing to be with us. But I will miss him after the 2 years. And I want \nto say to his family--his wife Mike, his son, Tom, and his \ngrandchildren in Tuscumbia, he is not going to retire. He is just going \nto do something else.\n  Thank you, Judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to add my comments to those of \nmy colleagues we have heard today on both sides of the aisle. I think \nit is very clear from the things we have been hearing for the last hour \non the floor that Judge Heflin, Senator Heflin, has the deep respect of \npeople from both sides of the aisle.\n  I was not sure what Senator Heflin would do because I knew he had \nhealth problems. But I had hoped he would continue to serve because he \nis such a good person and because I have enjoyed getting to know him. I \nhave gotten to know him through the Senate prayer breakfasts that have \nbeen mentioned here earlier, which are a very important time for us to \ncome together on a bipartisan basis and talk about the things that are \nbringing us together and the things that we ought to remember about \ndoing what is right rather than what is expedient, or rather than \nsomething that is of a partisan nature.\n  I have really enjoyed the Wednesday morning prayer breakfasts because \nit is a time when we can come together in that spirit. Sometimes it \nseems that is the only time during the week that we have that sense of \ncloseness and bonding here in the Senate.\n  But, as I have heard my colleagues talk who have known Senator Heflin \nand served with him for years, he and his wife, Mike, who is very much \na part of his team, are so well loved. I just want to say to him: \nGodspeed. I hope he will not be gone after he does retire, but will \ncome back and visit with us on Wednesday mornings, or any other time he \nis able to do it.\n  I think all of us should respect someone who leaves on their own \ntime, who follows their own compass, and who does what is right for \nthem in their lives rather than staying too long or in any way having \nsomeone else decide for them what is right for their lives.\n  So I wish him well. I would like to add for the record my deep \nrespect for this man who has served his country in so many different \nareas--two branches out of the three of Government. That is very \nunusual.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those paying \ntribute to our colleague, Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama who earlier \ntoday announced his intention to retire from the Senate at the end of \nthis Congress. I must say that his announcement today has taken me \nsomewhat by surprise as I had not thought that he had resolved in his \nmind whether or not to seek another term. Having done so, I wish him \nwell and note that he will be sorely missed in the Senate. His wit, his \nwisdom, and his unshakable demeanor have endeared him to all of us.\n  Senator Heflin has served his home State of Alabama well and with \ndistinction over the last 18 years. I have often relied on his \nexperience and reason in the areas of his work on the Judiciary and \nEthics Committee. He always brings to the topic at hand the level head \nhe acquired through years of sitting on the bench. His integrity has \nnever been challenged and my respect for him has only grown since he \njoined the Senate. When I think of his tenure in the Senate I \naffectionately remember the finer traditions of the Senate marked by \ncomity and discourse rather then rancor and partisanship. The Senate \nneeds more people like Howell Heflin and I regret, but understand, the \ndecision he has made. I wish him and his wonderful wife well as they \nanticipate their return to Alabama and commend him for a particularly \nhonorable and distinguished career in the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in expressing \nsincere regret that the Senator from Alabama has decided not to stand \nfor reelection next year.\n  It has been my privilege to serve with him on the Judiciary \nCommittee. The majority has shifted four times since we have served \ntogether. But, I have to say that regardless of whether Howell was in \nthe majority or the minority, he was always fair, always astute in his \nanalysis, and always courteous.\n  Like the judge he was before coming to the Senate, Senator Heflin has \nbeen a keen student of the law. I will surely miss his legal ability on \nthe Judiciary Committee, not to mention his sense of humor and \ncomraderie.\n  But, as the junior Senator from Alabama noted, Senator Heflin is not \nleaving today. I have appreciated working with him on several key \ninitiatives over the last few months including the balanced budget \namendment, an amendment to the Constitution to protect our flag from \ndesecration, and regulatory reform, to name just a few. I will \nappreciate working with him still during the next year and a half on \nthe many pressing issues we face during the 104th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from West Virginia \nwhether I am in fact interrupting? I was going to take about 5 minutes, \nbut if I am in the Senator's way--would it be all right, if I had 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. It certainly will be.\n  Mr. President, if I may be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I share the expressions, the words of \nadulation, encomiums of praise, and the warm felicitations of \nfriendship that have been made by so many of our colleagues this \nafternoon.\n  I shall speak at another time. So, for now I just want to say to my \nfriend, Senator Heflin, who was one of my strongest supporters when I \nwas the leader, both in the majority and in the minority here, he \nalways had my great confidence with respect to his integrity, his \nfairness, and his judicious demeanor. I appointed him to the Ethics \nCommittee, an assignment for which he has never paused to thank me \nprofusely. But I want him to know I share these expressions of \nsentiment, and on another day I will try to do my own feelings greater \njustice than I would at this moment.\n  I do have an amendment and I ask unanimous consent I may yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota without losing my right to the \nfloor so that I may then call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, I actually do not know what I am going to say. I just \nheard about Judge Heflin's announcement. I do not have any prepared \ntext. Maybe later on I can come out on the floor of \n[[Page S4784]] the Senate with a more polished speech that the Judge \ndeserves. But I would like to just say a couple of things from the \nheart and from the head.\n  First of all, I knew about Judge Heflin before I came to the U.S. \nSenate, but I did not know him personally. That is the second part I \nwant to get into in a moment, the personal part. But as to what I knew \nabout Judge Heflin, I am Jewish but I would identify my baptism to \npolitics being the civil rights movement. There were certain heroes and \nheroines in the South who had the courage to take on what was a system \nof apartheid. It was apartheid. There were some great, great, great men \nand women who had the courage to speak up for civil rights for all \npeople.\n  By the way, I think that what happened in the civil rights movement \nenriched our country. It made the United States of America a better \ncountry for all people; not just black people, but white people, people \nof all colors.\n  Mr. President, Judge Heflin, Senator Howell Heflin, was one of those \ngreat heroes. He used his skills and has always used his skills as a \nlawyer to serve people and he served justice in the South and in our \ncountry. He lit a candle and he had the courage to speak out.\n  The prophetic tradition of my faith is that to love God is to love \njustice. If that is the case, Judge Howell Heflin is truly a Senator, a \njudge, and an American who loves God.\n  Mr. President, at a personal level, I just want to stand on the floor \nof the Senate and try to say: ``No. No. No. You cannot do this. I am \nopposed.''\n  I wish it was in my power, or I was able to have the persuasion to \nsay to Judge Heflin: ``You cannot do this.'' I am going to miss him. He \nis somebody I look up to--not just because I am 5 foot 5\\1/2\\. He is \nsomebody I look up to; somebody I believe in. He is the alternative to \ncynicism. He is hope. And he is honor.\n  Judge, I am going to really miss you. Thank you for everything you \nhave done for this country.\n  I might cry, so I am leaving.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4777-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4784-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatfield, Mr. Exon, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 423 to amendment No. 420.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment add the following:\n\n                      TITLE   --DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\n\n         downward adjustments in discretionary spending limits\n\n       Sec.   01. Upon the enactment of this Act, the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget shall make downward \n     adjustments in the discretionary spending limits (new budget \n     authority and outlays) specified in section 601(a)(2) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for each of the fiscal years \n     1995 through 1998 by the aggregate amount of estimated \n     reductions in new budget authority and outlays for \n     discretionary programs resulting from the provisions this Act \n     (other than emergency appropriations) for such fiscal year, \n     as calculated by the Director.\n\n\n  prohibition on use of savings to offset deficit increases resulting \n              from direct spending or receipts legislation\n\n       Sec.   02. Reductions in outlays, and reductions in the \n     discretionary spending limits specified in section 601(a)(2) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, resulting from the \n     enactment of this Act shall not be taken into account for \n     purposes of section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading the amendment.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is unambiguous and straightforward in its \nintent and in its effect. It will require the Director of the Office of \nManagement of Budget to lower the discretionary spending limits, for \nboth new budget authority and outlays, for each of fiscal years 1995 \nthrough 1998, by the amount of budgetary savings that will result from \nthe enactment of this act. This will mean that the savings, which will \nresult from enactment of the pending legislation, will go to deficit \nreduction only.\n  The savings cannot be spent on other programs. They cannot go for tax \ncuts. If my amendment is adopted the savings enacted in this bill will \nreally be savings, not fodder for tax goodies to the favored few or \npart of some shell game designed to save with one hand and spend with \nthe other. We need to reduce the deficits and my amendment will make \nsure that the savings in this bill will do just that.\n  The exact amount of deficit reduction that will occur from this \nmeasure cannot be determined at this time. That will depend on the \noutcome of the conference with the House on this bill. We do know, \nhowever, that the House-passed bill, H.R. 1158, contains a total of \n$17.4 billion in rescissions and other reductions in spending. We also \nknow that the committee substitute before the Senate contains $13.5 \nbillion in rescissions and other reductions. If the bill which passes \nthe Senate retains the $13.5 billion in spending cuts, and if the \nconference splits the difference--as it sometimes does--in rescissions \nbetween the two bills, the final conference agreement will result in \ndeficit reduction of somewhere around $8.8 billion. That amount of \ndeficit reduction will occur, even after paying for the FEMA \nsupplemental. That is a substantial amount of deficit reduction, \nparticularly, when one considers that these rescissions are being made \nhalf way through the fiscal year. This is not to say that I agree with \nevery rescission contained in the committee substitute. There will \nundoubtedly be amendments offered to restore a number of the proposed \nrescissions. I may vote for those amendments. But, whenever these cuts \nare made, one thing is clear and that is that we must do everything we \ncan to reduce the deficit at every opportunity if we are to reach the \ngoal of budget balance early in the next century. Therefore, if I \nsupport amendments to restore cuts in the bill, I will only do so if \nthose amendments have full offsets.\n  Senators should be aware that, without my amendment, the spending \ncuts made in the bill will not go to deficit reduction. If the \ndiscretionary spending caps are not lowered, as my amendment will \nrequire, the savings in this bill can simply be respent somewhere else. \nOr, as we have heard so much about, the savings could be used to help \npay for tax cuts or even for increases in direct spending. It is true \nthat to use the savings in this act for tax cuts, would require a \nchange in the Budget Act. But, that, Mr. President, is precisely what \nhas been proposed by \n[[Page S4785]] the House leadership. In fact, I am advised that today, \nWednesday, March 29, the House Budget Committee will report a measure \nwhich would waive the pay-go requirements of the Budget Act in order to \nallow reductions in the discretionary spending caps to be used to help \npay for the folly of all follies--tax cuts at this time.\n  To my mind that is an outrage. Here we are ready to cut Head Start \nPrograms, child care programs, money for computers in the classroom, \nmoney for scholarships, and funds for safe and drug-free schools, all \ncuts that will impact on programs designed to assist our young people \nwith getting a better start in life like a good education, better \nnutrition, adequate learning tools, assistance in the fight against the \nscourge of drugs, and, yet, there are some who want to take these \ndollars from our young people and parcel them out in tax cuts to the \nfavored few. Well what is wrong with that? There are several things \nwrong with that approach. First, we just went through a lot of agony \nand hand wringing, and heard a lot of passionate rhetoric about how \ncritical it is for this Nation's overall well-being to get these \ndeficits down. The balanced budget debate and the line-item veto debate \nwere about getting these deficits down.\n  For weeks we have had the wringing of hands and the gnashing of teeth \nover the need to reduce deficits. There was virtually no disagreement \nabout getting the deficits down. The disagreement was about what method \nshould be employed to accomplish that goal. Now, to come right along \nbehind that debate and blow all the savings in this bill like sailors \non leave to pay for tax cuts makes a mockery of all the hot rhetoric on \ndeficit reduction, and certainly further undercuts the American \npublic's view of the sincerity of the Members of this body.\n  Second, any tax cut proposal at this time is just plain foolish. We \nmust not squander our budget savings on tax favors. I like to vote for \ntax cuts. That is the easiest vote I have ever cast in 49 years in \npolitics, and in serving in legislative bodies at the State level and \nat the national level. It is the easiest vote of all. Whoopee. We all \nlike to vote for tax cuts. It is different to vote for tax increases. \nBut any tax cut proposal at this time is just plain foolish. To do so \nis tantamount to simply running on a treadmill--working up a sweat, but \ngoing virtually nowhere.\n  The Bible says ``to everything there is a season,'' but this is not \nthe season for a tax cut. It is common for politicians to try to be all \nthings to all people, try to make everybody happy, claim deficit \nreduction to some, but hand out tax cuts to others. But, this is the \nseason for coming to grips with the hard reality of our day. The time \nfor feel-good politics is over, and instead of making everybody happy \nwith phoney placebos, our duty is to make everybody perhaps a little \nunhappy in the short run for the good of all people--make the cuts and \nget the deficits down as we have promised.\n  The third thing wrong about tax cuts is that, in the case of this \nbill, unless we lock in these savings we will be paying for tax \ngiveaways on the backs of our children and grandchildren. All the tears \nwe have just shed on this floor over our children and grandchildren in \nthe balanced budget debate will have amounted to nothing more than \ntheatrics if we are willing to take from programs that assist our young \npeople and, instead of using them to reduce the deficit, pass them out \nlike party favors on tax cuts for the well-to-do.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that the President of the United States has \nproposed a middle-class tax cut. I am also aware that the so-called \nContract With America calls for a much larger tax cut--of \nsomething like $630 billion over the next 10 years. That is the cost of \nthe bill that has been reported out of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. Furthermore, after all of the provisions of the House tax \ncut bill are phased in, the revenue losses every year will total more \nthan $110 billion--for each year thereafter.\n  And who will get the lion's share of the benefits from these tax \ncuts? Will it be the average American family, where often both parents \nhave to work in order to make ends meet? Or, will these tax breaks go \ninstead to upper-income households and large corporations?\n  According to a Treasury Department analysis, less than 16 percent of \nthe benefits of the fully phased-in tax provisions as passed by the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee would go to 60 percent of all families \nwith incomes below $50,000. The top 1 percent of families with incomes \nof $350,000 or more a year would receive 20 percent of the tax \nbenefits, while more than half of the tax goodies would go to the top \n12 percent of families--those with incomes over $100,000 per year.\n  Also, according to an analysis by the Treasury Department, over half \nthe benefits from the House Ways and Means Committee's capital gains \nprovisions would go to the wealthiest 3 percent of families who have \nincomes over $200,000, while three-fourths of the benefits would go to \nthe top 12 percent of families who have incomes over $100,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, I cannot imagine a more perverse policy than one that \ncalls for paying for tax cuts for the wealthy through cuts in programs, \nsuch as the ones contained in the bill now before the Senate, which \nprovide education and other forms of assistance to the Nation's \nneediest children and families. I urge my colleagues to reject such an \napproach by supporting my amendment. In so doing, we will at least have \nensured that the savings from the painful and difficult cuts that are \nbeing made in this bill will go only toward deficit reduction. Such an \napproach will benefit all Americans, not just the wealthiest among us.\n  Mr. President, to me this is a moral issue. It has to do with \ntruthfulness; it has to do with fairness; it has to do with conscience.\n  And unless this amendment is adopted, I cannot support this \nlegislation.\n  I cannot be a party to making these difficult cuts, without the \nassurance that these reductions will only be used to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  I will not indirectly cast my vote for tax breaks for the wealthy by \nvoting for painful cuts that, without my amendment, may be used to \nfinance subsidies for the rich.\n  I urge us not to make a parody of the recent serious debate just held \non this Senate floor on the line-item veto and the balanced budget \namendment. We have promised the American people we will reduce this \ndeficit and do it we must. Today we make our first serious downpayment \non our pledge with the adoption of this amendment. I urge that it be \nadopted by a strong vote so that the Senate, at least, will put its \nmoney where its mouth is and keep its commitment to the American \npeople.\n  I am against a tax cut at this time. I do not care who advocates it, \nwhether it be President Clinton or whether it be in the so-called \nContract With America. It is the wrong time. It is the wrong thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, as an additional cosponsor, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Mr. Harkin's name may be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall ask for the yeas and nays. I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 32 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I understood that Mr. Exon wanted to speak on this amendment. If \nthere are other speakers, I would like to know.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The absence of a quorum having been suggested, the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague from West Virginia and I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  I commend the Senator for his thoughtful and timely amendment. Some \nof our colleagues talk a good game of deficit reduction. Yet, when it \ncomes to taking action, they sometimes get cold feet.\n  I would like to point out that, even though the distinguished Senator \nand I were on opposite sides of the fence when it came to the balanced \nbudget amendment and the line-item veto, we are, nevertheless, united \nwhen it comes to deficit reduction. We proved that in 1993 when we \nworked hand-in-hand to pass the largest deficit-reduction plan ever, \nand we prove it again today. I am proud to stand with my friend, \nSenator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Herein lies a lesson for all of our colleagues. No party has a \nmonopoly when it comes to deficit reduction. No individual has all of \nthe answers. We can hold different views, but when it comes to specific \nspending cuts and real savings, we should be one body dedicated to a \ncommon cause--getting our fiscal house in order.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the relentless drumbeat from the other \nside of Capitol Hill to cut taxes, the American people have their \npriorities in order. And I hope the House and the Senate will listen. \nOf course, they want lower taxes, but they want a balanced budget \nfirst.\n  The American people are not selfish and certainly they are not \nfoolish. They want to get Government spending under control. They know \nyou cannot run with the rabbit and hunt with the hounds. They want to \nprotect their children's and grandchildren's future.\n  They certainly question the Contract With America when that contract \ngoes so far as to deviate from common sense.\n  The American people are willing to accept the sacrifice that comes \nwith creditable deficit reduction. They are willing to accept the pain \nof deep spending cuts, but only if those cuts go toward balancing the \nbudget, and not spending elsewhere in the form of tax decreases. The \nAmerican people know you cannot have it both ways. There is the rub and \nthere is the root to this frustration.\n  I believe that the Byrd amendment takes head-on that proposition by \nsaying that the savings that we made in this legislation will go for \ndeficit reduction--deficit reduction--and nothing else.\n  What confounds the American people are the complex rules that go \nalong with our budget process. In the never-never world of the budget, \na spending cut is not always a spending cut. It is like a lizard's tail \nthat comes off in your hands. We cut program after program, but cuts \noften become new spending and the deficit continues to grow.\n The lizard grows another tail, and on and on and on we go.\n\n  Mr. President, we could slash the space station. We could eliminate \nanother 100,000 Federal jobs. We could cut every discretionary program \nby 10 percent. However, those savings mean nothing unless we make the \ncuts permanent and specifically apply them toward deficit reduction.\n  I am convinced that is what the vast majority of the American people \nwant, and I know that the Byrd amendment now before us does exactly \nthat.\n  Fortunately, the Senator from West Virginia is right on top of the \nissue. The emergency spending bill before the Senate today could be \nfertile ground for spending mischief. The appropriators propose to cut \n$13.5 billion and will spend $6.7 billion in relief for last year's \nearthquakes in California. But what about the difference? What about \nthe difference, Mr. President, the $6.8 billion in supposed savings?\n  Without the Senator's amendment that we have just referenced, that \nmoney could be spent elsewhere, and might be. But the Byrd amendment \nputs a lockbox around these savings and prohibits the money from being \nspent. The savings are dedicated solely to reducing the deficit. It is \nthat clear, it is that simple, and it is that necessary.\n  In fact, this is a safe within a safe. We need the extra safeguard \nbecause the bill before us deals with emergency spending which is not \ncounted against the deficit. In the absence of a lockbox, the cuts made \nto pay for earthquake relief could be spent later this year on \nsomething entirely different. Adopt the Byrd amendment and eliminate \nthat possibility.\n  So, once again, I commend the Senator from West Virginia for offering \nthis important amendment. Anyone who is serious about credible deficit \nreduction should support it. Some cynics may say that $6.8 billion is \nmerely a drop in the bucket when it comes to the deficit that will grow \nto $299 billion by the year 2000, if we believe projections.\n  However, the Byrd amendment demonstrates how we will reduce the \ndeficit by making specific cuts in spending and locking away those \nsavings for deficit reduction and for no other purpose.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. It makes sense from every aspect, and I will be \nkeenly disappointed unless the Senate recognizes the wisdom of this \namendment and adopts it overwhelmingly.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator may \nrequire.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I did not realize we were under a time agreement. I ask \nfor a couple minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield as much time as the Senator needs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent to be \nadded as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do so because I believe what the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska has just said is absolutely \ncorrect. If, indeed, we are serious about doing what we have said over \nand over again over the course of the last several months with regard \nto deficit reduction, we need this amendment.\n  We need this amendment because, indeed, we say by adopting this \namendment that we are serious, that we recognize that the first and \nreally only purpose of a rescission is to ensure that we can cut \nspending and dedicate the savings to deficit reduction. We know that \nover the course of the next 7 years, we may have $1.8 trillion of \ndeficit reduction work ahead of us. We must begin with this bill. We \nmust continue in a budget process that will allow us a blueprint to \nensure that between now and the year 2002 or the year 2003 that we have \naccomplished again what we have indicated we want to do.\n  So this is the first step. It is a step with regard to process, but \nit is a step with regard to demonstrating our true intention that, \nindeed, we are determined to reduce the deficit; indeed we are going to \ntake the tough decisions we made with regard to this rescission and \nturn them into budget savings; indeed we are determined to do all that \nwe can, collectively, to ensure that what we say we are going to do we \nare going to do in the long term. That is what this amendment does.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has offered it before on \nother pieces of legislation and, I must say, I hope that on this \noccasion, we can have broad bipartisan consensus in support of it \nbecause, indeed, it puts the rest of our efforts over the course of the \nnext couple of days as we debate the real rescission package, its \nscope, its size, its practical application to the budget process in \nmuch more realistic terms.\n  This ought to have been the first amendment, because if it had been \nthe first amendment, I think we could have all said unequivocally, \nregardless of what else we do, as we debate size and as we debate \noffsets and as we debate all the other issues pertaining directly to \nthis bill, the one thing we will not debate is what we do with the \nsavings once they have been promulgated.\n   [[Page S4787]] This amendment says unequivocally that those savings \nwill be used for deficit reduction, and I hope, again, with unanimity, \nthis body can support it this afternoon.\n  Again, I commend the leadership offered to us by the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, and I hope we can support him in this \neffort when we have our vote later on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know from whom I must request \ntime. I have been informed by the Parliamentarian that that is a \nmistake, that Senator Daschle technically controls the time that \nSenator Hatfield controls. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Because it says ``in the usual form.''\n  Senator Daschle, I believe, unbeknownst to both of us, controls 45 \nminutes. Can the Senator yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say that I had the amendment that \nSenator Byrd offered all ready. In fact, I carried it over to him \nyesterday thinking that I would offer it. He said he already had it \nready. I was shopping mine to show him what was in it. So I am a \ncosponsor. There is no use doing it twice, nor should there be \nnecessarily any pride of authorship on my part since Senator Byrd had \nthe amendment ready, and it is here.\n  The first big issue we could have is whether we waive the Budget Act \nin order to adopt this amendment. That means we need 60 votes. I hope \nthat everybody in this Senate, Republican and Democrat, will vote to \nwaive the Budget Act for this amendment. It is a technical waiver. It \nis not a waiver that has to do with incurring more debt. It is just \nthat this proposal has to go before the Budget Committee to be \nreviewed, and technically, if it has not, it is subject to quite an \nappropriate point of order. We would not want all kinds of things \ncoming straight to the floor that change the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act. So we need that point of order. I hope \neveryone will vote for a waiver if it is necessary.\n  Essentially, it is not necessarily the case that if Congress approves \nrescissions and literally cuts money out of ongoing programs that those \nsavings would go toward deficit reduction. That is not necessarily the \ncase.\n  As a matter of fact, if you did a rescission and you saved some money \nbut you did not provide for what happened to the savings, essentially \nyou could fill the cap back up with later spending. You could go from \nwhatever you cut all the way up to the cap that year, and you would \nstill be within the procedures of the Budget Act. You would simply have \ncut spending in one program and spend the savings on another program.\n  Obviously, we are in the midst of this gigantic problem of getting \nthe deficit under control, which I really believe the American people \nwant more than anything else. There may be those who are not yet \nshowing up in the polls saying they want deficit reduction, but I \nsuspect it is because they do not believe it will ever happen. They do \nnot believe we have the guts to do it, so some of them have already \ngiven up on us.\n  I want to make a commitment right here today. It may be very \ndifficult, and it may be that some people cannot vote for it, but I \nhave been encouraged, if not supported unanimously, by Republican \nSenators who come to meetings--and there was a large group today--that \nRepublicans ought to produce a balanced Federal budget by the year \n2002.\n  Now, that is not without risk, I guarantee you. We are looking for \nsome people on the other side of the aisle to help us. It is going to \nbe for real, and when it is finished, the Congressional Budget Office \nis going to tell the American people the budget is in balance.\n  Whatever vagaries of estimating may occur during the 7-year period \nleading to balance, we are going to produce a balanced budget, not in 5 \nyears, but in 7 years.\n  It would be absurd for us to make that commitment and then come along \nhere with a midyear reduction in expenditures for the very year we are \nin, $6 billion net, and not provide that we start that deficit \nreduction effort with these savings.\n  Would it not be folly to say, well, let us just wait around and see \nif we need this spending authority for something else, and then start \nanew in about 2 months with a budget resolution where we have to do 50 \ntimes this much over the next 7 years, or more?\n  Having said that, this is a very simple but very, very useful \namendment. It says the savings achieved by this midyear rescission or \ncarving out of already appropriated money will all go toward deficit \nreduction in the year we cut it. It will be traced in the budget \nbecause some of it flows into, or outlays in, other years. It will be \ncounted as savings in those years, and those amounts will go to deficit \nreduction.\n  In a sense, it lowers the caps in a manner such that it would be very \ndifficult to spend the money. But what we are saying is it cannot be \nused for anything else, and nobody should be worried about that.\n  For those who are wondering about tax cuts, there is no question that \nthe law is already very clear that you cannot use discretionary savings \nto pay for tax cuts. How much in tax cuts we will seek, I do not know. \nClearly under existing law, when you do that, you are going to have to \nhave entitlement changes to offset the tax cuts.\n  So I believe this amendment sends an absolutely clear message, one \nthat says we are not trying to fool anybody. If we are cutting a net $6 \nbillion, let us put it toward deficit reduction, and not leave this \nspending authority around for somebody to dilly-dally, play with, and \nperhaps even spend.\n  Let me make another point on how important this is, Mr. President. \nYesterday, the President of the United States, in a major, major press \nconference preceding his regional economic summit in Atlanta, told us \nabout $13 billion in savings over the next 5 years from the second \nphase of the President's reinventing of Government--$13 billion. \nNothing new about it. Incidentally, as it turns out, it is already in \nthe President's budget, that $13 billion in assumed savings, so it is \nnothing new. However, look at the proportion of savings. We are here \ndebating a bill that will cut a net of $6 billion out of existing \nappropriations for this year, and the President is touting a major \ndeficit reduction effort over 5 years for $13 billion. Actually, we \ncould take this little $6 billion savings and make it recur each year, \nand we would be over $30 billion, approaching three times the \nPresident's figure. Does anybody think we are not going to do at least \nthat as we put together a 7-year balanced budget? We will have to do \nmore than that.\n  So it is not that the President is not within his powers and quite \nappropriately talking about his kind of reform. But I think to make a \nbig case out of it being major deficit reduction pales; it does not \nquite hit the mark.\n  So I do not have any other remarks to make. I might have exceeded my \n5 minutes.\n  I hope we do not have to have this be even a close call. I welcome, \non our side, putting my name up here as the Budget Committee chairman. \nI think we should waive the Budget Act on this amendment if that is \nnecessary. I hope Republican Senators understand that we ought to do \nthis. To not do it would be true folly, and we could be subject to \nenormous criticism, and properly so, if we did not devote these savings \nto deficit reduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico. His word on this is very influential and meaningful. I am very \ngrateful for what he has said in his support for waiving what might be \notherwise a budget point of order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Feingold, \nDorgan, and Bumpers be added as cosponsors.\n  I will yield whatever time the Senator from Arkansas may desire off \nthe time that I control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from \nWest \n[[Page S4788]] Virginia for this very important proposal, which I see \nas a sign of things to come. I see this as absolutely essential for \nkeeping faith with the American people, who are counting on us to do \nsomething about the deficit.\n  Everybody knows that we are going to be a severe disappointment to \nthose people unless we give up the idea of this so-called middle-class \ntax cut and put this spending, which we are laboring mightily to cut, \non deficit reduction.\n  Just on a personal note, Mr. President, I have not received one \nsingle letter from a constituent saying, ``Please give me my middle-\nclass tax cut.'' And I have received literally thousands of letters \nfrom people saying, ``Please put it all on the deficit.'' You cannot do \nboth. And if you chose to do both, you would run into an unmitigated \ndisaster. You would have to cut Social Security; you would have to cut \nMedicare; you would have to cut unbelievable programs, such as \nveterans, to achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, or any other \nyear.\n  The proposal of the Senator from West Virginia is simple, \nstraightforward, dynamic, and absolutely necessary if we are serious \nabout deficit reduction.\n  We tried cutting taxes and increasing spending back in 1981. That was \n$3.5 trillion ago. We just finished, Mr. President, a very volatile \ndebate on the balanced budget amendment. I was on the unpopular side of \nthat issue, because I regard the Constitution of the United States with \na reverence reserved only for the Holy Bible. There were a lot of \npolitics involved in that debate. But you and I both know we cannot \nbalance the budget with political rhetoric. We cannot balance the \nbudget with anything less than common sense and spine.\n  I heard the Senator from West Virginia say a moment ago, when I was \nin my office listening to his remarks, that unless this amendment \npasses, which says this $6 billion in net spending cuts on this bill we \nare considering goes for deficit reduction, he will vote against the \nbill. And that makes a lot of sense.\n  There are a lot of cuts in this bill which, if I had a choice about \nit, I would prefer to keep. There are dramatic cuts in housing. There \nare dramatic cuts in jobs. There are dramatic cuts in a lot of programs \nwhich I cherish, which I think go to the very heart and strength of the \nNation. I do not want to go through this agony only to see it go out \nfor what is called a middle-class tax cut that includes people who make \n$200,000 a year.\n  I promise you that the workers of this country would get just about a \n13-inch pizza--the equivalent of the tax cut would be about a 13-inch \npizza on Friday night. If we balance the budget, as we say we are going \nto, I promise you, he would give up pizza for life in order to give his \nchildren some sense of a good destiny, so that they are living in a \ncountry that is worth living in and which has a great future. His house \npayment will not be as much. His car payment will not be as much. The \ndollar will again be king, and the people on Wall Street will be \nrhapsodic.\n  But that pales compared to the way the American people would change \ntheir attitude about this institution we call Congress.\n  Democracy always hangs by a mere thread. When we say to the American \npeople, ``We cannot function anymore. We made you a promise, but we do \nnot intend to keep it,'' we erode people's confidence in their \nGovernment. Every time you do that, you pay a little heavier price.\n  I may vote for this bill simply because I saw the remarks of the \ndistinguished budget chairman in the paper this morning. Senator, I \nwant to say I was heartened. I was heartened by your comments in that \nstory this morning. I am heartened when I see the chairman of the \nFinance Committee singing out of the same hymn book, the same page.\n  Then my heart sinks when I look at what the leader in the House and \nthe leader in the Senate are saying. Not singing from the same hymn \nbook. They say we will have a tax cut.\n  So I am really troubled about how I will vote on this. I do not want \nto vote for a tax cut. I wanted to vote for deficit reduction and keep \nfaith with the American people.\n  Mr. President, this vote is going to separate the people who want a \npolitical issue to talk about and those who really believe in deficit \nreduction. There has never been a more golden moment here where the \nU.S. Senate can stand up and say ``As much as I would like to give \npeople a tax cut, we are not going to do it, because we have a higher \nresponsibility.''\n  I am like the Senator from West Virginia. I have never made an enemy \nvoting for a tax cut. There is a Senator in this body came up to me \nabout 10 years ago and said, ``Senator, I just saw a poll that 92 \npercent of the people in this country do not want their taxes \nincreased.'' Well, no kidding. I would assume that figure would be 99 \npercent.\n  So, the choices cannot be easy, if we are serious. The choices must \nbe tough. Here is a vote that will separate those who want the issue \nfrom those who want to keep faith with the American people.\n  This amendment, carefully drafted, says ``You may not use this \ndeficit reduction for taxes, or increased spending.'' Bear in mind, it \nis not just taxes here. It says two things: Do not increase spending on \nsomething else planning to use this $6 billion as an offset; and do not \nplan to use it for a tax cut. It is just that simple.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding me this time. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no other requests from Senators who \nwish to speak. I assume that the distinguished minority leader would be \nwilling to have time under his control yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, would the Senator yield 1 minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I notice my friend from Arkansas said he \nwas ``heartened.'' Let me say I will be heartened almost to death if \nabout 10 or 15 people on that side of the aisle vote for that balanced \nbudget we were talking about.\n  That will be the test, not this little $6 billion baby. I think with \nthe great enthusiasm that I am hearing from that side of the aisle that \nthere might be great fever and fervor and enthusiasm for the balanced \nbudget that we have been trying to put together.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for yielding. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may retrieve 1 minute, I yield it to \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator for yielding 1 minute.\n  I do not want to open up the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nbut let me say to my good friend from New Mexico: Here is the \nopportunity to have the best of two worlds. Do not tinker with the \nConstitution, and balance the budget--both. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 423\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

If the Senator will withhold, the Senate is \nnot in order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, rather than moving to waive, in view of the \nfact that no Senator voted against the amendment, I shall ask unanimous \nconsent, to thus save a rollcall vote. I ask unanimous consent to waive \nthe provisions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and the \nBalanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for the \nlanguage of amendment No. 423 as included in any conference report on \nH.R. 1158.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to suggest what the \nimmediate agenda may be for the rest of this day.\n  We have amendments pending, and are ready to be offered by Members. \nWe urge them to be here. I think Senator McCain will be offering the \nnext amendment. We have on our list Senator Kyl, and Senator Pressler, \nand then we would like to finish today's activity between 7 and 7:30.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Senate is \nnot in order. We cannot hear the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would estimate that we would probably wind up today \nbetween 7 and 7:30, and earlier, if possible, depending on rollcall \npossibilities for the amendments that are ready to be offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4784-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4789-S4791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN OF ALABAMA\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take just a minute or two to say a few \nwords about our friend, Howell Heflin.\n  I was not able to get here earlier when Senator Heflin was on the \nfloor. Along with all the many kind things that were said about him, I \nwould like to add my own strong feelings of affection for one of the \nfinest Members of the U.S. Senate that we have ever had in our country. \nAnd that is, of course, Howell Heflin who is retiring.\n  I have gotten to know Howell very well over the last 6 years. He is a \nman of unquestioned integrity and intelligence. Howell Heflin is a \nperson who has the capacity for great friendship and compassion for \npeople. He is a person who always has dealt straightforwardly and \nhonestly with his colleagues and with his constituents. He is the kind \nof a man that--if we had 100 people like him, this would be an even \nfiner institution by far than it is today, and it would be a much \nbetter country even than we are today.\n  He sets an example of all the best things in public service, for his \nconstituents in Alabama, and for people all across this country.\n You have been a role model to me, a mentor and a friend. I, along with \nour colleagues, am going to miss you and the qualities that you \nrepresent as a legislator, as a Senator, and as a human being.\n\n  So along with the rest of us, I send you my respect and my affection \nand, indeed, my love.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to join my many colleagues in \npaying our profound respect to the judge.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I was told to look out for those \nSenators who were colorful, Senators who would always be there to kind \nof give a helping hand when you needed it.\n  Howell Heflin and I came to the Senate together, and from the first \nday the chief judge became one of those colorful Senators for most of \nus. He stood out tall in our freshmen Senate class, and now he stands \neven taller as he announces today his intention not to seek another \nterm in the Senate.\n  That was a sad message for me. For all Members of our Senate class \nwho came in with him, his friendship, indeed his wisdom, is something \nwe have sought and relied on through these many years.\n  I should like to also add that the Heflin family as a whole, his \nlovely wife, who has been an active member, are beloved members of the \nSenate family. When the judge did not have a smile, she would have a \nsmile. And I say to my good friend, how fortunate you have been in this \nlife of yours of many accomplishments to have had that very strong and \nfaithful partner by your side these many years.\n  (Mrs. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, as one who was privileged--and I say \nthis with a great deal of humility--to have worn the green of the \nMarine Corps, Howell Heflin is indeed one of those unheralded, true \nheroes of the U.S. Marines. He fought in the Pacific. He distinguished \nhimself. He was recognized for his heroism, his leadership, his courage \nby the United States of America, and I have always valued those days \nwhen in the course of the Senate life we had to address issues relating \nto the Marine Corps. Many times have we gone to the Marine Corps to \nattend meetings, to attend breakfasts, the two of us, to always express \nour gratitude to the corps. So I say to my good friend, ``Semper fi.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  As Judge Heflin, as we call him, is walking over to Senator Warner to \nshake his hand, I just wanted to add a couple of words.\n  If any American did just one or two of the things that Howell Heflin \nhas done in his life, that individual would be so blessed--to be a war \nhero, to be a great and respected judge, to be a great U.S. Senator, \none who has respect from both sides of the aisle and, indeed, \naffection.\n  I just want to say to you, Judge Heflin, that you have been my pal \nand my friend, that I have gone to you with the issues that perhaps \nwere not in your best interest to support but you always listened to me \nand you always made a judgment that you thought was right for the \npeople you represent but also what was the right thing for you to do as \na human being.\n  I just wanted you to know one more thing. I have served in the \nCongress for a long time, in the Senate just a few years, and I \nremember an incident that occurred on the floor when there was an \namendment brought before this body that on the surface maybe one did \nnot understand its true meaning and how much it would impact certain \npeople in this country.\n  Judge, you voted for that amendment, and then when our friend from \nIllinois came to the floor, Senator Moseley-Braun--I am so happy that \nshe is here--and she made the case to the Senate that that amendment \nwould really tear apart many of our people and bring back memories that \nhaunt them, you stepped back and you led this Senate in its reversal of \nthat amendment. You did not think about whether it would make you \npopular or whether you would win that vote, which you did. You led us \nonto the right path.\n  Judge, you are a leader, and we will miss you. There are not enough \npeople in politics who are willing to take the risks that you have \ntaken. God bless you. And myself, I find already that there is a void \nin the Senate just knowing you will not be here in a year and a half. \nBut let me tell you, I am going to look forward to working with you in \nthe remaining time that we have together in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n   [[Page S4790]] Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleagues and to join in saluting Judge Heflin as he is known to all \nof us who have had a chance to work with him. He is truly a beloved \nfigure.\n  A moment ago, I walked over and gave Judge Heflin a big kiss. Now, I \ndo not know if that is the way things have occurred in the Senate over \ntime, but the fact is that just as the Senator from California and I \nand the Presiding Officer represent the new Senate, Judge Heflin \nrepresents the new South, and he has given rise to the kind of \nleadership, the kind of moral force that has lifted up this body \ncertainly and, indeed, this entire country. His integrity, his \nintelligence, his commitment and faith in the Constitution of these \nUnited States, faith in what the American dream has always stood for \nand can be in the future, has led Judge Heflin in a direction that I \nthink is without peer and without parallel in this body.\n  He has provided constant leadership and always had the time to be \nnice. He has always had the time to listen. He has always had the time \nto take a junior Member under his wing and talk with them about the \nissues, no matter how arcane.\n  I remember working with Judge Heflin on the Judiciary Committee and \ngoing over issues having to do with ALJ's and bankruptcy reform and \nthings that really do not rise to the level of the press releases and \nthe things that make the news but that are vitally important in the way \nwe execute and administer the laws of the United States. He paid \nattention to the details with a sense of the law and history, with a \nsense of the philosophy and the right way to go in such a way as to \ngive leadership and guidance to those of us who had just joined this \naugust body.\n  I can tell you that the Senate is going to miss Judge Heflin. I \npersonally am going to miss Judge Heflin. I know the people of Alabama \nare going to miss having Judge Heflin's service in the Senate because, \nif nothing else, he has been an advocate for Alabama like I have never \nknown. My mother would have been very proud to know Judge Heflin.\n  My mother, by the way, Madam President, was originally from Alabama, \nand I consider myself to be--in fact, it is interesting. Judge Heflin \nis sitting on the floor with the Senator from Louisiana. Together they \nrepresent my parental ancestral homes, both Louisiana and Alabama.\n  But my mother came from Alabama. I used to spend summers there as a \ngirl. I grew up on a farm there in the summertime. I have a great love \nfor his State.\n  But certainly no one has loved Alabama more than Judge Heflin has. He \nhas worked for that State. He has worked for the people of that State. \nHe has worked to give the people of that State the kind of leadership, \nthe kind of guidance, the kind of strong advocacy in this body over \ntime.\n  I know his service in behalf of the people of Alabama will be greatly \nmissed. We will certainly miss him, precisely because he provided the \nmoral leadership and really the voice of what the South can be and what \nthe South is today. He has provided the leadership in regard to issues \nhaving to do with race, Madam President, in a way that was always \nconsistent, always fair, always straightforward. And he did so with \ncourage.\n  And I want to end by saying that I think if one thing distinguishes \nJudge Heflin, it is his courage. He stood on this floor about a year \nago and made probably one of the most eloquent speeches I have every \nheard in my life. He made it from the heart and he made it with great \ncourage. It was that courage, I am sure, that the people of Alabama \nrecognized when they elected him to serve in this body. He certainly \nhas done his best to fulfill the sacred trust that the people of \nAlabama put in him and in so doing he has provided a great service to \nall of the people of the United States.\n  He has been a force for good, he has been a force for the light. We \nwill all miss him. Even as we all make promises now, Judge, to come \nvisit you and see you, the fact of the matter is we are going to miss \nnot having you here every day in the next few years. So, farewell in \nthat regard, and my salute to you.\n  We love you. We cherish you. We cherish what you have done for all of \nus. And we will never, ever forget the tremendous role that you have \nplayed in leading this country in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I join in the tributes to Senator \nHeflin. It has been my great privilege to have participated on a couple \nof trips with him and his wife, Mike. He is a wonderful traveling \ncompanion and a wonderful friend.\n  The eloquent remarks that were made by the Senator from Illinois in \nconnection with Judge Heflin are certainly true. She mentioned his \ncourage. He has not only courage in debate, but he has physical courage \nthat was demonstrated by his receiving the Silver Star in World War II \nin the Marine Corps.\n  So, Judge, you have not packed your bags yet. You are going to be \naround for a year and a half, so we do not want to say farewell yet. \nBut we just want to say what a great treat it has been to have been \nassociated with you and with your wife on various occasions. We look \nforward to more of those instances arising in the future. We will \ncertainly miss you when you leave.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I hate to see Howell Heflin leave the \nU.S. Senate. We came here together. We were classmates. He and his \nwife, Mike, and my wife, Barbara, and I have had an awful lot of good \ntimes together.\n  I do not know of any better mind or any greater heart in the U.S. \nSenate. Howell Heflin's mind is a tremendous instrument of good, of \nbalance, of thoughtfulness, and compassion, but of logic.\n  His background as a judge brought great wealth to this Senate. We \nhave watched him over and over again tackle some of the most difficult \nissues that faced this country and bring to it a judicial temperament, \na willingness to look at all sides of an issue, and many issues have \nmore than just two sides. But we have stood in admiration as we watched \nhim analyze an issue.\n  And that great mind has been matched by a great heart. Howell Heflin \nhas brought dignity and decency to this institution. We all, I think, \nwould like to believe that we add a measure of that, but I do not know \nof anybody that has lived up to that requirement of public service that \nwe not only bring talent of intellect but that we also bring a human \ndecency to the job.\n  And so, I am glad for you, Senator Heflin--I have to be formal \nspeaking on the floor. Howell, I am glad for you. I am glad for Mike. \nBut, I must tell you, I am sad for Barbara and sad for myself. The \nSenate will be poorer. Your life, I know, will go on and you will have \nmore time to do things which you so long delayed. But we shall miss you \nterribly. And we will take full advantage of the year and a half left \nthat we have of your talent here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, there are four of us here on the \nfloor--Senator Pressler, Senator Levin, Senator Heflin, and myself. We \nall came here together in the class of 1978.\n  Howell Heflin and I were immediately placed on the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Levin, being more adroit, and Senator Pressler, too, \nmanaged to escape service there.\n  But Howell Heflin and I went to the Judiciary Committee side by side, \nfreshmen Senators. And we went immediately to work on the issues that \nalways confronted a Judiciary Committee, things like--tough ones--\nissues of judges, issues of immigration, issues of civil rights, the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  One of the greatest privileges I had was watching this man work on \nthe balanced budget amendment, day after day, year after year. The \nfirst bill out \n[[Page S4791]] of the chute every year was the balanced budget \namendment. And we were very close and I feel we will get there this \nyear. It will largely be a tribute to you, sir, when it occurs, to \nHowell Heflin.\n  And always you were supportive and helpful to me. When I would seek \nyour counsel, you would give it in a most honest and refreshing way, \nwith that extraordinary honesty and integrity that is, sadly enough, \nsometimes lacking, but not always.\n  But to me, you were a steady, thoughtful friend and very, very wise. \nI do not know many people who are wise. I know brilliant people. I know \nthoughtful people. I know intelligent people. You are a combination of \nall those things, but you have a wisdom and common sense which is \nenviable.\n  And in our travels together, you and I have a great common bond, and \nthat is humor; good humor.\n  I will miss your no-tie Hawkins stories, but not much. And I will \nshare with you the toast to water again, and the great story on \nwhiskey, of course, which is memorable in itself.\n  But, you and Mike have traveled side by side, as Ann and I have, \nthrough many years of life. And that remarkable woman at your side is \none of the most special ones to me and to my wife, Ann.\n  So as you go on to new things, knowing that the actual essence of \nyour life is your good humor, it reminds me of what my mother said--\nthat humor is the universal solvent against the abrasive elements of \nlife.\n  You have lived that way and you have helped us all by just saying, \n``Relax. Settle down. We have a job to do. Don't get swept up in the \nemotion of it.''\n  The counsel, the friendship, the trust you gave to me are deeply \nappreciated. We have shared much together. You are a very dear friend \nand we wish you well. Good luck and Godspeed. We will enjoy these many \nmonths more of working with you on things that will come to pass simply \nbecause of your presence, and the fact that you have decided to leave \nus will impel us to do things that are left undone that we will get \ndone as a tribute to you.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I join in the tribute to my good \nfriend and colleague.\n  I recall visiting his home in Tuscumbia, AL, and his lovely wife, \nMike, receiving us there. I recall serving on the Commerce Committee \nand the Judiciary Committee with him over the years, and I believe we \nhave been on a trip or two with some of these delegations.\n  So I congratulate him on great service to the United States. It has \nbeen a pleasure to serve with you. I think you are an example to all of \nus of what a good U.S. Senator is. I wish you all my best.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4789-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4791-S4798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nlegislation, which would provide for disaster relief and for \naccompanying rescissions.\n  This is not by any measure a partisan bill--indeed, it was put \ntogether by the Appropriations Committee in the same fine bipartisan \nspirit that has always characterized that committee, and the \nrelationship between two very fine and capable men--Chairman Hatfield \nand the ranking member, Senator Byrd.\n  I do believe, however, that there is good cause for many of us who \nare now in the majority, to be particularly pleased with this \nlegislation.\n  If there was one glaring, disturbing symptom of ``business as usual'' \nin Washington as practiced for too many recent years, it would be the \npractice of always saying ``yes'' to new spending, even when most \nalways failing to make the hard decisions to pay for it.\n  One category of spending in which this has been most obvious has been \nthe area of disaster relief. It is, of course, entirely fitting and \nproper that we provide assistance to those who are in need solely \nbecause of an ``act of God.'' But we have too often simply appropriated \nthis money, added it to the Federal deficit, and failed to prioritize \nour spending priorities within existing spending levels.\n  I joined our distinguished leader, Senator Dole, during the last \nsession, in attempting to provide for a full spending cut offset during \nthe last time the Senate considered emergency disaster appropriations. \nWe failed in that effort, I am quite sorry to say.\n  But today we see here a bill that not only provides for needed \ndisaster assistance, but more than makes up for that new spending with \nan even larger amount of spending cuts. This, to me, means that we have \ntruly arrived at a brand new day in Washington.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that we do no extra, special service to \nthe victims of disaster, nor to our future generations, by simply \nadding the tab for such spending to the future national debt. We do not \nneed to be reminded that we will soon be asked to vote the debt limit \nup to $5 trillion--an astonishing, incomprehensible, inconceivable \nfigure.\n  The accumulation of such massive debts does not assist us in our \nefforts to cope with disasters or to forestall their worst effects. It \nonly undercuts our ability to adequately provide for such work. There \nhas never been a good policy reason to add such spending to \naccumulating debts.\n  Rather, the existence of a natural emergency, of a climate of \nurgency, has simply been used extensively by this Congress as an \nexcuse--a ``good'' reason to deficit-spend.\n  I am so very pleased to stand here today and be considering a bill \nthat will provide for those in need but will not add to the Nation's \ndebt. I think it is notable that the first amendment to this \nlegislation--offered by our fine colleague Senator Mikulski--sought not \nto strike the proposed rescissions from the bill--but rather to replace \nthe targeted, considered rescissions with ``across-the-board'' cuts.\n  I opposed that amendment, as I believe the targeted approach to be \nthe better way to prioritize our spending.\n  I agree with my friend Senator Bond that we appear to assume that \nexisting priorities are perfectly set whenever we attempt across-the-\nboard cuts--though surely they are not. But I take heart in the offered \namendment as well--the consideration of such an amendment first shows \nus that we are in a new atmosphere these days, in which fiscal prudence \nis considered to be desirable. It shows that the voters indeed drove \ntheir message home hard last November.\n  I feel very pleased that my colleagues will approve the pending \nrescissions legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I propose an amendment, I would \nlike to make a few remarks on the legislation pending before the \nSenate.\n  First, I congratulate the managers of the bill, the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I think the $13 billion \nthat is going to be taken out of the deficit is an important step \nforward. I think that some very difficult decisions have been made, and \nI know that the Appropriations Committee has very difficult choices to \nmake.\n  I do note also that the House has cut $17 billion, a $4 billion \ndifferential. Many of those, of course, were carefully examined by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and were found wanting.\n  Madam President, earlier, I wrote a letter to the chairman of the \ncommittee recommending $6.3 billion in low-priority defense and \nnondefense items funded in the defense budget, as well as several \ndomestic programs.\n  I do not want to go through all the details, but clearly there was \nsome funding that could have been the subject of a rescission. I regret \nthat they were not included in this package. Things like $5.8 million--\nthis is out of the defense appropriations budget--$5.8 million for the \nNational Center for Toxicological Research; National Guard outreach \nprogram in the Los Angeles school district; directed allocation of \nchild development funds to the Pacific region; a wild horse roundup at \nWhite Sands missile range, New Mexico; electrical service upgrades; \nnatural gas study and infrastructure planning. \n[[Page S4792]] Again, these are out of the defense appropriations bill, \nI emphasize. $2.5 million--I am sorry, I did not give the amounts--$2.5 \nmillion to establish a land management training center; $2.2 million \nfor a natural gas study and infrastructure planning; $1.5 million for a \nwild horse roundup; $1 million for improvement of navigational charts \nfor the lower Mississippi River; $10 million for a Los Angeles school \ndistrict youth program.\n  Again, Madam President, many of these funds may be very important and \nvital, but what happens around here is if you cannot get it into the \nspecific appropriations for which they would normally be attached, \nthen, of course, they are in the defense appropriations because it has \nsuch a large amount of money available.\n  What is $1 million to improve the navigational charts for the lower \nMississippi? What is $10 million for the Los Angeles school district; \n$2.5 million for natural gas utilization; $10 million for natural gas \nvehicles; $10 million for electrical vehicles? The list goes on and on, \nMadam President.\n  What I am saying is that they had nothing to do with defense. They \nshould have been rescinded and, unfortunately, they were not.\n  Mr. President, $11 million for seismic research, that incorporated \nresearch institutions; $20 million for National Center for \nManufacturing Sciences; $5.4 million for Hawaii, small business \ndevelopment center; $1 million for Saltsburg Remediation Center, \nwhatever that might be; an additional $15 million for electrical \ncomputers; $4 million, Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing \nSystems; $5 million for nursing research; $1 million for the Police \nResearch Institute.\n  I might add, that was put in in conference, never scrutinized in any \nauthorization procedure or appropriations procedure on the floor.\n  Another $1 million for the southwestern Oregon narcotics task force. \nAgain, not in either bill; $18.5 million for a mental health care \ndemonstration project at Fort Bragg, NC, with an open-ended pricing \nprogram growth clause.\n  The list goes on and on, Madam President. The fact is that we should \nstop it. We had an opportunity to do away with some of, at least, the \n$6.3 billion that I had sent and recommended to the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I hope that in the years to come, we will try to \nexercise significantly more discipline.\n  Also, we proposed rescissions of $352 million which was appropriated \nfor earmark for surface transportation projects which do not \nnecessarily represent either Federal, State, or local priorities. We \nshould have rescinded any unobligated moneys, in my view.\n  The VA-HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 1995 included $290 \nmillion in special-purpose grants. According to estimates, only $7 \nmillion of this funding has been properly authorized.\n  Examples of projects funded in that bill which should have been \nrescinded is $450,000 for the construction of the Center for Political \nParticipation; $750,000 for the Sci-Trek Science Center to create a \nmezzanine level in its building to increase exhibit space in downtown \nAtlanta; $1.45 million to the College of Notre Dame in Baltimore, MD, \nfor capital costs, including equipping and outfitting activities in \nconnection with renovation of the science center; and $2 million for \nthe De Paul University library to provide direct services and \npartnerships with community organizations, schools and individuals.\n  Madam President, my point here is many of these programs are good \nprograms. Many of them are even needed programs. The question is, are \nthey needed to the degree where we should fund them out of taxpayers' \ndollars, unauthorized? And sometimes they even did not go through the \nappropriations process. They clearly did not undergo the scrutiny that \nwas necessary.\n  I would like to thank the committee for adopting language to rescind \nwastewater treatment earmarks put in last year. I also appreciate the \ncommittee's restriction on the expenditure of $19 million which was \nearmarked to construct a footbridge to Ellis Island, a bridge that was \nopposed by the National Park Service. The committee has agreed to hold \nup that money until an environmental impact statement on the project is \ncompleted. I think this is a prudent and responsible action, and I \ncommend them.\n  Mr. President, the committee should also be commended for making a \nnumber of spending cuts that exceed the House reduction. In fact, the \nSenate cuts more than the House in 61 programs.\n  I might point out that in several accounts, including highway \ndemonstration projects and local library programs, the Senate \nrescission does not even equal cuts recommended by President Clinton. I \nthink the Senate can and should do better, and I will offer an \namendment later to restore rescissions requested by the President.\n  I have been examining the bill in detail since it came out on Monday, \nhaving been marked up in committee last Friday. I am curious about a \nnumber of items that remain funded in the bill. I wonder if I might ask \nthe managers several questions.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in questions and \nanswers with the manager of the bill, the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask my friend from Washington, on page \n6 of the House report, which I do not expect the Senator from \nWashington to have, I will quote it to him.\n  The House rescission bill on page 6 said:\n\n       The committee recommends a rescission of $12,678,000 in the \n     Agriculture Research Service buildings and facilities \n     program. These funds were appropriated for the construction \n     of a swine research center. Additional construction cost \n     requirements for this facility are about $13 million. The \n     Agriculture Research Service currently conducts swine \n     research in at least 13 different Federal facilities at a \n     cost of over $26 million. Many of these programs and \n     facilities are ongoing projects. The agency has no plans to \n     abolish or move existing research and researchers to the \n     proposed swine center if it is constructed. The Department of \n     Agriculture has estimated this facility would cost about $10 \n     million annually to operate.\n       Existing legislation directs the downsizing of the Federal \n     work force. Therefore, providing additional researchers for \n     this facility would cause adverse effects in research \n     elsewhere.\n       Critical swine research could be carried out at an existing \n     ARS facility at considerably less cost than providing an \n     additional facility at a time when USDA is closing facilities \n     and reducing staff.\n\n  I ask my friend from Washington if he knew of that action that was \ntaken by the House and perhaps tell me where the facility is located \nand what that facility would do, if he has information.\n  Mr. GORTON. I may say to my friend from Arizona that I have the House \nreport here in front of me. My page 6 deals with the Department of \nState international organizations----\n  Mr. McCAIN. The bottom of page 7, top of page 8.\n  Mr. GORTON. Again, I answer my friend from Arizona in the following \nfashion: I do not see the Senator from Iowa on the floor, though I \nsuspect he will be back soon. I think he or the Senator from \nMississippi can better answer the Senator from Arizona. This Senator is \nhere in anticipation of an amendment by the Senator from Arizona on the \nsubject of the Interior Department Bureau of Indian Affairs, and I \nintended, in connection with the offsets, to defer most of the debate \nto those who were familiar with the program.\n  I do notice the Senator from Mississippi here. The Senator from \nMississippi is now on the floor. He is the manager of the portion of \nthe bill dealing with the Department of Agriculture, and I think he can \nprobably better deal with that question.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Arizona has asked a question about \na rescission included on page 7 of the House committee report with \nrespect to the construction of the swine research center and has asked \nfor its justification.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Mississippi would prefer to answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy \nto point out that in this part of the bill, there were several changes \nin the funding that the House had included in its legislation. There \nare a number of buildings and facilities and accounts. If I remember, \nthis is in the Agricultural Research Service part of the bill. I am \noperating on memory now. I was watching the television monitor when I \n[[Page S4793]] heard the Senator from Arizona pose the question about \nthis facility in Iowa. My recollection is that the House rescinded \nfunds for this project and we rejected this proposal and instead took \nfunds not needed for another project. The House bill also recommended \nfunding for a number of projects in the Cooperative State Research \nService buildings and facilities account be rescinded, and we decided \nnot to go along with any of them as a class.\n  The reason for it is, No. 1, I do not think the administration \nrequested those rescissions. No. 2, to go back through all of the CSRS \nbuildings and facilities projects halfway through the year and try to \npick out a few to cancel, in effect, or rescind funds at this time in \nthe year, would have imposed quite a task on the committee in terms of \nreevaluating all projects in that bill.\n  We looked at the overall approach as one where, first of all, the \nadministration's request for rescissions totaling $142 million in the \nPublic Law 480 accounts struck us as something that we should recommend \nfor approval. The House recommended only a $20 million reduction in \nfunding for title III. Our recommendation is for a $142 million \nreduction, which is what the administration requested.\n  We tried to make an independent judgment based on the facts as we \nunderstood them. Our committee had already looked at this proposal for \nthe research facility in Iowa and decided it was meritorious. The \ncommittee had agreed, the Senate had agreed, the House had agreed, and \nthe President had signed the bill appropriating the funds for it.\n  We decided not to go back and make a second guess at whether or not \nthe House was justified in its decision. We decided to leave it for a \ndiscussion with the House in conference. We will review that in \nconference. I will be interested in hearing what the arguments are. I \nhave consulted with Senator Grassley of Iowa. He told me he strongly \nrecommended the continuation of this funding, and I agreed with him.\n  So that is, in a nutshell, the process by which I reviewed that \naccount and decided to recommend to the Appropriations Committee that \nwe not agree with the House on that rescission.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Did not the Senator from Mississippi inform the entire \nAppropriations Committee that total rescissions falling within his \njurisdiction were, by percentage, either the highest, or one of the \nhighest, of any of the subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, I do recall that we are \nrecommending more outlay savings than the House, by far. Almost three \ntimes as much in outlay savings will be realized from the \nrecommendations under the agriculture and related agencies title of \nthis bill than will be achieved if the Senate had gone along with all \nof the recommendations of the House.\n  So we have differences of opinion. They recommended a rescission of \nall of the funds appropriated for the Farmers' Home Section 515 rural \nrental housing program. We decided not to do that. We refused to go \nalong with that. The administration did not request a rescission of \nthose funds, and we thought that it would be unfair to stop in the \nmiddle of the year and eliminate all the money that was going to be \navailable for that rural housing program. It is important in many parts \nof the country.\n  So I will say to my distinguished friend from Arizona, he can go \nthrough this bill and pick and choose and isolate and identify specific \nareas where we disagreed with the House. We did not rubberstamp what \nthe House has suggested. We seriously and carefully considered every \nprovision in the House bill, however. But we came to some different \nconclusions. We think we brought our best efforts to bear on that \nchallenge and, in a responsible way, made recommendations to the full \ncommittee on appropriations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand and appreciate the hard \nwork of the Senator from Mississippi and the Members of the \nAppropriations Committee. But it is also the right and, in my view, the \nresponsibility of those of us who also are Members of this body to look \nat these provisions. And as I discussed before the Senator from \nMississippi came on the floor, when there are billions of dollars \nappropriated for defense that have no relation to defense, and when I \nsee things like--for example, included is a recommendation for \nrescission which is only $93,000. But if the Appropriations Committee \ndid not see fit to rescind it for the National Potato Trade and Tariff \nAssociation, then obviously there is a certain degree of cynicism about \nsome of the things that I see in the appropriations bills.\n  Also, the House recommended that the funding for certain agricultural \nresearch centers be rescinded. Among them were a poultry science \nfacility, alternative pest control center, a chemistry building, \naquatic research facility, center for applied aquaculture, science \nfacility, southeast research station, food science facility, and the \nlist goes on and on--a plant bioscience facility, $3 million for a \nbotanical garden.\n  I suggest very respectfully to my colleagues that if the State wants \nto build a botanical garden, I do not see why they should not build it \nthemselves. A grain storage research extension center. A horse science \nand teaching center--that is one I do not understand at all. A horse \nscience and teaching center. I do not know if we are teaching horses or \nif we are learning about the science of horses. Either way, I think we \nhave probably explored that issue fairly extensively in the last couple \nhundred years. A biocontainment facility; a wheat research facility; an \nenvironmental simulation facility.\n  It all has to do, Madam President, with the role of Government. Do we \nspend money on these projects, such as a horse science and teaching \ncenter and a center for applied agriculture? Do we allow the State and \nlocal governments to do it, or does the Federal Government do it?\n  If the Federal Government does it and that is the judgment of this \nbody, that is fine. But then I have an additional problem because what \nwe have done is left programs like this in and taken other programs \nsuch as native Americans out.\n  That is the subject of my amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 424 to Amendment No. 420\n\n         (Purpose: To make adjustments to certain rescissions)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 424 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue reading the amendment.\n\n       On page 4, line 20, strike ``$1,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$14,178,000''.\n       On page 5, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n                        buildings and facilities\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-330 and other Acts, $20,994,000 are rescinded.\n       On page 19, line 12, strike ``$11,350,000'' and insert \n     ``$8,250,000''.\n       On page 19, strike lines 20 through 23.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment would rescind over $12.5 \nmillion for construction of a swine research facility and nearly $21 \nmillion which are construction feasibility study funds not yet \nobligated.\n  The House rescissions bill removed these funds. The Senate bill under \nconsideration would restore these funds.\n  Madam President, this amendment would also restore funding for the $5 \nmillion to Indian programs. I would describe those Indian programs \nwhich have been cut which I seek to be restored.\n  I cannot improve upon the case made in the House committee report for \ncutting $12.678 million, and I described earlier the House report for \nthe construction of a swine research center. Additional cost \nrequirements stated in the report for this facility are about $13 \nmillion. They also mention the cost of about $10 million annually to \noperate.\n   [[Page S4794]] It also points out that there is swine research being \nconducted in at least 13 different Federal facilities at a cost of over \n$26 million.\n  On a Cooperative State Research Services building facilities program, \nthe House report notes that there is a current backlog of $400 million \nto complete facility construction projects already in the pipeline.\n  The bill provides for 15 new feasibility studies and this amendment, \nwhich would conform with the House bill, would rescind all funds not \nyet obligated and stop all feasibility studies.\n  I have two reasons for offering the amendment. First, I support the \nSenate rescission bill that meets the House-passed rescission bill. In \nlight of the need for significant deficit reduction, I believe the \nSenate can and hopefully should be able to reach the goal.\n  Second, the cutting of $12.7 million and $20.1 million low-priority \nprojects permits the Senate to restore $5 million in Indian programs \nrescinded by the Senate bill, which Indian programs I believe are not \nappropriate for rescission.\n  Over the years I have served on the Committee on Indian Affairs, I \nhave come to the painful yet very certain conclusion that Indian \nprograms have been the last to be funded and the first to be cut.\n  Last month, the Congressional Research Service provided the Committee \non Indian Affairs with a study that showed in graphic form how the \ndisparity in per capita Federal expenditures between Indians and non-\nIndians, which first became negative for Indians in 1985, has steadily \nworsened since then, and further deteriorates in the fiscal year 1995 \nenacted appropriations.\n  Consequently, in recent weeks, as the 1995 rescission efforts have \nquickened in Congress, I have told Indian tribes on every occasion that \nI believe many of the proposed rescissions on Indian programs are a bad \nidea and that I oppose them.\n  The Senate bill already adequately addresses some of the House \nproposed cuts of tribal court funds, the Indian business development \ngrants, and an amount sufficient to permit construction of the Indian \nMuseum Cultural Center to proceed.\n  I strongly support efforts to maintain funding for these accounts so \nlong as they are offsetting reductions from lower priority programs. In \naddition, I believe there are other lower priority projects or programs \nthat should be cut, rather than the $5 million in several BIA accounts.\n  The amendment would restore $5 million in Indian funds and rescind \nand offset $12.7 million from the swine research facility. The $5 \nmillion is comprised of four items in the BIA operation of Indian \nprograms and Indian direct loan program accounts.\n  The Indian self-determination fund: These indirect cost fundings are \ncurrently needed by tribes under self-determination and self-governance \ncontracts and compacts to administer formerly Federal activities.\n  Last year, Congress passed Public Law 103-413 to encourage expanded \ntribal assumption of BIA programs as the Federal bureaucracy is \ndownsized. I am concerned the cuts will deter expanded contracting and \ncompacting. In addition, for the past 2 years, tribes have borne \nunreimbursed shortfalls in indirect costs because tribes spent funds \nunder cost plans approved by the Interior Department inspector general, \nbut later could not collect reimbursement from the BIA because funding \nhad not kept pace.\n  The second program is a community reservation economic development \ngrant of $600,000. Federal economic development funds, properly \nadministered and distributed, are absolutely vital to restoring the \ngrossly underdeveloped physical, economic, and social infrastructure of \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native communities.\n  This important program was begun in 1992 as a 5-year pilot program \nwhen 34 tribal proposals were competitively selected from 148 tribal \napplications. Most grants are used as seed funds to leverage additional \nfunding. The grants ranged from a low of $27,000. Fiscal year 1995 \ntotal enacted level for this program is $5.945 million.\n  Indian rights protection, $500,000. In the context of the \nDepartment's vast trust responsibility to protect, maintain, and manage \nIndian resources, these funds offer only minimal assistance to support \nreservation and native community level efforts to protect property \nrights.\n  Included in this account are funds for reserved water rights \nnegotiation/litigation and settlement expenses, funds to uphold the \ndirectives protecting native allotments prescribed in the Alaskan \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act, and funds to fulfill the \ninvestigation and certification mandates of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act.\n  The last program would be the Indian Direct Loan Program of $1.9 \nmillion. This account provides loans to tribes, Indian organizations, \nand individual Indian for-profit enterprises under the Indian Financing \nAct.\n  Fiscal year 1995 total enacted level for this account is $2.479 \nmillion, which through a subsidy arrangement is expected to leverage up \nto $10 million in direct loans this year, unless rescinded.\n  Madam President, I absolutely believe we must place short constraints \non appropriations in this and following fiscal years. The amendment \nwould restore less than one-half of the Indian program rescissions \nproposed in the Senate bill, and it would make offsetting cuts in the \nconstruction of the swine research facility in the cooperative State \nResearch Service buildings and facilities account.\n  These Indian programs are an extremely important expression of the \nsolemn government-to-government relationship the United States and this \nCongress has with American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal \ngovernments.\n  I believe we can achieve significant cuts in fiscal year 1995 \nspending, and we can do so even as we carry out our obligation to \nensure that the lowest priority projects are cut first before Indian \nprojects.\n  I want to point out again, Madam President, I am seeking a \nrestoration of approximately half of the Indian cuts that were made in \nIndian programs in this rescission bill.\n  If we look at the cuts that were made in Indian programs as a portion \nof the entire budget, we will find, as usual, that the cuts in Indian \nprograms is a much higher percentage than any other cuts, rescissions, \nthat have been made.\n  I am seeking to restore four vital programs that are important to the \nwell-being of Native Americans and the fulfillment of our solemn treaty \nobligations.\n  I might add, Madam President, having been down here on numerous \noccasions and embarked on efforts like these, I probably will not win \nthis amendment, this vote. I probably will lose it. But it is very \ndifficult for me to go back to the native Americans and tell them that \nI did not at least try to restore the funds that I believe are \nnecessary to try to help the one group of Americans whose conditions \nare worse than any other group of Americans.\n  I will not recite the statistics concerning diabetes, alcoholism, \nchild abuse, and all the other horrible and graphic statistics that \nafflict Indian country, because I have done that before and I am sure I \nwill probably do that in the future.\n  I feel that in keeping with my obligation to them as chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, I cannot, in good conscience, not seek a \nrestoration of the funding for at least those most vital programs.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I question the ruling of the Chair on \nthe request for the seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is now a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, as the distinguished Senator from \nArizona has pointed out, this amendment has two quite separate and \ndistinct parts. And of course, the arguments relating to those two \nseparate and distinct parts are quite separate from one another as \nwell.\n  The Senator from Arizona has fought a long and often lonely fight \nwith respect to many items and many appropriations bills. He was quite \neloquent, just a few moments ago, on the misuse of the defense \nappropriations bill for nondefense items, and went through quite a \nnumber of them. Yet this \n[[Page S4795]] amendment does not deal with an offset from the defense \nbudget for nondefense items. But, for some reason or another, it takes \non the agricultural appropriations bill which, as has already been \npointed out by the distinguished chairman of that subcommittee, has in \nit an amount of rescissions far greater than those proposed by the \nHouse and I think proportionately as high as any portion of this \nrescissions bill. So let me speak very, very briefly to those \nagricultural projects because I know the Senators, both from Iowa and \nMississippi, will do so themselves.\n  At least a significant number of the Cooperative State Research \nService proposals here are for money for facilities which are in the \nprocess of being constructed, and where the removal of the money might \nwell cause a cessation of those construction projects.\n  It is, I am certain, for exactly that reason the Senator from \nMississippi did not wish to go along with the House of Representatives. \nBecause there will be differences on each one of these issues, a \nconference committee may well determine that some of the studies for \nnew projects, which might be very expensive, should be dismissed--\nshould be eventually rescinded. But the Senator from Mississippi----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Did not wish to deal just with those items. He was faced \nwith a set of rescissions at varying levels of study and of actual \nconstruction. He and the Senator from Iowa can deal with other matters, \nbut the swine research facility is one that will be before a conference \ncommittee along with all the other cuts and reductions, where members \nof the Subcommittee on Agriculture can determine a priority order of \nrescissions, designed to meet the very real goal of this rescissions \nbill.\n  I think sometime during the course of this afternoon, not only \nMembers, but the general public may have lost track of the \nextraordinary nature of this bill. I do not believe there is a Senator \nalive who has dealt in the middle of a fiscal year with the rescission \nof so many billions of dollars as this one does, in order to make at \nleast a modest downpayment on balancing our Federal budget. It seems to \nme the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture deserves a great \ndeal of credit for being willing to rescind a wide range of \nappropriations which, just a few months ago, he felt were appropriate.\n  Let me also speak, of course, to the other side of the equation and \nthat is the $5 million restoration for the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nconcerns. Unlike the agricultural section of this bill, where the \nSenate rescissions are greater than the House rescissions in total for \nIndian purposes in general, the Senate rescissions are less and fewer \nthan the House rescissions. When I, as the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Interior, was faced with a table of what the House had done, it had, \nI must say, fewer rescissions than we ended up with for the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  But the No. 1 goal of those who were concerned with and sensitive to \nIndian affairs, Madam President, was not the particular line items for \nthe BIA, which, of course, is bitterly criticized by many of its \npurported beneficiaries, but was directed at the total rescission of \nall money for the National Museum of the American Indian--two \nfacilities which have been planned and promised, one storage facility \nin Suitland and a museum on The Mall here in Washington, DC.\n  Another part of this bill for the Smithsonian Institution restores \nalmost $20 million for this year's progress in the creation of that \nNational Museum for the American Indian. It seemed to me in making that \nrestoration we needed some balance from other Indian appropriations, \nand for that reason, many of those which are the object of this \namendment were included. But the total of all of the additional \nrescissions for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Madam President, is \nnowhere near the amount restored for the museum.\n  Granted, the beneficiaries are different. There is no question about \nthat. But we did not go dollar for dollar any more than the Senator \nfrom Mississippi did. He rescinded more dollars than he restored. In \nour case we rescinded fewer dollars than we restored, in the broad \nsense of the term--matters of great interest to the native American \ncommunities of this country. In fact, of the $5 million which the \nSenator from Arizona seeks to restore, $1.9 million, almost 40 percent, \nis for a program which the President in his budget for next year has \nrecommended zero dollars. So all we are doing here is anticipating the \nrecommendations of the President of the United States--these are Indian \ndirect loans--because there is another guarantee, there is a guaranteed \nloan program for Indians. And in each of the other cases, we are \ndealing--which is not the case with all of these agricultural \nrescissions--with unobligated funds in smaller amounts than had \noriginally been intended and in much smaller amounts than the otherwise \ntotal of rescissions for Indian matters.\n  So I suppose it is possible to say that in one or more of the four \nobjects of restoration here, we might have done a better job. But I \nknow I have been approached by many Senators from my part of the \ncountry, as has the Senator from Mississippi, protesting individual \nrescissions while in general terms, as is the case with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, feeling that, if anything, we have not cut out enough \nspending overall. But the spending that we have not cut off overall \nalmost always seems to be spending in an area which is not of much \ninterest to that particular Senator; and the areas which are of \ninterest are matters of great sacrifice.\n  So I hope we have been reasonably sensitive in this case, to native \nAmerican concerns. I know that we have been more generous to them than \nwas the House of Representatives. And I know that the Senator from \nMississippi was tougher on agriculture, overall, than was the House of \nRepresentatives. I do not think that we should, by this amendment, \nexacerbate or make worse differences which already exist.\n  So, Madam President, with regret I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN.  Madam President, I will be brief. First, I hope the \nSenator from Washington will note these funds do not go to the BIA; \nthey are not BIA programs. They go direct to the tribes. I think that \nis an important distinction, particularly after he mentions the well-\njustified criticism of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Second, if the Senator is correct, that much of this money has \nalready been spent and allocated, I do not quite understand the \nstatement in the House bill that says there is a backlog of $400 \nmillion, necessary to complete facilities already in the pipeline; so \nthat is of some interest. And fiscal year 1995 provides for 15 new \nfeasibility studies. According again to the House report, the \nAgricultural Research Service currently conducts swine research in at \nleast 13 different facilities at a cost of over $26 million, and this \nfacility would cost $10 million annually to operate.\n  The Senator from Washington alluded to something about programs in \nindividuals' areas or States. I would point out to him these Indian \nprograms are national programs. They have no particular affiliation \nwith my State.\n  I do not intend to drag out this amendment or the debate. I know that \nthe Senator from Iowa will, with his usual passion and articulate \npresentation, defend this program, and I will, before he even speaks, \nsay I respect and admire his continued commitment to his State and \nagriculture and how important it is to his State as well as that of \nswine research.\n  So I do not intend to extend this debate, and I appreciate the time \nof the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, careful consideration was given to the \nformation of the National Swine Research Center.\n  A national peer panel recommended the establishment of the Swine \nResearch Center because the needed research was not being conducted in \nany other State or Federal laboratory nationwide.\n  The program of research is not duplicative.\n  The mission of the research center is to develop technology to ensure \nthat the U.S. pork industry operates as an environmentally sound and \nefficient animal production system.\n   [[Page S4796]] It will help maintain and increase the \ncompetitiveness and efficiency of U.S. pork production and marketing.\n  This is the answer which the Agricultural Research Service of the \nUSDA gave in response to a question from the House Agriculture \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Concerns expressed by Members of the House of Representatives have \nnot been about the facility itself or the research that it will \nconduct.\n  Their concerns have been with the outyear funding of research.\n  The ARS and the pork producers are currently working on this and are \nmaking a good faith attempt to consolidate swine research programs in \nthe future to reduce program funding requirements.\n  Pork production is on the increase in many States.\n  The research at this center will help pork producers nationwide.\n  ARS has no swine research projects in the areas of waste management, \nmarketing, economics, housing, management, human health, or swine \nhealth, welfare, and behavior in production systems.\n  Permit me to try to answer the key questions about the National Swine \nResearch Center.\n         national swine research center facility justification\n\n  What national strategic issues are associated with pork production?\n  Conservative projections indicate that the United States, in an \nenvironment of trade liberalization and increased demand, will have an \nopportunity to triple its pork exports, currently 262,000 tons), in the \nnext 10 to 15 years. At that level, the impact would be the creation of \n36,000 U.S. jobs and $1.1 billion in income, U.S. input-output model. \nOther parts of the world, including areas in Europe and South America, \nare poised to take advantage of this opportunity.\n  What are the barriers to growth in U.S. pork production and pork \nexports?\n  Major barriers to growth in U.S. pork production are related to \nmanure management/nutrient utilization, odor control, water quality, \nemployee health, animal well-being, and housing and food safety \nquestions associated with increased pork production. Current USDA \nfacilities are not designed to research these questions; nor are they \nstaffed by scientists with the expertise to study them; nor is it \nfeasible to convert them for the type of research the industry urgently \nneeds.\n  What are the social concerns associated with increased pork \nproduction?\n  Our society places a high value on environmental quality, water \nquality, protection from odors associated with swine production, worker \nhealth, and animal well-being. At a 1994 international meeting of \nexperts on odor perception and odor production, scientists agreed that \nthe difficulty of obtaining objective measures of odors was a serious \nproblem for the swine industry.\n  We must develop systems that allow U.S. producers to be competitive \nwhile meeting our Nation's social and environmental expectations.\n  How can these problems be solved?\n  A national group, including representatives from major pork-producing \nStates and the public and private sectors, examined the opportunities \nand threats facing U.S. pork production. These group recommended the \nestablishment of the National Swine Research Center, concluding that a \nunique new swine research center was required to provide the conditions \nfor addressing complex, systems-based issues of critical importance to \nthe survival and growth of the Nation's pork production sector.\n  Why should a public institution conduct this research?\n  The center will focus on the type of research that is best suited to \npublic institutions. Private sector incentives to conduct such research \nare inadequate; advances are likely to be widely useful within the \nUnited States; and results will provide a national strategic advantage \nin pork production with positive impacts on rural development, the \nnational economy, and the Nation's balance of trade.\n\n\n                        research program summary\n\n  Research at the National Swine Research Center will focus on \nenvironmental quality, including water and air quality, utilization of \nmanure, and housing designs to improve conditions for rearing swine and \npreventing human health problems.\n  In addition to areas of research already described in this document, \nproposed projects include:\n  Development of manure-based soil amendments for urban use,\n  Separation/concentration/drying/fermentation technologies for manure,\n  Methods to store and handle manure,\n  Production of biomass energy crops with organic fertilizer, and\n  Production of methane from manure.\n  The center will be the source of creative new research on a wide \nrange of production, health, environmental, and socioeconomic issues \nthat must be resolved to support U.S. producers' bid to claim a \nsubstantial share of growth in the world market for pork.\n  Finally, this is a list of current major ARS swine research projects:\n\n                   USDA-ARS Program on Swine Research\n\n       In FY 1995, $26.1 million was appropriated for ARS to \n     conduct swine research at 13 ARS locations. The areas of \n     swine research currently pursued are: foreign animal \n     diseases; domestic animal diseases; reproduction; food \n     safety; nutrition; systems; parasites; stress; pork quality; \n     genetics; and growth. ARS has no swine projects in the areas \n     of waste management, marketing, economics, housing, \n     management, human health, or swine health, welfare, and \n     behavior in production systems.\n\n\n            Current Major Areas of Research on Swine in ARS\n\n       Genetics (Beltsville, MD, Clay Center, NE) Development of \n     genomic map; identify genes associated with disease \n     resistance; identify animals with superior reproductive \n     capacity.\n       Reproduction (Athens, GA, Beltsville, MD) Sorting of male \n     and female sperm cells, cryopreservation of gametes and \n     embryos; neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction; genetic \n     and physiological factors that influence litter size.\n       Nutrition and Growth (Athens, GA, Beltsville, MD, Clay \n     Center, NE, Columbia, MO, Fayetteville, AR) Neuroendocrine \n     and bioregulation of physiological and genetic factors that \n     influence fat and protein metabolism; endocrine control \n     studies to increase the lean and reduce the fat in pork.\n       Domestic Diseases (Ames, IA, Peoria, IL) Viral-induced \n     reproductive diseases; enteric diseases; bacterial and \n     microbiological factors that influence the level of disease \n     and production efficiency\n       Foreign Animal Disease (Greenport, NY) Foot-and-mouth \n     disease; African swine fever.\n       Parasites (Beltsville, MD) Identification of swine \n     resistant to parasites; epidemiology and vaccines; diagnostic \n     methods for trichinosis and toxoplasmosis.\n       Pork Quality and Stress (Beltsville, MD, Clay Center, NE, \n     Columbia, MO, New Orleans, LA, W. Lafayette, IN) Improve baby \n     pig survival by reducing stress and environmental factors; \n     breed and diet effect on quantity, quality, and composition \n     of pork; metabolic regulation of fat synthesis.\n       Food Safety (Albany, CA, College Station, TX, Clay Center, \n     NE, Wyndmoor, PA) Rapid test to identify drug and antibiotic \n     residues; microbiological safety of port carcasses and pork \n     products; control of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on \n     meat.\n\n  I do feel the managers of this bill want to get to a vote soon. I \nbelieve with the forceful response that the Senator from Washington \njust gave as to the wrongness of the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona, plus the defense of this decision of the subcommittee on this \nspecific swine research center, I do not need to add a great deal to \nhow unjustified the amendment is that is offered at this point.\n  I will simply make a couple points, one in regard to the Federal \nGovernment's involvement in agriculture research. It has been a policy \nof the Federal Government since 1862, with the establishment of the \nland grant universities, to have the Federal Government very deeply \ninvolved in agricultural research and education to enhance the \nproductivity of our farms and to enhance the quality of the product of \nour farms. That research is much more sophisticated today than it was \n132 years ago. That research must still continue to go on to keep our \nagricultural industry competitive.\n  It happens that there is a research facility proposed at Iowa State \nUniversity. There are swine research facilities located at other \nuniversities, or research centers. The one established at Iowa State \nUniversity is not duplicative. I have an official response from ARS on \nthat that I am going to read in closing.\n  It should not be surprising to anybody that the Iowa State University \nwould be very deeply involved in agriculture research in the first \nplace and even specializing to a considerable extent in swine research \nbecause my State is first in the production of corn, \n[[Page S4797]] my State is either first or second to Illinois in the \nproduction of soybeans, and we are No. 1, way beyond any other State, \nin the production of pork. One out of every four pigs in America reside \nin my State. We are a massive pork producing State. And Iowa State \nUniversity is right in the middle of it. So nobody should be surprised \nwhatsoever if there is a determination made by a national organization, \nthe Congress, following up on proposals by outstanding research groups \nin America that we need to do specific research in a specific aspect of \nthe swine industry that might be located at Iowa State University.\n  That is the history of agricultural research. I wish to speak to a \nspecific point, and I am just going to read a short statement on this \npoint, about the suggestion by the Senator from Arizona that there is \nso much swine research already, why do you need another swine research \nfacility?\n  Well, the simple answer to that is the different specializations of \nthe different facilities around the United States. I could give a long \nlist, but I will not bother to do so, of what research has been done. \nBut a Congressman from my State, Mr. Latham, had an opportunity to ask \nthe Agricultural Research Service this question:\n\n       The National Swine Research Center--\n\n  And that is the one that the Senator from Arizona proposes to delete. \nI wish to start over again. Mr. Latham asked the question:\n\n       The National Swine Research Center has been criticized on \n     the basis that it will conduct duplicative research. What is \n     your opinion on the research mission of the center and do you \n     think it is duplicative?\n\n  This is the response from the Agricultural Research Service of the \nUSDA to the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee:\n\n       A national peer panel recommended--\n\n  I wish to stop just a minute. The reason I wish to emphasize, ``A \nnational peer panel recommended,'' this is not some Congressman or \nSenator getting something for their particular State. This was a \nstudied approach.\n\n       A national peer panel recommended the establishment of the \n     National Swine Research Center because the needed research \n     was not being conducted at any other State or Federal \n     laboratory nationwide. The program of research will not be \n     duplicative. The mission of the National Swine Research \n     Center is to develop technology to ensure that the U.S. pork \n     industry operates as an environmentally sound and efficient \n     animal production system. It will help maintain and increase \n     the competitiveness and efficiency of the U.S. pork \n     production and market.\n\n  I hope those are adequate responses to the supposed justification of \nthe Senator from Arizona for this deletion so that my colleagues will \nnot rescind this project and that we will move forward.\n  If we make a decision to move forward, I wish to emphasize what the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi said. We are only going back to \nconference with the House and take a second look at this. My judgment \nis a second look based upon the recommendation of a national peer panel \nwill show that this is not duplicative and it is needed, particularly \nin the area of cleaning up the environment and having an \nenvironmentally sound pork producing system; that this will move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to support the \nposition of the appropriators here and oppose the amendment. I do it on \nthe basis the Senator from Washington pointed out, and that is some of \nthese projects have been under way or are in the midst of getting under \nway. The one I have particular interest in is the environmental \nsimulator that is designed to study the aspects of hazardous materials \nmoving through soil. And it does it in a very abbreviated way. It is \nsomething that pertains to what we are seeking in this country. And so, \nMr. President, I rise briefly to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself strongly with \nthe comments made by my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, \nregarding this pending amendment. I think he hit the nail right on the \nhead when he read the letter from the Agricultural Research Service \nregarding the importance of this swine research center and the fact it \nis not duplicative of other research and facilities. The kind of \nresearch that is going to be done there is not being done anywhere else \nin the country.\n  There has been a lot of comment made on that this kind of research is \ndone elsewhere. Quite frankly, it is not.\n  Mr. President, I understand the desire of the Senator from Arizona to \nput more money into two accounts funding American Indian programs. I am \nnot fully familiar with them. I am sure he has some legitimate \narguments why that funding is necessary.\n  I would suggest, however, that the Senator from Arizona has gone \nafter wrong accounts to get the money. Because he has gone after some \nresearch projects that are important to us nationally; research \nprojects that are important not only for the producers in this country \nbut for our consumers also.\n  We have a long, proud history of Federal support for research in this \ncountry, especially agricultural research, going clear back to Abraham \nLincoln's time.\n  That support for agricultural research is a key factor providing us \nan abundance of the most wholesome, most varied food at the lowest \nprice of any nation. About 8 cents of every dollar of disposable income \nan American family has goes to buy the food they consume at home. You \ncannot match that figure anywhere in the world. We have not only the \nmost variety and the largest quantity of foods, but they are the \nhealthiest and the cheapest.\n  These benefits have been brought about, in substantial part, by the \nagricultural research that has been done in this country. A lot of this \nresearch is not the easiest to understand. There is a lot of \nsophisticated work being done to improve agricultural productivity, to \nexpand markets and uses for agricultural commodities, to improve the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. agriculture in world markets, and also to \nreduce the impact of agriculture on the environment while at the same \ntime maintaining productivity.\n  This is no time to be cutting this vital agricultural research. \nSpeaking only for myself, I believe we are not putting enough into \nagricultural research as it is. For example, USDA formula funds for \nland grant universities have been essentially flat in dollar amounts \nsince 1983, meaning universities have lost 20 to 25 percent of their \nresearch purchasing power since 1983.\n  Agricultural research is a good investment. Studies have shown that \nthe return on investment in agriculture research has been in the area \nof about 20 to 25 percent.\n  And let us keep in mind that a relatively small share of Federal \nresearch and development funding actually goes to agricultural research \nand development. According to the National Science Foundation, for \n1994, only 2 percent of the total Federal research and development \ndollars went to agriculture. Of the total Federal dollars for basic \nresearch, only 4 percent went to agriculture.\n  So again, while these proposed cuts may seem small in the magnitude \nof the billions of dollars we are talking about, they are large when \nyou compare them to the relatively small amount of actual research \ndollars that go to agriculture.\n  As I said, this research is sophisticated work; it is highly \nspecialized. And that can sometimes make it easy to attack or to poke \nfun at.\n  Well, there was even a television show one night that referred to \nfunding for the Swine Research Center, very jokingly saying, ``Well, \nthis is the ultimate pork, isn't it, Federal dollars going to pork \nresearch?''\n  Well, I suppose it got a lot of laughs and people who did not know \nwhat it was about can laugh about it.\n  But the fact is, the pork industry in America is no laughing matter. \nThere are over 200,000 pork producers in this country. The pork \nindustry generates over $66 billion in economic activity and supports \nabout 764,000 jobs directly and indirectly and adds nearly $26 billion \nof value to production inputs. Annual farm sales of hogs are usually \nmore than $11 billion, and retail sales of pork are more than $30 \nbillion each year.\n   [[Page S4798]] In fact, farm receipts from sales of hogs place the \nindustry in fourth or fifth place among all agricultural commodities \nthat we produce in this country. So it is a very important industry. It \nis very important for our producers. It is important for our consumers. \nIt is important for our Nation.\n  Some of the important issues that will be researched at the Swine \nResearch Center include how pork production can be made more efficient \nand how we can solve some of the environmental problems of pork \nproduction.\n  The research will include studies by soil, plant, and animal \nscientists into enhancing both the competitiveness and the \nenvironmental soundness of the pork industry.\n  There is currently, as my colleague from Iowa pointed out, no other \nState or Federal facility capable of addressing the unique research \nplanned for this center.\n  The Agricultural Research Service has identified this project as a \nhigh priority. It is the result of joint planning and continuing \nefforts by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, the National Pork \nProducers Council, Iowa State University, and the Iowa Pork Producers \nAssociation.\n  As Senator Grassley pointed out, there was peer review, a national \npeer review, not just regional or State.\n  So for these reasons, it is important that we continue our commitment \nto agricultural research in general and to the Cooperative State \nResearch Service and to the Agricultural Research Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point \nin the Record a fact sheet from the National Pork Producers Council, \nentitled ``A Profile of Today's Pork Industry.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   A Profile of Today's Pork Industry\n\n       The U.S. pork industry is experiencing unprecedented \n     growth. More pork was produced in the U.S. in 1992 than ever \n     before, and 1993 was nearly as large. Over 17 billion pounds \n     will again be processed from just under 93 million hogs in \n     1994.\n       The economic impact of the industry on rural America is \n     immense. Farm receipts from hogs place the industry in 4th or \n     5th position [depending on the year] among all farm \n     commodities. Annual farm sales usually exceed $11 billion, \n     while the retail value of pork sold to consumers exceeds $30 \n     billion.\n       And the pork industry benefits more than just farmers! Pork \n     production means jobs and economic opportunity for thousands \n     of rural communities. The ``value added'' nature of pork \n     provides employment well beyond the farm. Based on a 1993 \n     study by researchers at Iowa State University, the U.S. pork \n     industry is responsible for over $66 billion dollars in total \n     domestic economic activity. Through direct, indirect and \n     induced effects, the pork industry supports 764,080 jobs and \n     adds nearly $26 billion dollars of value to production \n     inputs. Given these figures, the pork industry's major \n     contribution to local, state and national economies and \n     governments (through tax revenues) is obvious.\n       Approximately 200,000 pork producers are in business today \n     compared to nearly three million in 1950. Farms have grown in \n     size--nearly 80 percent of the hogs are grown on farms \n     producing 1000 or more hogs per year. These operations, which \n     are often more technically sophisticated, are still \n     predominantly individual family farms.\n       The geographic location of pork production is shifting as \n     well. While the traditional Corn Belt represents the \n     overwhelming share of production, growth is also occurring in \n     ``nontraditional'' hog states such as Texas, Colorado, and \n     Oklahoma. North Carolina, which ranked 14th in pork \n     production 30 years ago, now ranks 2nd among states.\n       The global market offers tremendous growth potential for \n     U.S. pork producers. With many of the world's most cost-\n     efficient producers, the U.S. pork industry still only sells \n     about 2 percent of total production overseas. Yet pork is the \n     world's ``meat of choice'' by far, with over 40 percent share \n     of the world's meat protein market.\n       The National Pork Producers Council is the only national \n     membership organization representing pork producers \n     exclusively. The ``Pork. The Other White Meat'' promotion is \n     well known. Funded by the national pork checkoff and paid for \n     by producers, it is credited with having a major impact in \n     improving pork's consumer image and helping improve pork \n     demand. The checkoff also funds important research projects \n     to improve pork's nutritional profile, overall quality and \n     price.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, while I understand the desire of \nthe Senator from Arizona to put more money into programs he feels very \nstrongly about, this is not the time to turn our backs on the important \nagricultural research being done all over this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in announcing his plans to not seek \nreelection, our distinguished colleague from Alabama, Senator Heflin, \nsaid today that he hopes he ``will be looked upon as a public servant \nwho has served with dignity, integrity, and diligence.'' In my view, \nthose qualities speak volumes about Senator Howell Heflin.\n  From his highly decorated service in the U.S. Marine Corps in World \nWar II, to his 6 years as chief justice of Alabama's Supreme Court, to \nhis three terms in the U.S. Senate during which he held the thankless \npost of Ethics Committee chairman, this man affectionately known as the \ncountry judge from Tuscumbia, AL, has made a difference for America and \nthe people of his State.\n  While we have not agreed on every issue, I have been proud to stand \nwith my friend from Alabama time after time, whether it's been on the \nDesert Storm resolution, the flag protection amendment, the balanced \nbudget amendment, regulatory reform, or one of countless other issues.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Heflin looks ahead to returning home to \nAlabama and more time with his wife, children, and grandchildren, I \nknow all my colleagues join in wishing him all the best for the future. \nAnd I know that during that final 2 years of his term, he will continue \nto serve with the dignity, integrity, and diligence that have \ncharacterized his life in public service.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me first announce there will be no more votes this \nevening. It is my understanding that the manager of the appropriations \nbill now pending indicates we will complete action on the bill maybe \nlate tomorrow evening. That is the hope of the chairman, Senator \nHatfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4798-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, Senator Hatfield is here, and if Members on \neither side have amendments that could be disposed of this evening \nfollowing the discussion of the Glickman nomination, which I do not \nthink will take very long, he would be prepared to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Dan Glickman to be Secretary of Agriculture. Dan and I have worked \ntogether on four farm bills.\n  No matter how active or informed the members of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry are, we cannot put together a good \nfarm bill without an active administration. I know personally from \nspeaking to the President that Dan Glickman has his confidence. Mr. \nGlickman has the President's mandate to develop a farm bill that makes \nsense for both rural Americans and the taxpayers of this country as a \nwhole.\n  I know that Dan Glickman will be an ideal person to represent this \nadministration as we try to develop farm policies that make sense for \nfarmers, for consumers, for the environment, and for this country.\n  Dan Glickman was born in Wichita on November 24, 1944. He was first \nelected to Congress in 1976--just 2 years after I began my service in \nthe Senate.\n  As a veteran of the House Agriculture Committee, he has mastered the \narcane details of U.S. farm programs.\n  Again and again in his career he has fought to focus farm subsidies \non low-and middle-income farmers and tried to increase Federal \noversight of the commodity futures markets.\n  These are battles in which I am proud I was allied with him.\n  One of the things that I like best about Dan Glickman is his self-\ndeprecating sense of humor. This was highlighted in a recent story in \nthe New York Times. Mr. Glickman was joking about the Capitol's \nnotorious reputation for abandoning those out of power. Mr. Glickman \nsaid, ``The only one working in the family now is our son and he won't \ntake our calls.''\n  On the night of his election loss Congressman Glickman commented: ``I \nliken it to a bear market; sometimes the good stocks got hit every bit \nas much as the bad stocks. In this case, I think I was a good stock.''\n  Fortunately, for all of us, the stock market has shifted direction \nagain. How high Dan Glickman's stock has risen again will be clear \ntonight when he is overwhelmingly approved by the Senate.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as the longest sitting member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I welcome the administrations choice to appoint \nDan Glickman as Secretary of Agriculture. I have worked with Dan \nGlickman as a Congressman from the State of Kansas for a number of \nyears. I can attest to his commitment to agricultural issues and I know \nthe qualifications that he brings to the job.\n  Throughout his 18 years in Congress, he earned a reputation as a \nCongressman who understands the issues, who listens, and who works with \nhis colleagues to find common ground.\n  Congressman Pat Roberts, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, and I introduced \nDan to the Senate Agriculture Committee. I think that it is very \nsignificant that we three Republicans support this nomination. We may \nall share a Kansas background, but more importantly we know from \nworking with Dan that he is more interested in solving problems than \nscoring partisan points.\n  His experience speaks for itself. He has helped write the last four \nfarm bills--the last one as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Wheat, \nSoybeans and Feed Grains. We all know that the 1995 farm bill will be \ndifficult to write. The Agriculture Committee's recent hearings have \nhinted at the tough choices that lie ahead. We will need an \nexperienced, committed advocate at the Department of Agriculture. Dan \nGlickman recognizes the weaknesses and strengths in our current \npolicies, and the fiscal constraints that will play an important role \nin shaping our future policies. Above all, he realizes that the \nfoundation of our Nation is American Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, the people of Kansas are proud of Dan Glickman. I am \npleased to recommend him to be Secretary of Agriculture. I, too, hope \nthere will be an overwhelming vote.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Dan Glickman to become the next Secretary of Agriculture. \nDan and I are long-time friends, and share a mutual appreciation and \nadmiration for an agriculture system that provides the wholesome, \nabundant, and inexpensive food supply that all Americans now enjoy.\n  For the past 18 years, Dan has ably and effectively served \nagriculture as a Member of the House of Representatives, representing \nKansas' Fourth District. During his tenure, Dan provided outstanding \nleadership as a member of the House Committee on Agriculture. Many of \nus recognize the important role Dan has played in the effort to help \nU.S. agriculture compete in an increasingly global marketplace by \nexpanding and strengthening our country's export programs. Dan also has \nbeen instrumental in congressional efforts to improve U.S. grain \nquality standards, making our commodity exports more attractive to \npotential foreign buyers.\n  I know Dan to be a competent, thoughtful, and articulate spokesman \nfor agriculture. He has forged strong relationships with producers, \nagribusinesses, and legislators. These relationships will prove \ninvaluable as he begins his work as Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, rural communities depend on a vibrant and prosperous \nagriculture industry to support schools, churches, hospitals, community \norganizations, and main street businesses. I firmly believe that a key \nto our economic prosperity is the continued emphasis on American \nexports. During this year's farm bill debate, we must commit ourselves \nto crafting agriculture policy that allows our producers to compete in \nthe 21st century, global marketplace, strengthening our rural \ncommunities in the process. It is also imperative that we continue to \nlook for ways to improve effective programs, while eliminating costly, \nobsolete programs. Dan Glickman will play a vital role in achieving \nthis ambitious, yet attainable goal.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of Dan Glickman as the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The post of Secretary of Agriculture is important to this Senator and \nvital to American agriculture. His confirmation will bring an \noutstanding advocate for farmers to the Clinton administration.\n  Agriculture in this Nation is very diverse. While on the surface \nKansas and Montana agriculture are similar--we produce wheat and beef--\nthere are some significant differences as well. And there are myriad \nvariations in the agricultural industry which is found across this \nNation.\n  As we focus our attention on the 1995 farm bill, he will bring an \nexpertise to this debate which will be critical and beneficial to all--\nbut especially to our farmers. His experience, knowledge, and skill \nwill help us guide farm policy into the 21st century. I look forward to \nworking with him on that important task.\n  With the confirmation of Dan Glickman, I am confident that help is on \nthe way in dealing with several crises facing Montana. While I am \nconcerned about the closure of the region I Forest \n[[Page S4800]] Service office in Missoula, MT, I hope that Secretary \nGlickman will review the Forest Service reorganization plan and that he \nwill stop any actions which make no sense--like the proposed Missoula \nclosure.\n  Although I remain concerned about the need for expanded agricultural \nresearch and stability within the Agricultural Research Service, I know \nthat before stations are closed, Secretary Glickman will help identify \ncritical research and make certain such research is not unnecessarily \neliminated just to show that locations are being cut.\n  Finally, today I am heartened that we will soon see a heightened \nsense of cooperation between the Department of Agriculture and the \nDepartment of the Interior. Whether it is animal damage control on our \nForest Service and Bureau of Land Management properties or prevention \nof the spread of brucellosis between bison and cattle, I know we can \nexpect greater teamwork.\n  I am confident that Mr. Glickman is well prepared for the challenges \nahead of him. I congratulate him and I look forward to rolling up our \nsleeves and getting to work.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4799-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

He later became the chief \nreporter in 1988. Mr. Reynolds' service has been honorable as well as \nmemorable--his reporting has often landed him in the center of the \nday's headlines.\n  In his two decades of service, Mr. Reynolds reported Federal agency \nhearings and various committee testimonies in both the House and the \nSenate, including such notable events as the Joseph McCarthy and Jimmy \nHoffa hearings. He covered the White House during the Kennedy, Johnson, \nand Nixon administrations.\n  And Mr. Reynolds is truly a part of our country's great history. \nDuring his assignment in the Kennedy administration, he reported \nPresident Kennedy's famous Berlin speech and was in the Presidential \nmotorcade on that tragic day in Dallas, when President Kennedy was \nassassinated.\n  Mr. Reynolds has served the Senate and the Nation with distinction \nand loyalty for over 20 years.

Mr. President, let me join with the others who have \nrisen in support of this important nomination. I want to thank the \nmajority leader for bringing this matter to the floor at this time. \nThis is a very important and timely issue for a lot of reasons.\n  Obviously, there are many extraordinary decisions that the Senate and \nCongress must make over the course of the next several months, and we \nneed the leadership that Congressman Glickman can provide in this \nregard.\n  There are many who would like to begin working with him very \nearnestly, at the earliest possible date, to begin the process of \ndeveloping another 5-year farm bill. We need to get on with that. We \nneed to recognize how important it is that this farm bill be passed \nexpeditiously.\n  Certainly, the sooner we can get this nomination confirmed, the \nbetter. I am excited about this nomination for a lot of reasons. I \nbelieve that Dan Glickman is perhaps one of the most qualified people \nto be nominated for this position, at least in recent memory.\n  He understands the importance of agriculture, of rural America, of \nall of the challenges that we face as we consider the transition that \nrural America is now experiencing.\n  He is extraordinary at creative bipartisan consensus on policy \nissues, as well as on the strategy regarding a number of the \nlegislative matters that will come before the Senate. I believe that \nhis bipartisan consensus building skills will serve everyone well.\n  Dan Glickman has served in the Congress for a long time. As a member \nof the House Agriculture Committee, he has been the leader on countless \nlegislative issues relating to farm bills and agriculture. He deserves \nour support. We all recognize the leadership he has provided. He \ndeserves the kind of consideration that he is being given this evening.\n  Mr. President, I think it is also important to note that Dan Glickman \nis one of the most accessible people I know. He is willing to go the \nextra mile, to talk with people, to be available as questions arise, \nboth on and off the hill. He is willing to travel. He is willing to go \nout into the far reaches of this country to address in the most \nmeaningful and considered way the broad range of issues that the \nSecretary of Agriculture must consider.\n  He is an outstanding legislator who is ready to lead on a whole range \nof issues that I know will be on his desk in the not-too-distant \nfuture. He has been an advocate of increasing trade with other \ncountries. While he had specific reservations about the most recent \ntrade agreement, Dan Glickman understands how important trade is, how \nimportant it is that we reach out to other countries and create new \nmarkets.\n  He recognizes, as well, the value of the new market development that \nwe need to improve farm prices. He recognizes that value-added markets \nare really the key to long-term agricultural development. We cannot \nlook to the farm bill to create artificial price mechanisms. We have to \ngo out and build the markets both internationally and domestically.\n   [[Page S4801]] I have had many conversations over the course of the \nlast several months with Dan on this point. I am pleased at his \nenthusiastic response to the desire that many share with regard to \nbuilding value-added markets in the future.\n  Dan Glickman also understands the importance of the next generation \nof agriculture. He knows that the farm community is getting older, that \nthe farm community is getting to the point where, indeed, we must look \nto the next generation for the long-term future and viability of \nagriculture. He knows we have to help young farmers. He knows that the \nonly way to do that is to provide a better price.\n  Dan Glickman also understands the importance of conservation. \nConservation has been an issue that he has worked on for many years. He \nrealizes the importance of the CRP program and the efforts that we made \nto address soil erosion. He understands the importance of research in \nproviding for the efforts to conserve our soil and to do more in the \nrealm of providing for long-term environmentally sound responses to the \nagricultural practices of the past.\n  So, Dan Glickman is a very futuristic individual. He understands that \nwe made an investment that ought to be protected, but he understands, \nas well, the need to refocus that investment as warranted.\n  Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that I come to the floor \nthis evening to support his nomination, to again reiterate my view that \nthere are few people that have come to the Senate in support or in \nrecognition of the need for agricultural policy that have been as \nqualified as this person is.\n  Dan Glickman deserves strong bipartisan support. Given the remarks \nmade by the majority leader and others in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I am confident that there will be overwhelming support \ndemonstrated in our vote for him tomorrow.\n  Once he becomes Secretary, I look forward to working with him. I know \nfor the next couple of years his plate will be full and his agenda will \nbe long, but, I think there also will be a good deal of willingness on \nboth sides of the aisle to work with him to ensure that he is \nsuccessful.\n  Our country depends upon the talents of a Dan Glickman. Our future in \nagriculture depends upon his leadership. It is critical that we \ncooperate with Dan as he continues to provide that leadership.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can demonstrate with enthusiasm \ntomorrow how strongly we feel about this nomination, how hopeful we are \nabout his success and how determined we can be about our willingness to \ncooperate as he begins his task. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the strong support \nthat has been evident for a long time with the President's new nominee \nfor the Secretary of Agriculture, former Congressman Dan Glickman, from \nmy neighboring State of Kansas.\n  Mr. President, much has been said about this dedicated, talented \nindividual. I have heard statements made by Senator Leahy, the ranking \nDemocrat on this side of the Agriculture Committee; by the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, who has, as he has indicated in his remarks on \nthe floor a few moments ago, the record as the longest sitting member \nof the Agriculture Committee; and just a few moments ago by the \nminority leader, from my neighboring State to the north, South Dakota, \nthe minority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  They all summed up very, very well, the regard that the nominee had \nby those who know him the best. I have known him for a long, long time. \nI have worked with him on foreign policy ever since I have been in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  He is one who thoroughly understands the farm programs, but more \nimportantly, what an important part agriculture is to the overall \neconomy of the United States of America.\n  I remind all once again that, if it were not for the offsetting \nfactor of exports of farm products, the balance of trade deficit that \nthe United States has would skyrocket dramatically. Dan Glickman \nunderstands agriculture. He knows the serious situation that \nagriculture is facing today. I am delighted that the majority leader \nhas called for the vote on tomorrow morning.\n  I am anxious to begin working with the new Secretary of Agriculture \nbecause, as the lead Democrat on the Budget Committee, the new \nagricultural leader knows, the Agricultural Committee knows, the \nAppropriations Committee knows, that the actions that will take place \nin the Budget Committee in the near future are going to have a great \ndeal to do with how successful the new Secretary of Agriculture will be \nin writing a workable farm program and policy.\n  I have not been in a position, nor has he, during this waiting period \nwhich held up his assuming this new role in even a more timely \nfashion--it was not possible for me to sit down with him and talk \nspecifics about what his recommendations will be with regard to the \nrecommendations out of the Budget Committee for the total agricultural \nprograms.\n  Dan Glickman will do a great job. I will listen to his \nrecommendations very carefully with regard to the farm program. Given \nthe fact we are going to have to make some very, very hard choices on a \nwhole series of issues if we are going to get ourselves on the road to \na balanced budget by the year 2002--which I think obviously is the \noverwhelming goal of Members of the Congress on both sides of the aisle \nand in both Houses--it is, therefore, critically important we get Dan \nGlickman on board as soon as we make the confirmation tomorrow and as \nsoon as the President goes through the formality, which I hope will \nfollow almost instantaneously. Then Dan Glickman can take over fully \nthe important function of Secretary of Agriculture of the United States \nof America and, for that matter, the Secretary of Agriculture for the \nwhole free world.\n  I urge as near a unanimous vote as possible. I would not be surprised \nif the vote of the Senate was unanimous tomorrow morning. I am looking \nforward to working with my great friend, Dan Glickman, who will be the \nnew Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RENEWAL OF PERMITS FOR GRAZING ON NATIONAL FOREST \n                   LANDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, at the request of an \n     applicant for renewal of a permit that expires on or after \n     the date of enactment of this Act for grazing on land located \n     in a unit of the National Forest System, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall reinstate, if necessary, and extend the \n     term of the permit until the date on which the Secretary of \n     Agriculture completes action on the application, including \n     action required under the National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment to \nallow the renewal of grazing permits on Forest Service lands until the \ncompletion of the required analyses under the National Environmental \nProtection Act [NEPA].\n  The management of Federal lands is the hub of multiple-use \nstrategies. Sound stewardship and range management practices represent \nthe foundation needed to protect Federal lands and ensure that they are \nmaintained for future generations. Multiple-use practices by the \nranchers themselves greatly enhance the condition of Federal lands. \nKeep in mind that many generations of ranch families have made a \nliving, raised their families, and maintained these lands for future \ngenerations. The sustainability of their livelihoods is linked to the \nsubstainability of the land. They are the true environmentalists.\n  Despite their previous good stewardship, ranch families now risk \nbeing punished for the Forest Service's inability to complete the \nstudies required by NEPA in time for the beginning of the 1996 grazing \nseason. Over 120 Black Hills' grazing permits must be reissued by the \nForest Service before the 1996 grazing season, which begins in March \n1996. In accordance with NEPA, before the permits can be reissued the \nForest Service must analyze each allotment for effects on endangered \nspecies, and environmental, cultural, historical, and water resources.\n  In this time of downsizing, already 4,000 jobs at the Forest Service \nhave been eliminated. Yet despite this reduction in human resources, \nthe Forest Service must now take on sweeping studies of every single \nranking allotment--not just in South Dakota--but throughout the Western \nStates.\n  I met with Chief Jack Ward Thomas of the Forest Service last week. He \nsaid that in order to complete these analyses as close on time as \npossible, he will have to concentrate both his financial and human \nresources on completing the NEPA studies. Chief Thomas said it himself: \n``This means that every other function of the Forest Service in the \nWest will suffer as a result.''\n  The timber industry will suffer, as well as the ongoing Black Hills \nforest management plan activity. In addition, because Forest Service \npersonnel and resources will be spread so thinly, the risk of appeals--\nof both timber sales and grazing permits--is even greater.\n  I recognize that due to recent court action, the Forest Service is \nbetween a rock and a hard place. My amendment will solve the Forest \nService's dilemma. It allows the permits to be renewed until the \ncompletion of the NEPA analyses.\n  I would like to note that my amendment is very similar to an \namendment offered yesterday by my colleague from South Dakota. However, \nmy colleague's amendment was included as a part of the Regulatory \nTransition Act which could be delayed in conference for some time. The \nvery fact that I am introducing a similar amendment again today attests \nto the gravity of the situation, and my commitment to passing a \nresolution to this problem into law.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, we do not have much time. It is \nimperative that we resolve this issue quickly, for the sake of the \nranchers and loggers in South Dakota--and across the West.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I will now yield to my colleague who has taken a great deal of \nleadership on this issue, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. He \nhas joined with many of us to deal with this issue. It is one of these \nissues that has a timeliness problem.\n  What we really have, as the Senator has pointed out, is during the \npast several months there has been some kind of court ruling that \nrequires an individual NEPA investigation for every grazing permit. \nThere are about 4,500 grazing permits from the Forest Service. About \n700 of them will expire this year, the end of 1995. And, under the new \nregulation, driven by the court procedure, these NEPA requirements \nwould have to be completed before these grazing permits can be \nextended.\n  The Forest Service has said there is no way they can do that within \nthat length of time. The result would be that ranches that depend upon \ngrazing permits for their summer grass for cattle and sheep would \nsimply be out of business.\n  This does not change the requirement, it simply provides for some \ntime. It says basically that permits cannot be refused because of the \nlack of the NEPA regulation. In other words, it says until the NEPA \nregulation is finished the permits can be renewed. That is really what \nit is all about.\n  By the way, there is plenty of protection. It is not a matter of \nprotection. There are now NEPA requirements on the forest plain, at the \nforest level. It is already there. In fact you can make an argument it \nis not needed. We are not making that argument. We are simply making \nthe argument that the process of NEPA can continue but that there is \nnot enough time to do it without injuring people who have a business of \ngrazing on public lands.\n  This would simply extend the time for that to happen. It is timely \nand needs to be done so people can plan for next year, can plan to turn \ntheir cattle out, can have loans and continue their business as they \nalways have.\n  Mr. President, I urge the amendment. Let us put it in the bill so we \ncan take away this threat to the economy of the West.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my friend and \ncolleague from South Dakota, and my colleague and friend from Wyoming. \nI just made some pronouncements about the new Secretary of Agriculture \nabout adjoining States. Here we are, adjoining States again. I am here \nwith my senior colleague from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, and my \nnew colleague from the western neighbor of the State of Nebraska.\n  I congratulate both of them for the amendment that has been offered. \nThe matter has been cleared on this side and we are prepared to go \nahead and agree to the amendment, if that is the will of the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my friend from Nebraska. I regret he is leaving \nthis Chamber. I have previously said a few kind words about him, both \nhere and in the press. But I thank him very much for his great service \nhere in this body.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 425) to amendment No. 420 was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4801-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nDan Glickman. I have known him since 1974, when we came to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives together. I have known him and his wife. We \nhave traveled to different events together over the years. We have \nvoted together in the House of Representatives. We have served together \non a number of caucuses. I had observed his work over the years.\n  I certainly shall be voting with a great deal of pride for Dan \nGlickman for Secretary of Agriculture.\n  I am especially interested in the international aspects of \nagriculture. I believe in the next few years what we do in \ninternational agricultural trade will be just as important to farm \nprices as some of our domestic programs.\n  The business of the Secretary of Agriculture is the business of food \nfor \n[[Page S4803]] peace. It is the business of international trade. It is \nthe business of selling our products abroad, but also using food in \nforeign policy situations. The Secretary of Agriculture can be a \ndriving force for what happens in farm prices and for the entire \nagricultural industry in our country in the next few years.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture also is a very important force \ndomestically because it is his Department that sets the standards for \nfood--what people are supposed to eat. The Food Stamp Program also is \nadministered by the Department of Agriculture to provide food \nassistance for the poor. These are just some of a whole array of \ndomestic issues handled by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The Department of Agriculture is a vast, huge agency. I first became \nacquainted with it when I was a young 4H member growing up on a farm \nnear Humboldt, SD. There is a great deal of controversy about what the \nDepartment should do about reorganizing, and making it more efficient. \nI hope Dan Glickman will heed the call of the American people for less \nGovernment and more action, so to speak, in terms of the bureaucracy. \nIt seems every time we cut spending around here we are told it is going \nto cut children's programs or food stamps or it is going to close a \nlocal office in one of our States. We never hear anything about \nshutting down any of the bureaucracy here in Washington, DC.\n  We need to have a more efficient Department of Agriculture. I am \nhoping Dan Glickman will do just that. I am prepared to help him and I \nwish him well.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to yield back all the time \non both sides regarding the nomination of Mr. Glickman. And I am \nplaying the role of both leader and Democratic leader at the same time, \nI am told.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4802-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The Senate resumed legislative session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4803-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

My Administration's decision to make sound \ninvestments in science and technology even as the Federal Government \ncuts other spending is premised on three basic assumptions:\n --Technology is the engine of economic growth.\n --Scientific knowledge is the key to the future.\n --Responsible government advances science and technology.\n  The Congress and the American people can find evidence of the \nAdministration's dedication to responsible government support for \nscience and technology in our defense and economic policies as well as \nour management of the science and technology enterprise. We have \ndecreased the Federal deficit, helped to create millions of new jobs, \nand improved the tax treatment of small businesses and of investments \nin research and development. Hemispheric and global trade agreements as \nwell as relaxation of outdated export controls have opened huge export \nmarkets to America's high-tech industries. My National Security \nStrategy of Engagement and Enlargement (February 1995) depends on \nfarsighted and efficient science and technology investments. Our \nforeign policy and security interests are also supported by mutually \nbeneficial international cooperation in science and technology.\n  We have consistently endorsed technology policies to increase \nprosperity and enhance environmental quality. In Technology for \nAmerica's Economic Growth (February 1993) and Technology for a \nSustainable Future (July 1994) this Administration conveyed to the \nAmerican people our plans for public/private partnerships to improve \nthe business environment, enhance access to quality education and \ntraining, support development of information infrastructure, ensure \ncontinued excellence in health care, and strengthen America's global \ncompetitiveness.\n  Streamlined government based on strong partnerships--within the \ngovernment, with the private sector, and among nations--is a hallmark \nof the Clinton/Gore Administration. The ``virtual department'' I \ncreated by establishing the National Science and Technology Council \n(NSTC) has cut bureaucratic red tape and produced a historic first: an \nintegrated research and development budget that focuses on national \ngoals. The NSTC has also produced large savings by enabling agencies to \ncoordinate their efforts, divide tasks, and share resources.\n  My Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) provides \ncritical links to industry and academia. Their oversight of NSTC \nactivities, such as development of strategies for the management and \ndisposition of fissile materials, promises to improve the Federal \neffort. So, too, do the forums and workshops that have drawn in \nthousands of experts and stakeholders to help develop priorities in \nareas as diverse as fundamental science; environmental technology; and \nhealth; safety; and food research.\n  I am also very proud of the steps we have taken to improve \ninternational cooperation in science and technology. Through the Gore-\nChernomyrdin Commission we have used science and technology cooperation \nto ease the Russians' transition to democracy and a market economy. We \nhave received valuable new technology and cultivated a crucial partner \nin global affairs through Russian participation in the international \nspace station. We have used the Megasciences Forum of the Organization \nfor Economic Cooperation and Development and other international forums \nto explore ways to share the increasing costs of cutting-edge research \nwhile maintaining our position of world leadership. Bilateral science \nand technology cooperation with other nations, including advanced \nindustrial economies such as \n[[Page S4804]] Japan, and big, emerging markets such as the People's \nRepublic of China, serve us well in the global economy--giving us \naccess to new ideas and new technologies while creating new \nopportunities for business.\n  Economists have estimated that the social rate of return on \ninvestments in research and development averages about 50 percent, or \nabout double the average private rate of return. Clearly a solid \nFederal investment program is justified even in the leanest times. It \nis especially important for the Federal Government to maintain its \ninvestments in science and technology when the pressures of \ninternational competition are leading businesses to focus on shorter \nterm payoffs at the expense of more basic, longer term, and riskier \nresearch and development.\n  In Science in the National Interest (August 1994), the Vice President \nand I reaffirmed our longstanding commitment to world leadership in \nscience, mathematics, and engineering. Scientific discoveries inspire \nand enrich us. Equally important, science and mathematics education \nprovides all Americans with the knowledge and skills they need to \nprepare for and adapt to the high-technology jobs of the future and to \nexercise the responsibilities of citizenship.\n  This Administration has articulated clear goals and established \npriorities for Federal spending, and our economic policies have \nimproved the climate for private investment as well. We intend to work \nclosely with the Congress to ensure the well-being of our children and \ngrandchildren. These investments will prepare us for the challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nreauthorize Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers [VAMC's] to \nestablish nonprofit research corporations [NPRC's].\n  In 1988, Congress passed a law, Public Law 100-322, allowing VAMC's \nto establish NPRC's as a means to provide a flexible funding mechanism \nfor VA-approved research. The purpose of these foundations is to \nenhance ongoing federally-funded VA research by allowing them to accept \nprivate funds, contributions and grants. Between June 1993 and June \n1994, the 65 active corporations provided nearly $40 million in VA \nresearch support.\n  These NPRC's have five overlapping functions which help VAMC's serve \nveteran patients and their families. First, these foundations help \nrecruit and maintain qualified staff inside the VA health care system \nby insuring a strong research program. Not only do NPRC's fund research \nprojects directly, they also help send VA researchers, nurses, \npharmacists, and other staff to conferences and other research events. \nThis both encourages physicians and other health professionals to work \nfor VA and keeps the knowledge inside the VA system.\n  Second, these foundations manage research donations and grants with \nGovernment oversight. NPRC researchers must abide by sunshine laws and \nconduct every project in the open. Unlike universities and private \nfoundations, NPRC's must follow strict conflict of interest guidelines \nwhich protect integrity of the research and the interests of veteran \npatients.\n  Third, these foundations insure that substantial overhead funds are \nretained by VAMC's. Most universities charge overhead costs from 30 to \n50 percent, while NPRC's charge only about 5 to 30 percent for \noverhead. Simply stated, foundations allow more money to be spent on \nresearch-related activities and insure that the money stays inside the \nVA system. Furthermore, some NPRC's provide funds for overheard costs. \nFor example, the San Diego foundation contributes over $100,000 for \noverhead expenses, including paying one-quarter of the hospital's bill \nfor hazardous waste disposal at the research facility. Before NPRC's \nwere established, the medical centers were forced to carry all the \nadministrative costs of research.\n  Fourth, these foundations help provide resources for research-related \npersonnel, equipment, supplies, and conferences. For example, in \nSeattle, WA, the foundation purchases approximately 75,000 dollars \nworth of new equipment for the medical center each year. In some \ninstances, the staff supplied provide direct patient care. In \nWashington, DC, the foundation has 25 employees who work directly in \npatient care as doctors, nurses, or clinicians.\n  Finally, NPRC's allow interested veterans to participate in the \ndevelopment of new drugs and treatments benefiting veterans. In \nKnoxville, TN, the foundation participated in a study which made a new \nblood pressure medication available to patients in a safe, controlled \nmanner. In Indianapolis, IN the foundation conducted a drug study that \ngave veteran patients access to a new medication that benefits \nchronically ill heart patients.\n  By helping to provide equipment, treatment, staff, and other \nresources, while defraying the costs of overhead, these foundations are \nserving veterans without requiring more money from the VA budget.\n  This legislation would correct two problems in current law. First, it \nwould extend the window of opportunity for the establishment of new \nNPRC's until December 31, 2000. To my knowledge, there are several \nVAMC's that would like to establish these important research \ncorporations, including one in Colorado. If these VAMC's were allowed \nto establish NPRC's, it would pump much-needed supplemental funds into \nthe VA research program.\n  The second provision of this bill would delete the requirement that \nNPRC's be established as 501(c)(3) corporations. Realizing that the IRS \nhas recognized several foundations under different classifications, \nthis technical correction is needed to insure the legality of several \nNPRC's.\n  I am happy to include Senators Brown and Akaka as original cosponsors \nof this bill. Mr. President, I hope the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nwill consider this legislation favorably so that interested VA Medical \nCenter can once again establish new nonprofit research corporations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 644\n\n       Be is enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of American in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agriculture Adjustment Act to prohibit \nthe Secretary of Agriculture from basing minimum prices for class I \nmilk on the distance or transportation costs from any location that is \nnot within a marketing area, except under certain circumstances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n         the agricultural adjustment act amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill \nwhich will be a first step toward rectifying the inequities in the \nFederal milk marketing order system. The Federal milk marketing order \nsystem, created nearly 60 years ago, establishes minimum prices for \nmilk paid to producers throughout various marketing areas in the United \nStates.\n  My legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most harmful \nflaw in the current system, and corrects it.\n  That flaw is USDA's practice of basing prices for fluid milk in all \nmarketing ares east of the Rocky Mountains on the distance from Eau \nClaire, WI, when there is no longer any economic justification for \ndoing so.\n  The price for fluid milk increases at a rate of 21 cents per hundred \nmiles from Eau Claire, WI, even though most milk marketing orders do \nnot receive any milk from Wisconsin. Fluid milk prices, as a result, \nare $2.98 cents higher in Florida than in Wisconsin and over $1.00 \nhigher in Texas.\n  This method of pricing fluid milk is not only arbitrary, it is both \nout of date and out of sync with the market conditions of 1995. It is \ntime for this method of pricing--known as single-based-point pricing--\nto come to an end.\n  The bill I am introducing today will prohibit the Secretary of \nAgriculture from using distance or transportation costs from any \nlocation as the basis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities \nof milk are actually transported from that location into the recipient \nmarket. The Secretary will have to comply with the statutory \nrequirement that supply and demand factors be considered as specified \nin the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in \nmarketing orders. The fact remains that single-basing-point pricing \nsimply cannot be justified based on supply and demand for milk both in \nlocal and national markets.\n  This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nspecifically which criteria are used to set milk prices. Finally, he \nwill have to certify to Congress that in no way do the criteria used by \nthe Department attempt to circumvent the prohibition on using distance \nor transportation cost as basis for pricing milk.\n  This one change is so crucial to Upper Midwest producers, because the \ncurrent system has penalized them for many years. By providing \ndisparate profits for producers in other parts of the country and \ncreating artificial economic incentives for milk production, Wisconsin \nproducers have seen national surpluses rise, and milk prices fall. \nRather than providing adequate supplies of fluid milk in some parts of \nthe country, the prices have led to excess production.\n  The prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to \nensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an \nincrease in manufactured products in those\n marketing orders. Those manufactured products directly compete with \nWisconsin's processed products, eroding our markets and driving \nnational prices down.\n\n  In the past 4 years, markets far from Eau Claire, WI, sold most of \nthe surplus manufactured dairy products to the Federal Government under \nthe dairy price support program. The Minnesota-Wisconsin area--the \nsupposed surplus area of the country--in reality accounts for only a \nsmall percentage of actual surplus sales.\n  The perverse nature of this system is further illustrated by the fact \nthat in 1995 some regions of the United States, notably the Central \nStates and the Southwest, are now producing so much milk that they are \nactually shipping fluid milk north to the Upper Midwest. The high fluid \nmilk prices have generated so much excess production, that these \nmarkets distant from Eau Claire are now taking not only our \nmanufactured markets, but also our markets for fluid milk, further \neroding prices in Wisconsin.\n  Emphasizing the market distorting effects of the fluid price \ndifferentials in Federal orders is the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate that eliminating the orders would save $669 million over 5 \nyears. Government outlays would fall, CBO concludes, because production \nwould fall in response to lower milk prices and there would be fewer \nGovernment purchases of surplus milk. The regions which would gain and \nlose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination inherent to the \ncurrent system. Recent economic analyses show that farm revenues in the \nabsence of Federal orders would actually increase in the Upper Midwest \nand fall in most other milk-producing regions.\n  I am not advocating total elimination of the current system at this \npoint, however, the data clearly show that Upper Midwest producers are \nhurt by distortions built into a single-basing-point system that \nprevent them from competing effectively in a national market.\n  While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing \nfluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was \nformalized in the 1960's, when arguably the Upper Midwest was the \nprimary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to \nencourage local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that did \nnot traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs.\n  Mr. President, that is no longer the case. The Upper Midwest is \nneither the lowest cost production area nor a primary source of reserve \nsupplies of milk. Milk is produced efficiently, and in some cases, at \nlower cost than the Upper Midwest, in many of the markets with higher \nfluid milk differentials. Unfortunately, the prices didn't adjust with \nchanging economic conditions, most notably the shift of the dairy \nindustry away from the Upper Midwest and toward the Southwest.\n  Fluid milk prices should have been lowered to reflect that trend. \nInstead, in 1985, the prices were increased for markets distant from \nEau Claire. USDA has refused to use the administrative authority \nprovided by Congress to make the appropriate adjustments to reflect \neconomic realities. They continue to stand behind single-basing-point \npricing.\n  The result has been the decline in the Upper Midwest dairy industry, \nnot because they can't compete in the marketplace, but because the \nsystem discriminates against them.\n  Since 1980, Wisconsin has lost over 15,000 dairy farmers. The Upper \nMidwest, with the lowest fluid milk prices, is shrinking as a dairy \nregion. Other regions with higher fluid milk prices are growing \nrapidly.\n  In an unregulated market with a level playing field these shifts in \nproduction might be fair. But in a market where the Government is \nsetting the prices and providing that artificial advantage, the current \nsystem is unconscionable.\n  This bill is a first step in reforming Federal orders by prohibiting \na practice that should have been dropped long ago. However, for \nCongress there is a long way to go. Through the process of the 1995 \nfarm bill we will have to determine not only what Federal orders should \nnot do, but also what they should do, and, indeed, if they are still \nnecessary. My bill is a starting point. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues and with the dairy industry in the upcoming months to \ndetermine more specifically how we should establish orderly marketing \nconditions. However, this bill identifies the one change that is \nabsolutely necessary in any outcome--the elimination of single basing \npoint pricing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to modernize \nDepartment of Defense acquisition procedures, and for other purposes, \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n             the acquisition management reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, last year, we joined with the administration \nin taking a step toward improving the Federal Government's massive \nbuying system. This is an issue that I have been working on for over a \ndecade and the payoff from a comprehensive reform is significant. Last \nyear's bill, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, attempted to \nimprove the Government's access to commercial items. It also laid the \ngroundwork for more comprehensive reforms. However, it did not remedy \nthe core problems of the Federal buying system. Today, Congressman \nKasich and I are introducing legislation to dramatically reshape the \nDefense Department buying system.\n  Recent reports from both the Defense Department and the General \nAccounting Office highlight the need for reform. In short, the Defense \nDepartment has become increasingly unable to produce the best \ntechnology in an affordable manner, when it is needed. The vast \nmajority of weapon acquisition programs are experiencing serious cost \nand schedule problems. Last December, two of the Defense Department's \nown reports found that, on average, 33 percent of its programs are \nexperiencing overruns. A Defense Systems Management College study, \npublished last month in the College's journal, reported average cost \noverruns of 45 percent with schedule delays of 63 percent. For example, \nthe C-17 transport's cost and schedule overruns have seriously delayed \nits availability. After spending $10.4 billion and over 20 years in \ndeveloping the C-17, the Air Force is considering buying commercial \naircraft in its place.\n  We can point to such horror stories in all the services. Acquisition \ncosts for Navy major weapon systems are over budget by as much as 179 \npercent; Air Force systems by as much as 158 percent, and Army systems \nby as much as 220 percent, even after accounting for the effects of \ninflation and quantity. A July 1993 Defense Science Board study found \nthat: ``without fundamental reform, DOD will be unable to afford the \nweapons, equipment, and services it needs to provide for our national \nsecurity.''\n  The defense buying bureaucracy is plagued by multi-billion-dollar \ncost overruns, programs that are years or even a decade behind \nschedule, incentives that encourage spending rather than cost-cutting, \nand topheavy bureaucratic agencies that rely on detailed regulations \nrather than good judgment. Defense Department studies find that it \ntakes 16 to 25 years and more than 840 steps to bring a technology to \nthe battlefield. By then the technologies are out of date. Until the \nbuying system is changed, the results would not improve.\n  Mr. President, I have long maintained that Congress must be bold if \nit is to make significant improvements in the Government's buying \nsystem--a system I have worked for more than a decade to reform. It was \nmy legislation that led to the creation of the Packard Commission. I \nhave sponsored and fought for many reforms, including the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, which I and my colleagues on the \nGovernmental Affairs\n Committee successfully enacted into law.\n\n  While last year's legislation made a good step forward more \nsignificant changes are required to fix the core problems. Without \nmajor cultural and structural change, cost and schedule overruns will \ncontinue, the Pentagon will pay more than it should for goods and \nservices; and the taxpayer will pick up the inflated tab. Moreover, our \nbrave young men and women in uniform will continue to wait for decades \nto get weapons that may not meet their needs.\n  Mr. President, there are three root causes to this situation which \nmust be addressed today:\n  One, the defense acquisition process is too cumbersome, takes too \nlong, and does not produce desired results. The DOD 5000 and 8000 \nSeries of documents and its consensus based management process must be \nabandoned in favor of a results oriented process.\n  Two, incentives are wrong. They reward program managers and \ncontractors for increasing the size of their program and their budget. \nThere are no incentives for a job well done.\n  Three, the organization is too large. It is a bureaucracy with layer \nupon layer of management and dozens of buying commands and subcommands \nspread across the four military services. Many of the bureaucratic \nlayers exist solely for the purpose of satisfying the needs of the \nbureaucracy and add no value. The dozens of defense acquisition schools \nthat were originally intended to ensure the excellence of the work \nforce have now become a barrier to reform. And, dozens of military \ndepots have become a hindrance to efficiently downsizing the defense \nindustrial base.\n  Mr. President, my proposal contains eight parts and incorporates the \nprinciples of unity of command, lean management structure, fast \nprocesses, and pay for performance for both Government workers and \ncontractors.\n  First, with respect to program performance, programs must be managed \nwithin 90 percent of their budget, schedule, and performance goals. If \nthey overrun by 50 percent or more, programs must be terminated.\n  Second, my legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to \nstreamline the acquisition management process so that program managers \nfocus on achieving results. It also integrates the operational testing \nreforms that I have been working on with Senator Pryor to prevent \ncircumvention of operational tests and force early operational \nassessments to reduce the risk of major flaws being found after \nproduction has started.\n  Third, my proposal streamlines the defense acquisition organization \nand its interface with operational users. The bill reorganizes the \nDefense Department research, development, and acquisition bureaucracies \ninto a single DOD-wide agency, using the three layer organization \nendorsed by the Packard commission.\n  Fourth, the bill re-emphasizes the commitment of Congress to a \nprofessional acquisition work force and establishes an incentive \nstructure focused on program performance.\n  Fifth, the legislation emphasizes the necessity for an efficient \ncontracting process by establishing a policy goal of cutting in-half \nthe time it takes to get an item to someone with a need. It also allows \nthe Defense Department to limit the final selection process to the top \ntwo or three bidders, as recommended by the GAO.\n  Sixth, the Defense Department will be able to manage its contractors \non the basis of performance, rather than relying on continuous audit \noversight and the threat of penalties. Under the \n[[Page S4809]] concept that I am proposing, contractor profit would be \ntried to achievement of quantifiable performance measures.\n  Seventh, the bill addresses major financial management problems that \nafflict the defense buying system. It reduces the major source of \nprogram instability by enabling full-funding of a program for each \nphase of the development process. Additionally, those who use weapons \nwill regain authority for determining what is bought to support them. \nThe bill also applies pay for performance to responsible officials, \nrequiring them to bring financial management up to commercial \nstandards.\n  Eighth, the bill consolidates duplicative military and industry \nmaintenance and repair depots. The bill prohibits the Defense \nDepartment from performing depot and intermediate level maintenance and \nrepair work, unless industry is unwilling to perform the work. \nTherefore existing repair depots must be either privatized or shut \ndown.\n  Mr. President, large savings can be realized from the comprehensive \nreforms I am proposing. I anticipate that my approach will reduce \nacquisition management personnel by as much as 25 to 30 percent through \nreduction in duplicative headquarters staffs. The Defense Science Board \nTask Force on Defense Acquisition Reform reported in July 1993 that a \ncomprehensive reform along the lines I am proposing would save $20 \nbillion per year. The House Budget Committee has included $3.5 billion \nin its budget reduction proposal, and the Congressional Budget Office \nconservatively estimates the savings at about $1.7 billion per year.\n  In summary, there is both a need and an opportunity for reforming \nDefense acquisition. But, Mr. President, I must point out that \nbureaucracies are inherently unable to reform themselves. The time has \ncome for us to make some very hard and difficult decisions which have \nfar-reaching impact on the future of our country. Change must be \nbrought about by those of us who are concerned about maintaining a \nstrong defense within today's budget constraints.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill and a letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 646\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Roth, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: As the associations representing the \n     hundreds of thousands of American workers employed in the \n     aerospace, electronics, shipbuilding and services industries, \n     we offer our strong support for the depot maintenance \n     provisions included in your procurement reform legislation. \n     We urge prompt action on these provisions in order to achieve \n     their enactment in this session of Congress.\n       The elements of your proposal that repeal the $3 million \n     threshold for the shift of depot workload to the private \n     sector and the repeal of the so-called 60/40 rule will \n     eliminate management restrictions long opposed by the \n     Department of Defense as well as the private sector. The \n     elimination of these restrictions as called for by your bill \n     will afford the government much greater flexibility to obtain \n     the most cost effective use of every dollar spent on defense \n     logistics support.\n       Similarly, we are greatly encouraged by the provisions of \n     your legislation that address the issue of government \n     ``core'' competencies. We support the language that calls for \n     the performance of the preponderance of this workload by \n     private sector entities selected on the basis of competitive \n     procedures in accordance with your narrow definition of \n     ``core'' government competency.\n       The depot maintenance policy articulated in your \n     legislation will permit the development of a logistics \n     support program for the 21st century. Your legislation in \n     this regard is in the national interest and in the interest \n     of the private sector industrial base. We applaud your depot \n     policy initiative, and offer to work closely with you in the \n     weeks ahead to achieve its timely enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n         The Presidents of AIA, ADPA, AEA, CSA, EIA, NSIA, SCA, \n           and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n           \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4806-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 216\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 216, a bill to repeal the \nreduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals and \nentertainment.\n\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 327, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide clarification for the \ndeductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the \nbusiness use of the home.\n\n\n                                 S. 351\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 351, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the credit for \nincreasing research activities.\n\n\n                                 S. 360\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 360, a bill to amend title 23, \nUnited States Code, to eliminate the penalties imposed on States for \nnoncompliance with motorcycle helmet and automobile safety belt \nrequirements, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the names of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] and the Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 385, a bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to \neliminate the penalties imposed on States for failure to require the \nuse of safety belts in passenger vehicles, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 400\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from \nAlabama [Mr. Shelby] was added as a cosponsor of S. 400, a bill to \nprovide for appropriate remedies for prison conditions, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the names of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 442, a bill to improve and strengthen the \nchild support collection system, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 456\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the names of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] and the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 456, a bill to improve and strengthen the child \nsupport collection system, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 91\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pell, the names of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato], the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], and the Senator \nfrom Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] were added as cosponsors of Senate \nResolution 91, a resolution to condemn Turkey's illegal invasion of \nNorthern Iraq.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4820-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             SENATE RESOLUTION 96--RELATIVE TO A RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

JOHN BRADEMAS ON THE FUTURE OF THE NEW YORK STATE ECONOMY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, during the past year, NYNEX, a \nmajor telecommunications company headquartered in New York \nState, has sponsored a series of ``Agenda For Growth'' conferences on \nthe future of the economy of the State.\n  Keynoting the last of this series was Dr. John Brademas, president \nemeritus of New York University, who before joining the university in \n1981, served for 22 years in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Cosponsors with NYNEX of the February 15, 1995, meeting were the \nBusiness Council of New York State, Inc., \n[[Page S4834]] and the New York City Partnership/New York Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry, Inc.\n  I believe many of my colleagues in both Houses of Congress will find \nDr. Brademas' analysis of interest, and I ask that the text of his \nremarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\nAgenda for Growth: NYNEX Conference on the Future of the New York State \n                                Economy\n\n       I am honored to have been asked to open this conference on \n     ``The Future of the New York Economy,'' and I congratulate \n     Dick Jalkut, President and Group Executive of NYNEX \n     Telecommunications, on the contribution the ``Agenda for \n     Growth'' series represents to understanding important issues \n     facing our city and region.\n       At the outset, let me note that I have served on the Board \n     of Directors of NYNEX since 1991 and have greatly enjoyed the \n     opportunity to work with Dick and the other outstanding \n     leaders of NYNEX.\n       Today, I'll speak to you from the perspective of someone \n     who served twenty-two years as a Member of Congress, from \n     Indiana; for eleven years, as President of the nation's \n     largest private university, New York University; and as a \n     former chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of \n     New York. Among other current responsibilities, I'm serving \n     as chairman, by appointment of President Clinton, of the \n     President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and also \n     chair the National Endowment for Democracy.\n       So from this general background, I want to join you in \n     considering prospects for the future of New York City and the \n     surrounding area and ways of strengthening our economy in the \n     years ahead.\n       As we all know, the economic recovery of the metropolitan \n     region has lagged that of the entire nation. We know, too, \n     that recent changes in political leadership at the city, \n     state, and national levels have added a new dimension of \n     uncertainty to the economic outlook for New York.\n       How, in this context, do we nurture the unique strengths of \n     the metropolitan region and nourish its preeminent role in \n     the international marketplace?\n       How, as it were, do we develop an agenda for prosperity?\n       To respond to these questions, we must first understand the \n     dynamic that drives the New York economy and then consider \n     the challenges that require our efforts. The participants in \n     this\n      conference will offer many insights. Let me offer some \n     initial observations.\n       Point number one. New York's economic future lies in \n     fundamental changes in the international economy. \n     Technological advances propelling us into the 21st century \n     are redefining the competitive landscape of the entire world. \n     National borders and political ideologies no longer determine \n     patterns of global trade and the movement of capital. We have \n     entered an era characterized by a combination of intense \n     competition and interdependence.\n       Two of President Clinton's actions this month dramatically \n     underscore what Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin has \n     described as the ``interconnectedness'' of the world economy: \n     the Mexican rescue package and sanctions on China.\n       This changing structure of the international economy \n     profoundly affects the life of major cities like New York. \n     Why? The dispersal of economic activity around the globe has \n     created a corresponding need for organizational coordination \n     in a few key sites. So cities are increasingly taking on a \n     strategic role as highly concentrated command centers for \n     operations that are worldwide. Not surprisingly, cities have \n     concomitantly become critical locations for finance and \n     specialized services.\n       All these functions have influenced immeasurably both \n     international economic activity and urban development. One \n     result is the emergence of ``the global city,'' with New York \n     a primary example. The scope and character of the New York \n     area economy are more and more defined by its role in the \n     world marketplace.\n       Beyond understanding New York's place on the international \n     stage, we must appreciate a second fundamental factor. The \n     principal reason for the strength of the New York region in \n     the world economy is that it is the center for the creation \n     and sophisticated application of intellectual capital.\n       For during the past century, the New York economy has \n     evolved from one dependent on manufacturing to one based on a \n     concentration of Fortune 500 headquarters, corporate R \n     facilities, advanced business services in finance, law, \n     advertising and management and the world's leading cultural \n     institutions and media firms.\n       Indispensable to all these activities is what I'm calling \n     ``intellectual capital''--the individuals and industries that \n     develop new products and services, apply technology in \n     innovative ways, generate new marketing concepts and \n     techniques, design new fashions, create new forms of music \n     and art and produce the information and entertainment that \n     are distributed across the nation and the world.\n       Indeed, as several recent news accounts have noted, the\n        richness of its intellectual capital sector makes New York \n     an incubator for a host of new multimedia start-ups which \n     thrive on the vibrance of the arts--painters, musicians, \n     writers, filmmakers--and provides innovative content for \n     communications, advertising and publishing conglomerates \n     headquartered in the region--Time Warner, Sony, Hearst, \n     Viacom, Bertelsman, ABC, CBS and NBC. As the New York area \n     also offers comprehensive venture capital and financial \n     services, the remaining resources essential to creative \n     development are right here.\n       And New York's intellectual capital sector is more and more \n     the primary pulse of the region's strength. The performance \n     of individual facets of the sector may fluctuate over time \n     but taken as a whole, the intellectual capital sector will be \n     the lead generator of income and employment for the future of \n     this region. We must, therefore, nurture this unique resource \n     so that the New York metropolitan area can respond to change \n     with state-of-the-art capabilities. We cannot afford to cede \n     fields of specialization over time to our national and \n     international rival cities.\n       As we meet today in a hotel close to Times Square, I \n     observe that tourism--New York style--also depends on \n     intellectual capital. Business travelers come to New York in \n     search of the ideas and specializes information most easily \n     obtained through face-to-face contact. Other visitors come \n     for the city's cultural life, its restaurants and retail \n     stores.\n       Walk just a few blocks from here and you can see how New \n     York City blends culture, entertainment and tourism in new \n     and creative ways. Leading entertainment companies, like \n     Disney, Viacom and Virgin Records, are revitalizing historic \n     theaters on 42nd Street. This development has been made \n     possible, in part, through the impressive work of the Times \n     Square Business Improvement District which has made the \n     entire theater district attractive to visitors from around \n     the world.\n       As a former university president, I cannot fail to add that \n     New York City's intellectual capital is in large measure the \n     product of the presence of a rich mixture of colleges, \n     universities and research institutes. More than 100 \n     institutions of higher education are located here, situated \n     in all parts of the city. Unlike so many cities where one or \n     two colleges and universities dominate, New York is home to \n     nearly every type of educational institution: theological \n     seminaries, two- and four-year colleges and health care \n     centers and research universities of international \n     distinction.\n       Indeed, what helps make New York so special is that the \n     students who attend college and professional schools in New \n     York City often settle here and replenish our intellectual \n     capital. Our colleges and universities are magnets that draw \n     people to New York\n      who then launch their careers here, providing a new stream \n     of talent for both the private and non-profit sectors.\n       I must make another point. The intellectual capital sector \n     encompasses not only the world's largest corporations and \n     financial institutions but also the small companies and \n     manufacturing firms that pioneer customized products and \n     services. Recent studies have underscored the importance of \n     nimble, skilled small businesses as a significant part of the \n     job creation process in the New York area.\n       How then can we strengthen our base for the years ahead, to \n     assure that we retain both our role as a global city and our \n     investment in intellectual capital?\n       Here are a few suggestions.\n       First, we must recognize that we're fashioning an agenda \n     for growth at a time of major political change, and as you \n     and I know, decisions at every level of government have an \n     impact on the economy.\n       New leadership in both the United States Senate and House \n     of Representatives, a substantial number of members wholly \n     new to the legislative process, shifting committee \n     jurisdictions and, above all, a President and Congress \n     sharply divided by party mean a set of forces that may take \n     Federal policy in directions that depart radically from the \n     past. Similarly, this year, we have had a change of party in \n     the Governor's office in New York State, and last year, in \n     the Mayor's office in City Hall.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that reductions \n     in Federal grants to New York State in the Republican \n     ``Contract With America'' would total $26.4 billion a year. \n     Such cuts would affect every aspect of life in the city, from \n     transportation to education, and particularly health care, \n     which accounts for over 12% of employment and wages in the \n     metropolitan region.\n       From Albany, Governor Pataki wants to reduce state aid to \n     the city by $158 million for the City University of New York, \n     $128 million for the MTA and nearly $2 billion from Medicaid \n     and welfare.\n       From City Hall, Mayor Giuliani announced yesterday $600 \n     million in cuts in city agencies.\n       Clearly a concern that underlies all discussion of spending \n     cuts--Federal, state or local--is the impact on the poor in \n     the city. Although the widening gap between rich and poor in \n     New York City is not the subject of this conference, I \n     believe that effectively addressing this complex issue is \n     essential to the long-term social stability and economic \n     health of our city and region.\n       A second item on our agenda for growth: We must not only \n     sustain but substantially improve the infrastructure that \n     supports New York's economy and its reservoir of intellectual \n     capital. By infrastructure, I mean \n     [[Page S4835]] the capacity to move goods, people and \n     information.\n       The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, under the \n     sagacious leadership of Stanley Brezenoff, undertook major \n     improvements in the region's airports. We must continue these \n     efforts while dramatically enhancing ground access to our \n     airports. Indeed the regional public authorities should start \n     planning the transportation systems necessary for the next \n     century. While making better use of the existing \n     transportation infrastructure, we must also link inner-city \n     residents to jobs in outlying areas and find ways of \n     connecting suburban communities directly to downtown \n     Manhattan.\n       The other element of infrastructure indispensable to \n     intellectual capital is telecommunications. Put simply, the \n     metropolitan area can function as a global city only with a \n     telecommunications capability second to none. For there is a \n     synergistic relationship between unending demands for ever \n     more sophisticated services and the push for breakthrough \n     technology and systems to meet those demands.\n       Driven by data and communication requirements for managing \n     international operations from corporate headquarters and \n     conducting complex financial transactions around the world, \n     New York has emerged as the central nervous system for the \n     global network of the most advanced information technology \n     anywhere.\n       New York City resembles a giant switchboard: Electronic \n     messages are constantly flowing in, through and out of the \n     city's office towers and stock exchanges. Modern \n     telecommunications systems have enhanced the city's capacity \n     to put information to work, converting ideas and data into \n     new products and services that are distributed electronically \n     around the world.\n       Indeed, New York is the leading source of content for \n     books, magazines, newspapers, radio, television and \n     eventually for the Internet. Within just one mile of this \n     motel are the headquarters of the nation's largest television \n     and radio networks, leading publishing companies and major \n     sources of cable television programs.\n       As the global market for information and entertainment \n     expands, New York's communications industry will become even \n     more important. Only last week, MTV, a division of Viacom, \n     headquartered just four blocks from here, announced the \n     launch of a music television channel in South Africa, the \n     first American broadcaster to establish a network in South \n     Africa since the new,\n      post-apartheid government opened the state-controlled \n     airwaves to private enterprise.\n       New York is--literally--spanning the world!\n       Let me turn from physical infrastructure to the foundation \n     of New York's intellectual capital sector--people. New York \n     City has a larger number and wider diversity of brilliant, \n     talented, motivated men and women than any other urban area \n     in the world. It is this intellectual firepower that in large \n     part makes New York New York and is so attractive to \n     international business.\n       Two forces are critical to invigorating the environment \n     necessary for constant renewal of our creativity and \n     expertise: education and the arts. Let me elaborate.\n       The employment requirements of the New York metropolitan \n     region are increasingly characterized by the sophisticated, \n     cosmopolitan nature of the intellectual capital sector.\n       I have earlier spoken of the crucial role our post-\n     secondary educational institutions play in luring people here \n     for their studies and careers. Yet no challenge is greater \n     for New York City than to reaffirm the priority of good \n     elementary and secondary schools. The public school system is \n     nevertheless being asked to do much more with substantially \n     less. As Robert Berne, Dean of NYU's Robert F. Wagner \n     Graduate School of Public Service, has warned, the proposed \n     freeze in state aid to New York City schools represents a \n     substantial cut in funding because our school population is \n     increasing by approximately 20,000 students every year. And \n     Mayor Giuliani's announcement yesterday that the deepest \n     reductions in his budget will fall on the City's public \n     schools only intensifies the problem.\n       Without a strong school system, we will not be able to \n     produce a skilled workforce, one able to compete in today's \n     job market. As entry-level jobs demand higher technical \n     skills, we must design our high school programs to meet the \n     requirements for employment in the 21st century.\n       In addition to education, other components crucial to the \n     creative milieu that defines New York are arts and other \n     cultural institutions. The arts are a $9 billion industry in \n     this region, an essential asset to tourism which in turns \n     generates $20 billion of regional economic activity. The \n     Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, is the city's single \n     largest tourist attraction, with 4.6 million visitors \n     annually, nearly one million of whom are from outside the \n     country.\n       As a recent report, The Arts As An Industry, issued by the \n     Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, stated:\n       ``The arts and the people who create, present, and market \n     them are a critical competitive advantage that New York and \n     its suburbs have over our national and international \n     competitors for survival in the next century . . . But . . . \n     the most important role the arts play in the life of the \n     region is not related to its economy but to its very sense of \n     itself.''\n       I speak to this matter with particular interest as Chairman \n     of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, \n     and I express serious concern about the uncertain future of \n     Federal support for the arts, the humanities and museums. \n     Proposed budget cuts would have a deeply damaging impact \n     nationwide, for the arts, humanities and museums are vital to \n     the economy of every state and every local community. Non-\n     profit arts institutions alone generate $36 billion in \n     economic activity annually. They support 1.3 million jobs and \n     generate $3.4 billion in Federal tax revenues. Investment in \n     the arts and the humanities is good business.\n       Support for the National Endowments for the Arts and the \n     Humanities is so small--only $.64 per person a year for each \n     Endowment--yet it is indispensable seed money. Every Federal \n     dollar leverages an average of $11 more from private, state \n     and local sources, and without Federal support, there is no \n     serious prospect that private funds will fill the resulting \n     gap or that state and local governments will be able to do \n     so.\n       And what would be the impact of threatened cuts on New York \n     City where culture is an integral part of our tourist \n     industry?\n       Now in defining the context for ``an agenda of growth'' for \n     the New York Area, I have made two assertions:\n       (1) New York's future is linked to the international \n     economy; and\n       (2) Our unique source of strength is intellectual capital.\n       I must add a third factor: (3) We must more aggressively \n     encourage communication and cooperation between and among the \n     business sector; our educational institutions, especially \n     higher education; and government at every level.\n       The prevailing political winds can set a new course for the \n     relationship between government and business. The profit-\n     making sector and our colleges and universities can find new \n     ways of working with one another.\n       Indeed, it is awareness of the importance of such cross-\n     cutting relationships that caused the Carnegie Corporation of \n     New York to make a grant to New York University to organize \n     this year a series of three colloquia on science, technology \n     and government. Scientists and engineers, business executives \n     and government\n      leaders will join scholars from New York University, other \n     area universities and the New York Academy of Sciences to \n     take part in sessions on three major topics--\n     biotechnology, telecommunications and science and \n     environmental journalism. Experts from New York, New \n     Jersey and Connecticut as well as city, state and Federal \n     officials will discuss the implications for the tri-state \n     economy of advances in science and technology and of \n     decisions by public policy-makers.\n       Let me conclude this analysis by suggesting some questions \n     for this distinguished panel to consider. It is, in my view, \n     imperative that the business community, along with civic and \n     community groups, be involved in shaping the agenda for the \n     economic growth of the city. In doing so, there will be \n     difficult choices among competing priorities. Let me \n     illustrate.\n       First, sustaining the infrastructure of the New York City \n     region will require large-scale public investments. Which \n     ones? Here's an example: Should we renovate Yankee Stadium, \n     improve access to the airports or expand the Jacob Javits \n     Convention Center?\n       A still broader question here: How to link our economic \n     development strategy for job creation to our investments in \n     infrastructure?\n       Second, we must support the institutions that nourish our \n     base of intellectual capital. How?\n       To meet the demands of a changing economy, we must \n     modernize our public schools. What is the role of the \n     business sector here? Of our colleges and universities?\n       Again, can our institutions of higher education forge \n     connections with business and industry to the advantage of \n     both? Can, for example, the city's medical schools \n     collaborate more closely with the region's pharmaceutical \n     firms to build a stronger biotech industry?\n       I have spoken of the arts, one of New York's greatest \n     assets. How can we assure financial support, both public and \n     private, of our cultural institutions in ways that reflect \n     their importance to our economic future?\n       What initiatives, public and private, are necessary to \n     attract and retain artists, writers and the entrepreneurs of \n     New York's emerging multimedia industry?\n       Third, can we explore opportunities for more public-private \n     partnerships? Their success in renewing Union Square, Bryant \n     Park and downtown Brooklyn demonstrates that the quality of \n     life in New York can be enhanced if business and government \n     work together.\n       How can we stimulate jobs and economic development in low \n     income communities and invent more effective approaches to \n     the delivery of public services?\n       We all know that privatization is now in fashion but we \n     must ask exactly what government functions should be \n     privatized and the effect of privatization on the delivery of \n     services.\n       We know, too, that government tax, spending and regulatory \n     policies will continue to influence the agenda for the \n     economic growth of New York. The entire range of issues that \n     affect the economy--and society generally--is, of course, in \n     a democracy, the stuff of politics.\n       Now I have not today attempted to be exhaustive in my \n     comments, but instructive. I \n     [[Page S4836]] would, however, insist that in a modern, \n     complex society like ours, there are roles for both private \n     and public sectors. And if I have said anything useful, it is \n     to stimulate more communication and cooperation between the \n     two.\n       The rapidity of scientific and technological change imposes \n     new burdens on leaders of business to remain competitive and \n     on government policy-makers to serve the pubic interest.\n       For all these reasons, I applaud NYNEX for bringing \n     together these distinguished leaders from various fields to \n     discuss the future of our region.\n       I conclude with the words of that great conservative, \n     Edmund Burke:\n       ``The public interest requires doing today those things \n     that men [today, he would add, ``and women''!] of \n     intelligence and goodwill would wish, five or ten years \n     hence, had been done.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4833-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    A MUSLIM VOICE AGAINST TERRORISM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, in Tikkun, a journal that \ncomments on political and religious affairs from the Jewish \nperspective, I saw a comment under the title ``A Muslim Voice Against \nTerrorism'' by Iman Plemon T. El-Amin. He is an assistant to Iman \nWarith Deen Mohammed, and the journal comments: ``While Louis Farrakhan \ntends to be portrayed in the media as the dominant voice of Islam in \nthe United States, Warith Deen Mohammed represents a significantly \nlarge following. This statement about Islam should be read by all those \nwho claim that they never hear Islamic leaders speaking out against \nHamas violence.'' There is a tendency, in the United States, and \nparticularly in our media, to identify the word Moslem with the word \nradical or fundamentalist, so you constantly read about Moslem radicals \nor Moslem fundamentalists; and there is not an awareness that most \nMoslems practice their religion in a responsible way, just as most \nChristians and Jews and people of other beliefs do.\n  The United States is becoming more and more a pluralistic society \nwith people of many religious beliefs contributing to enriching our \nsociety. Among those whose numbers have grown significantly in the last \ndecade are Moslems and Buddhists.\n  The statement by Imam Plemon T. El-Amin is a good antidote for those \nwho see Moslem voice only in forms of extremism.\n  I ask that the statement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n                     [From Tikkun, Vol. 10, No. 2]\n\n                    A Muslim Voice Against Terrorism\n\n                         (By Plemon T. El-Amin)\n\n       Muslim voices against terrorism have not been silent, but \n     it is the trend, perhaps even the policy of major media, to \n     downplay the voice of reason, the voice of faith, and the \n     voice of principle, in favor of the shouts of the extreme, \n     the wails of the grief-stricken, and the threats of the \n     treacherous. The voices of peace, justice, mercy, and \n     tolerance are not difficult to find among Muslims and Islamic \n     media, who consistently denounce acts of terrorism and reject \n     them as illegitimate and unacceptable Islamic strategies or \n     methods.\n       Imam W. Deen Mohammed, internationally and nationally \n     recognized leader of the largest identifiable Muslim-American \n     community, explained recently that: ``Islam insists that the \n     best human behavior be demonstrated even when engaging an \n     enemy in war, Our Prophet Muhammed (prayers and peace be on \n     him) ordered that civilians not be made the victims of war. \n     He (the Prophet) cautioned the Muslims to take care not to \n     attack those who were not bearing arms against them. Islam \n     and the Prophet's life require of us that we uphold justice \n     and be a peace-seeking people.''\n       Muslims are guided and obligated by the Qur'an, which \n     reveals to us that we must not wage war for self-interest, \n     material gain, or mere retaliation. Muslims are to fight or \n     wage war only when someone hinders them from the worship and \n     work of God. And when we fight, we must reject barbaric \n     methods of warfare and doing any harm to women, children, the \n     elderly, the sick or wounded, and even to animals or \n     vegetation.\n       Muslims are commanded by God to do justice to all, \n     irrespective of whether they are friend or enemy, under all \n     circumstances. God says in the Qur'an, ``O you who believe! \n     Stand out firmly for justice even as against\n      yourselves or your parents or your kin, and whether it be \n     (against) rich or poor.'' (4:135) ``O you who believe! \n     Stand out firmly for God as witnesses to fair-dealing, and \n     let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to \n     wrong and depart from justice. Be just, that is next to \n     piety. And be regardful of God, for God is well-acquainted \n     with all that you do.'' (5:9)\n       The definition of jihad is not Holy War, nor can it be used \n     to justify terrorism. Imam W. Deen Mohammed has stated that \n     ``Jihad means struggle in everything that God has established \n     for Muslims to do. The emphasis on jihad in the Qur'an and in \n     the life of Prophet Muhammed was not for the purpose of \n     conquering lands or overthrowing nations, it was for the \n     purpose of liberating the higher instincts, the higher \n     aspirations in man.''\n       Cowardly acts of terrorism upon innocent men, women, and \n     children is not a doorway to Heaven, but a gateway to Hell. \n     Blind aggression and retaliation are sins, and as Muslims we \n     reject these practices by our selves, our kin, our foes, the \n     rich, or the poor. Past and recent acts of terrorism that \n     victimize innocent human beings, such as the World Trade \n     Center bombing, the mosque assault by Baruch Goldstein, and \n     the recent suicide bombing in Tel Aviv are deplored by our \n     community and must be condemned by all God-conscious and \n     civilized communities, both Muslim and others. We must all \n     stand up for peace and toleration. Among both the \n     Palestinians and the Israelis are those guilty and \n     responsible for the many women and children left maimed and \n     dead. Each side has produced both perpetrators of violence \n     and victims of injustice.\n       In Islam, one injustice, or even many, does not justify \n     another. Man's law and rule has failed both peoples. It is \n     time to embrace the law and rule of God, especially since \n     both people identify themselves as people who hold the rule \n     of God above the law of man.\n       The voice of the Muslim is not mute. Our voice is that of \n     the Qur'an, and the life of the Prophet Muhammed. Both ring \n     with clarity that peace is to be loved and sought, and \n     terrorism is to be hated and rejected.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/29/senate-section/article/S4836-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.
