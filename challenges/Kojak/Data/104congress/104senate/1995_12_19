Mr. President, what is the current order of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the conference report \non H.R. 1530, the Defense authorization.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as we debate the conference report on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996, I again want \nto express my admiration for the hard work, determination, and \ncommitment of Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee. \nRegardless of our individual and differing views on the specifics of \nthis conference report, I believe everyone knows that Senator Thurmond \nworked with diligence and dedication to reach an agreement with the \nHouse.\n  I also want to express my appreciation for the hard work of the \nmajority staff director, Dick Reynard; deputy staff director, George \nLauffer, who is \n\n[[Page S18836]]\nhere on the floor; general counsel, Don Deline; and all the majority \nstaff. They put in many late nights and 7-day weeks over the course of \nthis conference, which has provided them with far too little time to \nspend with their own families.\n  The same applies to Arnold Punaro, Andy Effron, and many others on my \nstaff who have worked with equal diligence and dedication.\n  This bill was in conference for over 3 months. The chairman, Senator \nThurmond, has shown great patience and endurance through long and \ndifficult negotiations with the House. Out of respect for Senator \nThurmond, particularly in his first year as chairman--although he has \nbeen on the committee for many years--I signed the conference report, \nand I voted for the motion to proceed, thereby providing the Senate \nwith the opportunity to consider this report.\n  I do not support the legislation, for reasons I will explain. I feel \nit is essential that the Senate at least make a determination and vote \non this conference report.\n  The conference report contains important legislative authorities, \nwhich I strongly support. I want to point out the important military \npay and allowances provisions, including a 2.4-percent pay raise for \nthe troops and a 5.2-percent increase in the basic allowance for \nquarters. Without this bill, the pay raise under permanent law will be \n2 percent, or 0.4 percent less. The basic allowance for quarters \nincrease would be 2 percent, instead of the current 5.2 percent, if \nthis bill passes.\n  If we do not have this bill enacted into law, I intend to join others \nin doing everything possible to see that this key legislation for pay \nraises and for basic allowance for quarters be inserted in another bill \nbefore we leave this session.\n  Second, approval of Secretary Perry's family and troop housing \ninitiative, which would provide new authorities--including shared \npublic and private sector funding--to finance needed construction and \nimprovements in military housing.\n  Third, detailed acquisition reform legislation that complements last \nyear's landmark Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. Key provisions \nwould:\n  Use simplified procedures to streamline the process of procuring \ncommercial products and services while preserving the requirement for \nfull and open competition.\n  Reduce the barriers that inhibit acquisition of commercial products \nby eliminating the requirement for certified cost and pricing data for \ncommercial products.\n  Streamline the bid protest process by eliminating the separate bid \nprotest authority of the General Services Board of Contract Appeals and \nproviding for all bid protests to be determined by the General \nAccounting Office.\n  Consolidate and clarify the standards of conduct for Federal \nofficials in the acquisition process to ensure consistent treatment of \nsuch personnel on a governmentwide basis.\n  Fourth, establishment of a defense modernization account. This \nprovision will encourage the Department of Defense and give them a \nstrong incentive to achieve savings in procurement, research and \ndevelopment, and operations and maintenance by allowing the Department \nto place the savings in a new account, the defense modernization \naccount. Funds in the account would be available for the services to \nspend on the most pressing long-term needs of our military--that is \nmodernization of our military forces and equipment and procurement. The \nDepartment could use amounts in the account to address funding \nshortfalls in the modernization of vital weapons systems.\n  Mr. President, I would like to see these provisions enacted into law, \nbut I cannot support the conference report in its present form. This \nwill be the first time, in my 23 years in the Senate, that I will vote \nagainst a Defense authorization conference report. I have supported \nevery previous Defense authorization conference report during my Senate \ncareer, including 6 years in which I served in the minority under two \nRepublican chairmen.\n  In the past, when we had a Democratic Congress and a Republican \nPresident, we routinely faced a House bill that was unacceptable and a \nSenate bill that was acceptable to the Republican President. In those \nyears most of the compromising had to come from the House if we were \ngoing to get a bill signed into law. We knew that when we saw the shape \nof the two bills coming out of the House and Senate.\n  We faced the same situation in reverse this year with a Republican \nCongress in the House and Senate and with a Democratic President. This \nyear, we have a generally acceptable Senate bill and a generally \nunacceptable House bill in terms of Presidential signature. This is \njust the opposite of what we have had year after year with Republican \nPresidents and Democratic Congresses. Unfortunately, this year, the \nHouse was unwilling to make the compromises necessary to get a bill \nthat is likely to be approved by the Clinton administration. Instead of \ncompromising more toward the Senate bill, which could have received \nClinton administration support, most important compromises strongly \ntitled toward the House position.\n  The conference report before us contains fundamental flaws that I \nbelieve are contrary to the best interests of the taxpayers and sound \nmanagement of our national defense activities. On balance, I have \nconcluded that this bill's bad policy outweighs its good policies in \nits current form.\n  Mr. President, I will discuss again, as I did last week, the missile \ndefense part of this conference report at a later point in my \npresentation. I would like to turn to other elements of the conference \nthat give me great concern.\n\n\n repeal of the requirement for an independent director of operational \n                          test and evaluation\n\n  When the House drafted its version of this year's bill, they \ndeveloped a DOD reorganization proposal which included a provision \nabolishing the position of the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation. That position was created in 1983 at the initiative of \nSenators Roth, Grassley, and Pryor, to ensure that testing of major \nweapons systems would be evaluated by an office independent of the \nresponsibility for program and contract management.\n  During the Senate debate on this bill, we adopted without dissent a \nbipartisan amendment--sponsored by Senators Roth and Pryor--reaffirming \ncongressional support for the Office of the Director of Test and \nEvaluation [OTE]. That was the Senate position.\n  In that amendment, we noted that the OTE position was ``created by \nCongress to provide an independent validation and verification on the \nsuitability and effectiveness of new weapons, and to ensure that the * \n* * military departments acquire weapons that are proven in a \noperational environment before they are produced and used in combat.''\n  In summary, Mr. President, Operational Test and Evaluation has as its \nmain purpose objective--evaluation of weapons systems before they are \npurchased. There has been a whole history to indicate the need for this \nkind of office because program managers inevitably get wedded to \nprograms. If they are responsible not only to develop the programs, \npresent them, sell them, and market them on Capitol Hill but also to \ntest them, there is an inherent inability for the kind of objectivity \nthat is needed in making sure the weapons work before we buy them.\n  The conference agreement is contrary to the Senate position--in fact, \njust the opposite of the Senate provision--and would repeal the \nlegislation requiring that there be an independent Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation.\n  Mr. President, it is important to differentiate the provisions \naffecting the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation from other \naspects of the DOD reorganization provisions proposed by the House and \nadopted in conference which reduce the number of positions in DOD \nrequiring Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.\n  With the exception of the language affecting the Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation and the language affecting the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations--which I shall \naddress later in my remarks--I have no objection to some of the other \nDOD reorganization provisions proposed in the conference agreement \nwhich largely came from the House. The unobjectionable elements of the \nconference agreement merely repeal \n\n[[Page S18837]]\nthe statutory designation of certain positions and the requirement for \nSenate confirmation.\n  The Operational Test and Evaluation proposal goes further. It would \nrepeal section 139 of title 10, which contains a number of key \nprotections for the Director of OTE. Under current law:\n  The Director can only be removed by the President, and the President \nmust report his reasons to Congress.\n  The Director is guaranteed statutory independence from the Under \nSecretary for Acquisition.\n  The Director may communicate directly with the Secretary without \nobtaining the concurrence or approval of any other official.\n  The Director has specific authority over all test and evaluation \nactivities of DOD.\n  Mr. President, those are key provisions. That is the only way you can \nhave an objective official in terms of ensuring that he is not subject \nto the normal bureaucratic pressures of the Pentagon.\n  Under the conference agreement, effective January 31, 1997, there \nwould no longer be an independent Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation. The Secretary of Defense would be free to subordinate the \noperational test and evaluation function under any Under or Assistant \nSecretary--including those with direct responsibility for the \nmanagement of major weapons systems programs--or even relegate it to \nthe military departments.\n  Congress specifically created this position in light of major \nacquisition problems of the late seventies and early eighties so that \nrealistic and independent operational test and evaluation functions \nwould be conducted without direct interference by acquisition \nofficials. Congress wanted to make sure that those who were being \ntested were not also grading their own tests. DOD has never fully \nembraced this position and its independence. Under the House approach, \nnow incorporated in this conference, the key concept of ``Fly before \nyou buy'' will be significantly weakened because this office is in \neffect terminated.\n  This is an ill-considered proposal with no foundation or \njustification. Congress should not be put in the position of having to \nrefight and reinstate this legislation next year. This is an example of \n``Ready, fire, aim'' that I think is destructive to the overall \nfurtherance of our national security. We should not support legislation \nthat cripples this vital organization.\n\n\n  repeal of the statutory requirement for the assistant secretary for \n             special operations and low-intensity conflict\n\n  There is another aspect of the House's DOD reorganization language \nwhich was adopted in conference to which I have similar objections. My \nconcerns relate to the provision that would abolish the requirement to \ndesignate one of the Assistant Secretaries of Defense to be responsible \nfor special operations and low-intensity conflict.\n  Mr. President, in 1986, Congress created the statutory position of \nAssistant Secretary, Special Operations and low-Intensity Conflict as \npart of comprehensive legislation concerning the organization and \nmanagement of special operations forces.\n  The 1986 legislation also established a unified combatant command for \nspecial operations.\n  The CINC was given unique authorities--possessed by no other CINC--\nfor administration, acquisition, and budgeting--authorities that are \nmore akin to the powers of a civilian Service Secretary than a military \nCINC.\n  We specified in law that there be an Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Special Operations in order to ensure adequate civilian control \nover the CINC.\n  The statute specifically makes the Assistant Secretary responsible \nfor ``the overall supervision (including oversight of policy and \nresources) of special operations * * * and low-intensity conflict \nactivities of the Department of Defense.''\n  Senator Cohen, a Republican from Maine, a member of our committee and \nleader for many years, is an expert on this subject of special \noperations. He and I drafted this legislation which was based on the \ndetermination that the subject of special operations was receiving \ninadequate attention by the Office of Secretary of Defense and the \nmilitary departments.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the least expensive parts of our \noverall military forces, but the one that is most likely to be used, \nwhether it is on the cutting edge of a major operation. The special \noperations forces are the best trained military forces we have. They \nare required to operate with great secrecy and great care, and they \nneed civilian supervision. This conference report eliminates that \ncivilian supervision as we had envisioned.\n  The conference report would repeal this requirement to have an \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity \nConflict, effective January 31, 1997. The Office of the Assistant \nSecretary has provided valuable oversight and supervision of an \nactivity that still receives to little attention within the Pentagon. \nThe circumstances that required creation of the position are largely \nunchanged. The Department, again, has not fully embraced the special \noperations reforms and this repeal will energize the enemies of special \noperations.\n\n  When Congress created this position, we were not simply trying to \ngive visibility to an Assistant Secretary. There are significant \nsubstantive differences between the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nSpecial Operations and each of the other Assistant Secretaries. The \nposition of Assistant Secretary for Special Operations is tied directly \nto a unique combatant command that exercises management powers similar \nto those of a civilian Service Secretary. The conference report would \nrepeal that statute, effective January 31, 1997, and remove that direct \ncivilian oversight of the CINC. This, again, was done without \nfoundation and without substantive consideration.\n\n\n     requirement to sell the naval petroleum reserve within 1 year\n\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, the Budget Committee provided \nreconciliation instructions to the Armed Services Committee to achieve \nsavings through sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills within \n1 year. That was because they wanted to raise money for the deficit. \nFaced with that requirement, the committee developed legislation with a \nnumber of safeguards, including provisions that would enable the \nSecretary of Energy to suspend the sale, and to require a subsequent \nvote by the Congress upon a determination that the sale was not \nproceeding in the taxpayer's best interest.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, however, refused to score the \nprovision in the DOD authorization bill as achieving any savings \nbecause CBO believed there was a significant chance that the sale would \nbe suspended and that subsequent legislation would be required. As a \nresult, when the Armed Services Committee submitted its reconciliation \nlegislation to the Budget Committee, the Armed Services Committee, on \nan 11-to-10 vote, recommended to the Budget Committee that the \nreconciliation bill include a different version of the provision \nwithout a number of key safeguards. Those of us who opposed this \nrecommendation expressed great concern about the potential for a huge \nloss to the taxpayers by a rushed sale without sufficient safeguards.\n  Subsequently, CBO estimated that the up-front proceeds from the sale \nwould be $1.5 billion, but the net revenue foregone would be $2.5 \nbillion over the next 7 years--leading to a $1 billion loss. As a \nresult, the requirement to sell the naval petroleum reserve was dropped \nfrom the Senate reconciliation legislation and was not included in the \nreconciliation conference report.\n  We are no longer under a mandate from the Budget Committees on the \nreconciliation process to raise this $1.5 billion. They wisely dropped \nthe provision when the Congressional Budget Office said it could cost \nus money. It could cost us $1 billion. What do we do? The conference \nreport before us today continues to mandate the sale with a year with \nthe option for the Secretary to suspend the sale. It is now out of step \nwith reconciliation and out of step with common sense.\n  Mr. President, because of the budget pressure, there will be \ntremendous incentive for this administration or a subsequent \nadministration at the end of next year, if we have a change of \nadministrations, to sell Elk Hills quickly to meet the deadlines of the \noverall budget and fiscal picture. A 1-year timeframe, I believe, is \nunwise. Right now, there is one company with the potential inside \ntrack. Chevron is a part owner and manager of Elk Hills. There \n\n[[Page S18838]]\nis concern, I think legitimate concern, that a requirement to sell Elk \nHills within 1 year will give that company a tremendous advantage, an \nadvantage that could be reduced by giving other potential bidders \nsufficient time and information to develop competitive bids.\n  Mr. President, since the leadership of the Budget Committee has \nalready decided to drop the sale of Elk Hills from the reconciliation \nbill there is absolutely no need to present with the Secretary of \nEnergy with the choice of either making the sale or losing the \nauthority to sell the NPR. Contrary to the assertions we have heard on \nthe floor, the administration has not recommended a forced sale within \n1 year. The President's budget for fiscal year 1996 clearly states, on \npage 148 that ``The administration proposes to privatize the Elk Hills, \nCA oil and gas fields in 1997 * * *.'' Mr. President, that date is \n1997, not 1996. Likewise, the administration's balanced budget \nproposal, submitted on December 7, 1995, provides for disposition of \nElk Hills ``not later than September 30, 1997.'' Again, an extra year \nso we ensure that we taxpayers get their money's worth out of this \nsale.\n  Mr. President, because the current contractor and co-owner, Chevron, \nhas a potential advantage in terms of the information needed to submit \na realistic bid, it will not be easy to establish a competitive bidding \nand evaluation process that will get the best deal for the taxpayers. \nThere are serious questions about whether the 1-year period is \nsufficient to ensure that the taxpayers get the maximum value through \nknowledgeable competitive bidding. This provision is a loser--\npotentially a $1 billion loser.\n  I find it strange that the same Congressional Budget Office, which \nour Republican majority is insisting we use for its numbers for the \nbudget deal we are talking about, basically says we are possibly or \neven probably going to lose about $1.5 billion on this, but we have it \nin the conference report anyway. I think it is a mistake.\n\n\n                        Buy American provisions\n\n  Mr. President, one of the strongest elements of our export economy is \nthe sale of overseas military equipment. This is an area in which the \nvalue of our sales overseas far exceeds the amount we buy from other \ncountries. This is one of the areas where we have a favorable trade \nbalance. The overall trade balance is unfavorable, but the trade \nbalance in military equipment is favorable. The conference report \nbefore us would expand and impose Buy American restrictions that are \nnot justified by industrial based or arms control considerations. This \nsays that you have to buy these items in America, even if the sales \nfrom our allies abroad or from others are substantially cheaper.\n  This means that when foreign companies cannot bid on American \ncontracts, foreign countries are likely to retaliate by imposing their \nown restrictions on American products, thereby damaging the export \nsector of the United States that currently has a very strong trade \nsurplus and advantage.\n  Section 806 of the conference report contains a buy American \nprovision for components of naval vessels which is, derived from the \nHouse passed bill. The Senate bill, under Senator Thurmond's \nleadership, did not have these buy American provisions. The conference \nreport comes back, and it is absolutely loaded with them.\n  Mr. President, there is ample existing authority for DOD to exclude \nforeign companies from competing on a contract when there is a valid \nindustrial base requirement for domestic producers. That is already the \nlaw. The Department of Defense has not requested any additional \nlegislative authority to impose specific buy American requirements on \nthe components listed in the conference report.\n  There has been no showing of a critical industrial base need that \nwould justify singling out these vessel components, among the hundreds \nof thousands of items procured by the Department of Defense, as \nwarranting protection from competition.\n  The existing buy-American list in title X covers only five items. \nThis is after years and years of struggling. Every year we have had \nbuy-American provisions in the House bill under a Democratic House. \nThis year, nothing has changed under a Republican House as they loaded \nup the report with buy-American provisions. Every year we have held \nfirm. We have said, ``No, it's bad government, it's bad for the \ntaxpayers, and it's a bad deal for the military.''\n  We are going to spend more money, get less national security, and \nhurt our exporters. This is particularly true with the aerospace \nindustry, because they are indeed the best in the world.\n  We have five items in title X: buses; a chemical weapons antidote; \nair circuit breakers for vessels; specified valves and machine tools; \nand ball bearings and roller bearings, which may be affected.\n  I am not here to debate those items. They are in there. They were put \nin the report at one time or another.\n  The conference agreement, without any justification that I can see \nand in contradiction to bipartisan opposition to similar positions in \npast conferences, would add the following items:\n  First, ``welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain with a diameter of \n4 inches or less.''\n  Second, ``vessel propellers with a diameter of 6 feet or more.''\n  You cannot buy those anywhere except in America and, in some cases, \nthere is only one contractor in America. Only one. What you are doing, \nin some cases--not all--is locking in sole-source procurement by law \nand eliminating competition.\n  Third, the following vessel components having unique marine \napplications: gyrocompasses; electronic navigation chart systems; \nsteering controls; pumps; propulsion and machinery control systems; and \ntotally enclosed life boats.\n  All of those are going to have no competition from abroad.\n  In addition, the proposal would not only extend the expiring buy-\nAmerican requirements for ball bearings and roller bearings, but would \nexpand it to cover all purchases, even those below the $100,000 \nsimplified acquisition threshold. That directly undermines one of the \nkey goals of last year's Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act: removal \nof special interest protection and paperwork for all purchases of \n$100,000 or less.\n  Mr. President, I find it a supreme irony that a Republican majority \nin the House and Senate, which committed at least rhetorically to free \ntrade and market competition, would inject the most sweeping buy-\nAmerican provisions we have ever placed in a defense authorization bill \nsince I have been in the Senate. This will damage the U.S. defense \nindustry, it will damage our trade position, and it will damage the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Sure, it will benefit a few companies. They will do well because they \nwill not have any competition. Some people in the House, I suppose, \nwill be able to go back and say in their districts, ``Look what we've \ndone for you. You're going to get these Government contracts.'' Our \nresponsibility is beyond one company in one district. It is the overall \ngood of America and our national security. In this case, this \nconference report flunks that test.\n  I recognize the Secretary currently has authority to waive \nbuy American requirements under a number of conditions, such as when \nthere would be unreasonable costs or delays or there would be an \nadverse effect on national security. The conference agreement would \nslightly expand that authority by allowing the Secretary to use it to \navoid retaliatory trade actions by a foreign nation. However, the \nwaiver authority is very difficult for the Secretary of Defense to \nexercise.\n\n  I think it is irresponsible to place a Secretary in the position of \nmediating between political pressures to impose restrictions on the one \nhand and a combination of foreign and domestic pressures to promote \nfree trade on the other hand. We are the board of directors. We should \nnot put the executive in charge of the Department of Defense in that \nposition. The waiver authority puts the Secretary in an extremely \ndifficult position, because there is substantial pressure not to use \nthe waiver from the very same sources that insisted on putting the \nprovisions in law in the first place.\n  Moreover, the retaliatory action from a foreign nation may well come \nafter a buy-American provision is imposed rather than beforehand, and \nthe Secretary's waiver authority, in terms of retaliatory trade, would \nbe useless \n\n[[Page S18839]]\nin this case. That is the way it would normally happen. The waiver \nauthority has to be anticipatory.\n  For example, we may impose a buy-American provision on a vessel \ncomponent only to find later that a foreign government has imposed a \ndomestic-source requirement that hurts our aircraft exports. In the \nabsence of a compelling case to impose the costs and burdens of \nrestricting competition, we should avoid adding new items to the buy-\nAmerican restrictions list.\n  A more onerous buy-American provision is set forth in the bill's \nauthority to use sealift funds to purchase vessels for the National \nDefense Reserve Fleet. Unlike the buy-American provision that applies \nto components which I previously discussed, the position governing \nNational Defense Reserve Fleets has no waiver authority. As a result, \nDOD will be precluded, under this conference report, from purchasing \nforeign vessels for the five additional roll-on/roll-off ships called \nfor in the mobility requirement study, despite the fact that there \nwould be major savings to the U.S. taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the Maritime Administration has been purchasing \nforeign-built ships and upgrading them in U.S. shipyards. It is not \nlike we are not getting a good portion of the work. We are.\n  The cost to purchase and upgrade this type of ship is about $30 \nmillion each. This means we could obtain the five additional ships for \nabout $150 million. Building new U.S. ships will cost $200 million to \n$250 million each, for a total cost of $1 billion to $1.5 billion for \nfive ships. I think the Senate ought to recognize this is basically \ntaking taxpayers' money and simply giving it to certain defense \nindustries in this country. If you want to do that, that is fine, but \neverybody ought to acknowledge that is what is happening. That means \nthe taxpayers could be paying an additional $1 billion or more without \nany increase in Navy capability. This provision is, simply put, a \nsweetheart deal for certain domestic shipbuilders.\n  Alternatively, the cost could be so high that the Navy may forego \npurchasing enough ships to meet the mobility requirements. Either we \nare going to cost the taxpayers about $1 billion here or we are going \nto buy less ships and not have the mobility requirements for our own \nmilitary forces. That is bad for the taxpayers and bad for our national \ndefense.\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.)\n\n\n                               Earmarking\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the next area I am concerned about relates \nto earmarking. I have been one of the leaders, and the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, has also been a real leader, in trying to \nprevent earmarking. Usually it has been in the appropriations bill. \nTime after time after time, we have come to the floor and opposed these \nitems in appropriations bills. One time, I even voted against the \nentire appropriations bill, as the Senator from West Virginia may \nrecall, because it was full of earmarks.\n  We in the authorization committee have not been perfect, but we have \nstrived not to have earmarks in these bills. That has been a long \npractice of our Armed Services Committee. We provide appropriate \nguidance under development and procurement of major weapons systems and \nleave to the executive branch the process of awarding contracts. We do \nnot get into micro- management. We try not to micromanage. This bill is \ncrammed full of micromanagement, and I find this supremely ironic, \nhaving seen Secretary Cheney, Secretary Carlucci, and Secretary \nWeinberger, those Secretaries under Republican administrations, \ncomplain over and over again about congressional micromanagement of the \nDefense Department.\n  This bill goes further in micromanagement than any bill I have seen. \nWe have done this to ensure, in terms of our practices, that the \nGovernment achieves the best price and quality based upon bids and \nproposals reviewed under merit-based criteria. We have endeavored to \navoid legislation and conference report language which earmarks \nspecific contracts to specific contractors.\n  We have avoided earmarking because there is too great a danger that \nawards under such a system will be based on political and parochial \nconsiderations rather than the best interest of national defense and \nthe taxpayers.\n  I am very concerned about the shipbuilding provisions of the \nconference report which could lead to substantial unnecessary \nexpenditure for the procurement of naval vessels. The conference report \nhas translated, I think, an innovative Senate concept, which makes \nsense under very unique circumstances. The concept would provide more \nships within the same cost projections that was developed by Senators \nLott, Cohen, and others--into something that was not what they \nenvisioned when they started; that is, a shipbuilding grab bag with \nsomething for everyone.\n  Section 1013 of the bill has the effect of directing the procurement \nof two additional large, medium-speed roll-on/roll-off ships, known as \nLMSR vessels, at specific shipyards. Likewise, section 135 has the \neffect of directing procurement of six destroyers to specific \nshipyards. In the absence of a clear industrial base requirement--and I \nhave seen no such showing--these sole-source-directed procurement \nsituations undermine the cost-saving potential of competition. Again, I \nregret to say, these are sweetheart deals for certain shipyards.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we are striving to get the taxpayers' \nfiscal budget under control and the national budget under control, I \nfind it very, very paradoxical that we are setting up this competition \nwith earmarks with sole-source-directed procurement going to certain \nshipyards and making certain these companies are happy at the expense \nof both taxpayers and national security.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned that section 1016 of the bill has \nthe effect of earmarking a ship maintenance contract for a specific \nshipyard. Once we start down this route, other shipyards, as well as \nrepair and maintenance contractors for aircraft and vehicles, will \ncertainly want their share of these directed, noncompetitive contracts. \nThe Competition in Contracting Act is designed to save money through \neffective competition. From time to time, there are exceptions which \ncan be justified on the merits, in terms of industrial base \nconsiderations. Those decisions should be made on the basis of sound \nanalysis and thorough consideration of executive branch views, not on \nthe basis of a conference with legislated earmarks. This earmark is not \nmeritorious and, again, I can only describe it as a sweetheart deal for \na certain shipyard.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about title 31 of the bill, which \ncovers the Department of Energy defense programs. Section 3133, 3135, \n3137, 3140, and 3142 and the associated statement of managers language \nprovide funds--many not requested by the administration--for \ndevelopment of technologies and other programs at specify Department of \nEnergy sites instead of allowing the Department to determine which \nsite, on the merits, would be the best location for conduct of the \nprogram. Hundreds of millions of dollars are so allocated in the DOE \nsection of this bill.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the numerous earmarks in this bill far \nexceed the tolerance level of anything justified in the ``give and \ntake'' of a conference. It sets the authorizing committee on a bad \npolicy path that we have studiously avoided and that we should not \nstart now. We have objected when the Appropriations Committee has done \nthis over and over. I spent literally hours out here at night, late in \na session, objecting to earmarks in appropriations bills under \nDemocratic control of the Congress. Now, I find that we do it over and \nover again in our own authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, aside from shipbuilding earmarks, I am troubled by the \nsubmarine research and development language. Section 132 of the bill \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to design, develop, and procure four \nnuclear attack submarines using ``new technologies that will result in \neach successive submarine * * * being a more capable and more \naffordable submarine than the submarine that preceded it.'' There is no \nrecognition in the language of the costs and risks of transforming the \nsubmarine procurement program into a research and development prototype \nendeavor.\n  No one argues with the goal of having military equipment that is both \n\n\n[[Page S18840]]\nmore capable and more affordable. Experience demonstrates that when \ndealing with complicated systems and advanced technology, it is quite \ndifficult to obtain greater capability at less cost. The Russians, for \nexample, tried to increase the capability while cutting costs of their \nsubmarines, and several of the products of that effort, along with \ntheir crews, lay at the bottom of the ocean.\n  New attack submarines are among the most complex and sophisticated \nsystems procured by the Department of Defense. It is one thing to \nestablish a goal--there is no problem with a goal--it is something very \ndifferent to require the Navy to structure its program to make new \nsubmarines both better and cheaper without any concern for the \ndifficulty of trying to achieve greater capability at less cost and \nwithout any consideration of the risk involved. I believe it is \nimportant that the language of the submarine research provision be \nreviewed and revised to ensure greater consideration of the tradeoff \nbetween cost and risk.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned that the conference contains a \nspending ``floor,'' which mandates that $50 million of the funds in the \nNational Defense Sealift Fund can be used only for advanced submarine \ntechnology activities of the Advanced Procurement Projects Agency. Mr. \nPresident, for a long time, this authorizing committee has strenuously \navoided putting floors in bills. We always felt we were the ceiling; \nappropriators should not go over our ceiling. Neither should we say \nthey cannot spend less than a certain amount, because that basically \nundercuts the appropriations process. It says to the appropriators that \nyou cannot spend less than a certain amount. We would object to the \nappropriators going over our ceiling and have tried to avoid having \nfloors in our bill. In this case, we have a floor of $50 million. In \nfairness, because of my past work with Senator Byrd, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, and my pledge to him that we would try to avoid these \nitems, I feel I need to point out the floors that is in this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, on National Guard and Reserve procurement, the \nconference report provides $777 million for Guard and Reserve \nprocurement, allocating all funding to specific line items. This is an \nunfortunate reversion to the way we added funds for the Guard and \nReserve years ago. This is not a breakthrough. It has been done before, \nand it was a mistake. Now, we are repeating that mistake. In recent \nyears, we have gotten away from specific earmarks, and we have \nauthorized various portions of the Guard and Reserve procurement \naccount in a ``miscellaneous equipment'' category. This served two \npurposes. First, it provided the Defense Department with the \nflexibility to allocate the funds to DOD's highest-priority \nrequirements without going through a lengthy reprogramming process. \nTwo, it avoided placing Congress in the position of picking literally \nhundreds of ``winners and losers'' from a long list of items that have \nnot been subjected to any merit-based review within the Department of \nDefense. In other words, this is an added package for the National \nGuard and Reserve. These items have not gone through the procurement \nprocess or any review by the Department of Defense, but we are picking \nthe items in this report in great detail. I think that is a mistake.\n  In this conference report, nothing is provided for the generic \n``miscellaneous'' account. As a result, the conference treatment of \nGuard and Reserve procurement is, I believe, worse than either of the \ntwo original bills.\n  I note again that this earmarking of every dime in the Guard and \nReserve procurement fund departs from the policy followed in recent \nauthorizations and appropriations acts. In fact, the fiscal year 1996 \nDefense Appropriation Act provides $777 million for Guard and Reserve \nprocurement, with $377 million--about half of it--provided for \nmiscellaneous procurement. In this area, the appropriation bill has a \nfar better ``good Government'' approach than does the authorization \nconference report before us today. I say this as one who has been on \nthe Senate floor many times criticizing the appropriations bill. In \nfairness, I have to point out that we are doing now what we have \naccused others of doing in the past.\n  Although I and a number of other Senators voted for Senator Levin's \namendment to the Senate bill that would have restored the generic \nnature of the funding, this amendment failed. I accept the fact that \nthe Senate decided to use a different approach, but I note that even \nunder the Senate-passed bill, $65 million was allocated for \nmiscellaneous procurement. Because there is not a single dollar left in \na miscellaneous category in this bill, the Department will have \nabsolutely no flexibility to determine the priorities for purchasing \nadditional equipment for the Guard and Reserve--even though the \nappropriators provided that flexibility.\n  Mr. President, in closing my remarks, there are several items of \nparticular concern to the Clinton administration that I think Members \nwould at least like to know about.\n  The conference report contains permanent restrictions on access of \nservicewomen and dependents overseas to privately-funded abortions and \nrestrictions on service by HIV-positive service members, both of which \nare objectionable to the administration. The administration has written \nletters on these points.\n  The administration also objects to use of the power of the purse to \nlimit the authority of the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to place \nU.S. forces under U.N. command and control. In addition, the \nadministration objects to the portion of the contingency funding \nprovision that would require the President to submit a supplemental \nappropriations request to replenish funds used for contingency \noperations.\n   Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support this conference \nreport. I know it means a great deal to Senator Thurmond and the other \nmembers of the committee and I understand their feeling. I know \nfirsthand the feeling. There are many provisions in the bill which \nshould be enacted into law. But there are many, many more which should \nnot. If this legislation is vetoed by the President as has been \nrecommended by his senior advisers, we will have an opportunity to \ncorrect the many flaws in the bill and produce an authorization bill \nthat can be signed into law. I believe it is important for us to do so. \nI pledge to continue to work toward passage of a subsequent bill if the \nlegislation in this conference report is not enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, could I be informed how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have 15 minutes which will be more than I need and I am \nhappy to yield some to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia but I will wait.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I shall \nrequire for the time under my control. It will not be 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, this Fiscal Year 1996 Defense Authorization Conference \nReport contains many needed and worthwhile provisions. A pay raise and \nraise in the Basic Allowance for Quarters for our active duty military \npersonnel, and new authorities for more competitive and efficient \nhousing renewal programs to improve the often poor quality of living \nfor military personnel and their families, are among the highlights of \nthis bill.\n  Like the able Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], I believe that this \nbill is going to be vetoed. As a matter of fact, it is a virtual \ncertainty. I am concerned that the pay raise and the key time-sensitive \nauthorities for raises and other benefits contained in the bill that \nmust be passed by January 1, 1996, be passed on another vehicle this \nweek such as a continuing resolution. We cannot very well be endorsing \nthe deployment of troops to Bosnia and then follow-up by denying them \ntheir pay raise.\n  I am also glad that the contingency force of SR-71 reconnaissance \naircraft is authorized for another year, and is fully appropriated in a \nbill that the President has already signed. I hope that our military \ncommanders in Bosnia will put the SR-71 to work thus providing \nintelligence to our forces there as soon as possible. But on balance, I \nbelieve, this bill contains more problematical and wasteful provisions \nthan it should. \n\n[[Page S18841]]\n\n  Most importantly, this bill is almost $7 billion over the President's \nrequest. In addition, this bill authorizes almost $500 million for \nadditional spending on the B-2 bomber program. The Senate had stripped \nout funding for additional spending on B-2 bombers from its version of \nthe Defense authorization bill, but like Dracula, the B-2 bomber shows \nan uncanny ability to rise night after night from the coffin. This $500 \nmillion was not requested by the Department of Defense. If the B-2 \nproduction line is to be reopened, as some appear determined to make \nhappen, then many more billions will be needed in future budgets. These \nfunds will have to be carved out of other procurement programs, \nprograms that carry a much higher priority with the officials in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  This conference report also contains incremental funding for a number \nof expensive ships that were not requested by the Department of Defense \nin this bill, and were not scheduled to be constructed until years in \nthe future. So, we will put down payments on ships we do not yet need, \nand worry about how to complete the payments for the rest of the ship \nlater. The attitude here seems to be taken directly from Scarlett \nO'Hara: ``I'll worry about that tomorrow.'' Furthermore, the \nshipbuilding provisions in this bill direct work to specific shipyards \nwithout a clear industrial base requirement, which undermines the cost-\nsaving potential of competition.\n  The ballistic missile defense provisions in the conference report \nalso go well beyond the Senate-passed compromise on this issue. That \ncompromise, which was still farther-reaching that I and other Senators \nwould have preferred, would have moderated the rush to build and field \nuntested ballistic missile defenses on an accelerated schedule that \ncould undermine ongoing efforts to further reduce Russian nuclear \nweapons reduction efforts. The conference report language again raises \nconcerns that far more cost-effective defensive measures, which reduce \nthe threat by reducing numbers of weapons, have been undermined, \nthereby increasing the threat by possibly igniting a new arms race. \nThere is no current need that warrants accelerated spending on \nballistic missile programs.\n  This bill also provides $30 million to restart the anti-satellite \n[ASAT] program, a program that had been terminated even during the cold \nwar. Mr. President, we should not be renewing efforts to restart an \narms race in space. The United States, which is so dependent on \nsatellite-transmitted communications for civilian and military \noperations, should be an arms control leader in the space arena.\n  Mr. President, because of these and other policy issues contained in \nthe conference report, I cannot support it. I understand that the \nSecretary of Defense has recommended that the President consider \nvetoing it, and I concur in that recommendation, although I regret the \ndelay in implementing the many good provisions contained in this bill. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee on next year's bill. I hope we can craft a bill next year \nthat enjoys broad support, and that does not continue on a path to \ngreater defense build-ups during a time when all other spending \ncontinues to decline.\n  Like Senator Nunn, I believe this bill is going to be vetoed. It is a \nvirtual certainty. I am concerned that the pay raise and key time \nsensitive authorities for raises and other benefits contained in this \nbill, which must be passed by January 1, 1996, be passed on another \nvehicle this week, such as a continuing resolution. We cannot very well \nbe endorsing the deployment of troops to Bosnia and follow up by \ndenying them their pay raise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we consider the conference report to \naccompany the fiscal year 1996 national defense authorization bill, it \nis imperative to put aside recent partisan criticism of the bill and \nremember that this legislation contains a significant number of \nprovisions that will benefit our men and women in uniform, many of whom \nare being sent to Bosnia by our President. In view of the dangers our \nforces will meet in Bosnia and the hardships their families will endure \nduring the holiday season, it is incredible to believe that many would \nput politics above the interest of the Nation.\n  I point out just a few of the provisions beneficial to the Members of \nour Armed Forces and their families. This is not all of them, this is \njust a few I am going to mention.\n  The full military pay raise, if you kill this bill, they will not get \nthe pay raise; increase in quarters allowance, that is badly needed; \nauthority to pay a family separation allowance to geographically \nseparated families. This is important; authority to pay enlisted airmen \nhazardous duty incentive pay; authority to pay dislocation allowance to \nthose forced to move as a result of base closure; increase specialty \npay for recruiters; automatic maximum coverage under the Servicemen's \nGroup Life Insurance; cost of living COLA equity for military retirees;\n  Reserve components initiatives: Authorized a reserve component dental \ninsurance program; and established an income insurance program for \nreservists who are involuntarily mobilized.\n  Mr. President, all of these are good things. These are things the \nservicemen want. These are things the soldiers want. You kill this \nbill, you will destroy all this. During the Senate-House conference \nthat considered the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill, we \nconducted bipartisan negotiations with members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, the House of Representatives Committee on National \nSecurity, and included representatives of the Department of Defense and \nWhite House staff in an effort to craft a bill that would be acceptable \nto all.\n\n  We conferred with all these people. We did the very best we could to \nget a bill that would be acceptable to everybody concerned here.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can pass this conference report in the \nsame bipartisan manner. I urge Members to come to the floor, debate the \nissues, and then give this conference report the strong support it \ndeserves.\n\n\n                        Naval Petroleum Reserves\n\n  Mr. President, while I am on the floor, I observe that my good \nfriend, Senator Nunn referred to the naval petroleum reserves and \nindicated the Government would not be protected properly under this \nbill. That is incorrect.\n  I want to say this.\n  The conference agreement on the sale of Naval Petroleum Reserves \ncontains a number of safeguards to ensure that the Federal Government \nreceives full value. Among these safeguards are the following two \nclauses which clearly spell out the conferees' intent that the reserves \ncan be sold only if this will result in the highest return to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The first is the mandated minimum acceptable price. This price will \nbe established by five independent experts who shall consider: all \nequipment and facilities to be included in the sale, the estimated \nquantity of petroleum and natural gas in the reserve, and the net \npresent value of the anticipated revenue stream that the Treasury would \nreceive from the reserve if the reserve were not sold. The Secretary \nmay not set the minimum acceptable price below the higher of the \naverage of the five assessments; and the average of three assessments \nafter excluding the high and low assessments.\n  This requirement ensures that the minimum acceptable price has to be \nat least as high as what the Government would receive for these \nreserves if any other course of action is taken including the \nestablishment of a Government corporation, the leasing of the reserves, \nor the continuation of the current operation of the field.\n  The second key clause is the authority to suspend the sale. This \nclause gives the Secretary the authority to suspend the sale of NPR-1 \nif the Secretary and the Director of OMB jointly determine that the \nsale is proceeding in a manner inconsistent with achievement of a sale \nprice that reflects the full value of the reserve; or a course of \naction other than the immediate sale of the reserve to be in the best \ninterests of the United States.\n  Mr. President, these two clauses essentially mean that NPR-1 cannot \nbe sold unless the Government gets a price for the field that exceeds \nthe value that would be achieved by any other option, and that the \nentire sale proceed in a manner that is in the best interests of the \nUnited States. \n\n[[Page S18842]]\n\n  The sale will provide an estimated $1.5 to $2.5 billion to the \nFederal Treasury. This does not include the several hundred million \ndollars that the Government will receive in increased tax revenues. \nWhat is more, the Government will save about $1 billion in operating \ncosts over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, the sale of these reserves was initiated--and I want \nto remind my friends on the Democratic side of this--by the \nadministration, and, in fact, the administration has come out in \nsupport of this provision. We have worked in a very bipartisan manner \nto draft this provision so as to incorporate the maximum safeguards \npossible. I hope that we can continue this bipartisanship and vote to \napprove the conference agreement which includes this provision.\n  So, our Government is thoroughly protected under this bill in the \nmatter of the petroleum reserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require.\n  I rise today to offer some remarks concerning the Department of \nDefense conference report now being considered by the Senate.\n  I join Senator Nunn in his comments earlier today on the Senate floor \nhere, in complimenting our committee chairman, Senator Thurmond, the \nstaffs, and those who have worked a long time on this bill.\n  I do not like to see charges of partisanship leaking into this year's \ndebate because I have been a Member of the Senate for some 21 years, a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee since 1985, and I have not \nalways agreed with every line-item spending decision or every word of \nlegislation included in past defense authorization and appropriations \nbills during my tenure here. Mr. President, I have supported those \nmeasures without regard to who controlled the Senate or who controlled \nthe White House. I can say that without any qualms of conscience \nwhatsoever. What I have worked for here is what is best for the United \nStates of America and what is best for the security of the United \nStates of America and our interests all around the world.\n  I understood in the past that I would not agree with every item, but \noverall these bills have included, on balance, more positive aspects, \nso I could go ahead and vote for them.\n  Much has been made of the fact that this bill does have some very, \nvery good things in it with regard to pay, with regard to housing, with \nregard to aviation retention pay and some things like that. I support \nthose items fully. I think we can still get those passed, even if this \nbill were not approved on the floor. I am already a cosponsor of an \namendment to the continuing resolution that is being proposed to \nprovide for those things, whether they are in this bill or not. So that \nwill take care of some of those concerns.\n  But, having said that, it is with much regret--it really is with \nregret--I find I must oppose this year's authorization conference \nreport. I never before in all the time I have been in the Senate have \nopposed authorization and appropriations bills for defense and I very \nmuch regret that I had to this year. I voted against the Senate version \nof this bill and gave my reasons here on the floor and had hoped the \nbill could be improved in conference. Unfortunately, I do not believe \nthat is the case. I believe the bill is not as good as the Senate bill \nthat we sent to conference. So, for the first time in over 2 decades, I \nwill vote against a defense authorization conference report. Let me \njust enumerate some of the reasons why.\n  One of the top items in my estimation is that the carefully-crafted \nABM language in the Senate bill, which we worked on very hard, and was \nonly marginally supportable for many of us in the first place, has been \nmade unacceptable. That is a very, very important item. This involves \nour balance of missiles around the world, and the conference report at \nthe very least gives the appearance that the United States intends to \nunilaterally violate the ABM Treaty.\n  On August 2, 1995, I discussed at some length my concerns over the \nversion of the fiscal 1996 defense bill that was voted out of the Armed \nServices Committee. In that statement I described several problems with \nthe bill's language on ballistic missile defense. Because the bill \nbefore the Senate today, I very much regret to say, does nothing to \nalleviate my concerns on this crucial issue--and I do term this a \ncrucial issue--I must rise to speak, once again, against this ill-\nadvised language.\n  March 5 of this year marked the 25th anniversary of the entry into \nforce of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, better \nknown as the NPT. Thanks to some good diplomatic work by the Clinton \nadministration, a task made all the easier by the good basic sense of \nthe diplomatic objective, the United States succeeded in achieving its \nlongstanding goal of securing unconditionally the unlimited extension \nof this treaty. No more of the 5-year things, where the NPT review had \nto meet every 5 years and decide whether we are going to go ahead with \nsomething like a nonproliferation treaty. This year the United States \ntook the lead in pushing for, and was successful in getting \nunconditionally, the unlimited extension of this treaty. That was a \nmajor step.\n  So, the primary purpose of that treaty is to curb the global spread \nof nuclear weapons. Article VI of the treaty commits the United States \nand other parties to make good-faith efforts relating to what the \ntreaty calls the ``cessation of the nuclear arms race,'' something I \nhave fought for ever since I have been in the Senate, some 21 years. It \nstarted clear back in 1978, with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act that \nI was the author of.\n  Fortunately, here, too, the administration deserves some credit for \nits efforts on behalf of the START II treaty which the Senate should \nvote to ratify very soon. The START II treaty will substantially reduce \nthe nuclear stockpiles of the United States and Russia, and will \neliminate altogether not just the last of Russia's heavy nuclear \nICBM's, the SS-18, but will also eliminate the most destabilizing \nweapons, land-based ICBM's with MIRV's, the multiple independently \ntargeted nuclear warheads. These are known as MIRV's.\n  In achieving these goals, America will take a long step in fulfilling \nits key arms control obligation under the NPT. Yet, START II does not \ndeserve to be ratified just because it is consistent with America's \nclear international obligations under the NPT.\n  The real reason all Americans should support the START II treaty is \nthe most basic one. It serves the national security interests of our \ncountry. It serves our interests.\n  Amid all of this progress on the NPT and START II fronts the new \nmajorities of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House \nNational Security Committee have inserted language into the current \ndefense bill that will put America on a path, as I view it, out of the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This treaty prevents both the United \nStates and Russia from deploying a national missile defense against \nstrategic nuclear attack, and in doing so the treaty has helped to lay \nthe foundation for these deep cuts in the nuclear stockpiles. \nFurthermore, the treaty itself is holding down the enormous costs of \nmaintaining the U.S. nuclear deterrent. The lack of a Russian defense \nagainst strategic United States nuclear missiles means that we can \naccomplish much more with less. If Russia is permitted to deploy a \ndefense against such missiles, as it would if the ABM Treaty should \ncollapse, we will end up having to spend a whole lot more for a whole \nlot less security.\n  I have no doubt that Russia's political, military, and parliamentary \nleadership will view the language in this bill as an assault on the ABM \nTreaty. It is an action which would only create new incentives for \nRussia to reassess, or even abandon, its arms reduction obligations \nunder START II. How the Congress could be seriously considering pulling \nAmerica out of the ABM Treaty given the likely reaction such a step \nwould trigger in Russia is a mystery to me. It is a recipe for \nrekindling a strategic nuclear arms race. Surely, the gains to U.S. \nsecurity by retaining a strong U.S. commitment to the ABM Treaty \noverride any gain from the costly and dubious missile defense scheme \noffered in this bill. \n\n[[Page S18843]]\n\n  Specifically, the bill requires deployment of a national missile \ndefense system by a fixed date. I repeat that. It requires the \ndeployment of a national missile defense system by a fixed date. Let me \ntell you how ludicrous that is just on the surface. The system has not \nbeen invented yet. Yet, we require that these scientific breakthroughs \nthat would let us even put up a missile defense system that would be \nhalfway capable have not even been invented yet, and, yet, we are \nrequiring a date certain for it to be deployed.\n  It requires the deployment of ABM systems that are not permissible \nunder the current treaty. It includes a unilateral definition of ABM \nsystems that can be developed in a treaty. The Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili has warned that such a \nstatutory definition could jeopardize the prospects for early \nratification of the START II treaty in Russia and negatively impact our \nbroader security relationships with Russia.\n  The missile defense language in this bill will lead not only to \nmassive expenditures on missile defense systems that will never prove \nto be 100 percent effective but will eventually lead to even more \nmassive expenditures--not just of public funds, but also of diplomatic \ncapital, I might add--on offensive nuclear weapon capabilities. We will \nneed to deal with a Russian strategic missile defense system. Whether \none looks at the budgetary, or the strategic implications of this \nlanguage, the results of such an examination I just think can only be \ntermed ``foolishness.''\n  I would like to work with the new majority on the Armed Services \nCommittee to address missile threats in a way that does not destroy the \nABM Treaty. But I see little indication on this bill, or elsewhere, \nthat the majority is interested in investing in prevention of missile \nproliferation. Instead, they want to pour out pounds or megatons of \nfallacious cures. What the majority should be proposing are new \nmeasures to prevent missile proliferation from occurring in the first \nplace as opposed to shelling out tax dollars on sophisticated hardware \nand software to deal with--or, more accurately, pretend to deal with--\nthe problem after the fact. As I see it, this is a solution out looking \nfor a problem because we do not have all the threats from abroad that \nwe used to have. I will go into that in just a few moments.\n  Congress's new majority is proposing nothing, for example, to ensure \nthat U.S. missile proliferation sanctions are strengthened and \nimplemented in a manner that serves as an effective deterrent to \nproliferation. I see nothing to indicate a new effort to strengthen \nexport controls--for example, something I have long advocated and put \nin legislation and had passed--or to encourage measures to strengthen \nthe MTCR, the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n  Meanwhile, in this--what I view as a meat-ax approach to budget \nreduction--the State Department funds are being chopped back so that \neven fewer resources will be available for the pursuit of diplomatic \nmeasures aimed at halting nuclear and missile proliferation. Many in \nthis new majority continue to seek the elimination of ACDA, the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency, which has worked hard over the years to \nstrengthen U.S. policies in just these areas.\n  In their zeal to inveigle our country out of the ABM Treaty, the new \nmajority continues to tout an alleged missile threat from what they \ncall rogue nations out there lurking somewhere in anticipation of \nlaunching ICBM's against targets in the United States. This whole rogue \nnation argument is simply an old-fashioned red herring. It a \ndistraction from actions that are really needed to strengthen our \nnational defense. Indeed, rogue nations may pose less of a threat to us \nthan rogue defense bills like some of the provisions in this one that \nwe have here today.\n  I have noted several times the testimony before the Select Committee \non Intelligence, of which I am a member, of the former director of the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General James Clapper, on this \nmissile threat. He stated last January that ``We see no interest in or \ncapability of any new country reaching the continental United States \nwith a long-range missile for at least the next decade.''\n  In correspondence dated December 1, 1995, the CIA informed Senators \nLevin and Bumpers that the missile threat as identified in this bill \nwas overstated. Though I fully agree with the CIA assessment, the \nagency could well have gone further by noting that, contrary to a \npopular belief, missiles are not proliferating in the world today. \nIndeed, in some important respects there has been a decline in certain \ntypes of missile proliferation threats. Over the years, we have seen \nthe elimination of long-range missile programs in Brazil, Argentina, \nand South Africa. The Iraqi missile program has been destroyed. Egypt's \nefforts to build a long-range missile program has been terminated, and \nnobody seriously believes that Libya will have an ICBM capability any \ntime soon. In the INF Treaty, the United States and Russia agreed to \neliminate a whole class of missiles, and the START treaties have cut \nback substantially the numbers of nuclear ICBMs. When looking at \nmissile programs that remain in the Middle East, South Asia, and East \nAsia, it is obvious that there is a global missile proliferation threat \nthat must be addressed. Indeed, we could soon be witnessing robust \nmissile races in at least two of these theaters, if they are not \nunderway already.\n  But do these developments justify a U.S. walkout from the ABM Treaty? \nOf course, not. On the contrary, we should ask the following: Do these \ndevelopments justify an increased U.S. effort to enhance its \nintelligence capabilities, both analysis and collection; to strengthen \nexport controls, both licensing and enforcement; to implement \nsanctions, both to punish and to deter; to ensure that our diplomats \nhave the resources they need to roll back these programs; and, to \nensure the readiness of U.S. forces that are deployed abroad to defend \nthemselves against tactical missile attacks? Yes to every one of the \nabove, especially the last.\n  I want to see our defenses for our frontline troops, and those who \nmay be in a combat's way, protected against the tactical missile \nattacks.\n  But, nevertheless, I remain an optimist. I am hopeful that the new \nmajority will someday come around to the view that Star Wars is not the \npanacea to proliferation. Indeed, a Star Wars we have yet to invent \ncannot be placed in place by a certain time because we have not \ninvented all of it yet. We know from our star wars experience before \nthat it is a bigger problem than anybody thought it was going to be \nback in those days.\n\n  When they do, I will be ready to work with them to get our \nnonproliferation and arms control policies back on track. Judging from \nthe content of this bill before us today, that day has clearly not \narrived. So I remain firmly and unalterably opposed to this misguided \nmissile defense legislation. I urge all my colleagues to join me in \npressing this opposition for as long as it takes to restore some sanity \nto this program.\n  Mr. President, I note for my colleagues that in my view this language \nis reason enough alone to oppose passage of the conference report. \nThere are other reasons as well. This bill had $7 billion added above \nand beyond what the administration requested--one of the main reasons \nwhy I voted against it going in, before it went to conference.\n  If that money had gone to operation and maintenance accounts where it \nis needed, if it had gone to pay all of our bills from peacekeeping \noperations already passed, which is somewhere around $2 billion, if it \nhad gone for programs like that and things that we really need, depot \nmaintenance, things like that where we are behind and did not have \nadequate budget provided, then I would not have objected. I would have \nsaid fine, we needed that and the administration should have requested \nit to begin with. But that is not where the added $7 billion additional \nwent.\n  One-half a billion dollars is unrequested and unwelcome B-2 funding \nthat can be used to start new production and was brought back from \nconference, and another one-half a billion dollars was added to the \nnational missile defense account. These two funding decisions are \nmerely downpayments on huge programs in the outyears. And they make a \nmockery of the desire to balance the budget and eliminate deficit \nspending. We have part of the Government shut down here arguing over \nthe budget, \n\n[[Page S18844]]\nwhether we are going to be able to get a balanced budget. Then we have \nadd-ons like this for things that were not needed at all, and they are \ndownpayments on huge programs in the outyears.\n  If these programs alone go forward, the funding contained in this \nconference report represents a commitment to many, many more billions \nout there in the future. I think just the national missile defense \nprogram in the outyears requires outlays by one estimate of at least \n$43 billion, if we carry it out as it has been spoken of. I cannot \nsupport wasting precious taxpayer dollars on the B-2, for instance, \nthat is well over half a billion a copy. That is taking out even all of \nthe sunk costs of the past. And we know that every time we have made an \nestimate in the past on the B-2 it has gone up. One of the estimates \nwas above half a billion per copy. It is around $650 to $700 million \nright now, if you figure all the costs that have to go into hangars and \nthings like that for each airplane that is produced.\n  The plane is an aerodynamic wonder. It truly is. I had the pleasure \nof going out and flying it not long ago. It is one that has cleared the \nhurdles that we in the Armed Services Committee put in to make sure \nthat this unique airplane would indeed pass all of its aerodynamic \ntests. It does not have a rudder up there. You never see a vertical \nsurface on that airplane. It meets all the different aerodynamic \nrequirements in how you control it, and it is an aerodynamic marvel, I \ncan guarantee you that. It flies beautifully. But when you put between \nhalf a billion and $1 billion per plane, it just is too much.\n  Once again, I would say what we have provided here is something that \nis not required, not necessary, and is another solution looking for a \nproblem. We have bombers that the Air Force has said are adequate when \nwe combine what we have with the B-2's already produced or provided for \nand the B-1's. Those give us enough bomber capability to meet any \nthreat we see right now.\n  Overall, the funding level in this conference report is too high and \nthe bulk of the funds will be spent in the procurement accounts, not on \nitems requested by the Pentagon, not on requirements of the President's \nrequest that he sent to us but on items built in members' home \ndistricts.\n  Now, the conference report authorizes the purchase of items not \nrequested such as purchase of F-15's. Well, who does that benefit? The \npurchase of F-16's. Who does that benefit? The purchase of extra F/A-\n18's. Who does that benefit? The purchase of extra C-130's. The \npurchase of extra C-21's, Lear jets, not requested by the Pentagon. \nThese were add-ons. At a cost of an additional $1.6 billion, the \nconference report also authorizes the procurement of the LPD-17, the \nLHD-7 and an additional DDG-51, all three not requested by the \nPentagon, not requested by the administration, yet they are add-ons. \nWho benefits? Whose district? Whose States benefit? How did those get \ninto this conference report when the administration did not want them, \nat least not in this year's budget plan of how we are going to spend \nour increasingly scarce defense dollars?\n  Mr. President, I have supported add-ons where they make sense in the \npast, and I would have supported some of the add-ons in the conference \nreport, but the magnitude of the add-ons, the magnitude of all of \nthese--just one of them is not enough to sink this bill, but you put \nthem altogether, the add-ons and the solely parochial rationale \nsupporting some of them, it is impossible to support this conference \nreport.\n  The conference report does not stop at spending too much on programs \nthat we either do not need now or do not need at all. This bill marks \nthe return of widespread earmarking in the authorization process. That \nis where you have a requirement for a certain aircraft or a certain \nitem being purchased but it also specifically words things in a way \nthat it has to be spent exactly where they want it spent in a certain \nperson's district or a certain person's State.\n  The unpalatable earmarking of close to $800 million that was included \nin the Senate for reserve component equipment has been expanded and now \nthe bill contains additional earmarking in the shipbuilding and ship \nrepair accounts.\n  Earmarking, Mr. President, is a practice that the Armed Services \nCommittee has in the past worked tirelessly to weed out of its bills. \nAnd through the years I think we have been reasonably successful in \ngetting some of that earmarking wiped out. In the end, those efforts \neven impacted the appropriations bills which a few years back stopped \nearmarking the reserve component equipment accounts. And ironically, \nthe appropriators for the most part chose not to earmark their bill \nthis year, and it is the authorizers now that have loaded up our bill \nwith so much pork that I referred to it one day on the Senate floor as \nan ``agriculture bill'' because it has so much pork in it.\n  Mr. President, another remarkable provision in the conference report \nrequires the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve. When this issue came \nup during consideration of the Senate bill, many of us disagreed with \nrequiring the sale of this money-making asset, but we were bound to \nsell the reserve by reconciliation. In light of that reconciliation \nmandate, the committee worked to put safeguards in place in the \nauthorization bill to make sure the American taxpayer got the best \npossible return on the sale of this asset. What is remarkable about the \nconference report with regard to the petroleum reserve also, it was \ndropped out of reconciliation. We would no longer be forced to sell the \nreserve but for the fact the authorization conference report now \nrequires it to be sold. So it is dropped out of one report, the \nreconciliation bill, but kept in this authorization conference report \nand requiring that it be sold within 1 year. That is what made this \nthing really unacceptable: It required that it be sold within 1 year.\n  The conference report undermines its own so-called safeguard by \ncreating a buyer's market for the reserve, not an environment conducive \nto obtaining the best deal for the seller, the American taxpayer.\n  At the same time, the conference report adds earmarked funding for \nprograms of which there is a questionable requirement, the conference \nreport takes a $450 million cut in the account that funds cleanup of \nour nuclear weapons complex, a requirement which I view as a moral as \nwell as a legal obligation. That is one that I feel very strongly \nabout. The cleanup is required because we started back about 1985 with \na report that I got into, or asked the GAO to do on the Fernald part of \nthe nuclear weapons complex, and at Fernald we found out there were \nlots of problems. I asked for studies of other places around the \nnuclear weapons complex and now have a stack of GAO reports probably \n3\\1/2\\, 4 feet high through the last 10 years that have outlined this \nproblem, going from a nuclear cleanup cost estimate back in those days \nof $8 to $12 billion for everything to now up to around $200 to $300 \nbillion over a 20-year period, if we can figure out how to do it. Yet, \nwe reduce funding for it in this year's bill.\n\n  On what we might term social issues, this conference report, I \nbelieve, should be opposed. It prohibits service members and dependents \nfrom obtaining abortions paid for with private funds and just using \nmilitary medical facilities, except in the cases of rape, incest, or \nwhere the life of the mother is in danger.\n  If you are a female member of the armed services or a wife stationed \nsomewhere overseas, you may not have the option of going to outside \nfacilities as good as you would have if you were home in the United \nStates. In the past, we have permitted cases of abortion where it was \npaid for with private funds but using the military medical facility. \nThat is prohibited now with this legislation.\n  The conference report also discriminates against HIV-infected service \nmembers by requiring their discharge.\n  These are just some of the issues that have been attributed to my \ndecision to vote against this conference report.\n  I would like to comment for a moment on the process that led up to \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. President, this conference lasted for something close to 95 days. \nConferees met at the panel level for 2 weeks--the panel level now, the \nsubcommittee level--before being dissolved with outstanding issues \nstill to be considered at the full conference level. \n\n[[Page S18845]]\n\n  From the time the panels were dissolved, nearly 3 months ago, until \nthe committee members were informed last week that agreement on all \nissues had been achieved, the conferees met one time--just one time--\nand that was not for the usual purpose of conferees meeting. The \npurpose of that one meeting was to give the outside conferees the \nopportunity to express their views. The other committees that were \ninvolved in some way that were permitted the courtesy of coming in and \ngiving their testimony to the conferees, and that was the purpose of \nthe one meeting.\n  So when the panels dissolved, many, many issues remained unresolved, \nand the Senate conferees were never convened to discuss strategy for \nretaining important Senate positions, like the ABM language or funding \nfor the B-2, positions that were strongly supported by the Senate as a \nwhole.\n  In the case of the ABM language, we had an overwhelming vote on the \nfloor of the Senate, and the Senate position on B-2 funding was the \nresult of a rollcall vote taken in committee. Dialog at the conferee \nlevel may have changed the outcome on some of the items that were given \nup to the House.\n  Before concluding my remarks, Mr. President, for the record, although \nI do not support and will not vote for the conference report, I \ncertainly do support the acquisition reform provisions contained in \nthis legislation and hope we can attach those to some other piece of \nlegislation if this bill should fail.\n  Should this legislation be enacted, at least acquisition reform \nprovisions can help make a better and more effective Government. Should \nthe conference report fail to be enacted, I hope we can find a way to \nenact these procurement reforms by some other vehicle.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to speak about some \nof the better points of the conference report for the fiscal year 1996 \nDOD authorization, specifically, divisions D and E on acquisition \nreform and information technology management, respectively.\n  As you know, Mr. President, last year, the Congress passed the \nFederal Acquisition Streamlining Act, known as FASA, the first major \npiece of procurement reform legislation in a decade. Passage of FASA \nconstituted a critical victory in the war against government \ninefficiency. It is a comprehensive government-wide procurement reform \neffort aimed at streamlining the acquisition process by reducing \npaperwork burdens through revision and consolidation of acquisition \nstatutes to eliminate redundancy, provide consistency, and facilitate \nimplementation.\n  Now, I do not think anyone expected a second comprehensive round of \nreforms to follow so closely after FASA, especially while we were \nawaiting the new regulations, but with the dawn of the 104th Congress, \nwe saw a proliferation of new and revitalized procurement proposals. I \neven introduced a bill myself on behalf of the administration, S. 669, \nthe Federal Acquisition Improvement Act. Although I did not support \nevery item in that bill, I am pleased to say that some of the better \nconcepts have been included in this year's acquisition reform package.\n  Before I talk about the substance of the bill, I want to say a word \nabout the process that has been used to reach this end product. As with \nmany bills, a vehicle is often sought for expedient passage. This year, \nthe vehicle for government-wide acquisition reform is the DOD \nauthorization bill. I want to be very clear when I say that I do not \nexpect this to set a precedent for future acquisition reform \ndiscussions. Though most of these changes will also apply to the \nDefense Department, it was not my preference to enact government-wide \nchanges on a DOD bill. Expediency in legislating does not always \nproduce the best results.\n  However, once the decision was made to go this route, we have worked \nhard to make the best of a less than favorable situation. A staff-level \nworking group in the Senate spent several months scrutinizing each and \nevery proposal to identify the most useful and most needed provisions. \nEven though the Senate had only two subcommittee hearings, we have done \nthe best we could to consider opinions from interested parties however \npossible--by phone call, mail or meeting. And even without the formal \nmedium of a hearing, we tried to consider as many viewpoints as \npossible, and I sincerely hope that no one feels excluded from this \nprocess.\n  With that said, I am pleased to support, with one exception, the end \nproduct of what I consider an effort to build upon the acquisition \nreforms we initiated last year in FASA. The one exception is the \nproposed changes this bill makes to the recoupment laws which I do not \nconsider to be part of acquisition reform. I cannot support this \nchange.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight a few of the more \nsignificant changes being made to procurement law and explain my \nposition on recoupment.\n  In the area of competition, the Senate steadfastly refused to alter \nthe current definition of full and open competition, found in the \nCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984 [CICA], despite a House proposal \nto the contrary. but to ease the burden on contractors, both large and \nsmall, who expend large amounts of money to compete for contracts which \nmay never be awarded to them, we have instead authorized the use of two \nphase competitive procedures for certain construction contracts and \nallowed contracting officers to limit the competitive range of offerors \nto those who are judged to be best qualified.\n  In the area of commercial items where a lot of work was begun last \nyear with FASA, we have created a 3-year authorization for the use of \nstreamlined procedures for the purchase of unmodified commercial items \nunder $5 million. This should reduce the burden on contractors and \nshorten the deadlines and time it takes the government to acquire \ncommercial items since less time is needed to prepare an offer. We also \nauthorized the waiver of most statutory requirements for government \ncontractors when we purchase off-the-shelf commercial items, because it \nis impractical and inappropriate to routinely apply government-unique \nrequirements to ordinary commercial items that may be provided from a \ncommercial assembly line or over the counter. We also define off-the-\nshelf commercial items and refine the definition of commercial \nservices.\n  Procurement integrity was an issue which was left unresolved last \nyear by FASA with an agreement to take it up this year. We have \nstreamlined these provisions to prohibit the improper disclosure of \ninside information, and included a recusal provision which would \nprovide a statutory basis and statutory enforcement for ethics \nregulations already in place, and a limited revolving door provision, \nwhich would prohibit certain agency officials from going to work for a \ncontractor for 1 year after certain involvement with certain contracts.\n  In the area of protests and dispute resolution, repeal of the \ninfamous Brooks ADP Act consolidates administrative protests in the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO]. I am very pleased with this solution.\n  I recognize that a protest is intended to be an action brought on \nbehalf of and in the best interest of both the government and the \ntaxpayer, making sure that both get the best deal. However, it seems to \nhave gotten to the point where agencies routinely build time for \nprotests into major procurements from the start, because companies \noften proceed with a protest if they lose out on a contract, regardless \nof the government's explanation for their loss of that contract. \nBecause every major procurement or program seems to generate its own \nflurry of protests, I strongly prefer the GAO as the administrative \nforum of choice where the process is less formal, less costly, and less \njudicialized.\n  I also recognize that GAO does not have the authority to issue \nbinding declaratory judgements and that its decisions are merely \nrecommendatory. There are very few instances where the agency has not \nfollowed a GAO recommendation, however, and in those instances, the \nagency must account to Congress for its actions, preserving the \nCongressional oversight role.\n\n  Among other things, we have also severed the linkages between the \nsuccessful implementation of a Federal Acquisition Computer Network and \nthe FASA-authorized simplified acquisition threshold and pilot \nprograms; reduced the number of certifications required of contractors; \ndelayed the implementation of FASA's cooperative \n\n[[Page S18846]]\npurchasing program until after a GAO study has been completed and \nreviewed; required agencies to conduct cost-effective value engineering \nprograms; established requirements for the civilian acquisition \nworkforce; authorized a demonstration project for personnel management \nin the DOD acquisition workforce; and amended the OFPP Act to eliminate \nobsolete and unnecessary provisions.\n  Division E of the DOD bill, originally Senators Cohen and Levin's \ninformation technology management reform bill, will reform the way the \nGovernment both buys and manages its information technology systems. \nThis section of the bill will not only force agencies to take a more \nstrategic view of their information assets and enhance up-front \nplanning, it will give the Government the tools it needs to keep up \nwith the rapid pace of technological change in the information arena. \nIt will also add to the information resources management reforms of the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995, of which I am a co-author. Hopefully \nthis will lead to a substantial reduction in the number of horror \nstories we hear every year about information systems that are late, \nover budget and do not work.\n  Finally, as I stated earlier, there is one provision that has been \nincluded as acquisition reform, but which I exclude from this category. \nThis provision--which I cannot support--would essentially eliminate the \nrequirement to recoup R costs paid by the U.S. on foreign arms sales. \nEven though the Secretary of Defense will be given authority to waive \nthe recoupment fees only under certain circumstances, I am just not \nconvinced that these changes are necessary, narrow as they may be, even \nif corresponding reporting requirements were added. The U.S. is already \nvery competitive in world arms markets; new incentives are unnecessary. \nIn the past, I have opposed other initiatives to use government \ninstitutions or government funds to underwrite foreign arms sales. \nGiven our current dominance of the market, further encouragement of \nforeign arms sales is neither necessary nor desirable.\n  Mr. President, it is easy to see that even after FASA, we have \ncontinued to address more difficult and complex issues with this second \nround of acquisition reform. Although I do not support and will not \nvote in favor of the DOD conference report, I am glad that, if it \npasses, at least the acquisition reform provisions can help to make a \nbetter and more effective government. And if the conference report does \nnot get enacted, I hope some way can be found to enact these \nprocurement reforms in another context.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, to summarize some of the President's budget \nrequest, there was an additional $5.2 billion added, basically, to the \nfollowing accounts:\n  Army aircraft, $336 million added;\n  Missiles, $189 million added;\n  Wheeled and tracked combat vehicles, $357 million added;\n  Other procurement, $506 million added.\n  In the Navy:\n  Aircraft, $686 million added;\n  Weapons, they subtracted $127 million on that one;\n  Ships, added $1.6 billion in ships that were not requested;\n  Ammunition, plus $430 million;\n  Other procurement, $18.6 million.\n  In the Air Force:\n  Aircraft, added $1.2 billion;\n  Missiles, cut $709 million;\n  Ammunition, added $343 million;\n  Other procurement, minus $536 million.\n  National Guard had $777 million added, most of it earmarked.\n  Specifically an additional $212 million for six more F/A-18's;\n  An additional $1.4 billion for the LHD-7;\n  An additional $974 million for the LPD-17;\n  An authorization for 3 DDG-51's while only providing the money for \ntwo;\n  An additional $493 million for B-2 with no limitation on how those \nfunds can be spent, including new production, which could be the \ndecision later on. That language was fought over in the conference, I \nunderstand.\n  It also had an additional $311 million for F-15E's;\n  And an additional $159 million for F-16's.\n  So, Mr. President, I support some of the good things I think were in \nthis legislation, such as the military pay raise, the additional basic \nallowance for quarters and aviation retention pay. I hope that we can \nput those on to other legislation. I am the cosponsor of legislation to \ndo that.\n  For all the above reasons and more, I regret for the first time I \nwill not be able to vote for a conference report on this. I do regret \nit very much. I know how hard the chairman, Senator Thurmond, has \nworked on this and how much he wants this. I do wish very much that I \ncould support this, but I find that I just cannot, for all the reasons \ngiven above.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as may be \nneeded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Incidentally, the distinguished Senator from Ohio asked \nfor 5 additional minutes. I ask unanimous consent that our side have 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nplan to object, I intended that the 5 minutes come out of our allotted \ntime, not 5 minutes added on to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the additional 5 minutes \nallocated to the Senator from Ohio will be deducted from the time on \nthe minority side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. If the additional 5 minutes he received is going to \ncome out of that time, then I will not ask for 5 additional minutes. I \njust wanted to be sure each side had the same number of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to address the central objection \nraised by certain Members and the administration against this \nconference report concerning ballistic missile defense.\n  The administration has argued that we do not need and cannot afford a \nnational missile defense system. This is a debatable point and everyone \nis entitled to their own view. But the administration has also claimed \nthat the NMD system called for in this conference report would require \nthe United States to unilaterally abrogate or violate the ABM Treaty. \nThis assertion is simply false.\n  Over the last several months, the majority conferees engaged the \nadministration and the minority conferees in a detailed negotiation to \nensure that all legitimate concerns having to do with the ABM Treaty, \nthe START II Treaty, and the President's prerogatives in the area of \narms control were addressed and resolved. This negotiation produced the \nballistic missile defense provisions in this conference report.\n  Unfortunately, once these concerns were addressed, the administration \nmoved the goal line and changed its demands. At the last moment, the \nWhite House made it clear that even if we resolved all concerns having \nto do with the ABM Treaty they would oppose this conference report over \na simple commitment to deploy a national missile defense system, even \nif that system were fully compliant with the ABM Treaty.\n  Let us be clear about the administration's reasons for opposing this \nconference report. The administration opposes any National Missile \nSystem; they argue that there is no threat and that we cannot afford \none anyway. Ironically, the administration is willing to spend hundreds \nof millions of dollars each year on a National Missile Defense \nTechnology Program that is specifically designed never to lead to \ndeployment. What we are saying is at that level of investment we ought \nto get something real in return--an actual deployed system.\n\n[[Page S18847]]\n\n  On the subject of the threat, there is no doubt that there is an \nexisting and expanding threat to the United States from ballistic \nmissiles. With Russian ICBM technology virtually up for sale and with \nNorth Korea developing a missile capable of reaching the United States, \nI do not see how one can argue that there is no threat in sight. This \nis just another excuse for doing nothing.\n  To provide some context, I urge Senators to look back at the Missile \nDefense Act of 1991, which was a bipartisan effort. The 1991 act called \non the Secretary of Defense to deploy a National Missile Defense System \nin 5 years, by 1996. In contrast, the conference report before the \nSenate today gives the Secretary of Defense 8 years to deploy a similar \nsystem.\n  What has changed since passage of the Missile Defense Act of 1991 is \nthat the administration no longer wants to deal with the problem. I \nregret this and I urge my colleagues to reject the artificial arguments \nregarding the ABM Treaty. There are many in the Senate who want to see \nus abrogate the ABM Treaty. This conference report, however, does not \ndo it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to a couple of remarks made by \nthe Senator from Ohio. The Senator from Ohio registered his support for \nadministration success in securing the unconditional extension of the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. He then went on to articulate his concerns \nwith the ballistic missile defense language in the defense \nauthorization conference and the potential detrimental impact on \nRussian ratification of START II. He also mentioned his concern about \nthe lack of concern by the new majority with regard to export controls \nand other measures that would contribute to staunching the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Let me highlight provisions in the Defense authorization conference \nreport which I believe the Senator would agree supports his concerns.\n  With regard to START II, there are two provisions, one which \nexpresses the Congress' support for ratification and implementation of \nSTART II, and another provision expressing the Congress' belief that \nthe United States not take any action to unilaterally retire or \ndismantle systems until such time as START II is ratified and \nimplemented by both parties. This is consistent with the testimony by \nthe Under Secretary of Policy for the Department of Defense, Walt \nSlocombe, before the Senate Armed Services Committee during its START \nII hearing this year. Let me quote Mr. Slocombe's response to a concern \nthat I raised about premature reductions to the U.S. strategic forces, \nMr. Slocombe replied,\n\n       . . . we will not begin the reductions necessary to reach \n     the START II levels until the Treaty has been ratified, and \n     we will ensure that the pace of our reductions are reasonably \n     related to the pace of Russian reductions.\n\n  It seems ridiculous to me that the administration would oppose the \nDefense authorization conference report and cite provisions that \narticulate the administration's stated policy.\n  With regard to export controls, the Defense authorization conference \nreport includes a provision that expresses the concern of the Congress \nthat it is in our national security interests to maintain effective \nexport controls. Additionally, the conference report expresses its deep \nconcern that the administration has lowered restrictions on a number of \ndual-use items and technologies with defense capabilities. The \nconference report would require them to evaluate licenses for the \nexport of militarily critical items that should be controlled for \nnational security reasons; requires the Department to review export \nlicenses for biological pathogens; and requires a report on actions \ntaken by the administration to ensure that it is maintaining an active \nrole in review export licenses in a number of areas, such as space \nlaunch vehicles, supercomputers, biological pathogens, and high \nresolution imagery. The conference report also makes recommendations to \nstrengthen proliferation regimes, such as the Missile Technology \nControl Regimes. The conference report also contains provisions to \nstrengthen the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992.\n  Last, the Senator from Ohio mentioned his concern that the Defense \nauthorization conference report does not contain enough funds to pay \nour peacekeeping assessments to the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, the Defense authorization conference report is not the \nappropriate legislation to pay peacekeeping assessments, the \nappropriate legislation is the foreign aid and foreign operations \nappropriations bills.\n  The Defense conference report before the Senate contains funds to pay \nfor contingency operations in Iraq, which Secretary of Defense Perry \nasked for, but was not included in the Defense budget request. It also \nincludes $50 million for humanitarian assistance and $20 million for \nhumanitarian demining activities. Items which quite frankly should be \nfunded in the international affairs budget function, but which this \ncommittee has supported.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to inquire about the amount of \ntime that I could have on this. Is the time under the control of the \ndistinguished chairman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield to the Senator as much time as he may desire.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think 15 minutes should do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for as much time as \nhe desires.\n  Mr. LOTT. First, Mr. President, I would like to commend and \ncongratulate the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, for his excellent work on \nthis legislation, his dedication, his perseverance. There have been \nmany times during the process of the development of this bill--in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, on the floor of the Senate, in \nconference--when the hurdles looked like they were unachievable, that \nwe just were not going to be able to move forward to the next issue or \nmove the whole bill. But in each instance along the way, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has insisted that we work together, between the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, across the aisle, between the \nSenate and the House, and between the Congress and the administration. \nIt has not been easy. This is a big, important bill for the future \ndefense of our country, and we would not be here without the leadership \nof our great Senator from South Carolina. I commend him and thank him \nfor the opportunity of being involved in the process to move this \nlegislation forward. Of course, I also want to thank the distinguished \nranking member on the committee, the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nNunn, for his cooperation and his being willing to point out where \nthere were potential problems and to try to find solutions we could \nlive with.\n  Mr. President, when the Defense Authorization Committee began this \nconference in early September, Members from the House and Senate worked \nfor swift resolutions to issues of dispute between the two bills. While \nmost conferences include issues which are difficult to negotiate, this \nconference clearly was especially difficult in trying to work out an \nagreeable conference report. Once the conference discussions began, it \nwas evident that huge differences existed between the House and Senate \nconferees and the administration. Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Spence, \nand countless other Members, worked vigorously to try and bridge the \ndifferences, and a substantial compromise was required to resolve these \nissues. In fact, they were achieved. We did reach a compromise, and \nthat is why we have this conference agreement. That is the way all \nconferences work. You always have differences between Republicans on \nthe Armed Services Committee--between Democrats and between Republicans \nand Democrats, and between the Congress and the administration. That is \nwhat happened here. After a lot of hard work, we were able to achieve \nthis conference agreement.\n  There were countless issues in this process that I felt strongly \nabout. Several of them were resolved in a way that I do not \nparticularly like. But the greater good is involved here. I think this \nis a conference report I can support, should support, and I also think \nthe Senate should agree to. I understand that there are feelings in the \nminority that maybe they were not consulted enough as we went along. I \ndo know that our staffs communicated \n\n[[Page S18848]]\nand that as negotiations were underway, our staff really worked hard to \nkeep the staff on the other side informed. I do know that Senator \nThurmond worked with Chairman Spence, and I know he worked with Senator \nNunn. I had repeated conferences myself with Senator Nunn. He was very \ntolerant in talking on the car phone late at night and early in the \nmorning. I talked to Senator Exon about a variety of issues in the \nconference, and I know that other Senators of both parties talked back \nand forth.\n  So while maybe it has not been a perfect process, we have learned \nfrom the process and we do have a result that I think we should be able \nto live with. I have listened carefully to the criticism on this final \nagreement. Some Members do not believe they were fully involved in the \nnegotiations. Other Members just do not like some of the final results. \nI can remember, though, year in and year out when Senator Nunn and \nChairman Aspin would convene the big four to resolve differences in the \nabsence of the remaining members of the committees. There has been some \ncomplaint that there were not enough people involved in the loop. But I \ndo have a memory of how, not very long ago, the big four finally got \ndown to the big issues and met, and if the big four could not resolve \nthe final problems, the chairmen met to make the final call--perhaps \nChairman Nunn and Chairman Dellums. So there is nothing really \ndifferent in the way we proceeded this time.\n  So we need to distinguish between unhappiness over the process and \ndisagreements over what the right answers are on the policy questions \ninvolved. I agree that the process can always be improved. But \nopposition should not be raised against this bill because of objections \nto the way the conference was conducted.\n  This bill will serve as a roadmap for meeting America's national \nsecurity needs in the future. This bill will guide the Department of \nDefense in its research and development, acquisition of weapons \nsystems, personnel policy and force structure levels.\n  Friday, some Members began listing items they regarded as \nunacceptable in this bill to the point of deciding to oppose the \nconference agreement. Items identified as being questionable or \nunacceptable include these among others: The missile defense language; \nremoval of statutory requirements for Assistant Secretaries for Special \nOperations and the Director of the Office of Operational Test and \nEvaluation; reduction in the time required for sale of the naval \npetroleum reserve by 1 year. Now there is a reason to oppose this bill. \nBig deal. You are going to vote against the Defense authorization bill \nbecause of a 1-year difference in when we sell the naval petroleum \nreserve? I do not find that very defensible, frankly. We also had the \ndirected procurement of some ships to specific shipyards. I did not \nparticularly like the agreement reached in some of these areas, but it \nwas a compromise. It was one where we had strong feelings on both sides \nof the aisle from the Senate that was different from what the House \nwanted. But we kept pushing and pushing, and we finally got agreement \nbetween Senators of both parties and House Members of both parties. I \nwould prefer not to have gone with the agreement that came up on those \nships. But that is the art of compromise. You give--sometimes a lot--\nand you get a little and you come back another day and try again.\n  There are those who say there are too many certifications and reports \nrequired by this bill. Should we not be getting certifications and \nreports from the Pentagon to the Congress? I thought the Congress in \nthe past has felt very strongly that we need to be kept informed. I \nthink we did not go too far there.\n  There are some buy American requirements for certain components in \nthis bill. We did not have it in the Senate bill. The House felt \nexceedingly strongly about it. We got them to make some changes, some \nmodifications. I think that the requirements that are in here are \nlivable. Would it be better if we did not have them? I guess, maybe so, \nalthough I think there are a lot of people in this country who wonder \nwhy we should not have some requirements that key components be bought \nin America. After all, these are U.S. tax dollars. Why should we not \nrequire some critical systems to be manufactured in America? I think it \nis dangerous to allow U.S. companies to go under--requiring us to buy \ncritical components from sources outside this country. I also think it \ninvolves jobs in America. But, this is a very small requirement in this \nparticular bill.\n  Also, one objection I have heard is that they do not like the \nlanguage on U.N. command and control. Now, I want the Senate to think \nabout that. Are you really, really, comfortable with an arrangement \nthat would put our troops under U.N. command and control? Would you not \nrather have some clear directions on how that would happen or if it \nwould happen? If you want to vote down the defense authorization bill \nbecause of our command and control language with regard to the United \nNations, have at it. I can tell you the American people will not be \nwith you, and I do not think it is smart from a defense standpoint.\n  Given so much is made of these various items, I want to review some \nof them so that the Members of the Senate will understand the substance \nof what is involved.\n  With regard to the missile defense language, the conference report is \nbalanced. It is moderate--arguably by some on this side of the aisle \nand in the House, too moderate. But that, again, is the nature of the \nconference. Nobody gets everything they want. The conferees made every \neffort to accommodate the legitimate concerns and objections made by \nthe administration, and even some objections that I thought were not so \nlegitimate. But we went the extra mile. The conference report resolves \nall concerns having to do with the ABM Treaty, the President's \nprerogatives in the area of arms control negotiations and Russian \nratification of START II.\n  Unfortunately, after all of this, the White House is still \nthreatening a veto, and some of our colleagues are complaining as if we \ndid not address the concerns. Let me mention a few of the more specific \nthings that were, in fact, done to meet these objections that were \nraised.\n  First and foremost, the conference report contains a provision that \nis virtually the same as the Senate-passed language on TMD demarcation, \nwhich was specifically identified by the administration as acceptable. \nNow, we had some problems in this area because I frankly had thought we \ncould go ahead and go with the identical Senate-passed language on \ndemarcation, and along the way it kept being changed to say, well, it \nis not identical but virtually the same and that the words mean the \nsame. There was concern on the other side about that. The language we \nwound up with, the administration specifically identified it as \nacceptable and not a problem. So, I assume, then, there is no problem \nwith the TMD demarcation. The House-passed demarcation language, on the \nother hand, has been singled out as veto bait. Thus, on the single most \ncontroversial BMD issue in conference, the administration got what it \nasked for.\n  Equally important, the conference contains language on national \nmissile defense that resolves concerns that we might have about setting \nup anticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty by requiring deployment of a \nmultiple-site NMD system by a date certain. The conference report does \nnot contain the multiple-site requirement which was even in the Senate-\npassed bill. After a lot of discussions with Senator Nunn and his \ncommunication with the administration, we did not want to leave any \ndoubt. So a major concession was made there and, in fact, we have a \ncouple of Senators on this side of the aisle who are seriously \nconsidering voting against the conference report because of that \nconcession.\n  There was a narrow little slither that we could get through. We tried \nto find that little, small, unmarked passage that we could pass \nthrough. I think we found it if, in fact, you want any missile defense \nat all. Frankly, I suspect there are some on the other side who do not \nwant any missile defenses at all. That is why even though we keep \nmaking concessions and coming to agreements, it never seems to be \nenough.\n  To ensure that there could be no misunderstanding regarding an \nanticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty, we remove not only the specific \nrequirement for a multiple-site system, but \n\n[[Page S18849]]\ntwo other pieces of language; first, a congressional finding that the \nentire United States could not be defended from a single site; and, \nsecond, a requirement that the ground-based interceptor be deployed in \nsignificant numbers and at a significant number of sites to defend the \nentire United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. I still think it is \nindefensible that we say we might have one site, but you folks who live \nin certain areas along the gulf coast or in Hawaii or in Alaska, gee, \nwe may not be able to cover you. Sorry about that. But, we will get the \nother 48 or so.\n  In place of this language, we inserted the exact language from the \nSenate compromise that the ground-based interceptors would be capable \nof being deployed at multiple sites. These changes were made at the \nrequest of the senior Senator from Georgia to resolve his concerns \nregarding anticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty.\n  Let me also point out this conference report urges the President to \nundertake negotiations with Russia to amend the ABM Treaty to allow for \na multiple-site NMD system. I think it is in our best interest to do \nthat. It does not just involve our relationship with Russia, but what \nother countries may be doing in this area. This provision makes it \nclear that we have no intention--no intention--of unilaterally \nviolating the ABM Treaty. The language does state, if negotiations \nfail, we should consider withdrawing from the treaty, but this right is \nalready provided for in article 14 of the treaty.\n  These provisions and others I have not mentioned make it clear that \nwe intend a cooperative approach with Russia in dealing with the ABM \nTreaty. Nowhere in the conference report is it suggested or required \nthat we violate or unilaterally walk away from the ABM Treaty. In \nexchange for resolving this ABM Treaty concern, the conferees agreed to \nretain a requirement to deploy an NMD system by the end of 2003--but \nwithout the multiple-site requirement.\n  Any remaining arguments about this ``anticipatory breach'' of the ABM \nTreaty or assertions that Russia may not ratify START II due to our NMD \nprogram are not based on fact or logic. Russia may not approve START \nII, but I think it may be because of the Communists and the \nnationalists that were just elected to their parliamentary body, not \nbecause of this missile defense language. I remind the Senate that the \nonly operational ABM system in the world is, in fact, deployed around \nMoscow. It would be foolish to allow the Russians to blackmail us \nwithout regard to actions permitted by the ABM Treaty, as they have \nattempted to do on a variety of issues, including expansion of NATO and \nUnited States policy in Bosnia.\n  Let us be clear about the administration's real objections with the \nballistic missile defense provisions in this conference report. The \nadministration and some of our colleagues here in the Senate do not \nwant the United States to be defended at all against ballistic \nmissiles. That is my fear, at any rate. The administration's NMD \nprogram is designed to perpetuate research and development while \nindefinitely delaying deployment of the most limited NMD system. How \nlong can you go on with research and development? It is like some of \nthe Corps of Engineer projects that I am familiar with. They study \nthem, study them; they do analysis and study. If they put that money \ninto the construction of the projects that they waste on years of \nstudies, we would get our projects a lot quicker, we would not waste \nnearly as much money. If we are not actually going to do this, how long \nare we going to go forward with R?\n  My staff was told directly by a senior White House official that the \nadministration would object to any requirement to deploy an NMD system \nby a date certain, even if that system fully complied with the ABM \nTreaty. There you have it. That is the crux of the matter.\n  In essence, they oppose any commitment to deploy a national defense \nmissile system. By way of comparison, by the way, interestingly, in \n1991, a Democratically controlled Congress dramatically restructured \nthe Bush administration's SDI program with the Missile Defense Act of \n1991, which was a bipartisan initiative, sponsored by the then chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee. The 1991 act called for deployment of \nan NMD system in 5 years, whereas the conference report before the \nSenate today calls for a similar deployment in 8 years. What is the big \nconcern here?\n  This 1991 bipartisan agreement, that was led by Senator Nunn, Senator \nWarner, Senator Cohen, and others, said it would be done in 5 years, by \n1996. Now this one says we will not even get it done until the year \n2003. If we get to 2002 and we do not have the capability, if we do not \nwant to do it, we do not have to go forward. We can change it. But \nshould we not have some goal that someday we will quit doing R and we \nactually deploy a defensive system? Should we not have a date in mind \nso this just does not go on forever?\n  The 1991 act also mirrored this conference report in urging the \nPresident to negotiate amendments to the ABM Treaty to allow for a \nmultiple-site NMD system. Think about that again. The 1991 act--\nbipartisan--led by Senator Nunn of Georgia, said essentially the same \nthing we are saying here, that there should be an effort to negotiate \namendments to the ABM Treaty to allow for these multiple sites. Many of \nthe same Members who stood on this floor in 1991 speaking in favor of \nnational missile defense deployment are now telling the American people \nnot to worry, that we do not need to defend the United States against \nballistic missiles.\n  This defies, not only logic, but our responsibility to provide for \nthe defense of the American homeland. I cannot help but conclude that \non the subject of ballistic missile defense, the administration did not \nnegotiate with us in full faith.\n  For weeks during the conference we heard nothing about objections \nconcerning the ABM Treaty. But even after addressing each one of these \nconcerns, in most cases accepting specific proposals made by the \nadministration or minority conferees, we still hear the same old \narguments and are faced with a veto threat. So I am disappointed, \nalthough I must confess I am not too surprised right now.\n  The next question involves the restructured Assistant Secretaries of \nDefense. Some Members have objected, on both sides of the aisle, to \nchanges in law which impact two civilian offices within the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary for Special \nOperations and Low Intensity Conflict, and the Director of the Office \nof Operational Test and Evaluation. These Members allege that these \npositions are being eliminated by this conference report. Now this is \nnot completely accurate.\n  The conference report simply removes the statutory requirement which \ndictates that these positions must be maintained. Why did the \nconference committee makes these changes? Frankly, primarily because \nthe House felt so strongly about it. But, since the late 1980's the \nmilitarily services have shrunk by almost 25 percent. The military \nservices have gone down in size by 25 percent. But, during the same \nperiod, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has increased in size by \nover 20 percent. This is since the late 1980's, so there have been \nDemocrat and Republican administrations. But, while the military \nnumbers are going down, the number of civilians in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense have gone up 20 percent. How does this make sense? \nIt does not. If you do not remove the statutory requirement that \nrequires the continuation of this imbalance of personnel, the Secretary \nof Defense is restricted from realigning his office. This conference \nreport empowers the Secretary of Defense. It does not restrict him in \nthis regard.\n  Does anyone believe the Members of the House and Senate defense \ncommittees would eliminate or want to eliminate operational test and \nevaluation? Absolutely not. It is very important that we continue to \nemphasize the importance of operational tests and evaluation of new \nweapon systems. But maintaining our commitment to this function should \nnot preclude our ability to allow the Office of Secretary of Defense to \nbe restructured in order to reduce overhead and save money. After all, \nin the final analysis, the Office of the Secretary of Defense cannot \nfight a single battle. Military personnel have to do that. So we are \ngetting fatter on the civilian side at OSD, while we are \n\n[[Page S18850]]\nslimming down in the actual fighting people.\n  The same is true of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special \nOperations. We are not in favor of removing civilian oversight of \nspecial operations, absolutely not. But the Secretary of Defense should \nbe unburdened from the countless statutory requirements, one of which \nis this Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n  A lot of criticism has been made that this conference report mandates \nthe Navy buy numerous component items in the United States only. While \nit is true the bill contains the requirement for the Navy to purchase \ncertain components with 51 percent U.S. domestic content, it does not \ncontain an absolute buy-American provision.\n  The United States is out of step with other countries which get \ninvolved in the awarding of defense contracts. If a defense contractor \nwants to bid on a Dutch weapon system, for instance, they require U.S. \nfirms to meet two different tests. First is the an offset requirement--\nthat is you have to bring some amount of money into the Netherlands to \noffset the amount of money going to the United States defense \ncontractor. Second, the Netherlands requires a certain percentage of \nthe United States defense contractor's work or product to be done in \nthe Netherlands.\n  Now, we like to do business with the Dutch. But they have \nrequirements on us that we do not have for ourselves. Are we going to \nget in the position where all of our--or many of our key defense \ncomponents are built overseas? There is danger there. Surely we see \nthat.\n  But that is not all the Dutch require. The Netherlands also leverages \nforeign defense firms by granting larger offsetting credits to United \nStates contractors who increase the Dutch content of the component \nsupplied by the United States contractor. For example, the Netherlands \nrequires a 100 percent offset on all awards to foreign defense \ncontractors, but they have structured an offset credit valuation system \nwhich awards more offset credit to foreign contractors who meet 85 \npercent domestic levels or higher in their country. So, if a United \nStates contractor wants to win a defense contract with the Dutch \nGovernment they have two choices: Either they come up with a 100 \npercent offset for the total value of the contract award, or they have \nto manufacture 85 percent of that component or system in the \nNetherlands.\n  That is not exactly what you would call an open and fair competition \nfor U.S. defense firms. The United States in almost every area of our \ndefense procurement welcomes all bidders without domestic content \nrequirements or offset requirements. How is this fair? It is the same \nold deal. America says we want free trade but we do not even require \nthat it be equal or fair, not only in this area but a lot of other \nareas.\n  This bill simply identifies a list of specific key components and \nrequires that 51 percent of those components be manufactured in the \nUnited States. It does not even come close to leveling the playing \nfield in terms of applying the same set of rules on foreign contractors \nsupplying our Defense Department as foreign countries apply to U.S. \nfirms competing for defense contracts in their countries.\n  Good old Uncle Sam gets to be Uncle Sap once again. We always seem to \nbend over backward to deal with the problems of our allies but we do \nnot look after ourselves. We are not talking about only one or two \ncountries applying for these domestic content and offset requirements. \nThere is a long list: Australia, Norway, Canada, South Korea. The \ndomestic content provision in this bill is needed. It makes sense. And \nit is fully warranted, given the practice of other countries requiring \noffsets by U.S. contractors.\n  We probably should have done more in this area, not less. But, again, \nthis was a case where the Senate was willing to say no, we are not \ngoing to have anything on this. Our House conferees were just \nabsolutely adamant. And we ground it down and we made them give \ntremendous concessions. We came up with what is really a very small, \nand I think a reasonable, proposal.\n  COLA's for military retirees are in this bill. Members need to \nunderstand, without passage of this bill military retirees will, once \nagain, fail to receive a fair and equitable cost-of-living adjustment, \nequal and timely with civilian retirees.\n  The Armed Services Committee members feel very strongly about this. \nAgain, it is a question of fundamental fairness. I know there is some \nthinking going on around here, do not worry, we will put it on some \ntrain going through here in the next few days and we will take care of \nit.\n  There may not be any trains going through here in the next few days. \nWe may be here Christmas day. But the idea we are going to hitch it on \nto a continuing resolution is very dubious. In the process, our \nmilitary retirees could get trapped.\n  We have it in this bill. That is where it belongs. We need to make \nsure we understand, if we do not pass this authorization bill our \nmilitary retirees' COLA could be lost. How are you going to explain to \nthe military retirees in your State that you opposed a bill that would \nbring their COLA back into parity and alignment with civilian retirees? \nThis bill provides important parity there.\n  Some say this bill is not perfect. I have never voted on a perfect \nbill, I do not think. I have never voted on a perfect defense bill. I \ndo not agree with all of the bill's provisions, but overall I think \nthis is a good bill. Concerted efforts were made to address numerous \nadministration concerns. As a result, substantial modifications were \nmade in conference to address these concerns.\n  In the missile defense area, as I pointed out, the cooperative threat \nreduction program, the so-called Nunn-Lugar program, we had some \nreservations about it. We worked hard on that with Senator Nunn and \nSenator Lugar. We made agreements. I think all the money was restored, \nwith a certain amount of it fenced, but even that money could be spent \nin other countries. I think that was the final result. We support this \nprogram and we got it worked out.\n  We made changes but we retained the U.N. command and control \nrestrictions. We had contingency operations funding. I personally do \nnot like that at all. I do not like this contingency operations \nfunding. I do not like giving the Pentagon money and saying, ``by the \nway, use it because of commitments that had already been made in Haiti \nor Somalia or wherever they may be''--but giving the money in advance. \nI think they need to justify all of these continuing operations' \nfunding. We will live up to providing the funds. We always have and we \nwill. But I do not like this funding in advance.\n  We had acquisition reform provisions. We had improvements in military \nhousing. There is a long list of really good things in this bill.\n  While the administration may not like all of them, I say again, we \nmade tremendous efforts to work with the administration. I know Senator \nNunn helped with that. I know our leader, the chairman of the \ncommittee, wanted to work with the administration. In fact, he insisted \nthat we meet with Dr. Perry at breakfast meetings to hear his concerns. \nI remember Dr. Perry came over and said, ``We do not like the House-\npassed bill, but we are pretty comfortable with the Senate-passed \nbill.''\n\n  So we worked to try to address his concerns. We met with the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, Deputy White. He came in and said--I cannot \nremember the number--``There are six or seven areas we are really \nconcerned about.'' Look at the bill and you will find in almost every \none of those areas we either met their specific requirements, or \nrequest, or made substantial movements in that direction. So they have \nbeen able to get a lot of modifications.\n  I think we have a good bill. I urge Members of the Senate to support \nthis conference report. It is good for the men and women in uniform. \nThat should be our principal goal. It improves the readiness of our \nforces. It begins to correct the modernization problems our military \nservices face and provides policy guidance necessary to operate our \ndefense efforts in a challenging and difficult time.\n  Did we leave some issues on the table? Yes. But we will be back at \nwork on the next authorization bill in about 6 weeks.\n  Did we have some areas that we may change our mind on later? Yes. But \nwe have an authorization bill every year. If some language needs to be \nrevisited, we can do that. Let us pass this bill. \n\n[[Page S18851]]\n Let us do the right thing for our country and for our military men and \nwomen.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nMississippi for the excellent remarks he has made on this bill.\n  He is the Republican whip in the Senate and does a great job there. \nHe is also a valuable member of the Armed Services Committee and has \nmade a great contribution to our country by sitting on that committee. \nAgain, I want to thank him for all he has done to promote this bill.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Department of Defense \nauthorization conference report, and I do so with considerable regret. \nI, as a member of the committee, voted to support the original \nauthorization bill because I think it did represent a very carefully \nbalanced approach on some of the critical issues which I am going to \ncomment on briefly.\n  I acknowledge that there are parts of this bill that I think are \nquite good. The military pay provisions, the acquisition reforms are \nareas of particular interest to me. In my own State, money is provided \nfor hydronuclear testing, some $30 million. Those and many other \nprovisions I fully support.\n  But the conference report now before us contains significant changes \nfrom the originally approved bill, particularly with respect to \nproviding additional funding for the B-2 bomber, a position which the \nSenate opposed both in committee and on the floor.\n  The report contains very dangerous language, in my opinion, with \nrespect to the national missile defense provisions that, if enacted, \nwould violate the U.S. agreement on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. \nThe report contains a number of troubling ``special arrangements,'' \nsuch as a specific ship maintenance contract for a specific shipyard, \nwhich in my view would circumvent the competitive bidding process. The \nreport also delineates line by line how the National Guard and Reserve \nmay spend their allocated money for procurement, a position contrary to \nthat taken by the National Guard and Reserve components. Moreover, Mr. \nPresident, I regret to say that the conference report does not have the \nfull bipartisan support of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The \nminority members, the Democrats, were not even minimally notified or \nconsulted with respect to major issues that were changed in the \nconference report.\n  Last week, the Democratic conferees were asked to sign the conference \nreport despite the fact that we had not been given the final language \non a number of critical issues, most notably the language with respect \nto the B-2 bomber and the potentially explosive national missile \ndefense language.\n  I might note with specificity that when my office was notified that \nthe final conference meeting would convene, we were provided about 30 \nminutes advance notice. I was able to attend, but a good many of my \ncolleagues, not having any prior notice of the conference meeting, were \nnot able to attend. This meeting convened rather late in the afternoon \nat approximately 6 o'clock, with such late notice many of my colleagues \nwere unable to rearrange their schedules to attend a very important \nmeeting.\n  So for those reasons, and others, I do not intend to support this \nconference report today and I would not agree to sign the conference \nreport last week.\n  It appears that this conference committee has never been terribly \nserious about conducting bipartisan negotiations. As a matter of fact, \nthe conference committee was disbanded a few weeks after it was \nconvened. Therefore, there could be no meaningful bipartisan discussion \nof the funding levels, or any of the other outstanding issues in the \ncontext of a conference discussion. In point of fact, Mr. President, \nthe conference was disbanded before any real, substantive discussions \neven began among the conferees.\n  Due to the early disbanding of the conference, negotiations have \ntaken place primarily between House and Senate Republicans behind \nclosed doors for the past 95 days. Because the conference was \nofficially disbanded, negotiators were not bound to follow the open \nmeeting rule, nor were they required to notify all conferees of \nnegotiation sessions or conference meetings.\n  I am a relatively new member to the committee, Mr. President. This \nwill be my third authorization bill. But I must say, in my experience \nit is unprecedented that the committee has operated in this fashion. I \nam told by my colleagues who have considerably more tenure than I do on \nthe committee that this is without precedent. I must say when I was \nappointed to this committee in 1993, I was enthusiastic about that \nappointment, and I continue to be. One aspect that I particularly \nenjoy--having had the opportunity to serve on, among other committees \nhere in the Senate, the Senate Armed Services Committee--is that it has \nhistorically had the reputation, which I found to be the case, that it \nreally was bipartisan. That is not to say that there were not \nlegitimate differences that divided us. There were, and there continue \nto be. But there was a virtual absence of partisanship as we processed \nthe various policy questions within the jurisdiction of that committee.\n  I regret to say, and I hope that this is a temporary aberration, if \nyou will, that this is not an auspicious beginning for us if this is \nthe way the Defense authorization conference is going to be conducted \nin future years.\n  There are Members on both sides of the political aisle who have \nserved many, many years in the Senate. These individuals have gained \nconsiderable expertise in very discrete areas dealing with the funding \nof our national defense effort, and I think their expertise would have \nbeen extremely helpful in the negotiations with our colleagues in the \nother body.\n  I note further, Mr. President, that there are major parts of the \nconference report that were discussed at this meeting which I have \ndescribed--the one which provided our office with about 30 minutes \nnotice--that were only verbally described to Senators literally minutes \nbefore the report was presented to us for signature. With respect to \nsome of these provisions, they are extremely complicated. Language is \nvery important.\n  Specifically, I note the conference report language change with \nrespect to the national missile defense provision. I must say that \nengaged colleagues on both sides of the aisle worked on the Senate-\npassed compromise version of this language. In extraordinarily \ndifficult and, I think, very instructive discussions, the Senate \nprovisions were agreed to overwhelmingly when it was acted upon on the \nfloor of the Senate. Unfortunately, this was not the experience with \nrespect to the conference negotiation.\n  The resulting conference language, in my view, is deeply flawed. It, \nindeed, may result in a violation of the ABM Treaty, and it seems to me \nthat we send all the wrong signals to the Russians. In effect, by the \ndeployment schedule specifically established in this bill at 2003, it \nseems to me, would make the Russians even more reluctant to negotiate \nany further nuclear arms reductions and give them considerable reason \nto believe that it is our intent to violate the ABM Treaty itself.\n  Another of the issues that divided us is the additional funding of \nthe B-2 bomber. It was defeated in the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthis year, in a bipartisan vote, and not included in the Defense \nauthorization bill which was passed in this Chamber. I find it \nparticularly troubling that the provision itself that would increase \nfunding to the B-2 bomber was not available at the time the conference \nreport was presented to us and we were asked to approve. Again, this is \none of the most difficult issues that the committee had to deal with, \nand I would submit that this is not the way in which we ought to be \nconducting conference negotiations.\n  Moreover, this conference report imposes new restrictions on the \nPresident's ability to obtain contingency funding for military \noperations. This is in direct contravention of the President's \nconstitutional role as our Commander in Chief. The report contains \ndirected procurement of specific ships at specific shipyards without a \nclear \n\n[[Page S18852]]\nrequirement, undermining, in my opinion, the efficiency and cost-saving \nobjectives which are of critical importance as we face very, very \ndifficult budgets in the outyears.\n  The conference report contains spending floors with respect to \nshipbuilding provisions. These are requirements to spend specified \namounts on specified projects. Again, in the real world in which we \nlive, where the budgets are going to be tighter next year and each of \nthe outyears thereafter, I find this provision unfathomable.\n  The conference report will create a special congressional panel on \nsubmarines. I must say that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have made a number of very constructive comments over the years \nwhen they talk about streamlining Government and reducing the number of \ncommittees. Adding another committee, it seems to me, is duplicative \nand creates unnecessary additional staff involvement and the \npossibility of additional funding that is just not warranted. The \nexisting panel, in which submarines are included in the jurisdictional \nportfolio, does a proper job in my judgment and a new panel just for \nsubmarines is redundant, unnecessary and unwise.\n  The conference report designates every single line of the National \nGuard and Reserve procurement funds, rather than providing generic \ncategories of funds. This, Mr. President, is contrary to requests made \nby the National Guard and Reserve.\n  The conference report dictates to the Department of Defense what \ntheir procurement priorities ought to be. It allows them to spend the \nmoney on nothing but those items deemed appropriate by the House and \nSenate. I recall in a different context a lot of criticism about \nCongress micromanaging the Pentagon. Let me suggest that I believe this \nis a case in which micromanagement has become the operative order of \nthe day.\n  I mentioned previously Pacer Coin, a program of particular interest \nin my State. The Nevada Air National Guard would receive two of those \nplanes. The conference report contains language on the Air National \nGuard's Pacer Coin mission that is patently false. The report reads, \nand I quote, ``The conferees understand that the National Guard Bureau \nhas requested that the Air Force terminate the Pacer Coin program.''\n  This statement is not true. As a matter of fact, I have a letter \ndated December 8, 1995, from Maj. Gen. Donald Shepperd, Director of the \nAir National Guard. His letter states in part, ``The Air National Guard \nalways has supported Pacer Coin and will continue to support the \nmission.'' General Shepperd's letter then goes on to say, ``It is our \nunderstanding that the Pacer Coin mission is a priority of the \nCommander in Chief, U.S. Southern Command.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of General \nShepperd's letter of December 8, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Departments of the Army and the Air Force; National Guard \n           Bureau,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 1995.\n     Senator Richard Bryan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bryan: Thank you for your December 6, 1995 \n     letter concerning the continuation of the Pacer Coin mission. \n     I assure you that the Air National Guard always has supported \n     Pacer Coin and will continue to support the mission as long \n     as there is a military requirement and the necessary \n     resources.\n       Regarding the military requirement, it is our understanding \n     that the Pacer Coin mission is a priority of the Commander-\n     in-Chief, U.S. Southern Command. In terms of necessary \n     resources, the program transferred to the Air National Guard \n     underfunded in fiscal years 96, 97, and 98. This shortfall \n     spurred budgetary exercises that may have been misconstrued \n     as a lack of support for the Pacer Coin program. My staff is \n     searching for alternatives to fund the shortfall for FY 96.\n       Again, let me reiterate my support of the Pacer Coin \n     mission and assure you that the Air National Guard will \n     support this mission as long as there is a military \n     requirement and proper funding.\n       Please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n\n                                           Donald W. Shepperd,\n\n                                              Major General, USAF,\n                                     Director, Air National Guard.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I also have a letter from Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey, commander in chief of U.S. Southern Command dated June 2, \n1995. His letter states, ``U.S. Southern Command supports retention of \nthe Pacer Coin reconnaissance program in the Air National Guard and \nperiodic deployments of the system in this theater.''\n  And again, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof General McCaffrey's letter dated June 26, 1995, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Department of Defense, U.S. Southern Command, Office of \n           the Commander in Chief,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bryan: Appreciate your concern over the \n     potential termination of the U.S. Air Force Pacer Coin \n     reconnaissance program and welcome the opportunity to share \n     the U.S. Southern Command's views on the value of this \n     important asset.\n       The U.S. Southern Command and its ground, air, and naval \n     component forces rely heavily upon releasable, high quality \n     imagery. This requirement for extensive imagery is to support \n     operational planning, exercise deployments, humanitarian \n     assistance and disaster relief operations. We also provide \n     comprehensive imagery support to U.S. Country Teams and host \n     nations throughout the region that are involved in \n     counterdrug operations.\n       As you know, however, fiscal constraints and force \n     structure reductions drove the transition of the Pacer Coin \n     program from the active force structure to the Air National \n     Guard. As a consequence, we have asked for periodic Air \n     National Guard deployments of Pacer Coin to satisfy the \n     continuing requirement for timely, high quality, broad area \n     imagery that we can release to our host nation allies in the \n     region. The U.S. Southern Command supports retention of the \n     Pacer Coin reconnaissance program in the Air National Guard \n     and periodic deployments of the system to this theater.\n           Best wishes,\n\n                                           Barry R. McCaffrey,\n\n                                               General, U.S. Army,\n                                               Commander in Chief.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I must say it has been difficult for me to understand, with two \ncommanding generals who have in one instance a National Guard command \nauthority and in the other instance an operational command of the \nSouthern Command both expressing support for the program, how the \nconference report could question the viability of this program and \nconclude that this is a program that is not supported.\n  I guess by way of general conclusion, Mr. President, I regret to say \nthat this conference has not been conducted in its historical \nbipartisan manner. Democrats were cut out from any meaningful \nparticipation in the conference itself. And I must say the Secretary of \nDefense has indicated that he will recommend a veto of this conference \nreport to the President. The National Security Council and the Pentagon \nfind the national defense missile language in this report to be wholly \nunacceptable and quite dangerous.\n  Finally, the President himself has sent a message to Congress saying \nthat he will veto this bill in its present form. For these and the \nother reasons that I have referenced in my comments, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and in the absence of any other \ncolleague in the Chamber I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. May I inquire how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 28 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first, I want to begin by commending the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for \nthe work that he has done this year in leading the effort in putting \nthis defense authorization conference report together.\n  It has been a tough year, as we all know. It has been a long and \ndifficult \n\n[[Page S18853]]\nyear with many, many complex and difficult questions. Senator Thurmond \nhas provided extraordinary leadership in bringing us to this point. I \nwant to commend him for his efforts in that regard.\n  At the same time, I want to express my disappointment that, \napparently, this conference report is going to be virtually unanimously \nopposed by our colleagues from across the aisle. I regret that, because \nwe have always, at least in my tenure, moved forward on defense bills \nin a bipartisan fashion. It appears now that we will not be doing that \nthis year. I think that is disappointing.\n  Nevertheless, I hope that our colleagues will see fit to support this \nlegislation in such a manner that it can pass the Senate, be sent to \nthe President and then he will, obviously, have to make a choice as to \nwhether or not he wants to accept the bill or veto the bill.\n  We heard a lot of Members state reasons why they will not vote for \nthe bill on the basis of what is included in the bill. What we have not \nheard is information relative to what is now in the bill that will be \nlost if it is not passed.\n  Anybody can look at a bill this massive, covering this amount of \nspending, and find reasons why they do not like a particular part of \nthe bill. I have never voted for a bill where I have agreed 100 percent \nfrom beginning to end with every provision in that bill. This is the \nart of political compromise that tries to balance the opinions of one \nHouse versus the other, the opinions of one party versus the other, the \ninterests of particular Senators in putting more emphasis on one \nportion of the bill than the other. In the end, you put a package \ntogether. You trust the major thrust of that package is in the \ndirection that you want to go.\n  So to raise specific concerns about specific items in this bill as a \nbasis for rejecting the whole bill, I think, is something that if we \npractice it on every bill that came forward, nothing would pass in this \nbody.\n  But as I said, Members have stated that there are items in the bill \nthat they do not like and, therefore, they will not vote for the bill. \nI would like to list, as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, what \nwill be lost if this bill is not passed. I think Members ought to \nconsider some of this before they make a final determination on how \nthey will vote.\n  Do Senators understand that the full pay raise, which is only 2.4 \npercent, but the full pay raise to our troops in uniform, including \nthose on the way to Bosnia and those deployed in areas around the \nworld, will not be granted if this bill is not passed? The \nauthorization for the full pay raise is included in this legislation \nand that will not go forward unless this bill is passed.\n  Reserve mobilization insurance will not be established. Several bonus \nauthorities for enlistment and reenlistment will not be authorized. At \na time when we have a shrinking defense force and we are trying to find \nthe top quality people, the bonuses for enlistment and reenlistment \nthat are incentives to attract the kind of people we need will not be \navailable.\n  A whole series of quality of life initiatives will be lost. We keep \ntalking about our No. 1 priority for our troops is quality of life. We \nneed to provide them with the best training and the best equipment and \nthe best leadership, but we also need to provide them with a quality of \nlife that will allow they and their families to make a career \ncommitment to service in our military. A whole series of initiatives on \nquality of life will be lost.\n  Let me just mention some of them. There will be no increased quarters \nallowance to close the gap of housing cost increases. This quarters \nallowance equals 5.2 percent in the bill. Without it, it will be 2 \npercent. That means when a soldier and his or her family are stationed \nin particular areas of the country and sufficient base housing is not \navailable for them, as is the case in most instances, they have to go \nout into the local market. When they go out into the local market, the \nallowance that they are given for their quarters does not begin to \ncover the cost of housing in that particular area. We give quarters \nallowance to cover that, but it has not kept pace with the increase in \nhousing costs, and so soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and \ntheir families will be put at a continued even greater disadvantage \nthan they have been in the past.\n  There will be no authority to pay quarters allowance for NCO's on \nships or NCO's who currently live in inadequate quarters. These are \npeople who are key to the successful functioning of our military, and \nthey will not receive quarters allowance unless this bill is passed.\n  There will be no authority to pay family separation allowances to \ncertain single soldiers.\n  There will be no authority to pay enlisted airmen hazardous duty \nincentive.\n  There will be no authority to pay special duty pay to personnel \nassigned to tenders.\n  There will be no authority to pay increased special duty pay to \nrecruiters.\n  There will be no authority to pay dislocation allowances to those \nforced to move as a result of the BRAC process.\n  There will be no more automatic increase of servicemen's life \ninsurance. At a time when we are deploying troops to Bosnia to \nundertake the risks that will be involved in this, there will be no \nautomatic life insurance increase. That was included in our bill.\n  There will be no COLA equity for military retirees, and I will \ndiscuss that in a moment.\n  There are a number of service academy issues that will not be \naddressed.\n  Two Navy P-3 squadrons will not be authorized.\n  There will be no floor on military technicians, a critical request \nmade by the service chiefs and others as they came before our \ncommittee. As the equipment becomes more sophisticated, we need people \nwho have more technological capability to repair and deal with this \nequipment, and this is a very important part of the authorization bill \nauthority, and that will not be provided.\n  Dental/medical benefits, CHAMPUS benefits for certain members of the \ntotal force will not be included. These, just from the Personnel \nSubcommittee, are items that we will not have if this bill is defeated \nor if the President vetoes it.\n  Let me discuss one other. There is a whole series of initiatives to \nprovide new authorities for the provision of new housing, repaired \nhousing, restored housing for our military personnel.\n  Why is this important? Because over the last 30 years, while we have \nmade some remarkable strides in providing our troops with training and \nequipment, we have ignored their living quarters, the repair, \nmaintenance, and the construction of new quarters. Currently, on the \nmilitary's own estimate on the basis of their own standards--and I \nsuggest their standards are not the standards that are found generally \nin housing construction throughout this country; they are lower \nstandards. Even by their standards, many of the housing units, most of \nwhich are over 30 years old, are in a state of disrepair. In fact, by \nDepartment of Defense standards, over 80 percent of the existing \nmilitary housing is inadequate. Let me repeat that. Over 80 percent of \nthe housing that we ask our military families and ask our single \nmilitary personnel to live in is inadequate. It is substandard and it \nneeds repair, maintenance, and some of it needs to be torn down. A lot \nof new units need to be built.\n  Under the current rate of funding for this repair, maintenance, and \nconstruction, it will take 30 years to remedy the problem. Of course, \nin 30 years, the problem that is remedied this year and in succeeding \nyears will then be inadequate. So we are getting nowhere. Under the \ndirection of the Secretary of Defense, Bill Perry, under the very able \nleadership of former Secretary of the Army, John Marsh, and an internal \nas well as external task force, a year's worth of effort has culminated \nin a plan to very substantially upgrade military housing on an \naccelerated basis. Because we are faced with a budget crunch that does \nnot provide the immediate funds, new housing authorities are requested \nby the department, so that we can use methods that are used by the \ncivilian housing authorities, which exist in virtually every one of our \nStates, to leverage funds to begin to dramatically accelerate the \nrehabilitation and construction of new quarters for our personnel.\n  We are asking individuals to commit a career, a lifetime, to the \nservice, and that means that we are moving from \n\n[[Page S18854]]\nsingle enlisted people that formerly were brought into the service by \nthe draft, as I entered, and now, instead of a 2, 3, or 4-year \ncommitment, people are making a lifetime commitment. Most of those \npeople are bringing their families with them--their spouses and \nchildren. For this country to ask individuals to put on the uniform and \nprovide for our defense and not provide for adequate housing, I \nbelieve, is a disgrace. It is a disgrace to ask these people to live in \nthe housing and the quarters that they currently live in.\n  I have personally visited the family quarters and the bachelor \nquarters on a number of bases throughout this country and some \noverseas. I would not put my family in some of these living situations, \nand either would anybody else in this Senate. I would not begin to ask \nmy family to live under some of the conditions that our service \npersonnel live in, without complaint. The least we can do for these \npeople who make this commitment to provide for our security and our \nfreedom is give them adequate living quarters. Roofs are caving in, \nceilings are caving in, water is running down the walls, broken \nplumbing, exterior windows cracked, cold air rushing through. You do \nnot need air conditioning if you live in a cold climate because it \ncomes right through the windows and the walls.\n  I think one of the things that I will regret the most if this bill \nfails, either in the Senate vote or if it is vetoed by the President, \nis the loss of authority to do what Secretary Perry has asked us to \nprovide--to accelerate the reconstruction and the maintenance and \nrepairs of some of our housing that we provide for our military \npersonnel. That is what we lose just from the personnel section of this \nbill. I do not have the time to go into other sections.\n  There have been a number of allegations made here about some of the \nadditional problems that exist. I would like to address one of those \npoints, because it seems to be a major sticking point for several \nMembers--that is, the statutory authority that exists providing for the \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation. What Members need to \nunderstand is that the conference report does not abolish this office. \nThis is an important office, as is the Office for Special Operations \nand Low Intensity Conflict. But what the committee is attempting to \naddress is a situation where the Department wants the flexibility to \nreview the way it is organized, to make determinations as to how it \nwants to be structured and then report to us as a committee by March 1 \nof 1996. The repeal of the statutory authority, first of all, does not \neven take place until January 1, 1997. It is not prejudicial because we \nare asking the Secretary of Defense to report to us by March 1 of next \nyear his recommendations as to how the Department can be reorganized so \nit can operate in the most efficient manner. They are feeling the \nbudget squeeze. They know they need to make decisions relative to how \nthey can better organize to achieve savings.\n  All we are doing is repealing the requirement for specific positions \non a statutory basis. It does not mean the position will be eliminated. \nWe then, as a committee, will have the opportunity to review the \nreport, question the Secretary, and look at and evaluate their \nreorganization plan, and we can decide that we want to retain these \nstatutory provisions.\n  There is no doubt that the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation is an important position. Senator Nunn, on this floor, very \naccurately described the nature of the position and the independence of \nthe incumbent director. I fully expect that Secretary Perry will ask \nthat this position be retained. The key factor is that he will make \nthat recommendation on the merits, not because he was encumbered by a \nstatutory protection. That is the goal of this legislation. Meritorious \nrecommendations by the Secretary of Defense, not abolition of one \nposition or another.\n  The legislation is intentionally crafted to permit any repeal to be \nvitiated before it is implemented, if that is the appropriate outcome. \nThere has been a lot of misinformation about this part of the bill, and \nif Senators will take the time to review the actual language and \nunderstand the intent, I am confident that they will see this as a \nworkable solution. So I urge my colleagues who may be thinking of \nvoting against the bill, on this provision alone, to look at the \nconference report and understand what it is we are attempting to do.\n  Now, Mr. President, second, I want to take some remaining time here \nand just put this Defense authorization debate in the broader context \nof the budget debate, because it has been said on this floor on \nnumerous occasions by numerous Members that if we were really serious \nabout reducing the deficit, we would reduce defense spending. We would \ntake this defense bill, which they say is sacrosanct from spending, and \nwe would begin to take savings out of Defense. I do not know where \nthose Members have been for the last 10 years. But as Senator Nunn said \non this floor just about a year ago, ``Those who claim that Defense has \nnot been substantially reduced since the end of the cold war are flat \nout wrong. The Defense Department, in the past few years, has carried \nmore than its fair share of sacrifice for lowering the deficit. Indeed, \nthe Defense Department seems to be the only part of the Federal \nGovernment that has carried its fair share.'' Let me repeat that one \nstatement again. ``Those who claim that Defense has not been \nsubstantially reduced since the end of the cold war are flat out \nwrong.'' They ignore the facts.\n\n  To say defense is the area that needs to be reduced so that we could \nprove our commitment to deficit reduction ignores reality. The fiscal \nyear 1996 budget request for defense is at the 1975 spending level in \nconstant dollars. The 1997 level is at the 1955 level. Since 1985, we \nhave reduced defense procurement 71 percent. Research, development, \ntesting, and evaluation funds have been reduced 57 percent. By 1999, \ndefense spending as a share of the gross national product will have \ndeclined to 2.8 percent, the lowest since before World War II.\n  We are now entering the 11th straight year of declining defense \nbudgets. We have cut active duty personnel by 32 percent. That is the \nlowest level in 60 years. The Army will have 45 percent fewer \ndivisions, the Navy 37 percent fewer battle force ships, and the Air \nForce 40 percent fewer attack and fighter aircraft.\n  Now, defense spending, which has decreased--just in the 10-year \ndecade, the decade of the 1990's, defense spending will decrease 35 \npercent. What are we doing with the rest of the budget? Domestic \ndiscretionary spending, during that same time period, increases 12 \npercent; welfare and mandatory spending will increase by 38 percent. \nThose that say defense has not done its share are ignoring the facts.\n  If some of these other nondefense areas of the budget had done one-\ntenth of what defense has done, we would not be debating the need for a \nbalanced budget. We would have achieved a balanced budget. Name me one \nprogram in the Federal Government, outside of defense, that has even \nbegun to reach the decrease in spending that defense has. Name me one \nprogram that has been reduced at all.\n  The challenge is not to further reduce defense. The challenge is to \nlook at the other programs that are driving our costs out of sight, \nthat are squeezing our ability to provide for an adequate defense.\n  At the same time that defense spending is reducing dramatically and \nthe number of personnel are reducing dramatically, the requirements for \ndeployments are increasing. We have shrunk our forces in Europe from \n314,000 prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. That number is now \nrapidly approaching 100,000. Yet those remaining forces have been \ndeployed in more missions in the last 5 years than in the previous 45 \nyears combined. The average soldier now spends approximately 138 days \neach year away from home on extended short-notice deployments. This is \ncombined with extensive training, away from home, in order to maintain \nthe critical skills necessary. That is a tremendous strain on those \npersonnel and particularly on their families.\n  Our Navy surface ships are away from home at tempos in excess of 130 \ndays per year--that is away from home. That does not count the short-\nterm deployments to prepare them for the longer term deployment.\n  The Marines currently have 24,000 people--pre-Bosnia--24,000 people \ndeployed overseas carrying out a whole \n\n[[Page S18855]]\nnumber of 911 fast-reaction assignments. The Air Force has had a \nfourfold increase in the deployment obligations over the last 7 years, \nwhile drawing down its overall end strength by a third.\n  So we have troops deployed all over the world on all kinds of \nmissions and yet we have fewer number of personnel to allocate to these \ndeployments. What does that mean? Longer deployments, longer time away \nfrom home, more strain and stress on the force.\n  We have a serious gap that is opening between our military mission \nand the level of funding we provide. The Armed Services Committee this \nyear, under the very able leadership of our chairman, has done the very \nbest that we can to take this limited budget and stretch it in a way \nthat begins to meet the needs of our Armed Forces.\n  To those who say, ``We have added $6.7 billion and the Pentagon \ndidn't request it.'' If the Pentagon were calling the shots their \nbudget requests would have been a lot higher than they were. They are \nnot. They get a number from the President. The President's Office of \nManagement and Budget says, ``Here is your number, now make it work.'' \nThese people are trained to salute and say, ``Yes, sir.'' Ask any one \nof them, as we have in our hearings, do you need more, could you use \nmore, would you like to have more? Their answers were ``Yes, we \nwould.''\n  There are a number of things we would like to deal with but we \nrecognize we are constrained by this budget and therefore we have done \nthe best we could. We are on the razor's edge of readiness. We are \nworried about procurement in the future. We are not updating our \nequipment. We are sacrificing quality of life, but we have to live \nwithin this budget number. We will do the best that we can. They do a \nterrific job. To say they do not want the additional resources, that \nthis extra money that Republicans have provided, $6.7 billion, is \nwasted money is simply not the case.\n  You can argue over how that ought to be allocated. It is not \nallocated 100 percent the way I would like to allocate. The defense \nbudget has been declining now for 11 straight years. It is certainly \nnot some Government program run amok without control, as so many others \nhave.\n  Mr. President, balancing our books is one of the most important \nduties of Government, but it is not the first duty of Government. The \nfirst duty of Government is the defense of this country, without \nneedless risk to the men and women who serve. That means more than \ndefending our borders. It means shaping a security environment that \nwill be favorable to America in the future. It means providing our \ntroops with the training they need, the equipment they require, the \nkind of leadership that provides for success, and the quality of life \nthat gives them a stake in the future of this country, that provides \nfor their families while they are away on deployment.\n  We are asking fewer people to do more with less. As I speak, we are \ndeploying 20,000 troops, and many more thousands of support troops, in \nthis effort to Bosnia. They are fighting terrible weather, as we can \nsee every day on CNN. They are fighting some of the world's worst \nterrain. They are engaging in a mission that many of us still are \ntrying to figure out what the mission is. It is a mission that is \nfraught with risk.\n  We are asking and have asked and will continue to ask a great deal of \nthe men and women who wear the uniform of this country. The very least \nwe can do with this type of budget constraint is to provide them with \nthe best that we can. To reject this bill now, I believe, sends an \nabsolutely wrong signal.\n  We talked about sending signals on the floor last week. What kind of \nsignal do we send, with all the authorities, the quality of life \ninitiatives, and other items in this bill. What kind of signal do we \nsend to the troops right now trying to fight fog, the weather, the \nsnow, and the landings on a runway they cannot see, in a mountainous \narea of Bosnia? Deploying into terrible weather and terrible terrain on \na mission they are not sure exactly what it is. What kind of signal do \nwe send, that the Senate rejects the bill that takes care of their \nfamilies while they are gone? The Senate rejects the bill that provides \nthe authorities we need to have a successful military effort? That is a \nterrible signal to send.\n  If Members want to talk about sending a signal; walk down here now \nand vote. Just because there is a piece of the bill that you do not \nlike or because this is now partisan politics and we did not get in \nenough of the discussions about what the final bill should look like. \nTherefor in a fit of pique you register your displeasure with it, I \nthink that is a terrible mistake. It is a terrible time for our troops, \nas we approach Christmas, as our troops are leaving their families and \ngoing into a very uncertain, risky situation in the world's worst \nterrain and climate--to now reject this bill would be a huge mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues who may be having reservations, ask us what the \nfacts are, look at what is in the bill, let us work with you to resolve \ndifferences next year, but do not tell our troops that we are not going \nto give them these authorities and we will not provide for their future \nas included in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator from \nIndiana for the excellent remarks he has made on this bill. He is a \nvaluable member of our Armed Services Committee and made a fine \ncontribution throughout this year to the work of that committee. We \nappreciate it very much, Senator, all that you do for your country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Am I not correct \nthat the Senate is due to stand in recess now until the hour of 2:15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nproceed for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to join the distinguished chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee in recognizing the valuable \ncontributions consistently made by the Senator from Indiana and his \nvery stirring and moving remarks of a few minutes ago. He is recognized \non our committee as an expert in the area of personnel, and I am \npleased to hear that, as he addressed our colleagues this morning, he \nmade specific reference to the families of the men and women of the \nArmed Forces and of course his reference to those now being deployed to \nBosnia.\n  As the Senator well knows, there are some 100 ships on the high seas, \nall over the world today, and men and women of the Armed Forces \nstationed in many other countries. So this message not only relates to \nthose that, perhaps, are foremost in our minds on the Bosnia \ndeployment, but, indeed, to men and women on the high seas and in \nvarious posts in farflung parts of the world. I compliment my good \nfriend for his remarks.\n  Mr. President, it has been my great privilege to serve these 17 years \non the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I share the concerns of so \nmany that, as we approach the vote on this bill, there remains in the \nminds of some, doubts about whether or not this bill meets their \nindividual expectations.\n  I have had those same doubts through these 16 previous years about \nother defense conference reports and, indeed, the bill itself, as it \nhas left the Armed Services Committee. But each time, I have found a \nmeans by which to reconcile my differences and to join the other side \nof the aisle in support of the bill. This year, under the very able \nleadership of the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, a \nman who has a career associated with the armed services unparalleled in \nlength to any Member of this Chamber, having joined the Armed Forces in \nthe early stages of World War II, at the time when he was not even \nsubject to the draft--he went out and volunteered. He resigned as a \njudge, and was proud to wear the uniform of his country, and he did so \nwith great distinction, being the only Member of the U.S. Senate to \nhave participated in the historic Normandy invasion in June 1944.\n  So, I pay great respect to my chairman. Beginning in the early stages \nof World War II, he started his preparations to serve in this Chamber \nand serve as a true representative for the men and women of the Armed \nForces. Shortly we will be voting on this conference report, which will \nbe the first \n\n[[Page S18856]]\nbill of the Senate Armed Services Committee which proudly bears his \nname as chairman.\n  Let me address two specifics. I was concerned about references to the \nsubmarine panel. This was not an idea that originated in the Senate. \nTogether with Senator Lieberman, Senator Robb, and Senator Cohen, I \nworked on the provisions relating to submarines in this bill and we \nrecognize there was no need for this panel. But the House did. The \nHouse even wanted stronger measures.\n  Negotiations related to submarines were perhaps one of the most \ndifficult part of the negotiations with the House of Representatives \nand the Senate. Out of it came the concept to have a panel to consist \nof three members from each committee, appointed by their respective \nchairmen on a bipartisan basis and reporting back to their respective \ncommittees. I, therefore, do not believe there is any invasion of the \nauthority of the two committees on the armed services in the two \nbodies. In fact, I view some positive aspects in this concept. Because, \nas one looks at the former Soviet Union today, and most particularly \nRussia, that is where a disproportionate amount of their annual \ninvestment in national security goes--right into research and \ndevelopment and production of first-line submarines, submarines that \nchallenge our finest submarines in the seven seas of the world today.\n  So I think every bit of intellect, every bit of wisdom that we can \nincorporate on behalf of our Nation into future submarine production is \ntime and effort well spent. That, I think, will be a positive \ncontribution. I hope I will be considered to be a part of this special \npanel on submarines, since in my State we are proud to have a shipyard \nwhich for many years has built some of the finest submarines, not only \nfor our Navy, but anywhere in the world.\n  Then, Mr. President, turning to a second item, the Guard and Reserve, \nthis has been a debate through the years. The Senator from Michigan \ntried, I think, to convince our committee--subsequently tried to \nconvince the floor--of his desire to have a different approach to the \nGuard and Reserve. He is a very valued member of our committee. He \nunderstands the subject of the Guard and Reserve. And, like so many of \nus, we express our best judgment and seek to try to be convincing among \nour colleagues. He did that on two occasions and the majority of the \nSenate in the committee and on the floor decided on a different means \nto address the Guard and Reserve. So the battle was fought. The battle \nwas decided. We go on with our business.\n  Of course, he has a perfect right to come and express such \ndisappointment as may remain on this subject. But nevertheless, we have \na solid provision in this bill for the Guard and Reserve and it \nreflects the majority views of the Armed Services Committee as well as \nthe Senate as a whole.\n  These are just two examples of where there are differences between \nMembers on the other side of the aisle and Members on this side, but I \nplead with my colleagues to think, in the spirit of reconciliation, as \nwe do so frequently in this Chamber, and particularly as it relates to \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces and sending that message. When, \nfrom the Chair, that vote is announced, we want to send a positive \nmessage all across the world and on the high seas. I urge my colleagues \nto support this conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from Virginia \nfor the excellent remarks he has made on this bill. The Senator from \nVirginia was once Secretary of the Navy. He served in the Marines. He \nis a valuable member of the Armed Services Committee. He has rendered \nlong service here and with great distinction to country and I want to \ncommend him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished senior colleague. \nMy career both in the Senate and, indeed, in the uniform of the United \nStates, falls far short of that of the senior Senator from South \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18835-7", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe 15 minutes of time has been \nallotted to the Senator from Nebraska under the unanimous-consent \nrequest. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I will take that time at this moment.\n  Mr. President, if the average American was to read the 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Act conference report now before the Senate, he or she \nmight believe that there was a mistake in the printing of the bill's \ntitle. The content of the conference agreement, the rhetoric in the \nreport, and the pork add-ons contained in the legislation are more in \nkeeping with the cold war environment of 1986, not the post-cold-war \nworld of 1996.\n  I voted against the Senate version of the authorization bill earlier \nthis year based on my belief that the $7 billion increase in spending \nauthority contained in the bill was extravagant and that the bill's \nspending priorities and legislative restrictions were harmful, yes \nharmful, to our national security interests. I am dismayed to report \nthat the conference report is even more objectionable on these counts \nthan the Senate-passed version. As a result, I will vote against the \nNational Defense authorization conference report for the first time in \nmy 17 years as a U.S. Senator, a decision I do not come to lightly.\n  With very little participation solicited from the minority, the \nmajority in the Senate and House have finally reached an agreement on a \nbill that will be greeted with cheers from the multibillion-dollar \ndefense corporations in America. At a time when much of the Federal \nGovernment has run out of money and is shut down, at a time when the \nCongress is cutting domestic programs to the bone and the majority \nparty is trying to push through an unwise $245 billion tax cut, we are \nconsidering a bill that adds $7.1 billion to the defense budget that \nthe President did not ask for and our military leaders do not want.\n  This bill writes checks for unneeded weapons systems that will have \ndefense corporations popping champagne corks around the country. \nChristmas has indeed come early for these multibillion-dollar \ncorporations, and their gifts are beyond their wildest hopes. I implore \nevery American that is asked to do with less this coming year due to \nthe Republican budget-cutting ax to keep in mind the \nfollowing glittering, gilded ornaments hung with care by the majority \non the defense corporate tree:\n\n  $700 million in unrequested funds for an accelerated star wars \nprogram, a mere down payment on a system which has already cost the \nAmerican taxpayers $35 billion and will likely cost another $48 billion \nto build;\n  $493 million in unrequested funds to restart the B-2 bomber program \nbeyond the 20 planes already bought, again a mere down payment on a $30 \nbillion procurement plan;\n  $23 million in unrequested funds for 4 additional medium range army \naircraft;\n  $76 million in unrequested funds for Longbow helicopter \nmodifications;\n  $140 million in unrequested funds for Kiowa helicopter modifications;\n  $32 million in unrequested funds for ground support avionics;\n  $37 million in unrequested funds to buy 750 additional Hellfire \nmissiles;\n  $36 million in unrequested funds to buy 450 additional Javelin \nmissiles;\n  $43 million in unrequested funds to buy 1,500 additional MLRS \nmissiles;\n  $50 million in unrequested funds to buy MLRS launchers;\n  $18 million in unrequested funds to buy 29 additional Army tactical \nmissiles;\n\n[[Page S18857]]\n\n  $14 million in unrequested funds to buy Army tracked vehicles;\n  $82 million in unrequested funds to buy Howitzers;\n  $34 million in unrequested funds for improved Army recovery vehicles\n  $110 million in unrequested funds for M-1 modifications;\n  $44 million in unrequested funds for Army regional maintenance \ntraining sites;\n  $29 million in unrequested funds to buy 10,000 additional machine \nguns;\n  $33 million in unrequested funds to buy 2,100 additional grenade \nlaunchers;\n  $14 million in unrequested funds to buy 28,000 additional M-16 \nrifles;\n  $50 million in unrequested funds for small caliber ammunition;\n  $47 million in unrequested funds for mortar ammunition;\n  $80 million in unrequested funds for tank ammunition;\n  $33 million in unrequested funds for artillery ammunition;\n  $30 million in unrequested funds for mines;\n  $49 million in unrequested funds for ammunition production support;\n  $327 million in unrequested funds to buy Army trucks;\n  $136 million in unrequested funds for Army communications;\n  $81 million in unrequested funds to buy 4 additional AV-8 Harrier \nplanes;\n  $213 million in unrequested funds to buy 6 additional F-18 planes;\n  $65 million in unrequested funds to buy 6 additional Sea Cobra \nhelicopters;\n  $45 million in unrequested funds to buy 17 additional T-39 trainer \naircraft;\n  $165 million in unrequested funds for EA-6 modifications;\n  $42 million in unrequested funds for F-14 modifications;\n  $32 million in unrequested funds for P-3 modifications;\n  $30 million in unrequested funds for ECM modifications;\n  $40 million in unrequested funds to buy 45 additional Harpoon \nmissiles;\n  $49 million in unrequested funds for Tomahawk missile modifications;\n  $30 million in unrequested funds for Navy support equipment;\n  $1.4 billion in unrequested funds to buy a LHD-1 assault ship;\n  $974 million in unrequested funds to buy a LPD-17 amphibious ship;\n  $430 million in unrequested funds for Navy ammunition;\n  $15 million in unrequested funds for C-3 countermeasures;\n  $14 million in unrequested funds for Satcom ship terminals;\n  $17 million in unrequested funds for sonobuoys;\n  $30 million in unrequested funds for intelligence support equipment;\n\n  $34 million in unrequested for Marine Corps training devices;\n  $361 million in unrequested funds for F-15 Advance procurement and \nmodifications;\n  $159 million in unrequested funds for F-16 procurement;\n  $133 million in unrequested funds to buy 3 WC-130 aircraft;\n  $96 million in unrequested funds for C-135 modifications;\n  $63 million in unrequested funds for Air Force aircraft \nmodifications;\n  $40 million in unrequested funds to buy 100 additional GBU-15 \nmissiles;\n  $38 million in unrequested funds to buy 54 additional Have Nap \nmissiles;\n  $15 million in unrequested funds to 100 additional cruise missiles;\n  $344 million in unrequested funds for Air Force ammunition;\n  $20 million in unrequested funds for Cyclone class ships;\n  $17 million in unrequested funds for 2 additional special operations \ncraft;\n  $777 million in unrequested National Guard and Reserve equipment \nspecifically ear-marked for weapons systems such as 10 new C-139 \naircraft and 2 new C-26 operational aircraft.\n  The list I have just recited is a lengthy one indeed, but it only \nscratches the surface; there are dozens of other programs where the \nmajority has increased the administration's request and provided money \nfor programs the Pentagon has said they do not need while cutting \nprograms it says it does need.\n  The decorations that the majority have hung on the corporate tree are \nnumerous and expensive. Defense lobbyists have had a banner year to be \nsure. In addition to the $7 billion in unjustified spending, this \nconference report contains a number of provisions which will make for a \nprofitable 1996 for some of the biggest American corporations, \nincluding:\n  A taxpayer-financed loan program to export weapons to the third \nworld;\n  An earmarked noncompetitive ship maintenance contract for a specific \nshipyard;\n  Numerous earmarked Energy Department projects and programs;\n  Authorization allowing a waiver of research and development funds \nowed the Government by defense contractors; and\n  Costly buy-American requirements which will drive up the cost to \ntaxpayers of future procurements.\n  As I said at the beginning of my speech, this Defense authorization \nis not forward looking, it is backward looking. If the Senate had to \nmeet truth-in-advertising requirements, the clerk would be obliged to \nchange the year ``1996''on the cover of this report to ``1986.'' \nHowever, the cold war flavor of this bill goes beyond the inflated, \nparochial spending I have discussed up to this point. The legislative \nrequirements of the conference report are equally extreme. The most \ntroublesome is the missile defense language that commits our Nation to \ndeploying a national missile defense system within the next 8 years at \na likely cost of $48 billion against a threat that does not and will \nnot exist. The son of star wars system mandated in this bill would be \nineffective against terrorist threats, abrogate the ABM Treaty and \nlikely take with it Russian implementation of START I and START II, not \nto mention endangering prospects of ratifying next year the chemical \nweapons convention and a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.\n  With logic right out of Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in Wonderland,'' the \nmajority wants the American taxpayer to spend $48 billion to defend \nagainst a threat which does not exist, the very course of action which \nwill prompt the Russians to renege on their commitment to destroy two-\nthirds of their nuclear weapons, thereby reviving the threat that never \nwould have existed had we not pursued the system in the first place. As \nthat famous cartoon Bayou Alligator might have said: ``We have met the \nenemy and he is us.''\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would just like to offer at this time \nfor printing at the conclusion of my remarks an article that appeared \nin the Sunday Washington Post of December 17.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. I would just comment briefly on the fact that this starts \nout ``Off to a bad Start II. In both the United States and Russia, \nHopes for Strategic Arms Pact Are Fading.'' It goes on to describe the \ndelays that we have caused. The concern of the Russians that we are \nabout to break the ABM Treaty was one of the causes I suggest for the \nreturn of the Communist Party to a measure of strength in the elections \nover the last week, because they are feeding on the situation that we \ndo not care and we are going to break out of the ABM Treaty.\n  In conclusion then, Mr. President, the Clinton administration has \nsaid that it would veto this bill if it reaches his desk. I support the \nPresident in this decision and believe that the Senate should save him \nthe trouble by defeating this conference report.\n  The American taxpayer cannot afford this expensive gilded Christmas \ntree of unneeded weapons and corporate earmarks. Likewise, the American \nnational security interests can ill-afford this self-defeating policy \nembodied in this bill, forcing us back to the chill of the cold war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back any time remaining \nassigned to this Senator.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 1995]\n\n                         Off to a Bad START II\n\n               (By Rodney W. Jones and Yuri K. Nazarkin)\n\n       After months of delay, the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee moved last week to bring the START II treaty up for \n     a vote on the Senate floor. The pact would reduce U.S. and \n     Russian strategic nuclear weapons to 70 percent of Cold War \n     levels and also eliminate land-based multiple-warhead \n     missiles, the most threatening of Russia's weapons. \n     Unfortunately, while a favorable Senate vote on the treaty is \n     virtually assured, ratification of the pact by Russia has \n     become increasingly uncertain in recent months. As Russians \n     go to the polls today, many will be voting for politicians \n     who question whether START II is still in Russia's best \n     interest.\n       The prime cause of Russian second thoughts, according to \n     parliamentarians and \n\n[[Page S18858]]\n     defense experts in Moscow, is the Republican-led effort that began this \n     summer to mandate the deployment of a multi-site strategic \n     anti-ballistic missile, or ABM, system by the year 2003. This \n     system was called for originally in the Senate version of the \n     defense authorization bill and endorsed last week by a House-\n     Senate conference committee. Yet it would violate the 1972 \n     ABM Treaty, which for more than two decades has helped \n     curtail a costly buildup of defensive nuclear weapons and \n     countervailing offensive weapons.\n       It first became clear that START II was in serious trouble \n     last month when parliamentary leaders in Moscow who had \n     supported START II hearings in July concluded that a \n     ratification vote in the waning months of 1995 would fail. To \n     avoid a foreign policy crisis over a negative vote, they \n     postponed further action on the treaty.\n       Regrettably, the prospect for unconditional Russian \n     ratification of START II next year is no more promising. \n     Following today's election, the State Duma, Russia's lower \n     house of parliament, is expected to be even more critical of \n     START II and of the United States than its predecessor. \n     Russian political parties and factions opposed to the treaty \n     will probably gain seats at the expense of the reformist and \n     democratic parties that generally support it. President Boris \n     Yeltsin's poor health and the growth of assertive nationalism \n     in Russia further clouds START II's chances.\n       Even the Russian military leadership, which had steadfastly \n     supported START II, shows signs of cooling toward the treaty \n     in the wake of U.S. congressional action threatening the ABM \n     Treaty. The Russian military fears the United States' real \n     intent is to gain strategic superiority over Russia. The \n     Russian military dismisses as preposterous U.S. assertions \n     that the legislation is aimed at protecting American soil \n     from the threat of a handful of long-range missiles from \n     North Korea and other small countries. In effect, Russian \n     military leaders argue, the United States would be deploying \n     new defense missiles just as Russian was completing the \n     reduction of its offensive missiles under START II's \n     requirements. Russian would be more vulnerable and the United \n     States less so.\n       Ivan Rybkin, the Duma speaker, expressed the growing \n     disenchantment with START II in the newspaper Nezavissimaya \n     Gazeta on Nov. 5: ``We cannot be bothered any longer, given \n     this situation that propels plans for NATO enlargement and \n     reveals our U.S. congressional colleagues' intentions to \n     begin a process that threatens the ABM Treaty--the \n     cornerstone of the existing arms control regime.''\n       Russian misgivings about START II haven't come overnight. \n     Initially Yeltsin and the Russian military leadership firmly \n     believed that START II was in Russia's interest. They \n     recognized benefits for Russia--the fact that START II's deep \n     reductions would enhance stability, reduce future defense \n     costs, ensure formal strategic parity with the United States \n     and contribute to long-term cooperation between the two \n     powers. The Clinton administration also worked to alleviate \n     Russian uneasiness over U.S. national missile defense \n     activities. But the ABM developments of late have changed \n     Russian feelings toward START II.\n       If Clinton vetoes the defense authorization bill as he has \n     promised, a direct conflict over the ABM Treaty will be \n     avoided. Congressional direction of the U.S. military might \n     then be provided exclusively in the defense appropraitons \n     bill. That legislation, which the president approved earlier \n     this month, says nothing about deploying an ABM system.\n       This silence, however, is unlikely to assuage Russian \n     concerns, since Russian must worry that the ABM issue will \n     return in the next congressional session. Moreover, the \n     appropriations bill mandates completion of the Navy's ``Upper \n     Tier'' system, a defense initiative to produce shorter-range \n     missiles that Russia also finds objectionable because of its \n     potential for use against long-range weapons.\n       Russian arms control experts are also troubled by the \n     thinking of some U.S. lawmakers who believe that the AMB \n     Treaty is an obsolete Cold War measure. The Russians point \n     out that if the ABM Treaty is to be revised in light of the \n     post-Cold War situation, they see it as equally reasonable to \n     amend and adapt the START treaties. After all, they argue, \n     the cumbersome and intrusive START verification provisions \n     were elaborated in a climate of mutual suspicion and mistrust \n     and were based on worst-case scenarios about the other side's \n     intentions.\n       These Russian critics suggest that Moscow's obligations \n     under START II are largely irrelevant to current realities. \n     The Russians are required by the treaty to alter the \n     structure of their strategic triad by 2003. This will entail \n     sizable expenditures both to eliminate all multiple-warhead \n     land-based ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) and to \n     replace them with single warhead missiles. Given the current \n     U.S.-Russian partnership, Russian START II critics argue, \n     such measures are not essential to the strategic security of \n     both nations and should be open to revision.\n       The Russians are completely uninterested in negotiating \n     amendments to fundamental provisions of the ABM Treaty. This \n     apparently was well understood by those pushing the \n     antiballistic missile initiative in Congress, for they also \n     included the possible alternative of U.S. withdrawal from the \n     ABM Treaty. Russia might consider changes to the ABM Treaty--\n     but only along with parallel changes in START II.\n       Would this be acceptable to U.S. officials, legislators and \n     1996 Republican presidential candidates? Renegotiating \n     current nuclear treaties with the purpose of adapting them to \n     new realities--as instruments for regulating the nuclear \n     forces of both nations--would mean embarking on a long and \n     formidable process.\n       If the United States is not prepared to enter such a \n     process, yet withdraws from the ABM Treaty or takes steps in \n     that direction, if would mean the end of START II--the end of \n     real, dramatic reductions in the numbers of the world's most \n     destructive weapons.\n       Is it still possible to resuscitate START II in Russia? \n     Right now, it seems unlikely. If Clinton vetoes the defense \n     authorization, with its ABM mandate, the prospects for saving \n     START II would improve, but only slightly.\n       Russian opponents of START II may now insist on delaying \n     Russian ratification until the results of the 1996 U.S. \n     presidential (and congressional) elections can be evaluated. \n     Repairing the growing damage to U.S.-Russian relations and \n     U.S. interests in nuclear threat reduction will become \n     steadily more difficult unless Congress revives the tradition \n     of bipartisan statesmanship on nuclear weapons issues that \n     has prevailed since the end of the Cold War.\n\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Maine yield for a question?\n  Mr. COHEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand under the prior UC that the \nSenator from Vermont at some appropriate time--not now, the Senator \nfrom Maine has the floor--but the Senator from Vermont would be \nrecognized for not to exceed 20 minutes on the landmines issue. I \nwonder if it would be appropriate--I see the distinguished chairman on \nthe floor--that I ask unanimous consent that upon completion of the \ncomments of the Senator from Maine that I be recognized for my time? If \nthere is somebody else who wants it, I am perfectly willing to do a \ndifferent time. I wonder if that would be satisfactory.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Can I inquire as to whether my 20 minutes starts now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Maine?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, we just heard a standard display of \nDemocratic rhetoric from our colleague from Nebraska. According to my \ncolleague from Nebraska, whatever the Pentagon sends up here, Congress \nis duty bound to oblige. If they send up a bill requesting certain \nsystems, we either have to accept them or reject them, but no \ndiscretion is left for us to exercise, I gather from the statement of \nmy colleague from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I recall when they were in the majority. Whenever the \nPresident sent a bill up here, it was standard Democratic rhetoric: \n``Whatever the President proposes, forget about it, Congress disposes. \nIt's the congressional responsibility to formulate a budget, not the \nPresident's. He submits it, but we dispose of it.''\n  So now that they are in the minority, they are complaining that this \nexceeds the President's request. They did not have that particular \nconcern when they were in the majority. So I think it is incumbent to \npoint out, for example, that there was a certain land transfer, called \nthe Corn Husker Army Ammunition Plant. It was not in the President's \nrequest. It was added somehow. So it has been historically the case \nthat the Congress has the power and responsibility to decide which land \ntransfers should be included and which should not, which systems should \nbe built and which should not. When the Pentagon makes a request, it \ndoes not mean the Congress simply rolls over and either accepts it or \neliminates it.\n  What my colleague failed to point out is that, as I believe Secretary \nPerry has noted, procurement has been cut back rather significantly, \nabout 72 percent since the height of Ronald Reagan's defense budgets. A \n72-percent cut in procurement, and Secretary Perry \n\n[[Page S18859]]\nsaid if there was going to be an increase over the President's request, \nas we provided, it should be put into procurement.\n  So that whole long litany of systems cited by my friend from Nebraska \nreally ignores the fact that the Defense Department itself said if we \nhad more money, we would spend it on procurement, and that is precisely \nwhat we have done.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the national missile defense \nsystem. I was really struck by the statement that the Communists are \ncoming back into power because we are debating whether we are going to \nhave a national missile defense system. I never heard anything so \nabsurd in my life.\n  Whether the Communists come back into power has little to do with our \ndebate right here. It has everything to do with what is taking place in \nRussia right now in terms of their troubled efforts in trying to \ndemocratize their country, to move to a capitalist system, to a \ndemocratic capitalist system.\n  I think it ironic they come to the floor and suggest that because we \nwant a system to protect the American people, this is going to require \nthe Russians to return to their old Communist ways.\n  A great deal has been said about the national missile defense system, \nbut not a lot has been said about the immediate threat to our troops \noverseas as well as our allies, which are theater missiles. This bill \nmakes great strides toward protecting our allies and our servicemen and \nwomen who are abroad from these kinds of theater missiles that can be \ntargeted at them.\n\n  Did we not learn anything during the Persian Gulf war? Do we want our \ntroops to again be in the situation they faced in Saudi Arabia and that \nIsrael faced? A situation in which we had to depend upon Patriots to \ntake down those Scud missiles?\n  The TMD programs accelerated by this bill are designed to protect our \nservice men and women abroad and also our allies. It is something the \nadministration also supports, by the way. This bill is a strong \nendorsement of the TMD systems.\n  With regard to national missile defense, a number of statements have \nbeen made about the conference report, that somehow it endangers the \nABM Treaty. And, again, I found this somewhat ironic. It makes very \nlittle sense to me. We passed language by a vote of 84 to 15 that had \nbeen negotiated by Senator Warner, myself, Senator Nunn and Senator \nLevin. And this Senate compromise language that was endorsed by an \noverwhelming vote was actually watered down in conference. That is what \nstrikes me as being so ironic about this.\n  The Senate compromise we negotiated, for example, called for the \ndevelopment of a national missile defense system with multiple sites. \nSince the ABM Treaty, as amended, only allows one site, the Senate \ncompromise language that we negotiated actually envisioned either \namending the treaty or indicating we would withdraw from it, as the \ntreaty permits.\n  In fact, the compromise called for negotiations to amend the treaty \nand stated that if we could not successfully negotiate amendments, we \nwould actually consider withdrawing from it. It seems to me the \nlanguage we have before us is actually much weaker than that. The \nSenate compromise language that we passed 84 to 15 called for a system \nthat would actually go beyond the bounds of the ABM Treaty, but the \nconference report does not. The conference report does not even mention \na multiple-site system. There is no mention at all of a multiple-site \nsystem. It does not say we cannot develop one, but there is no \nrequirement that we do develop one.\n  The major change on national missile defense in this language is that \nunder the Senate-passed compromise, we would ``develop for deployment'' \nin the future, and that language has been changed to ``deploy'' in the \nfuture. But we have actually written it in a way that would allow us to \ndeploy a system consistent with the ABM Treaty. That is the irony \ninvolved, because you could have one site, theoretically, providing \ndefense for the United States. That would be consistent with the ABM \nTreaty.\n  By the way, I want to point out, the Russians already have an ABM \nsystem. They have their one site. So we could, in fact, be consistent \nwith the ABM Treaty developing one site that could, theoretically \nspeaking, potentially protect all of the United States.\n  So I find it ironic that they are now saying this particular language \nis going to destroy the ABM Treaty; this language is causing the \nRussians to rethink their role in the world with respect to the United \nStates; this conference report is going to cause them to turn to \ncommunism once again. That is clearly the most excessive rhetoric that \nI have heard to date.\n  The fact of the matter is that the administration is opposed to the \ndeployment of a system of any kind to defend the American people. And \nduring the conference negotiations, White House officials made it clear \nthey would oppose any legislation that altered in any way the \nadministration's so-called National Missile Defense Technology \nReadiness Program, what they call a rolling hedge, but I think is more \naccurately described as simply spinning our wheels. In other words, \nthey threaten to veto any defense authorization bill that did anything \nother than rubber-stamp their National Missile Defense Program.\n  Mr. President, we are the ones who control the power of the purse. We \ncannot accept the administration telling us: You cannot change under \nany circumstances the formulation of a program. They have the right to \nveto it, but we should not in any manner forego our power to try to \ndefine what we believe to be in the best interest of the American \npeople.\n  So what this debate over missile defense is really all about, it is \nnot about whether the conference report somehow endangers the ABM \nTreaty, because it clearly does not, but whether we are going to \nproceed toward the deployment of a national missile defense system as \npermitted by the ABM Treaty even today.\n  Frankly, I think it is unfortunate that some of the Members on the \nother side come forward to declare that this conference report \nconstitutes an ``anticipatory breach'' of the ABM Treaty and warn the \nRussian Duma might kill the ABM Treaty in response.\n  There is nothing in this report that would cause the Russians to \nreact in a negative manner, but the Russian Duma might be incited to \nreact by, I think, careless remarks being made by some Members in this \nChamber.\n  I was disturbed last weekend to read an opinion article in the \nWashington Post, coauthored by a Russian arms negotiator that followed \nthis false line of reasoning.\n  The quote was, ``The prime cause of Russian second thoughts'' about \nthe START II treaty, according to Yuri Nazarkin, ``is the Republican-\nled effort that began this summer to mandate the deployment of a \nmultisite strategic antiballistic missile, or ABM, system by the year \n2003. This system,'' Nazarkin writes, ``was called for originally in \nthe Senate version of the defense authorization bill and endorsed last \nweek by a House-Senate conference committee. Yet, it would violate the \n1972 ABM Treaty,'' Nazarkin concludes.\n  That is simply not accurate.\n  The conference report, as written, does not violate the treaty. The \nfact is that we could deploy an ABM system, if necessary, from a single \nsite, which would be consistent with the treaty. For those Members to \ncome on to the floor and say this is an anticipatory breach is wrong. \nIt sends precisely the wrong signal. If other Members are worried about \nthe Russian Duma reacting negatively, they have their own words to \npoint to in terms of why this is taking place.\n  We have to ask why is a Russian arms negotiator, who carries weight \nin Moscow, making erroneous statements? He is repeating the erroneous \nstatements being made right here on the Senate floor. I urge my \ncolleagues to read, very carefully, the language in this report.\n  Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments in talking about the B-2 \nbomber. My colleague from Nebraska mentioned that this is a system \nwhich the Defense Department did not call for, and I agree. In fact, \nfor many years I led the effort to terminate the B-2 program here on \nthe floor with the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, and in the \ncommittee this year I led the successful effort to strike funding for \nthe B-2. There were some Members \n\n[[Page S18860]]\non the other side who support the B-2, and some on our side support it. \nIt is not that I do not support the B-2 bomber; it is a fine aircraft. \nThe fact of the matter is that I do not think we can afford to start \nbuilding 20 new B-2 bombers, which is what Members of the House would \nlike to do.\n  The conference report did provide $493 million above the \nadministration's request for the B-2. But, again, contrary to what some \nhave said, it in no way endorsed the production of additional B-2 \nbombers or bringing back the B-2 bomber production base. All of these \nfunds, I point out, have been fenced until March 31. Hopefully, the \nadministration will send up a rescission bill to take the funds out for \nthe B-2 bomber.\n  The only statement in the conference report regarding this $493 \nmillion is the Senate conferees' statement that the funds can be \nspent--I want to emphasize these words--``only for procurement of B-2 \ncomponents, upgrades, and modifications'' for the existing B-2 fleet. \nThe House conferees have remained silent on this issue. They were \ninsisting that they could put language in the manager's statement that \nwould allow for the opening of a brand new production line, and we \nsuccessfully resisted that. Our language is that it should be used for \nspare parts, upgrades and modifications of the existing fleet, and not \nto open a brand new line.\n  Second, because of our concern over the cost of the B-2, we called on \nthe Secretary of Defense to explore what new technologies might be \ndeveloped in the coming years for a new type of bomber that, hopefully, \nwould be less expensive than the B-2.\n  Make this very clear, Mr. President. We are opposed to opening up a \nbrandnew line of the production of B-2 bombers. Now, some of our \nMembers want that. But, frankly, the conferees on the Senate side \nbelieve that that was simply not affordable, and the conference report \nreflects that view.\n  Mr. President, we asked the Secretary of Defense to make an \nexamination of exactly what he would cut out if Congress were to direct \nhim in the future to buy more B-2's. The Secretary of Defense has to \ncome back and identify for us which programs he would cut because, \nclearly, it would exceed the President's budget and the 5-year defense \nplan. Because if any decision were ever made to buy more B-2's, we \nwould have to then, at that time, start picking and choosing which \nsystems would have to be deleted or defunded. That is something every \nMember ought to understand as to what we were able to achieve.\n  To recap, Mr. President, there is not a single word in the conference \nreport about buying components for new B-2's or bringing back the B-2 \nproduction facilities that were closed. Everything in this conference \nreport is focused on the high cost of the B-2 and the unacceptable \ntrade-offs of other defense programs that would be required by any \nfuture decision to buy more B-2's. What the conference does talk about \nis using the authorized funds for supporting the existing B-2 fleet, \nnot to open up a new B-2 line.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by telling you what I think is going \non here. The President's political advisers would like the President to \nveto this bill, so he could score points with certain constituencies by \narguing that we are spending too much on defense. They wanted him to \nveto the DOD appropriations bill for the same reason, but he could not \ndo so because he wanted to win over some of the Members of this body on \nthe Bosnia resolution. Now they are saying that while we lost that \nparticular battle--he signed the bill even though he did not want to \nand the funds have been appropriated--so let us please certain \nconstituents by urging him to veto this measure.\n  But the President faces a real dilemma on this. He has deployed \nAmerican troops to a war zone in Bosnia. Congress has adopted \nlegislation supporting the troops in the field. If the President vetoes \nthis conference report, he is going to be perceived by many soldiers \nand their families as withholding support for them--at the very time \nthat he has dispatched them on a very dangerous mission.\n  If he vetoes this, he will be vetoing a pay raise for the troops in \nBosnia and all of our troops. He will be vetoing an increase in the \nhousing allowance that supports their families back in Germany, here in \nthe United States, and around the world. He will be vetoing a new \nprogram to allow DOD to use the private sector to improve military \nhousing, which is a program DOD desperately wants and our soldiers and \ntheir families desperately need.\n  In short, the President faces a dilemma. If he vetoes this bill, he \nwill score some political points, but it will harm our troops and their \nfamilies, including those now putting their lives on the line in \nBosnia.\n  So the members of his party in the Senate are trying to save him from \nthis dilemma by defeating this conference report on the Senate floor. \nThat is what this debate is really all about. All this discussion about \nthe ABM Treaty and the various programs and the add-ons is really a \ncover for this issue.\n  American troops are in the field. Their worried families are back in \nGermany and elsewhere, living in woefully substandard housing. We \nshould be thinking about them and not the 1996 election season.\n  I urge my colleagues to look beyond the litany of excuses offered on \nthe other side for opposing this bill and do the right thing and pass \nthe conference report. If the President chooses to veto it, let that be \nhis choice, not ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncommend the able Senator from Maine on the excellent remarks he just \nmade. He is a staunch member of the Armed Services Committee, and we \nare very proud of what he does for the defense of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking Democratic \nmember, Senator Nunn, and I have reached an agreement that permits this \nbill to be voted on today and sent to the President. I intend to vote \nagainst the bill for a number of reasons--arms control and others. But \nI do not want to hold up any further action on it.\n  I am not going to take the Senate's time to repeat the contents of \nthe agreement. It speaks for itself. It is of critical importance, \nbecause the provision that will be deleted from the bill, or reversed \nin the next Defense authorization bill, would have the effect of \nundermining an amendment that passed the Senate by a vote of 67-27. It \nis an amendment that has been agreed to by the House in the fiscal year \n1996 foreign operations conference report.\n  I think this is only the first or second time in my 21 years here \nwhen I felt compelled to delay action on a piece of legislation. I did \nit in this instance because it is an issue I feel very, very strongly \nabout.\n  For the past 3 years, I have been trying to get the U.S. Government, \nand other governments, to act to stop the proliferation and use of \nantipersonnel landmines. There has been remarkable progress. In the \npast 9 months, several NATO countries took steps far exceeding those \ncalled for in the Leahy amendment. Nineteen countries have urged an \nimmediate, total ban on these weapons. This was unheard of, even \nunthought of, 10 years ago.\n  The Leahy amendment falls short of that, but it would be a step \ntoward that goal, a goal I support and, in fact, a goal that President \nClinton declared at the United Nations 1 year ago.\n  I want to respond briefly to something the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee said yesterday. He said my amendment would ``impose \na moratorium on the defensive use of antipersonnel landmines by U.S. \nArmed Forces,'' and that it would ``require the removal of minefields \nemplaced in demilitarized zones.'' I know some in the Pentagon who \nlobbied against my amendment may have said that, but that is not \ncorrect.\n  My amendment would impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of \nantipersonnel mines except along international borders and except in \ndemilitarized zones, where, I stress, their use is obviously defensive. \nI included that exception after discussions with officials in the \nadministration, including \n\n[[Page S18861]]\nthe Pentagon, and with foreign governments. I concluded that in these \nlimited instances--in fixed minefields along internationally recognized \nborders and in demilitarized zones where everyone knows where the mines \nare and where civilians can be effectively excluded and compliance \nmonitored, an exception was warranted. I am talking about places like \nthe demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, or the border \nbetween Finland and Russia. Again, my amendment does not require the \nremoval of these landmines.\n  I do want to concur with the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee when he said yesterday that the bill contains $20 \nmillion for humanitarian demining activities--to remove these mines. I \nam glad he agrees with me about the compelling need for these funds, \nsomething I have urged in the past, in the Appropriations Committee as \nwell as the Armed Services Committee. These are funds used to train and \nequip foreign personnel to remove landmines, in countries that do not \nhave the expertise or capability to do it themselves.\n  There are 100 million--100 million--unexploded landmines. They are in \nover 60 countries. If not one landmine was ever put down in the future, \nthere would still be 100 million in 60 countries, waiting to explode. \nBosnia has a small percentage of them, but that is 4 to 6 million \nlandmines. The Defense Department has done an excellent job in getting \nthe humanitarian demining program started. The regional CINCS have all \nexpressed very strong support for it.\n  Mr. President, I was prepared to speak for as long as necessary if we \nhad not been able to reach an agreement to delete this provision. I am \nvery grateful to Senator Thurmond and Senator Nunn, for their \nwillingness to do this. I also want to thank Senator Warner, who I know \ncares a great deal about the landmine problem.\n  As we watch our troops land in Bosnia, the horror of landmines, and \nthe serious impediment they pose to our forces, have become obvious to \neveryone. Look at this map. I ask my colleagues to take a moment to \nlook at this map. Half of the former Yugoslavia is a minefield.\n  In many areas, our troops will have to crawl on their knees, probing \nevery single inch of the ground, to be sure it is free of mines before \nthey move on. Any step could be their last. It could be a landmine that \nwas put there randomly, weeks, months or even years ago, and now lying \nhidden beneath mud or snow.\n  This is not an isolated problem. It is a plague that has infested \nalmost every continent--Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Central America--\neverywhere our troops are sent, either in combat or as peacekeepers, \nthey will face landmines, millions and millions of them.\n  But the overwhelming majority of the victims are innocent civilians. \nIn Bosnia, like so many countries, many of the mines are plastic. They \nare impossible to detect with metal detectors. They are the size of a \ncan of shoe polish. Most are strewn randomly. What maps exist are \nunreliable.\n  In Bosnia already, 24 United Nations soldiers have been killed by \nmines, and 204 have been injured. Thousands of civilians have suffered \nsimilar fates. Mr. President, it is such a common occurrence that in \nTuzla there is a place where you can buy one shoe--not a pair of \nshoes--but one shoe. Because so many people have lost a leg or a foot \nfrom the landmines.\n  I mention this not to add to the anxiety of the families of our \ntroops. They will be as prepared as any can be to avoid the threat of \nlandmines. But there is no way to totally eliminate that threat.\n  Last week, a United States sergeant in Bosnia was quoted as saying he \nwanted to be sure all the mines are gone before he led his men into an \narea. If my son was there I would want him under the command of a \nsergeant like that. The fact of the matter is that nobody can guarantee \nit. Even after our soldiers leave, the civilians and the refugees will \ngo back to their land. When that time comes, the landmines will be \nthere. Most countries that are littered with landmines, Bosnia \nincluded, cannot begin to afford the cost of clearing them. As one \nperson told me from one of those countries, ``We clear the landmines an \narm and a leg at a time.''\n  Last week, UNICEF called for a ban on these weapons because of the \ncarnage they are causing among children, and they called for an \ninternational boycott of any company that manufactures them. The \nAmerican Red Cross has called for a ban. The U.S. State Department \nestimates that every 22 minutes someone is killed or maimed by a \nlandmine. In the time I am speaking here now at least one person \nsomewhere will be killed or horribly crippled for life by a landmine.\n  We can debate all day about whether landmines have a military use. Of \ncourse they do. What weapon does not have some military use? But do \nthey save lives? I challenge anyone in the Pentagon to prove that \nlandmines save lives. One-third of our casualties--one-third--in \nVietnam were from mines, including American mines. Our troops were \ncasualties of their own minefields. That is up from 10 percent of what \nthey were in World War II. A quarter of the Americans killed in the \ngulf war were from mines. Twenty-six percent of American casualties in \nSomalia were from mines. These are the Army's own statistics. It will \nbe a miracle if Americans do not lose their limbs or lives from mines \nin Bosnia.\n  In October, an American nurse lost both legs and part of her face \nfrom a mine in Rwanda. In June, two Americans died from a mine while \nthey were on their honeymoon in the Red Sea area. Another lost a leg \nand part of another foot on a humanitarian mission in Somalia. He \nconsiders himself lucky because he survived, unlike so many mine \nvictims in that country.\n  These are the Saturday night specials of civil wars. We have a lot \nmore to gain if we declare their use a war crime.\n  Since August 4 when my amendment passed the Senate, over 10,000 \npeople have been killed or horribly maimed by these tiny explosives \nthat are triggered by the pressure of a footstep. Think of that. In \njust the past 5 months.\n  My amendment is modeled after our 1992 law to halt U.S. exports of \nantipersonnel mines. Since we passed that law, 29 governments have \nstopped all or most of the exports, and others, including France, \nBelgium, Austria, and the Philippines have taken steps to ban their \nproduction or use of antipersonnel mines and even to destroy their \nstockpiles.\n  It is also totally consistent with what the President called for at \nthe United Nations a year ago, when he declared the goal of the \neventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. Every day, 72 more \npeople die or are mutilated by landmines. We need to stop talking about \nwhat we are going to do ``eventually,'' and start doing it today.\n  My amendment is a step toward that goal. I thank the 67 Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, who voted for it.\n  The Pentagon says it did not create this problem and that halting our \nuse of these weapons would not solve it. That kind of defeatist \nattitude does not belong in the Pentagon or anywhere else. Lest anyone \nforget, the moratorium in my amendment does not cover antitank mines or \ncommand detonated claymore mines that are used to guard a perimeter. It \nwould not take effect for 3 years.\n  The purpose of delaying its implementation is to give us time to go \nto other governments and say ``we are prepared to stop this, and we \nwant you to join us.'' It gives us the moral authority, and it shifts \nthe responsibility to them. If the United States shows leadership, \nstrong leadership, if we halt our use of these indiscriminate weapons \neven temporarily, it will give a tremendous boost to the global effort \nto ban them.\n  The certification in this bill, which was never debated or approved \nby either body, sounded innocent enough. But its effect would have been \nto prevent the moratorium from ever taking effect. It would have given \nthe Pentagon a veto. Some have asked why wouldn't I want to know if the \nmoratorium would endanger the lives of United States Armed Forces. Of \ncourse I am interested in the Pentagon's opinion. The conference report \nalready asks for it. Even after the certification provision is deleted, \nper our agreement, the conference report will still contain a \nrequirement that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit a \nreport to the congressional defense committees \n\n[[Page S18862]]\ncontaining his responses to seven questions concerning a moratorium on \nthe use of landmines. I have discussed this with Senator Thurmond, and \nhe agrees that he will join with me in submitting some additional \nquestions I have to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, for inclusion in \nthat same report.\n  Mr. President, the Pentagon wants an exception for mines that \nautomatically self-deactivate. I wish that were the solution, but it is \nnot. Those mines are just as indiscriminate. There is no way to limit \nhow many can be used. There is no way to get governments or rebel \ngroups that have millions of the $2 variety, which do not self-\ndeactivate, to destroy them so they can replace them with more \nexpensive, modern mines. The only way is to ban all indiscriminate, \nantipersonnel landmines.\n  Mr. President, we have seen photographs of our soldiers crawling on \ntheir stomachs, with sticks in their hands, trying to find where the \nlandmines are, never knowing when they put their hand out just to brace \nthemselves whether their arm will be blown off. That is terrible \nenough. But this picture is what you see in most countries. That is not \na combatant. This is the typical landmine victim, a young girl with one \nleg gone. Her life changed forever.\n  Mr. President, during the Civil War, General Sherman--no great \nhumanitarian, called landmines ``a violation of civilized warfare.'' If \nPresident Clinton can restrain the Pentagon and my amendment becomes \nlaw, the United States will be able to show strong, moral leadership to \nrally others to put an end to this hideous, global curse. It will not \nbe in time to prevent casualties of Americans or others in Bosnia, but \nit will save countless lives in the future.\n  Mr. President, I know of no Member of the Senate, Republican or \nDemocrat, who feels any affection for landmines. Certainly those who \nserved in combat know how terrifying it is to know that there may be \nlandmines under foot. Where we diverge, some of us, is how to get rid \nof them.\n  I believe that as the greatest military power, we must set an \nexample. There were negotiations in Vienna in September on proposals to \ndeal with the landmine problem. It ended without agreement, partly \nbecause the United States did not exercise as strong leadership as it \nshould have, and could have, on this issue, but also because of \nresistance by the armed forces of other countries. We did not push for \nwhat the President of the United States called for at the United \nNations, the eventual elimination of landmines.\n  I have been to Vienna. It is a beautiful city with luxurious \naccommodations. I could not help but think, if those same diplomats \nwere to meet in a field in Cambodia and were pointed to a table several \nhundred yards out in the field, and told to walk out to that table--\n``Work your way out. We will give you a probe to search for mines. Work \nyour way out through that mine-infested field and negotiate an \nagreement on these perfidious weapons. And when you are done, work your \nway back.\n  ``If you have not reached agreement on the first day, the table will \nbe in a different field on the second day. And in a different one on \nthe third day.''\n  Mr. President, I think we probably would have an international ban on \nthe use of indiscriminate antipersonnel landmines very, very quickly.\n  I am not so naive to think that there would not be some pariahs who \nwould continue to use them. But, like chemical weapons and nerve gas \nand anthrax and dum dum bullets and so on, those who use them are so \nmuch the exception to the rule that they would be branded international \npariahs and war criminals.\n  Maybe then a child like this can walk in a field without losing her \nleg. Maybe people could put their country back together after a war. \nMaybe American men and women who go on humanitarian or peacekeeping \nmissions would go with one less danger.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter to me \nfrom Senator Thurmond, describing our agreement, be printed in the \nRecord, along with a newspaper article from the Washington Post, dated \nDecember 17, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 1995.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Pursuant to our discussion on the floor \n     this morning concerning consideration of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, I would like to recap \n     our agreement.\n       We have agreed that:\n       1. You will control 20 minutes of debate on the landmine \n     provision and I will control the same mount of time;\n       2. You will not filibuster the defense authorization \n     conference report and will not object to a unanimous consent \n     for a time certain to vote on the defense authorization \n     conference report and;\n       3. If the current version of the FY 96 Defense \n     Authorization bill does not become law, I will do everything \n     in my power to ensure that section 1402(b) (concerning a \n     certification in relation to the moratorium on landmine use) \n     is deleted from any subsequent version of the bill. If the \n     current version of the FY 96 Defense Authorization bill is \n     signed into law, I will do everything in my power to ensure \n     that section 1402(b) is reversed in the next Defense \n     Authorization bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 1995]\n\n                       The Pentagon's Mine Games\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       It's ``PEACE on earth'' time. But peace in earth is of more \n     concern. The Pentagon is worried sick about the death buried \n     under the mud and snow of Bosnia, where thousands of U.S. \n     troops will be spending Christmas.\n       Every day, we hear about the hidden threat that is more \n     dreaded than the weather, more feared than the snipers and \n     the hatred that infect the area. The number of land mines is \n     estimated at between 4 and 6 million. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-\n     Vt.) calls these $2 weapons ``the Saturday Night special of \n     civil wars.'' There are an appalling 100 million of them \n     scattered around the world, many of them planted in countries \n     to which our troops may be sent. The prospects make the heart \n     sink. One-third of our Vietnam casualties were caused by land \n     mines, although the majority of land mine victims are \n     civilians.\n       The Pentagon, while wringing its hands and beefing up anti-\n     mine training, is pressing its campaign against the anti-land \n     mine legislation introduced by Leahy. The chief lobbyist for \n     keeping the world safe for land mines is none other than the \n     chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John \n     Shalikashvili. He says we need land mines to ``protect our \n     troops,'' an ironic formulation in view of the clear and \n     present danger they present in Bosnia.\n       ``While I wholeheartedly support U.S. leadership in the \n     long-term goal of anti-personnel land mine elimination,'' he \n     wrote in a letter to one congressman, ``unilateral actions \n     which needlessly place our forces at risk now will not induce \n     good behavior from irresponsible combatants.''\n       The Pentagon is pushing a high-tech solution: a land mine \n     that expires within a given period of time. The hope would be \n     that the 60 countries that have planted the cheap mines will \n     dig them up and replace them with the more expensive version. \n     Translation, according to Leahy: The Pentagon will decide \n     what weapons to get rid of--no civilian on Capitol Hill is \n     going to tell them.\n       The commander-in-chief generally makes such decisions. Bill \n     Clinton is an instinctive opponent of an indiscriminate \n     killer like the land mine. A year ago, he told the United \n     Nations General Assembly that the U.S. goal is the ``eventual \n     elimination of anti-personnel land mines.'' Since then, \n     however, he has fallen silent. He seems to have retreated in \n     the face of pentagon opposition. Lately, he has been somewhat \n     more assertive in his role of chief of the armed forces, but \n     he still tends to defer to the chairman of the joint Chiefs. \n     The rest of the administration is deeply divided.\n       Leahy has been the leader of the opposition to land mines \n     since 1989. He was haunted by the sight of a handsome 10-year \n     old boy at the Nicaraguan-Honduran border who was limping \n     around on a home-made crutch. A land mine had taken one leg \n     and had ``ruined his life.'' Leahy established a $5 million \n     annual fund to help victims. Three years later he got a one-\n     year moratorium on the U.S. export of land mines. Legislation \n     banning land mine use passed the Senate by a two-thirds vote \n     this fall and the House by a voice vote. It is currently \n     stuck in conference.\n       Leahy knows his colleagues sigh and roll their eyes when he \n     gets up for yet another land mine speech and shows \n     photographs of the hideous consequences to the causalities, \n     who, incidentally, are often children. On the coffee table of \n     his office, he keeps a small round green object made of \n     plastic and rubber that looks like a shoe-polish container. \n     It is the mine of choice for most of the countries whose land \n     is sown with them. He says that if U.N. negotiators were \n     required to sit around a table in the middle of a field in \n     Cambodia--now ``a land of amputees,'' in Leahy's words--they \n     would agree on a ban in a matter of two days at the most.\n       The cheap plastic mines of Bosnia are difficult to detect, \n     Leahy notes. An aide gets \n\n[[Page S18863]]\n     down on his knees to show how soldiers must pass a hand-held detector \n     inch by inch over a suspect area. The Leahy ban would do \n     nothing in Bosnia. But the Army's dilemma has spotlighted the \n     issue, which Leahy says stirs the same powerful reaction in \n     audiences of all persuasions--the VFW, NRA and the League of \n     Women Voters. Nineteen countries are for the ban.\n       But in the Senate Armed Services Committee, men like Strom \n     Thurmond, Sam Nunn and John Warner, inveterate defenders of \n     the Defense Department, support the Pentagon's attempts to \n     gut Leahy's bill, even though it wouldn't take effect for \n     three years and permits mining of border and demilitarized \n     areas.\n       Only the president can lead the way out of the world's mine \n     fields.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I do not believe that I will use the 20 \nminutes allotted for me to respond to Senator Leahy, as I spoke about \nmy concerns with his landmine provision yesterday. I will, however, \nreiterate a number of concerns expressed by myself, and other members \nof the committee, as well as the Department of Defense, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Department of Justice, with regard \nto the landmine provision which is no longer in the defense \nauthorization bill, and the reporting and certification provision.\n  The Senator from Vermont has been a strong proponent of legislation \nthat would eliminate anti-personnel landmines. I applaud the Senator \nfor his efforts to make the world safer for innocent women and children \nwho fall victim to these weapons of war used in many civil wars in the \nThird World.\n  I cannot, however, support legislative efforts that would needlessly \nplace U.S. Armed Forces at risk. In my view, and the view of a number \nof my colleagues on the committee, that would be the effect of the \nprovision that was incorporated in Senator Leahy's landmine \nmoratorium--which I emphasize is not in the Defense authorization \nconference report, pursuant to Senator Leahy's request, but is in fact \nin the Fiscal Year 1996 Foreign Appropriations Conference Report.\n  Mr. President, the provision currently in the Defense authorization \nconference report would require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff to submit a report to the congressional defense committees each \nApril 30 for 3 years, that would include the following information:\n  The extent to which the defensive use of anti-personnel landmines by \nU.S. Armed Forces adheres to international law;\n  The effects that a landmine moratorium on the defensive use of the \ncurrent U.S. inventory of remotely delivered, self-destructing antitank \nsystems, antipersonnel landmines, and antitank mines;\n  The reliability of self-destructing antipersonnel and antitank mines \nin the U.S. inventory;\n  The cost of clearing the antipersonnel currently protecting our naval \nstation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and other United States installations;\n  The cost of replacing those antipersonnel mines with substitutes and \nthe level of protection provided by the substitutes;\n  The extent to which the defensive use of antipersonnel and antitank \nlandmines are a source of civilian casualties around the world and the \nextent to which the United States and the Department of Defense have \ncontributed to alleviating the illegal and indiscriminate use of these \nmunitions;\n  The impact or effect of the moratorium on U.S. Armed Forces during \noperations other than war.\n  Last, the provision would require the Secretary of Defense to certify \nthat a legislated moratorium would not adversely affect U.S. Armed \nForces defensive capabilities and that they have adequate substitutes.\n  The Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nDepartment of Justice have raised objections to the Senator's \nprovision, and particularly to the implementation of a moratorium on \nthe use of antipersonnel landmines by the U.S. Armed Forces for \ndefensive purposes because of its detrimental impact on the ability of \nthe military forces to protect themselves. The Department of Justice \nalso believes that the provision would seriously infringe on the \nPresident's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief on how \nweapons are to be used in military operations.\n  Mr. President, as I stated yesterday, I do not understand why the \nSenator from Vermont would not want this information.\n  Certainly, he would want to know that the moratorium would not \nseriously risk or endanger the lives the U.S. Armed Forces who are to \nbe sent out in to situations where their very lives are at stake, with \nthe necessary munitions and weapons to defend themselves.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the able Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, earlier this year I joined a bipartisan \nmajority that voted in favor of the Senate version of the 1996 National \nDefense Authorization Act. I had hoped to be able to provide \nunqualified support for this conference report. I want the Senate to \nknow I will vote for this bill, but I do have some serious reservations \nthat I have voiced to my good friend from South Carolina, the chairman \nof the committee. I really have the expectation that we may have the \nopportunity to reconsider some of the elements of this legislation in \nthe future.\n  But I do want to say the bill sets the right course on the \ndevelopment of key national and theater missile defense systems. These \nprojects were fully funded earlier this year in the Defense \nappropriations bill, which became the Defense Appropriations Act when \nsigned by the President.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Thurmond, this bill provides many \ncritically needed increases for the quality of life for the military. \nMilitary pay, benefits, and allowances were again fully funded in the \nDefense appropriations bill. These initiatives reflect not only the \nAppropriations Committee's priorities but also those of Senator \nThurmond and the Armed Services Committee members, their longstanding \nefforts. We have joined together to provide for the needs of the men \nand women who served in the Armed Forces and their families.\n  I want to, once again, commend Senator Thurmond for sustaining these \nquality of life items in the bill he has now presented to the Senate as \na conference report. These priorities enable me to support the bill \ngenerally while, as I said, I do find it flawed in instances compared \nto the same bill as it passed the Senate in September.\n  There are initiatives that are not supported by the Department of \nDefense, not funded in the defense appropriations bill, and in some \ninstances they directly conflict with provisions of legislation that \nhas already been enacted by this Congress and approved by the President \nafter bipartisan support in the House and the Senate.\n  I do regret this dispute. We do have disputes from time to time \nbetween the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee. \nI hope we can once again try, next year, and the years to come, to work \ntogether to better reconcile these two bills. The problem is, having \ngiven the Department a bill in September that--the Senate passed a bill \nin September--we funded that bill primarily in the Appropriations \nCommittee bill that was brought to the floor and approved by the \nPresident. Now this bill takes a different approach, in many instances. \nIt is that new approach that comes out of conference, which I know we \nall have problems in conference--but it is my feeling that we should \nexpress--at least on behalf of the Appropriations Committee I should \nexpress these reservations, with no lack of respect for my good friend \nfrom South Carolina, or the committee that he serves with. But I do so \nout of the belief that Congress should give the Department of Defense \nconsistent guidance. They have literally been spending from this 1995 \ndecision, from the 1996 decision. I want to point out how this bill, \nnow, changes the pattern that has already been put down in terms of our \ndefense effort.\n  We should seek to minimize the interference and micromanagement of \nthe military by the conference. This conference report is nearly 1,000 \npages in length and poses significant and, in some instances, I think \nunfortunate restrictions on funds already made available for vital \nmilitary programs.\n  Let me say, for instance, that sections 224 and 225 of this bill \nrestrict all spending for the $9.7 billion defense-\n\n[[Page S18864]]\nwide research and development account, the RDT account. That includes \nall missile defense funds until 14 days after a series of reports are \nprovided to Congress. These two sections will result in massive \ndisruption to hundreds of programs.\n  These funds have already been appropriated, and based on the December \n1 approval and enactment of our appropriations bill, it makes no sense \nto suspend literally hundreds of contracts that are already now in \nexistence based upon the December 1 approval until a series of reports \nare presented to Congress next year.\n  Another section, 131 of the bill, mandates spending on four different \nsubmarines, with contracts and dollar levels allocated to specific \ncontractors, notwithstanding the views of the Navy or the performance \nof those contractors on the boats. The provision further requires the \nPresident to include these submarines in future year budgets, whether \nthe Navy wants them or not.\n  I have to ask the question: Why should submarines now take priority \nover all Army, Air Force, and Marine requirements in the future? This \nprovision I think is wrong. We should not tie the hands of future \nPresidents or those who make the budgets, or denigrate the needs of \nother services because of a commitment to one portion of one service.\n  Even more difficult for me than that is the next section, 132, which \ntakes $50 million out of funds we appropriated to redress the \ndocumented shortcomings of our military sealift and spends that $50 \nmillion on even another new submarine development.\n  I think there is a strong consensus in the Congress and the \nDepartment on the need for improved global lift. This is the transfer \nthat I mentioned, this $50 million. It is not an authorization. It \nliterally shifts the money already appropriated for sealift to another \nnonexistent, future, previously unauthorized development program. It \nwas a new program to me.\n  Additionally troubling to me are the provisions of the bill on \nreadiness and the needs of the National Guard and Reserve. These \nprovisions are in direct conflict with the provisions that were \nadopted, as I said, by Congress earlier this year when we brought forth \nthe defense appropriations bill.\n\n  This bill, this conference report, will reduce full-time military \ntechnician support for the Army and Air Guard. It phases out the \nNational Guard Youth Challenge Program and does not authorize $100 \nmillion in readiness and training funds appropriated for the National \nGuard and Reserve on December 1.\n  At a time now, Mr. President, when thousands of Reserve and Guard \npersonnel are being called to active duty and actually deployed to \nBosnia, this bill I think sends the wrong message. The Guard and \nReserve deserve our support right now, too, and I believe they should \nhave our support, and I am troubled by those sections that decrease the \nsupport for the Guard and Reserve.\n  The President's decision to commit United States troops to Bosnia, \nalong with ongoing contingency operations in Haiti, Cuba, the Middle \nEast, and Korea, puts enormous strain on the defense budget. To \naccommodate those requirements, the appropriations bill increased the \nDOD transfer authority to $2.4 billion. This bill reduces that limit to \n$2 billion. It will constrain the Department's ability to meet \nemergency requirements, and I think instead Congress still has to \nreview and approve all such transfers. There is really no reason to \nlower the limit on reprograms at a time when we have myriad overseas \noperations ongoing.\n  Another section, section 1006, prohibits the obligation of funds for \nspecific programs appropriated not for the next year, 1996, the year we \nare in now, but for the last year, fiscal year 1995. I know of no basis \nfor this conference report to restrict the availability of funds \nalready obligated and committed to ongoing programs from the last \nfiscal year.\n  A vital safety and lifesaving service in the United States, for \ninstance, is the Civil Air Patrol. In my State, the Civil Air Patrol is \nfully integrated into the Department's search and rescue system, and \nthe Civil Air Patrol makes a tremendous contribution across the Nation. \nDespite their record of achievement, this bill fails to fully authorize \nthe appropriated levels of the Civil Air Patrol for 1996.\n  Mr. President, I hope this is just an oversight because I know that \nthe Armed Services Committee has in the past supported the Civil Air \nPatrol. I hope it is in error and not a statement of opposition because \nI think we need the Civil Air Patrol. The Civil Air Patrol is one of \nthe ongoing functions to feed new pilots into the whole military \nsystem. It should not be denigrated at this time.\n  Section 912 of the bill creates a new mechanism that funnels savings \nfrom operation and procurement programs into a new fund that is used \nfor additional procurement. It, in effect, is a way to have an ongoing \nrolling appropriations, which bothers me. I believe modernization of \nthe Department is underfunded, and I think the range of contingency \noperations we face for 1996 and 1997 will bring some changes. All \nsavings will be channeled to meet these liabilities. The cost of Bosnia \nwill be paid from within the current levels available for defense. Any \nsavings must be utilized to preserve readiness and the quality of life \nbefore any additional allocation for procurement programs.\n  This bill goes further than past bills to limit obligations of \nappropriated funds, rather than authorize programs.\n  These ex post facto limitations create conflicts the Department of \nDefense must seek to resolve between two bills passed by Congress.\n  The failure of the Armed Services Committee to complete this \nlegislation before enactment of the appropriations bill is no reason \nfor this bill to impose numerous restrictions on programs adopted by \nCongress just last month. I hope that in future consideration of this \nbill or other legislation we can resolve these differences.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the committee will work with us on these \nmatters. I now have to, however, go into another function as chairman \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  On October 31, I wrote to the chairman to express our comments on the \nproposed changes in the retirement credit for employees of \nnonappropriated funds activities. Regretfully, the conference report \nincludes section 1043, which establishes a new, complex, and unfunded \nliability for retirement funds of Federal employees.\n  According to the Office of Personnel Management, this proposal \ncreates new gaps in coverage, treats similar service differently, and \ncreates new inequities. I do hope that the chairman of the committee \nwill work with me, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Director \nof OPM to understand and clarify these new guidelines and protect the \nretirement benefits. I see no reason to give nonappropriated funds \nemployees greater benefits than those who work fully for the taxpayers.\n  I also have a comment about section 567. We have initiated a control \nover the HIV virus. This bill requires that the military expel from the \nmilitary any person who contracts HIV. With our military people \ndeployed to high-HIV-incident areas--Southeast Asia, Africa, and part \nof the Caribbean--I believe that we have to have a policy to handle \nthose deployments.\n  We started a program in the Department to deal with an effort to \ndevelop a vaccine to protect men and women in the military from the \nrisk of infection from HIV. Unfortunately, that program is canceled, \nand the new concept of expelling from the military those who get HIV is \nin the bill.\n  Despite including section 567, the conference report fails to \nauthorize the funds provided in the appropriations bill to assist the \nDepartment to develop a vaccine--to protect the men and women of the \nmilitary from the risk of infection. If the Armed Services Committee \nwants to expel victims of AIDS from the military, they should support \nefforts to combat this terrible disease.\n  I want the Senator to know that I am not critical of what he is \ntrying to do. I just do not believe this is the way to do it. I think \nthat we ought to have some way to develop a policy that is consistent. \nWe did have prophylactics dealing with venereal diseases. I do not know \nwhy we cannot press on and develop the vaccine that will prevent the \ntransfer of HIV.\n  Mr. President, I understand and appreciate the difficult \ncircumstances a \n\n[[Page S18865]]\nconference can impose, and the compromises necessary to achieve a bill. \nI have made this statement on the floor on my own behalf in previous \nyears. But these provisions cannot be viewed as setting any precedents \nfor future bills.\n  At a time when personnel are en route to Bosnia, and deployed across \nthe globe, we must do our job, and protect their pay and benefits. I \nhope all Members will support this effort.\n  I hope again now that Senators will join with this committee to \nsupport our people who are en route to Bosnia, who are deployed around \nthe globe. I think we must do our job and protect the pay and benefits \nof all these people who put their lives in harm's way to support our \nNation.\n  I wish to join the chairman and support this bill. I urge him and the \nmembers of the committee, however, to rethink some of these provisions. \nThey take us off in the wrong direction as we are trying to conserve \ndefense dollars, and I do believe that all Members of the Senate should \njoin in to make certain that the dollars we put in for defense are \nspent for defense needed in the coming fiscal year and no more.\n  I thank my friend. I know that he may be a little bit disturbed at my \ncriticism. It is meant in good faith and with great respect for him and \nhis service to the Nation and to the military people by his devotion to \ntheir needs. But I do think this bill is not the same bill that the \nSenator crafted in our Armed Services Committee. It is the changes that \nhave come out of the conference that really disturb me and to which I \ndirected my attention here on the floor. I thank him for his time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator for his \nremarks, and it will be a pleasure to work with him and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in trying to correct anything here that \nshould be corrected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the able \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. And I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding my opposition to several specific \nprovisions included in the conference report on Defense authorization, \nand concerns about how the conference itself was conducted, I will vote \nto approve the report on final passage. I do so reluctantly, knowing \nthat the President has indicated he will veto the bill if it passes, \nand knowing that most Democrats--including the respected former \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and now ranking member, \nSenator Nunn--and some Republicans, will vote against it.\n  In truth, I agree with most of the reservations expressed by the \nPresident, Secretary Perry, Senator Nunn, and many of my Democratic \ncolleagues on the committee. But if we do not approve this conference \nreport, I believe we run the very real risk of not getting a Defense \nauthorization bill this year and I believe this bill even in its \ncurrent form is better than no bill at all.\n  Were it absolutely clear that the deficiencies in this legislation \ncould be corrected and a new report passed very quickly, I might join \nmy Democratic colleagues in opposing it. But because I am not as \nsanguine as others about that result, I want to show my support for the \nmajority of the measures as they exist in the report and to ensure that \nit not be viewed in strictly partisan terms.\n  Mr. President, we have learned repeatedly in this century that new \nenemies can arise on distant shores within a matter of years, and that \nthe price of inadequate preparation--in places like Bataan or the \nKasserine Pass in World War II, or Osan during the Korean War--can be \nvery high.\n  We now live in an era where the complexity of military systems \nmandates decades of development before those systems are fielded, \nmeaning that we have to prepare now for the unexpected conflicts of \ntomorrow.\n  Our national strategy calls for being prepared to fight two major \nregional conflicts simultaneously. My colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee know that unless our major procurement accounts are \nstrengthened we simply won't have enough airlift, ships, and smart \nmunitions to fight and win decisively in two major regional conflicts.\n  Yet despite the steady drone of critics attacking this strategy, no \none has offered a more attractive alternative. Until a broadly \nsupported alternative is adopted, I intend to provide more than just \nlip service in advocating a procurement program that supports our \nnational strategy. The conference report attempts to address some of \nthe major shortfalls in the procurement accounts.\n  My Armed Services colleagues are also aware that funding for \nreadiness cannot tolerate further reductions without serious erosion of \ntroop morale and effectiveness. The conference report adequately funds \nreadiness.\n  And of course, we all know that we must maintain decisive U.S. \nsuperiority on the battlefield of the 21st century.\n  This report authorizes adequate funding for the research and \ndevelopment that will provide our troops the communications, the \nintelligence, and the weaponry to defeat any enemy, anywhere, anytime.\n  But there are areas of significant disagreement, as well. I have \ncarefully reviewed the issues that concern the President and others, \nand I share many of their criticisms. In the case of ballistic missile \ndefenses, while the conference report is much less onerous than the \nHouse version of the bill, it would nonetheless send a message to the \nRussians that our commitment to the ABM Treaty is tenuous.\n  In committee, I offered an amendment to strike a measure from the \nSenate version of the bill that would restrict a servicewoman's access \nto privately funded abortions overseas. It was supported by a majority \nof committee members, including two Republicans. And I was very \ndisappointed when the measure was restored in the conference report.\n  The report includes provisions discharging HIV-positive service \nmembers on the pretext that they are nonworldwide deployable, when in \nreality no others who are permanently nonworldwide deployable are \nforced out under current law.\n  Mr. President, the report includes roughly half a billion dollars to \ncontinue funding the B-2 bomber. This funding was removed by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee--with the support of four Republicans--but \nagain restored in conference. This despite a detailed analysis by the \nDepartment of Defense which showed that the contribution of additional \nB-2's would be marginal in a theater campaign when compared to more \ncost-effective means of weapons delivery, such as precision-guided \nmunitions. If we did not have such pressing fiscal constraints, more B-\n2's would make sense--indeed I've supported those to date--but not when \nwe are shutting down the Government because we can't agree on the \nreally tough spending choices necessary to balance the budget in 7 \nyears.\n  There are far too many earmarks in the report that will prove costly \nto the taxpayer. There are earmarks for unrequested Department of \nEnergy weapons programs, Buy America designations, and National Guard \nand Reserve equipment. And there are earmarks for ships, including \nsubmarines which are vitally important to two shipbuilders, one of \nwhich is in my own State.\n  Rather than designate particular submarines for particular \nshipbuilders, I had hoped that we would be able to authorize a winner-\ntake-all competition to save the taxpayers billions in procurement \ndollars.\n  In the end, my senior Virginia colleague helped devise a compromise \nto designate the builders of the first two subs to minimize development \nrisks, followed by competition on the third and subsequent subs. The \nconferees accepted this compromise, but also allowed for the option of \nbuilding some additional prototype submarines, if the Navy concludes it \ncan achieve a more affordable and more effective submarine by doing so. \nThis is not a perfect solution, but it is better and less expensive \nthan the alternative of eliminating any hope of eventual competition by \ndesignating a single submarine builder as was originally planned by the \nNavy.\n  My biggest problem with the conference report is that it reflects too \nfew tough choices. Too often the conferees resolved differences in \nprocurement priorities between the Senate and \n\n[[Page S18866]]\nHouse not by compromising but by agreeing to the requests of both. \nThat's not cost-effective, but politics is defined as the art of the \npossible and the most cost-efficient approach would not have enjoyed \nmajority support.\n  Mr. President, some of my Democratic colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee will vote against this report--at least in part--to protest \ntheir exclusion from the conference process. After a few pro forma \npanel meetings, the panels were dissolved with no full committee \nmeetings called to reconcile differences. But while I share the \nfrustrations of my colleagues about the congressional conference \ncommittee, chaired this year by the House--I believe the final report \nmoves in the right direction in enough areas to justify my support.\n  By passing this legislation, we make it clear that we are committed \nto ending the defense budget free fall. We send a firm and unambiguous \nmessage of support to our troops in Bosnia. We preserve the many \nprovisions agreed upon through delicate compromises that could be very \ndifficult to rebuild if the report is returned to conference. We may \nhave to do that, if we cannot resolve the differences, quickly, but it \nwould be a bad precedent, and would reduce incentives for the Armed \nServices Committees--or any committees for that matter--to work out the \ntough issues within a single coherent bill.\n  Finally, we ensure the prompt implementation of the many fiscal year \n1996 defense programs, acquisitions, and operations that have been put \non hold for weeks now by our delay.\n  It has been suggested that particular provisions in the conference \nreport, such as the pay raise and BAQ increase, be attached to other \nlegislation if this report is vetoed to ensure their prompt enactment.\n  If the conference report is defeated here on the floor or vetoed at \nthe White House, I will work with the conferees and the President to \nresolve the veto issues as quickly as possible and I will urge my \nfellow conferees to stay focused on the specific concerns of the \nPresident to avoid unraveling the many fragile compromises contained in \nthis report.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield back any \ntime that I may have been allocated. And I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nVirginia for the outstanding remarks that he has made on this bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Office of Operational Test and \nEvaluation [OT & E] in the Office of the Secretary of Defense was \nestablished and strengthened by Congress in the early 1980's to ensure \nthat weapons we provide our troops have been vigorously tested in an \nindependent and realistic manner. The statutes behind this Office were \none of the most important achievements of Congress' effort to reform \nthe defense acquisition process. It is legislation that continues to \nsave the tax-payers billions of dollars. Most importantly, these \nstatutes continue to protect the lives of our men and women in uniform.\n  It is, thus, surprising that the Defense authorization conference \nreport would repeal these public laws that Congress passed with strong \nbipartisan support. Provisions in H.R. 1530 will repeal section 139 of \ntitle 10 that established and provides independent authority to the \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation. Two weeks ago I, along \nwith Senator David Pryor and Senator Charles Grassley, urged the \nconferees to remove these damaging provisions.\n  We reminded our colleagues that last August this very chamber \nunanimously passed a resolution stating that the authorities and office \nof OT must be preserved. I am disappointed that the conferees appear \nto have disregarded our advice and, more importantly, the unanimous \nopinion of the Senate.\n  What is at stake in the Defense authorization bill are the lives of \nour men and women in uniform. And, there is no one more concerned than \nI about the well-being of our troops.\n  The Office of Operational Test and Evaluation was created \nspecifically to ensure the safety of our troops. Section 139, the \nstatute that the conference bill repeals, gives our troops confidence \nthat the weapons they bring to the battlefield have been tested \nvigorously in an independent manner and in an operationally realistic \nenvironment. Over more than a decade of service, OT has ensured that \nthe new weapons with which we equip our soldiers can be relied upon in \ncombat.\n  That is how OT saves lives.\n  OT also saves the taxpayer billions of dollars. Its establishment \ninstitutionalized a very simple premise: That we should not spend \nbillions of dollars on a new weapon unless we are sure that it works \nand will be effective on the battlefield. OT is the institutional \ncore of the Pentagon's fly before you buy approach to new weapons and \nequipment.\n  OT saves both lives and money because section 139 requires that the \ntesting and evaluation of new weapons are directed by an official whose \nauthorities are independent from the services and whose authorities are \nnot vulnerable to pressures of the Pentagon's procurement bureaucracy.\n  Some of us may recall the cancellation of the Sergeant York--DIVAD--\nantiaircraft system. The problems of this faulty program were \nidentified and highlighted by OT The DIVAD was a billion dollar \nboondoggle which was terminated by OT's independent tests and \nevaluations despite protests from within the Pentagon. One can imagine \nwhat the risks would have been to our soldiers had this system been \ndeployed.\n  Another example of OT saving lives is the performance of the \nBradley infantry fighting vehicle during the war against Iraq. The \nBradley had never seen combat until Operation Desert Storm.\n  The mission of the Bradley is to deliver troops safety to combat. \nIndependent operational testing conducted by OT demonstrated that the \nBradley's original design seriously jeopardized the lives of the troops \nit was meant to protect. Over the Army's objections, the Bradley's \nproduction schedule was extended so that design flaws were remedied.\n  In one of the many studies conducted after Operation Desert Storm, \nArmy Maj. Gen. Peter McVey testified on the performance of the Bradley. \nHe stated that ``more lives of soldiers than we can count'' were saved \nby the combat-like testing to which the Bradley was subjected prior to \nits full production and deployment to the gulf.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reiterated this conclusion \nwhen he stated that the vigorous independent testing oversight put into \nplace by Congress saved more lives than perhaps any other single \ninitiative.\n  In addition to the Bradley and the Sergeant York, OT has \ncontributed significantly to performance, capability and reliability of \nthe equipment and weapons systems our Defense authorization and \nappropriations bill purchase for our taxpayers and, above all, of our \nsoldiers. These include improvements to the C-17 cargo plane, the Aegis \nCruiser, and there are numerous other examples.\n  In each case OT ensured that each of these systems were subjected \nto vigorous independent testing. Their evaluations contributed to \ndesign changes that improved their capabilities and reliability. In \nother cases, wasteful programs were terminated.\n  In this way, the legislation that established the office and \nauthorities of the Director of OT simultaneously improved the safety \nof our soldiers and saved the taxpayer money. That alone makes section \n139 of title 10 one of the most important achievements in acquisition \nreform of the last decade. We should be protecting, if not \nstrengthening, such statutes.\n  What would be the bottom line if we repeal section 139? In the name \nof reducing the size of the Pentagon, we will have eliminated a tiny \noffice whose work has proven essential to the very objectives of H.R. \n1530, providing a rational, accountable, and efficient system of \nmanagement in the Pentagon.\n  To eliminate this office as we are sending our troops to Bosnia seems \nto be all the more incredulous. These troops, many of whom are \nembarking through Dover Air Force Base in my State of Delaware, will be \ndeploying with an array of new equipment that has never been tested in \ncombat. Can we imagine sending our troops to battle with equipment we \nhave not made the fullest effort to subject to operationally realistic \ntesting? \n\n[[Page S18867]]\n\n  If we are really concerned about our troops, we should be vehemently \nopposed to the provisions that would eliminate the independence and \nauthorities of the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation. We cannot \naccept these provisions and claim that we are doing our utmost to \nensure the safety and welfare of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the conference report \non the defense authorization bill and to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it.\n  Earlier this year I voted against the authorization bill in committee \nand on the Senate floor. In each case I was doing so for the first time \nin my 13 years in the Senate during all of which I have served on the \nArmed Services Committee. On September 6 when the Senate passed this \nbill I warned my colleagues that we were going to conference with a bad \nSenate bill and an even worse House bill and that it was hard to \nimagine a conference result many of us could support. My only hope was \nthat having seen thirty-four Senators vote against the bill on \nSeptember 6, including the ranking Democrat on every Armed Services \nSubcommittee, the majority would reach out to try to deal with the \nconcerns of these members. Many of those who voted against the bill on \nSeptember 6 were, like me, casting the first vote in their Senate \ncareers against a Defense authorization bill.\n  Unfortunately, there was no reaching out in conference. With the sole \nexception of the ballistic missile defense provisions there was not a \nMember level meeting of the conference to which Democrats were invited \nin two months. We were simply informed through our staffs as to how \nissues had been resolved, in some cases after that information had \nalready reached the press. Indeed, I found the press a very \nenlightening source over the past two months about Member level \nmeetings occurring between House and Senate Republicans.\n  This is not how conferences have previously worked in my 13 years on \nthe committee under Chairmen Tower, Goldwater, and Nunn. Never were the \nviews of the minority disregarded on so many items. Never was there no \nopportunity given the minority to at least have their views heard \nduring the conference and to test the sentiment of members, not staff, \nby putting issues to votes.\n  There has always been a big four process where the full committee \nchairmen and ranking members would meet to try to resolve the truly \ndifficult issues the solution to which had eluded the subcommittee \nchairmen and ranking members. But never before did that process start \n2\\1/2\\ months before the end of the conference when almost no issues \nhad been resolved at the panel level and never before were the results \nof that process, especially controversial results, not briefed to \nmembers for their discussion and approval at member-level meetings of \nSenate conferees.\n  Mr. President, I believe that, unless corrected, what has happened \nthis year on this bill in terms of process alone portends a very bleak \nfuture for the Armed Services Committee and the Defense authorization \nprocess. The majority may be dooming a committee that has always \nstrived for bipartisanship, and therefore relevance, to becoming a \nhighly partisan debating society with all the real decisions being left \nto the Appropriations Committee. When the Armed Services Committee \nworks on a bipartisan basis, as Senator Smith and Senator Cohen did on \nthe good acquisition reform provisions in this bill, it can make real \ncontributions to providing this Nation an effective defense at the \nlowest cost to the taxpayers. But that was not the norm in this \nconference.\n  I have spoken thus far about a broken process. Let me now, Mr. \nPresident, list some of the problems I see in this bill. I will use two \nbaselines for comparison purposes, the defense authorization bill \npassed by the Senate on September 6 by a 64 to 34 margin and the \nDefense appropriations conference report which passed the Senate on \nNovember 16 by a 59 to 39 margin.\n  This bill is significantly worse than both those measures. It not \nonly authorizes a net $7 billion in additional spending for \nunrequested, often unneeded and unsustainable projects which were \nincluded in the appropriations conference report, it breaks new ground \nin making bad public policy in a whole series of areas not previously \nput before the Senate.\n  I will not go through them all in any detail for that would take too \nmuch of the Senate's time on a doomed conference report. But let me \ncite some of the examples: provisions on ballistic missile defense \nwhich would clearly undermine the ABM Treaty and revive the cold war, a \nmandate to discharge people who are HIV-positive from the military even \nif they can carry out their responsibilities, a mandate to terminate \nthe independent Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, an office \nthat previously enjoyed strong bipartisan support, a series of \nshipbuilding provisions that represent the sum of all parochial \ninterests, but fail to meet the national interest, a series of \nprotectionist special-interest buy America provisions that go beyond \nanything I have previously seen in a Defense authorization conference \nreport, provisions on funding of contingency operations and on command \nand control of U.S. Forces that raise constitutional issues, the total \nundermining of the land mine moratorium provision which this body \npassed 67 to 27 on August 4 and which we passed again as part of the \nforeign operations appropriations bill, and on and on.\n  I am only going to go into detail on one relatively minor issue, the \nsale of the Federal interest in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 at Elk \nHills, CA, a field that is currently jointly owned with Chevron Corp. \nThis field is one of the 10 largest oil fields in the United States \nwith some estimates of recoverable reserves running well over a billion \nbarrels of oil equivalent. The taxpayers own approximately 78 percent \nof the field and Chevron owns the rest.\n  This issue of the sale of Elk Hills was the subject of some \nconsiderable discussion last Friday. The point was made by the senior \nSenator from Virginia that the administration had proposed the sale of \nElk Hills. That is true. But it is also true that the administration, \nas recently as 2 weeks ago, continued to ask for 2 years to complete \nthe transaction--through September 30, 1997--and it is also true that \nthe administration asked for the fallback option of authority to create \na government-owned corporation to manage the reserves if it could not \nget an adequate price for its interest in Elk Hills. If the \nadministration proposal were in this bill, particularly with regard to \ntiming, this Senator would not be raising any concern about this \nprovision. Unfortunately, it is not what is in the bill.\n  Let me review the history as I understand it. Democrats on the Armed \nServices Committee have been concerned about insuring against a fire \nsale of this valuable asset since this issue was thrust upon us by the \nbudget resolution in June. That resolution effectively mandated the \nsale of all the naval petroleum reserves in 1 year. We had held no \nhearings on this subject this year, and in the one hearing where this \nissue had been brought up in 1994, there had been criticism from the \nRepublican side of DOE s plans to sell Elk Hills.\n  Nevertheless, since the majority felt that it must respond to the \nbudget resolution mandate, I and other Democrats sought as best we \ncould without the benefit of hearings to add safeguards against a fire \nsale during committee deliberations in June and in a floor amendment in \nJuly. The most important safeguard was one cited by the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia on Friday; namely, that the Secretary of Energy and the \nDirector of OMB could bring the sales process to a halt if they felt \nthey were not going to get an adequate price or if they felt another \ncourse of action was more in the national interest. This safeguard is \nsimilar in effect to the administration safeguard that they be allowed \nto form a government-owned corporation as a fallback if they are not \ngetting an adequate price. This is the course recommended by the \nNational Academy of Public Administration.\n  Unfortunately, all safeguards, both those in the Senate-passed \nauthorization bill provision and those in the administration proposal, \nran afoul of Congressional Budget Office [CBO] scoring. It was the view \nof CBO that the safeguards were likely to be utilized and that \ntherefore a second bill would be needed to sell the Elk Hills \n\n[[Page S18868]]\nreserve. So for purposes of the reconciliation bill, the committee, \nover Democratic opposition, recommended dropping the safeguard \nprovision.\n  As many Members know, thanks to the same CBO scoring, this provision \nbecame subject to the Byrd rule in the reconciliation process and was \ndropped from that legislation on a point of order. CBO effectively \nfound that sale of the Elk Hills would not contribute to deficit \nreduction in fiscal years 1996 to 2002, and most importantly from the \npoint of view of the Byrd rule, would make deficits worse for decades \nafter that.\n  CBO projected that the sale of Elk Hills would only generate $1.5 \nbillion for the taxpayers. In my view, and luckily in the view of \nsenior administration officials, if that's all the taxpayers are \noffered, this sale should not happen. CBO got this low number through \nthe combination of a very conservative estimate of recoverable reserves \nand the use of a very high discount rate for future revenues, far above \nGovernment discount rates.\n  Once this issue was taken out of the budget process, where it never \nshould have been in the first place, I and other Democrats thought the \nbest thing to do was put it off to next year so we could really \nunderstand it. That was the initial decision in the staff discussions \nin conference. But then the issue was reopened. To give the majority \nstaff credit, they insisted on the key safeguard which the Senate had \npassed, namely, that the Secretary of Energy could stop the sale if the \nGovernment was not getting an adequate price or if another course of \naction better served our national interest. But when our minority staff \nrecommended that we allow 2 years for the sale as the administration \nhad proposed, my understanding is that the House majority staff \nrefused. We regret that and regret that Democratic Members on our side \nwere not given the chance to address the issue with Members from the \nother body.\n  A rushed sale does not work in the taxpayers' interest, although it \nmay well work to the advantage of private parties. Members on both \nsides know from experience that it often takes the executive branch in \ngeneral, and the Department of Energy in particular, longer to do \nthings than they predict. So the 2 years which the administration has \nrequested may well be optimistic in terms of completing a one-of-a-kind \ntransaction which the Department has never attempted before. The \nindications which my staff have heard are that the Department of Energy \nhas been withholding information on the potential value of this field \nfrom interested private sector parties. At least one private sector \nentity seeking information in Government files about the field has been \ntold it must use the Freedom of Information Act to get that \ninformation. That is obviously not the way to generate interest for \npotential buyers of this valuable asset which has produced a net $13 \nbillion in federal revenues over the past 20 years.\n\n  My view is that the controversy over this relatively minor provision \nin this huge bill is an example of where bipartisan member meetings \nmight well have resulted in a different and better outcome. As I said \nearlier, there are far more important and numerous reasons to oppose \nthis bill. But this provision is an example of the breakdown in the \nconference process which I referred to at the outset of my remarks and \nwhich I very much regret.\n  Mr. President, it is not with any pleasure that I am going to cast my \nfirst vote against a Defense authorization conference report in my \nthirteen years in the Senate. I am sure that is true for the many \nMembers who will be casting such a vote for the first time in their \ncareers, some of which are far longer than mine. But I am absolutely \nsure that it is the right vote. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing the bill and sending it back to conference for more work. If \nit is passed, I will urge the President to carry out his threat to veto \nit. I hope the majority will then respond to the President's request to \nprovide for the January 1 military pay raise on separate legislation \nprior to adjourning this year and that next year we can work on a \nbipartisan basis on a Defense authorization bill that can become law.\n\n\n                         Competition Provisions\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I, along with other \nMembers, spent a great deal of time on the competition provisions of \nthe conference report. We have prepared a joint statement on these \nprovisions that I ask be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n    Joint Statement of Senators Cohen and Levin on the Competition \n        Provisions in the Fiscal Year 1996 DOD Authorization Act\n\n       Several contractor organizations have expressed concern \n     that the acquisition provisions in the conference report on \n     H.R. 1530, the DOD Authorization Act, could undermine the \n     principle of full and open competition, which assures all \n     responsible sources the right to bid on government contracts. \n     As the Senate authors of the Competition in Contracting Act \n     (CICA), which establishes the requirement of full and open \n     competition, we are confident that this is not the case. The \n     conference report does not contain any provision that would \n     undermine full and open competition and we would not agree to \n     any provision that would do so.\n       Unlike the free-standing acquisition bill passed by the \n     House (H.R. 1670), the conference report on H.R. 1530 would \n     not change either the definition of full and open competition \n     or the existing exceptions from the requirement to use full \n     and open competition. Consequently, all responsible sources \n     must be offered an opportunity to bid on government contracts \n     (except where a specific exception to that requirement is \n     already available under CICA). We intend to monitor the \n     implementation of the bill closely to ensure that the \n     executive branch does not misinterpret its language to \n     undermine full and open competition or deny responsible \n     offerors an opportunity to compete for government contracts.\n\n\n                 A. Title XLI of the Conference Report\n\n       Title XLI of the conference report contains provisions \n     which would address competition requirements as follows:\n       Section 4101 would require that the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation implement the unchanged CICA provisions in a \n     manner that is consistent with the need to efficiently \n     fulfill the government's requirements;\n       Section 4102 would raise the dollar thresholds for approval \n     of sole-source purchases to streamline procedures for smaller \n     procurements; and\n       Section 4103 would authorize contracting officers to use \n     so-called ``competitive range'' determinations more \n     effectively to narrow the initial field of offerors under \n     consideration to those who are best qualified.\n       None of these provisions may be used to exclude responsible \n     offerors from participating in a procurement.\n       1. Regulatory Implementation of CICA. The policy stated in \n     Section 4101 would require the regulation writers to consider \n     more efficient procedures for implementing the requirement \n     for full and open competition. Such procedures could include, \n     for example: the authority to submit proposals in electronic \n     form; the use of electronic bulletin boards to quickly \n     disseminate procurement information (such as solicitation \n     amendments and offeror questions and answers); the \n     establishment of matrices of evaluation criteria to which \n     offerors may respond directly to ease the comparison of \n     proposals; and the simplification of specifications.\n       This provision does not change either the CICA provisions \n     requiring full and open competition or the existing \n     definition of full and open competition. These unchanged \n     provisions would, by their terms, require agencies to permit \n     ``all responsible sources'' to participate in a procurement. \n     Consequently, the requirement that CICA be implemented in a \n     manner that is consistent with the need to efficiently \n     fulfill the government's requirements could not be used to \n     exclude responsible sources from bidding on a contract.\n       2. Thresholds for Justification and Approval. Section 4102 \n     would raise the threshold for high-level sign-off on sole-\n     source procedures from $100,000 to $500,000 to reduce \n     paperwork on smaller procurements. This is the first \n     adjustment to this threshold since the enactment of the \n     Competition in Contracting Act in 1984, and would bring the \n     competition threshold back into conformity with the threshold \n     in the Truth in Negotiations Act (which was raised from \n     $100,000 to $500,000 last year). The provision would not \n     create any new exceptions to the requirement for full and \n     open competition and would not affect the requirement that \n     contracting officers justify in writing the decision to use \n     non-competitive procedures in any procurement, regardless of \n     dollar value.\n       3. Competitive Range Determinations. Section 4103 would \n     expressly authorize the use of competitive range \n     determinations to narrow the field of offerors and exclude \n     those who do not have a realistic chance of winning the \n     procurement. Competitive range determinations have always \n     been permitted under CICA, but some agencies have been \n     reluctant to use this tool out of a fear of bid protests.\n       Section 4103 specifies that the competitive range should \n     include the greatest number of offerors consistent with \n     conducting an efficient procurement. This provision does not \n     permit agencies to deny offerors the opportunity to bid on \n     government contracts. It does not authorize agencies to \n     narrow the field of competitors on any basis other than the \n     evaluation criteria specified in the solicitation and it is \n     not intended to authorize \n\n[[Page S18869]]\n     the exclusion from the competitive range any offeror whose proposal is \n     not significantly inferior to the proposals that will be \n     considered.\n\n\n                      B. Other Competition Issues\n\n       In addition to the provisions described above, Division D \n     contains provisions authorizing the use of simplified \n     procedures for the acquisition of certain commercial items \n     and authorizing the waiver of certain laws in procurements of \n     commercially-available off-the-shelf items. Neither of these \n     provisions would undermine full and open competition or deny \n     responsible offerors an opportunity to compete for government \n     contracts.\n       1. Simplified Procedures. Section 4202 would authorize the \n     use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of \n     commercial items in contracts with a value of $5 million or \n     less. Special simplified procedures could include, for \n     example: shortened notice time frames; streamlined \n     solicitations; expanded use of electronic commerce; and the \n     use of alternative evaluation procedures. This provision \n     would expire after three years, unless reauthorized by the \n     Congress.\n       The simplified procedures authorized by this section would \n     be available to agencies in addition to streamlined \n     acquisition techniques already available to agencies and \n     widely used for the purchase of commercial items under \n     existing law. These techniques include the use of GSA's \n     multiple award schedules; multiple award task order \n     contracts; ``prime vendor'' contracts; indefinite delivery \n     indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts; and requirements \n     contracts.\n       While Section 4202 authorizes the use of simplified \n     procedures, it would not permit limitations on competition or \n     the exclusion of responsible sources from bidding on \n     contracts. In fact, the provision expressly requires the \n     publication of a notice inviting all potential sources to \n     submit offers and committing the agency to consider such \n     offers. In other words, agencies must evaluate all offers \n     received, in accordance with the simplified procedures, and \n     select the best one for contract award.\n       Agencies would be permitted to conduct sole-source \n     procurements only if justified in writing pursuant to the \n     existing CICA exceptions.\n       2. Waiver of Laws. Section 4203 would authorize the waiver \n     of certain laws in purchases of commercially-available off-\n     the-shelf items. This provision would alleviate burdens on \n     contractors, not on the government. It is intended to enable \n     commercial companies to sell off-the-shelf items to the \n     government on the same terms and conditions they use in the \n     private sector sales.\n       The laws that are authorized to be waived under section \n     include only government-unique policies, procedures, \n     requirements and restrictions that are imposed ``on persons \n     who have been awarded contracts'' by the Federal government. \n     This provision does not authorize the waiver of laws--such as \n     CICA and the Procurement Integrity statute--which apply in \n     the period prior to the award of a contract. And it does not \n     authorize the waiver of laws--such as CICA, the Prompt \n     Payment Act, and the Contract Disputes Act--which impose \n     policies, procedures, requirements and restrictions on \n     federal agencies and federal officials, rather than on \n     contractors. For these reasons, Section 4203 would neither \n     authorize the waiver of CICA nor permit any limitation on \n     competition for federal contracts.\n       3. ``Two-Step'' Procurements. Earlier this year, the \n     Administration requested authority for a ``two-step'' \n     procurement process--similar to a provision passed by the \n     Senate as a part of last year's Federal Acquisition \n     Streamlining Act--under which an agency may narrow the field \n     of offerors to those who are best qualified and offer the \n     best overall technical approach to a problem, and only then \n     require the submission of detailed price and technical \n     proposals.\n       Two-step authority is not included in the conference \n     report, due to concerns raised by both the Administration and \n     the business community about the proposed language. The \n     conference report does, however, contain a pilot program for \n     ``solutions based contracting'', in which contractor \n     selection would be based on contractors' qualifications, past \n     performance, and proposed conceptual approach to the \n     procurement.\n       We remain open to the possibility of granting broader two-\n     step authority at some time in the future, assuming that the \n     problems can be worked out in a manner that is consistent \n     with full and open competition and the principle that all \n     responsible offerors must be provided a fair opportunity to \n     compete for government contracts.\n\n\n        Procurement and Information Technology Management Reform\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the procurement and information technology \nmanagement reforms in the DOD Authorization Conference Report will \nresult in billions of dollars in savings to the taxpayer. Some \nobservers have suggested that perhaps as much as $60 billion is wasted \neach year from inefficiencies in the Federal contracting process. The \nrewards to the taxpayer from the Government finding more efficient ways \nto purchase goods and services are indeed great--potentially equivalent \nto a third of the budget deficit and more than what we will spend on \nnew weapons this year.\n  The reforms contained in this bill are needed if we are to seriously \naddress the inefficiencies in the procurement process. Although last \nyear's Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act was a good first step, many \nproblems continue to exist which result in great inefficiencies, \ncumbersome and unnecessary delays, and an overly bureaucratic process. \nThe provisions in this legislation complement our past streamlining \nefforts and will allow the government to pay less of a bureaucratic \npremium on the price of goods and services it buys.\n  The need to continue procurement reform is widely recognized. Both \nHouses of Congress and the Administration have worked together on a \nbipartisan basis to develop these provisions. The procurement reform \npackage that the conferees agreed to includes two major provisions: the \nFederal Acquisition Reform Act and the Information Technology \nManagement Reform Act. These two Acts will go a long way to putting an \nend to many of the inefficiencies of the current system.\n  The savings that can be achieved from procurement reform are \nsignificant. By passing the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act last \nyear, we will realize $12 billion in savings over the next 5 years. The \nFederal Acquisition Reform Act in the DOD conference report can be \nexpected to save additional billions through eliminating unnecessary \npaperwork burdens, streamlining the process for buying commercial \nitems, clarifying procurement ethics laws, and improving the process \nfor contracting for large construction projects.\n  Billions more will be saved in this bill as a result of the \nInformation Technology Management Reform Act, legislation which Senator \nLevin and I introduced earlier this year, which emphasizes the use of \ntechnology to achieve more efficient and cost-effective government. \nAgencies will be required to conduct a systematic re-examination of how \nthey do business before investing in information technology. This \nreview will identify areas for improvement and result in significant \nsavings through the re-design or ``re-engineering'' of existing \ngovernment business activity. According to the Administration, efforts \nto re-engineer government through information technology as mandated in \nthis legislation will save at least $4.3 billion over the next 5 years.\n  The systematic use of information technology to re-engineer \ngovernment will be a lasting contribution of this bill. Not only will \nwe save billions of dollars through these efforts, but we will improve \nthe delivery of services to the taxpayer by effectively applying modern \ninformation technology to government processes.\n  The need to reform how the Federal Government approaches and \npurchases information technology is well documented. My report of \nOctober 1994 entitled ``Computer Chaos,'' outlined the problems \naffecting the $27 billion we spend each year on information technology.\n  Much of this money is wasted buying new systems that agencies have \nnot adequately planned for or managed. In other words, government has \nnot done a very good job deciding what it needs before spending \nmillions, or in some cases, billions of dollars on information systems. \nConsequently new systems, especially high dollars systems, rarely work \nas intended and do little to improve agency performance.\n  In addition, a large portion of the $200 billion spent on information \ntechnology over the last decade has been spent maintaining old \ntechnology that no longer performs as needed. Agencies thus spend \nbillions of dollars each year to keep old, inefficient computer systems \nrunning, and continue to buy new computer systems that are poorly \nplanned and, once operational, do not meet their needs.\n  Agencies trying to replace these old ``legacy'' systems have also \nbeen plagued by the constraints of the current procurement system. Over \nthe last three decades, the process for buying federal computers has \nbecome too bureaucratic and cumbersome. It has spawned thousands of \npages of regulations and caused agencies to be primarily concerned with \nconformity to a paperwork process. What the process fails to address \nare the results--more efficient and less expensive government and, most \nimportantly, fairness to the taxpayers. \n\n[[Page S18870]]\n\n\n  In addition, an adversarial culture has developed between government \nand business. Many companies believe government contracting officers \nand bureaucrats won't give them a fair shake. Federal employees are \nsuspicious of companies because of a fear of being second guessed and \nhaving the procurement protested.\n  In short, it is a culture of little trust, less communication and no \nincentives to use information technology to improve the way government \ndoes business and achieve the savings that we so desperately need.\n  The Information Technology Management Reform Act is designed to \ncreate positive management incentives, increase communication and get \nbusiness and government working together to meet the technology needs \nof the federal government. In addition to helping agencies buy \ntechnology faster and cheaper, the bill would ensure that a responsible \nmanagement approach is taken to maximize the taxpayer's return on the \ngovernment's investment in information technology.\n  Among other provisions, this legislation will repeal the Brooks \nAutomatic Data Processing Equipment Act, authorize commercial-like \nbuying procedures, and emphasize achieving results rather than \nconformity to the process. While we cannot legislate good management we \ncan establish a framework for effective management to take place. This \nis what this legislation sets out to do.\n  Once enacted, agencies will be required to emphasize up-front \nplanning and establish clear performance goals designed to improve \nagency operations. Once the up-front planning is complete and \nperformance goals are established, other reforms would make it simpler \nand faster for agencies to purchase the technology to help them achieve \ntheir goals.\n  The Information Technology Management Reform Act will also discourage \nthe so-called ``megasystem'' buys. Following the private sector model, \nagencies will be encouraged to take an incremental approach to buying \ninformation technology that is more manageable and less risky. Agencies \nnow combine or ``bundle'' many of their information technology \nrequirements into large ``systems'' buys primarily because the existing \nprocurement process takes so long to complete. Reducing the amount of \ntime it takes to conduct a procurement and simplifying the process will \ntake away the incentive to bundle requirements and will result in \nsmaller contracts.\n  Encouraging the use of smaller contracts will enhance competition. \nMany of the most dynamic technology companies in the nation, most of \nwhich would be classified as small businesses, choose not to even bid \non federal contracts because of the size and red-tape involved. \nMeanwhile, some of those who benefit from the complexities of the \nexisting federal contracting process continue to promote a more \ncomplicated, legalistic system in order to discourage new entrants into \nthe federal marketplace.\n  By replacing the current system with one that is less bureaucratic \nand process driven, agencies will be able to buy technology faster and \nfor less money by taking advantage of the dynamic marketplace in \ninformation technology. More importantly, a system will be in place to \nensure that before investing a dollar in technology, government \nagencies will have carefully planned and justified their expenditures \nin terms of benefits accrued to the taxpayer.\n  We stand at the culmination of years of effort in acquisition and \nmanagement reform that started with the Hoover Commission and continued \nwith the Ash Council, the Grace Commission, the Packard Commission and, \nmost recently, the Section 800 panel. Failure to act now will cost \ntaxpayers billions of dollars in continued inefficiency and waste. By \npassing this conference report, we can take a significant step toward \ntransforming the way the government does business and eventually regain \nthe confidence of taxpayers in their government.\n  In concluding I want to both commend and express my appreciation to \nSenator Stevens, Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nSenator Glenn, the Ranking member as well as Senator Roth who served as \nChairman earlier this year and Senators Smith and Thurmond. It is \nthrough these Senators leadership that we have been able to craft \nlegislation that will save billions of taxpayer dollars. I also want to \nthank Representatives Clinger and Spence. Without their foresight and \nperseverance we would not be voting on procurement reform legislation \nthis year.\n  I would also like to thank my friend and colleague Senator Levin who \nI have worked closely with for over 15 years on the Oversight \nSubcommittee. I very much appreciate his counsel and support on efforts \nto reform the procurement system and improve government through the \neffective use of information technology.\n\n\n                    Manufacturing Technology Program\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee in a brief discussion \nregarding the impact of the Conference Report to H.R. 1530 regarding \nthe Manufacturing Technology Program.\n  The bill requires a two-to-one cost share from private sources for at \nleast 25 percent of the MANTECH Program expenditures. Specifically, I \nam concerned that the statement that awards be made on a case-by-case \nbasis may result in overall inefficiencies. Would the chairman wish to \ncomment on that concern and offer an interpretation that would not \npreclude the incorporation of a range of projects in a given program \narea that may involve a number of participants, but still gains at \nleast a two-for-one total cost sharing from non-Federal sources?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I understand my colleague's concerns regarding the \nproject distribution under the MANTECH Program, but it is the \nConferees' intention this program be administered on a project-by-\nproject basis, especially with regards to the cost-sharing provisions. \nHowever, in implementing this provision, the committee would be willing \nto look at alternative methods of accounting that the Department of \nDefense may propose, such as bundling similar projects for fulfilling \nthe cost-sharing requirements, on a case-by-case basis.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator for that clarification, and wish to \nfollow-up as to what constitutes a non-Federal funding source. Given \nthat non-Federal expenses are often reimbursed by the Federal \nGovernment through other programs or accounts, would the chairman wish \nto comment on what exactly constitutes the cost-sharing funds?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, please let me make it clear we did not \nintend for Government funds to fulfill the non-Federal cost-sharing \nrequirements of this provision. I believe this interpretation will \nmaximize our leverage of federal resources. This issue is already \naddressed in the regulations implementing cost-sharing in dual-use \ntechnology programs.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if the Senator would be so kind, I would \njust like to wrap up with one more question. Section 276 of the bill \nprovides a waiver authority for the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition and Technology to obligate any remaining funds that could \nnot be obligated under the cost-sharing requirements by July 15 of a \nfiscal year. In my opinion, to waive this requirement without making \nevery effort to find suitable projects that meet the cost-sharing \nrequirement would be contrary to the intent of this legislation. If he \nwould like to comment, what safeguards did the chairman envision in \ndrafting this waiver authority against this waiver being the rule \ninstead of the exception?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to assure my colleague from \nMichigan that this waiver is only expected to be implemented after \nevery good faith effort is made to find suitable and sufficient \nprojects to obligate all these funds. This waiver authority is intended \nas a last alternative, and every other conceivable effort should be \nmade to follow these requirements, including bringing new and current \npotential participants into the competitive process. Finally, I will \nassure my colleague that the Armed Services Committee will scrutinize \nDOD reports prior to their implementing such a waiver.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for that explanation and for the kind assistance he has \nprovided me and my staff in resolving this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S18871]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to commend \nChairman Thurmond for his success, at long last, in achieving a \nconference agreement on the fiscal year 1996 national defense \nauthorization bill. I have the utmost respect and admiration for \nChairman Thurmond, whose tireless efforts over the past 4 months have \nresulted in agreement on a number of very difficult issues. I commend \nthe long hours and hard work of the chairman and the committee staff \nthat went into resolving the many difficult disagreements with the \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I do not support many \nof the provisions in this bill. I think my past statements, letters, \nand votes on the bill have made my position quite clear.\n  Prior to our committee markup, I wrote to Chairman Thurmond and the \nfive subcommittee chairmen to advise them of my views on a number of \nspecific defense programs and policies and to enlist their support for \nreflecting those views in the authorization bill. I greatly appreciate \nthe consideration given to my views by all of my colleagues on the \ncommittee, although many of my greatest concerns were not adequately \naddressed in the bill. My additional views filed with the bill reflect \nthose concerns.\n  I voted with Chairman Thurmond to report the bill from the committee, \nto allow the Senate the opportunity to consider the legislation. But \nwhen the debate ended, I voted against its passage in the Senate. After \ncasting my vote against the bill in the Senate, I wrote to Chairman \nThurmond to advise him of the specific reasons for my opposition to the \nbill and to clearly state that I would have difficulty supporting a \nconference agreement which did not rectify some of these problems.\n  Unfortunately, the conference agreement has not removed the problems \nin the Senate-passed legislation. Instead, many objectionable \nprovisions remain in the bill, and indeed, some of the problems in the \nSenate bill have even been exacerbated. In addition, a number of other \nobjectionable provisions have been added in this conference report.\n  I have served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nsince I came to the Senate in 1987. This committee has always been at \nthe forefront of the debate on national security policy and defense \nprograms. I believe very strongly that the authorization committee is \nan essential element of the Congress' role in the formulation of our \nnational security policies and programs.\n  Because of my respect for the chairman, as well as my strong belief \nin the importance of the authorization process, I signed the conference \nreport. However, I want to make it very clear that I do not support \nmany of the provisions in this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not note that there are \nmany very worthy and important legislative initiatives in this bill.\n  The bill authorizes an additional $7 billion in defense funding, as \nprovided in the congressional budget resolution.\n  The bill adds funding for high-priority readiness requirements while \neliminating or reducing defense funding for nondefense programs, such \nas peacekeeping assessments, humanitarian assistance, international \ndisaster relief, and homeless assistance.\n  Much of the added funding is authorized for modernization of our \nforces, including additional tactical aircraft and tank upgrades, and \nstrategic lift programs.\n  The bill establishes a new missile defense policy and provides \nfunding for programs which will ensure the deployment of effective \ntheater and national systems in an efficient and effective manner.\n  The bill authorizes a military pay raise and restores equity for \nretired pay cost-of-living adjustments.\n  The bill establishes a new process of public/private cost-sharing for \nconstruction of new military housing, which will reduce the burden on \nthe taxpayer and hasten the process of replacing aging military \nhousing.\n  The bill provides funding for ongoing operations in Iraq, and \nestablishes a mechanism to ensure that military readiness is not \nadversely affected by the conduct of peacekeeping and other unexpected \ncontingency operations.\n  Let me take just a moment to comment on this last provision, which \nthe ranking member on the committee has stated the administration \nbelieves is unconstitutional.\n  I think it is important for my colleagues to understand what this \nparticular provision, included as section 1003 of the conference \nagreement, actually does. It requires the Secretary of Defense to \nreport to Congress outlining, among other things, the objectives of the \noperation and the exit strategy--similar to the requirements in the \nDole-McCain resolution on deployment of troops to Bosnia. The provision \nrestricts the availability of certain training and operations funding \nas sources for funding these operations. It then requires the President \nto submit a supplemental appropriations request--either emergency or \noffset with rescissions--for these operations in a timely fashion.\n  The genesis of this provision was a desire to ensure that military \nreadiness is not adversely impacted by the costs of conducting \npeacekeeping and other contingency operations. In the past few years, \nthe military services have expressed concerns about the impact of \ndiverted funding on their ability to conduct necessary training in the \nthird and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. The administration has \nsubmitted emergency supplemental appropriations requests, late in the \nfiscal year, forcing the Congress to act hastily and with little \noversight in accepting the supplemental, faced with no other option but \nto shut down military training. The provision in this conference \nagreement will allow Congress to have the facts, during the early \nstages of any commitment to a peacekeeping or contingency operation, \nabout the cost and justification for these operations.\n  During negotiations on this provision, the minority staff did not \nobject to the need for a provision to protect readiness and properly \nfund ongoing and future operations. The only concern they raised was \nwith respect to the constitutionality of requiring the President to \nsubmit a supplemental appropriations request to Congress.\n  Because of these concerns, my staff checked with experts at the \nAmerican Law Division of the Congressional Research Service. According \nto a memorandum dated October 18, 1995, the provision ``appear[s] to be \nwithin Congress' constitutional authority.'' The memorandum cited \narticle I, section 9, of the Constitution as the basis for this \njudgment. This section states that ``No Money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. * * *''--\nwhich gives Congress broad authority to place conditions on the use of \ntaxpayer funds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this CRS memorandum be \nprinted in the Record in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1995.\n     To: Senate Committee on Armed Services, Attention: Cord \n         Sterling.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Constitutionality of Sec. Sec. 1003 and 1201 of the \n         House-passed version of H.R. 1530, the defense \n         authorization bill for fiscal 1996.\n       This is in response to your request for a brief summary of \n     our phone conversation regarding the constitutionality of \n     Sec. Sec. 1003 and 1201 of H.R. 1530, as passed by the House.\n       As we discussed, both sections appear to be within \n     Congress' constitutional authority. Section 1003 provides \n     authority to transfer funds from designated accounts to \n     support armed forces operations for which funds have not been \n     provided in advance and requires the President to seek a \n     supplemental appropriation to replenish any fund or account \n     from which funds have been so transferred. Section 1201, in \n     turn, would bar the use of any funds appropriated to the \n     Department of Defense for the participation of U.S. armed \n     forces in a United Nations operation unless (1) the President \n     certifies to Congress that the command and control \n     arrangements meet certain requirements and reports to \n     Congress about the nature of the venture and the U.S. role, \n     (2) Congress specifically authorizes U.S. participation, or \n     (3) the operation is conducted by NATO.\n       Both sections can find constitutional justification in \n     Article I, Sec. 9, of the Constitution, which provides that \n     ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law * * *'' Pursuant to \n     that provision Congress has broad authority over \n     appropriations, including the authority to place conditions \n     on the use of funds. In addition, Sec. 1201 can find \n     constitutional support in the various provisions of Article \n     I, Sec. 8, of the Constitution \n\n[[Page S18872]]\n     that authorize Congress ``To * * * provide for the common Defence * * \n     *''; ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, \n     and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water''; ``To \n     raise and support Armies * * *''; ``To provide and maintain a \n     Navy''; ``To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of \n     the land and naval Forces''; and ``To make all Laws which \n     shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the \n     foregoing Powers * * *.'' Those powers give Congress ample \n     authority to specify some of the conditions under which U.S. \n     armed forces may participate in UN operations.\n       I hope the foregoing is responsive to your request. \n     Enclosed, in addition, are a number of CRS reports pertinent \n     to your request. If we may be of additional assistance, \n     please call on us.\n                                                David M. Ackerman,\n                                             Legislative Attorney.\n\n  Mr. McCain. It seems to me that requiring the President to submit a \nsupplemental budget request is akin to requiring the President to \nsubmit a Federal budget request each year. This provision simply \nrequires the President to submit a budget for an operation which was \nnot included in his annual budget request.\n  In addition, the provision retains the flexibility of the President \nto submit either an emergency supplemental appropriations request or a \nrequest that is offset by rescissions of other appropriations for \ndefense or other agencies. It simply requires that the President get \ncongressional approval to use funds for a purpose which has not \npreviously been approved by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I believe the military services sorely need to have \nsuch a provision in place. I do not accept the administration's \nposition that there is anything unconstitutional about requiring the \nPresident to submit for congressional approval a budget for an \noperation requiring the deployment of U.S. military personnel. As my \ncolleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, stated on the floor last \nweek, ``[T]he President has a right to be wrong just like everyone \nelse.''\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, there are many laudable \nprovisions in this bill. In the event this bill fails to pass the \nSenate or is vetoed by the President, I would support separate \nlegislation which would include these provisions. However, in my view, \nthe good in this bill does not offset the bad.\n  Let me take a moment to discuss just a few of the problems in this \nbill on the funding side.\n  I am very distressed that the 4 months required to complete this \nconference, extending well beyond the beginning of the fiscal year, \nmade it necessary to enact the fiscal year 1996 defense appropriations \nbill prior to the defense authorization bill. As a result, many of my \nobjections to this authorization bill are the same as the objections I \nraised to the defense appropriations bill, because the authorizers in \nmany cases simply accepted the decisions reached earlier by the \nappropriators.\n  This conference bill contains an authorization for the third Seawolf \nsubmarine, as well as language which sets out a plan to earmark two \nfuture submarine contracts for each of our submarine-building \nshipyards. I have stated many times my opposition to wasting any more \nof our scarce defense resources on more Seawolf submarines--a program \ncosting $12.9 billion for three submarines. And I will vehemently \noppose any proposal in future years to earmark future submarine \nbuilding programs for a particular shipyard without the benefits to the \ntaxpayer of open and honest competition for the best program at the \nlowest price.\n  The bill also authorizes $493 million for the B-2 bomber program--\nwhich was not included in the Senate-passed bill. I must say that it \npuzzles me somewhat that the conference agreement essentially leaves \nunresolved exactly how these funds will be used within the B-2 program. \nThe purported agreement allows the Senate to insist that these funds \nonly be used for spares and support for the existing fleet of 20 \nbombers, but it also leaves unrefuted the House's position in its \nreport that the funds should be used for long-lead acquisition for \nadditional bombers. This is a classic political compromise, which \nleaves a very important issue unresolved and abdicates our \nresponsibility on the issue of the future of the B-2 program.\n  Mr. President, I know of no identified military requirement to spend \nan additional half-billion dollars to support our existing fleet, and \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs have made \nit clear that here is no military requirement for additional B-2 \nbombers. Like the Seawolf, the B-2 has now become a jobs program for \ndefense contractors and their supplies and subcontractors, which are \nconveniently spread all over the United States.\n  Both the Seawolf and the B-2 are relics of the cold war, and neither \nweapons system is needed today to meet the likely national security \nthreats of the future. In my view, the 1.2 billion authorized for these \ntwo programs could have been better used for programs which would help \nensure our forces' readiness in this post-cold war world.\n  The bill also contains authorizations for $700 million in low-\npriority military construction projects which were not requested by the \nmilitary services. In my view, this funding could be better used to \nensure that the readiness of our forces can be maintained in light of \nthe deployment of troops to Bosnia, or to provide for the future \nmodernization of our forces.\n  Again this year, the bill authorizes more funding for Guard and \nReserve equipment which was not requested by the services. The amount--\n$777 million--is identical to that provided in the appropriations bill. \nBut unlike the appropriators, the authorizers chose to earmark every \ndollar for specific items, including 6 more C-130H aircraft. By doing \nso, this bill eliminates the ability of the National Guard and Reserve \ncomponents to ensure that these extra dollars are used to procures the \nhighest priority items needed to carry out their missions.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am disappointed and discouraged that the \nstatement of managers language accompanying this conference agreement \ncontains earmarks for a number of programs which were not included in \neither bill. Not surprisingly, many of these earmarks are identical to \nlanguage included in the Defense appropriations bill which was enacted \nlast month.\n  There is $1 million for TCM testing--in which I should note there is \napparently an Arizona constituent interest; $6 million for precision \nguided mortar munitions; $1 million for electro rheological fluid \nrecoil research; $15 million for curved plate technology; $5 million \nfor Instrumented Factor for Gears; $1 million for blood storage \nresearch; $3 million for Naval Biodynamics Laboratory infrastructure \ntransfer activities; $2 million for advanced bulk manufacturing of \nmercury cadmium telluride [MCT]; $1.25 million for firefighting \nclothing; $950,000 for Navy/Air Force flight demonstration of a weapons \nimpact assessment system using video sensor transmitters with precision \nguided munitions; $1 million for SAR detection of MRBMs in boost phase; \n$5 million for a program called Crown Royal; $2.5 million for deep \nocean relocation research; $7.5 million for seamless high off-chip \nconnectivity research.\n  It amazes me, Mr. President, that the authorization conference \nagreement would contain this type of earmarking language. Maybe this is \nsome sort of gratuitous bow to the appropriators' long-standing \npractice of earmarking funds for special interest items. Certainly, the \nearmarks in the appropriations bill should be sufficient to ensure that \nthese millions of taxpayer dollars go to the institutions or \nindividuals to which they had been promised; an authorization earmark \nis no even necessary. Unfortunately, the inclusion of these earmarks \nputs the Senate Armed Service Committee imprimatur on a practice that \nensures defense dollars flow to hometown projects, rather than military \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, I don't know which members of the conference agreed to \nearmark these programs, or which members even discussed these earmarks \nor were aware that they had been added to the authorization bill. I \ncertainly hope that this is not the beginning of a dangerous trend in \nthe authorization process.\n  On the policy side, I will cite just two objectionable provisions.\n  First, the bill adds several new buy-America limitations. The list of \nnew domestic source limitations is significantly whittled down from the \nlengthy list contained in the House bill, but these types of set-asides \nare, in my view, overly protectionist and potentially harmful to \nfavorable trade relationships with our long-time allies.\n\n[[Page S18873]]\n\n  Second, and most egregious, is the inclusion of unworkable, \nunnecessary, and counter-productive provisions related to missing \nservice personnel.\n  When the Armed Services Committee completed work on this bill in mid-\nsummer, I stated my belief that the committee had gone as far as \nCongress should in reforming procedures for accounting for missing \nservicemen. I continue to believe that the language passed by the House \nin this regard was unwise and unworkable. I regret to say that the \nSenate receded in principle on the worst of these provisions.\n  The language in the conference report prohibits the review boards it \nestablishes from making a finding that a serviceman has been killed in \naction if there is ``credible evidence that suggests that the person is \nalive.'' It defines logic that, even if so much time has passed that it \nis physically impossible for a particular unaccounted-for servicemen to \nbe alive, the board still cannot declare him dead if ``credible \nevidence'' is offered that he is still alive.\n\n  In my view, this is a very broad and undefined standard. It would \neffectively prevent, in many cases, a determination of death, leading \nthe families of missing persons with unfounded hopes that their loved \nones are alive and unwarranted fears for their safety and health. This \nis something that we clearly rejected in the original Senate bill and \nshould not have agreed to in conference.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that there are roughly 78,000 \nservicemen missing from World War II. And this is an example of a war \nwhere we walked the battlefield. It might be of interest to note as \nwell that at the conclusion of the battle of Lexington and Concord, \nthere were five missing minutemen. Missing servicemen are \nunfortunately--and very tragically--a fact of war--as much as death is \na fact of war.\n  For an idea of the sort of problems this restriction on a finding of \ndeath will create in the future, I commend to my colleagues an article \nwhich appeared in the Washington Post on December 10, 1995, entitled, \n``Mystery of the Last Flight of Baron 52 Solved.'' In this case, the \nPOW/MIA lobby insisted for 20 years that there was ``credible \nevidence'' that a B-52 crew survived their shootdown over Laos in 1973. \nDespite credible evidence to the contrary, absurdly enough, they \nclaimed four of the crew were transported to the Soviet Union. Finally, \nwith the discovery and identification of the remains of the crew \nmembers, the so-called evidence of their survival and imprisonment has \nbeen irrefutably disproved, and they have been declared dead and their \ncases have been closed.\n  Because of the provisions in this bill, these sorts of claims will no \nlonger be the bizarre ratings of MIA hobbyists; they will be a part of \nthe official government process. As long as a shred of evidence is \noffered--and believe me, the evidence will be abundant--the families of \nfuture Baron 52 crews will languish in uncertainty.\n  The bill contains several other similarly unworkable and unnecessary \nprovisions. Among these are: a requirement that the Secretary appoint a \nboard of review for every serviceman determined to be missing in action \nand subsequent review boards every 3 years for 30 years; a requirement \nthat counsel be appointed for the missing; a requirement to subject \nfinal determinations of the Services to judicial review; the \nestablishment of reporting requirements on commanders in the field at \nthe very time their principal responsibility should be fighting and \nwinning a war; and the reopening of cases from previous conflicts.\n  Let me be very clear that I fully support any productive efforts to \nfully account for each and every missing service person. The POW/MIA \nSelect Committee exhaustively reviewed all aspects of this issue, and I \nbelieve the resources and procedures currently utilized by the Defense \nPOW/MIA Office are fully adequate to accomplish the objective of \ndetermining the fate of all of our missing people. In my view, the \nprovisions in this bill would require the creation of a costly and \nburdensome bureaucracy, with no added value to the process and perhaps \na significant degradation in the ability of the POW/MIA Office to carry \nout its responsibilities.\n  The provisions in this conference bill related to missing servicemen \nwere strongly opposed by the Department of Defense, the CINCs, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When we revisit this issue--and \nwe will have to revisit it in order to avoid the creation of a \nmassively burdensome bureaucracy--I hope we will pay due attention to \ntheir concerns. They are, after all, the people who will have to \nimplement the new procedures.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I am troubled by the vote facing me on \nthis bill. My respect and admiration for Chairman Thurmond, and my \nconcern for the future of the authorization process, make it very \ndifficult for me to vote against this legislation. I am concerned, too, \nabout the potential effect on the moral of our troops deploying to \nBosnia if the pay and other personnel provisions in this bill are not \nenacted in a timely fashion. If this bill does not become law, I commit \nto doing everything in my power to ensure that the Congress and the \nadministration agree to separate legislation containing these important \npersonnel provisions.\n  However, as I have said, I have serious concerns about several \nprovisions in the bill. I will continue to listen to the comments of my \ncolleagues and to evaluate the bill in its entirety, and therefore, I \nwill withhold, for now, making a final judgment on this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article to which I \nreferred earlier and a letter from General Shalikashvili, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 10, 1995]\n\n             Mystery of the Last Flight of Baron 52 Solved\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       A terse announcement from the Pentagon late last month \n     finally ended the unhappy story of the fatal last flight of a \n     Air Force plane known as ``Baron 52'' and resolved one of the \n     last mysteries about the fate of servicemen missing from the \n     Vietnam War.\n       The remains of the seven men killed when the reconnaissance \n     aircraft was shot down over Laos in 1973 have been identified \n     and will be interred in a group burial on Jan. 8, the \n     Pentagon said.\n       If all seven crew members died when the plane went down, \n     then four of them could not have survived and been taken as \n     captives to the Soviet Union. The belief that four of the men \n     were ``Moscow bound'' has long been held by some prisoner of \n     war activists and members of the MIA lobby, who cited the \n     fate of Baron 52's crew as evidence that Vietnam and its \n     communist allies have still not revealed the truth about \n     Americans who vanished in the war.\n       The belief was based largely on testimony by former Air \n     Force intelligence sergeant Jerry Mooney that intercepted \n     North Vietnamese radio communications indicated four \n     Americans captured in the region were being transported to \n     the Soviet Union.\n       The Pentagon has insisted that no one could have survived \n     the shootdown of the plane and that the intercepted \n     conversations were not about the Baron 52 crew. But in the \n     absence of seven sets of remains, Mooney's version of events \n     could not be entirely refuted.\n       Some members of the victims' families quarreled with the \n     Pentagon for years, arguing that military authorities told \n     them some crew members might have been able to parachute \n     safely from the aircraft. They said the Defense Department \n     was reluctant to tell what it knew because of the sensitive \n     nature of the flight.\n       Baron 52 was the code name for an EC-47Q plane that was \n     flying a night spying mission over Laos when it was shot down \n     on Feb. 4, 1973.\n       That was shortly after the Paris Peace Agreement supposedly \n     ended U.S. participation in the war, at a time when North \n     Vietnam was preparing to release the 591 American captives it \n     acknowledged holding.\n       According to Mark Sauter and Jim Sanders, authors of ``The \n     Men We Left Behind,'' a 1993 book alleging a POW-MIA \n     cover-up, ``the men weren't dead'' and the Pentagon knew \n     it.\n       U.S. officials removed the names of the four presumed \n     survivors from a list of prisoners they expected North \n     Vietnam to hand over because the flight was illegal under the \n     Paris agreement, Sauter and Sanders wrote.\n       ``The names were scratched from the list because they were \n     an inconvenience that would have complicated Henry \n     Kissinger's life,'' their book said. Kissinger, then \n     secretary of state, had negotiated the Paris Agreements and \n     was responsible for fulfilling President Richard M. Nixon's \n     promise that all U.S. prisoners would be coming home.\n       Mooney, long retired and living in Montana, repeated his \n     story to a U.S. Senate committee that investigated the fate \n     of the missing Americans in 1992.\n       But the committee also heard from Pentagon officials who \n     had finally viewed the crash site that no one aboard could \n     have survived. The committee concluded that ``there is no \n     firm evidence that links the Baron 52 \n\n[[Page S18874]]\n     crew to the single enemy report upon which Mooney apparently based his \n     analysis.''\n       A joint U.S.-Laotian field excavation team recovered the \n     remains from the crash site in 1993.\n       It took two years of work at the Army's forensic laboratory \n     in Hawaii to identify the victims, the Pentagon announcement \n     said. All members of the Air Force, they were Sgts, Dale \n     Brandenburg, of Capitol Heights; Peter R. Cressman, of Glen \n     Ridge, N.J.; Joseph A. Matejov, of East Meadow, N.Y., and \n     Todd M. Melton, of Milwaukee; 1st Lt. Severo J. Primm III, of \n     New Orleans; Capt. George R. Spitz, of Asheville, N.C.; and \n     Capt. Arthur Bollinger, of Greenville, Ill.\n       With their identification, the list of servicemen still \n     officially missing from the war stands at 2,162. The vast \n     majority are known to have died and real doubt remains about \n     only a handful of cases.\n       The Pentagon announced last month after a year-long review \n     that 567 of the open cases have ``virtually no possibility \n     that they will ever be resolved'' through the finding of \n     remains or other evidence because they were lost at sea or \n     explosions destroyed their remains.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     The Chairman,\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1995.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for taking time to meet with \n     me last week and sharing your insights on some very important \n     Defense issues we face now and in the coming years.\n       One of the issues your staff has contacted us on is the \n     POW/MIA legislative initiative contained in the House and \n     Senate versions of the FY96 Defense Authorization Bill now in \n     conference committee. I'm aware that you've already heard \n     from the regional CINCs expressing their concerns about \n     compliance with certain difficult provisions contained in the \n     House version.\n       No doubt we all agree the POW/MIA issue is of paramount \n     importance to all Service members, and especially to all \n     commanders. Nothing impacts a unit's fighting capability more \n     than uncertainty over whether members will be listed as \n     missing or forgotten if taken prisoner. This country has an \n     unbreakable commitment to our men and women in uniform that \n     such will not be the case. However, language in the House-\n     passed version would create a bureaucracy requiring CINCs to \n     divert precious manpower to this issue. In the middle of a \n     conflict, without relieving the anxiety of our men and women.\n       The CINCs have addressed the details, but let me add my \n     strong support to the Senate-passed version of the \n     legislation that clearly advanced the POW/MIA issue. Such \n     legislation will go a long way toward addressing the concerns \n     of the Congress, the American people, and our military \n     without unintended impacts we believe would be detrimental to \n     our warfighting capability.\n       Again, thanks for our meeting and I hope to talk to you \n     again soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, there have been objections raised to the \nshipbuilding agreement negotiated during conference. They assert that \nit directs the procurement of specific ships at specific shipyards \nwithout a clear industrial base requirement and will produce increased \ncost. This is simply not the case.\n  Let me focus first on one of the principal shipbuilding accounts, the \nArleigh Burke class destroyers program. The Senate conferees were \nconfronted with diverse factors concerning these ships that we \nattempted to resolve as cost effectively as possible.\n  Let me summarize these factors.\n  The Navy has repeatedly told Congress that the minimum annual \nprocurement of Arleigh Burke class destroyers needed to maintain an \nadequate industrial base is three. Testimony by Department of Defense \nwitnesses has confirmed this assessment, as did a Congressional \nResearch Service study completed last year.\n  The Navy gave high priority to including three of these ships in its \nfiscal year 1996 budget and did so.\n  As a last minute measure to generate additional funds for the Army's \nfiscal year 1996 budget, the Department of Defense reduced the number \nof Arleigh Burke class destroyers in the President's Budget from three \nto two.\n  During the period between submission of the President's Budget and \nour conference, numerous Navy and DOD officials have emphasized the \nimportance of including the original three destroyers to the budget.\n  The original appropriations conference funded two destroyers in \nfiscal year 1996, but also directed the Navy to negotiate for and \nexecute contracts for two more on the first day of fiscal year 1997. \nThis language was subsequently modified in the final DOD appropriations \nconference report to call for three destroyers in fiscal year 1996. But \nits original form was a marker that influenced our conference for most \nof its duration.\n  In fiscal year 1994, and again in fiscal year 1995, the Navy \nconcluded that cutthroat bidding in the destroyer program was leading \nto cost growth and the need for additional funding to resolve it.\n  The Arleigh Burke class has been in procurement for some time. Its \nconstruction costs at both building yards are well understood.\n  A Navy industrial base study, completed earlier this year, concluded \nthat the best acquisition strategy for the Arleigh Burke class would be \nto retain two building yards and award contracts based on an allocation \nmethod that emphasized cost reduction.\n  Numerous DOD and industry officials have pointed out that the best \nway to achieve efficiency and reduce costs in the shipbuilding industry \nis to provide a stable construction program, something that the \nPresident's Budget as submitted would clearly not accomplish.\n  The Senate defense bill's provision dealing with acquisition of \nArleigh Burke class destroyers, while a meritorious approach, could not \nprevail in conference because of opposition to it by the other defense \ncommittees.\n  In distilling these diverse factors into a conference position, the \nSenate conferees concluded that it was appropriate to explicitly \nendorse the results of the Navy's industrial base study, which resulted \nin the Navy's allocation method for awarding Arleigh Burke class \ndestroyers.\n  In short, Mr. President, the conferees endorsed the Navy's industrial \nbase analysis and the Navy's allocation method that resulted from its \nindustrial base study.\n  Assertions to the contrary are simply erroneous.\n  There are other conference outcomes that were important to the House, \nbut whose justification in my opinion is less clear. I would remind my \ncolleagues, however, that this was a long and difficult conference with \ncompromise necessary on both sides. We successfully rejected many \nprovisions sought by the House. But, as occurs in every conference, we \neventually accepted a few things that were important to House Members. \nIn doing so, however, we worked to ensure that the language adopted is \nsufficiently permissive that the Department of Defense retains adequate \ndiscretion in developing its course of action.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to address some assertions that have \nbeen made today on the nature of the conference agreement on nuclear \nattack submarines.\n  In his remarks this morning Senator Nunn implied that the conference \nagreement would commit the Navy and the Defense Department to a program \nof advanced technology development for submarines that is too costly \nand would risk the lives of Navy personnel. In my opinion Senator Nunn \ndid not correctly characterize the actual conference agreement.\n  Let me summarize the conference outcome on nuclear attack submarines \nas I see it:\n  The House and Senate had divergent goals. Believing the Navy's New \nAttack Submarine inadequate to its mission, the House conferees sought \na program for the incorporation of advanced technology into a series of \nfour developmental submarines before beginning series production. The \nSenate conferees sought authorization for the final Seawolf submarine, \nSSN-23, and competition for series production of the Navy's next class, \nthe New Attack Submarine.\n  The Senate conferees did not share the House's conclusions about the \ninadequacy of the New Attack Submarine to deal with future threats.\n  After a period of lengthy negotiations that included active \nparticipation by the Navy and the Department of Defense, a compromise \nwas reached.\n  In its barest essentials this compromise provides that: the Senate \nposition on authorization of SSN-23 and competition for future \nsubmarine procurement would be preserved; and the \n\n[[Page S18875]]\nHouse would gain a provision that directs the Department of Defense to \nprepare a plan that could lead to the insertion of technology through \nthe construction of a series of prototype submarines, each of which \nwould be cheaper and more capable.\n  I emphasize that the conference agreement accepts a requirement for a \nDOD plan. It does not commit the Senate to a program.\n  Do I think this issue will remain contentious? Yes, I do. In press \nrelease and interview the House is declaring that the conference \naccepted the House program.\n  Assertions to the contrary, the House is not correct. I urge my \ncolleagues to read the Conference Report. Any decision to pursue an \nadvanced submarine technology program that might emerge from the plan \nthat it mandates will be the subject of future debate and legislative \naction by Congress. This conference report commits no procurement funds \nto it. Further, the Senate has not endorsed the House's concept as the \nbest course of action to pursue for acquisition of submarines with the \nnecessary mission capabilities.\n  I agree with Senator Nunn that the twin objectives of lower cost but \nmore capable have proven elusive in the past--often sought but seldom, \nif ever, achieved.\n  I also agree with Senator Nunn that the language of the submarine \nprovision in the conference report could have spoken more directly to \nthe costs and risks associated with the House's technology thrust. I \nhave never said the provision could not be improved. What I have said \nis that it was the best compromise that could be achieved in this \nconference. Next year will be another matter.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that I would never, ever, endorse a \nspeculative and unproven program that would put the lives of American \nsailors needlessly at risk. This conference agreement does not do that, \nand I will never subscribe to a conference agreement that does.\n  Mr. President, another question has been raised concerning a \nconference outcome that would create a bipartisan congressional panel \non submarines. I want to address this question.\n  The House, in its conference position, was focused on ensuring the \nrapid incorporation of advanced technology into future submarines. The \nHouse's objective was ensure that sufficient technology would be \ninserted into submarine designs before beginning series construction of \na new class to ensure the United States retains a comfortable edge of \ntechnical superiority over any conceivable threat. Aware of potential \nopposition from DOD, the House's negotiating posture during conference \nwas based on the premise that extraordinary measures would need to be \ntaken to prevent bureaucratic or passive resistance from overcoming the \ntechnical thrust that it considered essential.\n  The Senate conferees' objective during conference was to preserve the \ncenterpiece of the Senate's submarine provision: competition based on \nprice. Consequently, the goals of the House and Senate were divergent.\n  After a period of lengthy negotiations, an agreement was reached that \nwas satisfactory to both House and Senate. One aspect of this \nagreement, an outcome strongly sought by the House conferees, was the \ncreation of a panel that will focus on the incorporation of advanced \ntechnology into future submarines. The House believed such a panel \nnecessary because it was not confident that could count on unbiased and \nobjective input by the Department of Defense.\n  In the original form proposed by the House, this panel would have \nbeen at Presidential level. Its membership would have included a cross-\nsection of experts appointed by the President, the House, and the \nSenate. Its oversight responsibilities and authority would have been \nquite broad.\n  The final form of the panel, as defined in the conference agreement, \nis much different. It will be composed of three members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and three members of the House National \nSecurity Committee. The members will be appointed by the chairmen of \nthe two committees. The panel will receive reports annually from the \nSecretary of the Navy on the status of submarine modernization and \nresearch and development. It will in turn report annually to the House \nNational Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nthe Navy's progress in developing a less expensive, more capable \nsubmarine.\n  While this panel will, by its nature, focus greater attention on \nsubmarines than other ships, all decisions regarding submarine programs \nwill of course continue to rest with two Armed Services committees.\n  Mr. President, some Senators also have objected to the inclusion of \nspending floors in the conference report.\n  The Senate conferees were opposed to inclusion of this language and \nresisted it during conference. We reluctantly accepted a version of the \nHouse-proposed language after concluding that acceptance was necessary \nin order to have a conference report. But we did so only after we made \nsure that both the Armed Services Committee's minority members and the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee were fully informed of its \nnature and our assessment that this was necessary to reach a conference \nagreement.\n  The conference report is part of a larger process that eventually \nleads to the obligation of funds for various purposes. There will be \nfuture opportunities for either the Appropriations Committee or the \nDepartment of Defense to register objection and prevent expenditures \nshould they desire to do so.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the Senate conferees won sufficient \nlatitude in the language so that DOD or the Appropriations Committee \nwould not be forced to spend funds or carry out actions to which they \nobjected.\n\n\n                            USUHS Provision\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, buried in the conference report on the \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 is a provision relating \nto the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the \nPentagon's medical school, that did not appear in either the version of \nthe bill that passed the House or the version that passed the Senate.\n  Though it has no force of law, the provision clearly was inserted by \nsupporters of the university at this stage of the Defense authorization \nlegislation in order to create the impression of support for the \nmedical school.\n  Mr. President, no one reading the record of this measure should be \nmisled by the sense-of-the-Congress provision in Section 1071(c) of \nthis bill. This language has been included at a stage of the \nlegislative process when, barring re-referral of the entire bill, the \nprovision effectively is untouchable.\n  Mr. President, some may wonder why the supporters of the university \nfelt it necessary to engage in this action.\n  The answer, for those who have followed this issue, is undoubtedly to \nanticipate reaction to a recent report of the General Accounting Office \nreviewing the cost-effectiveness of the university and alternative \nsources of military physicians.\n  That GAO report reaffirmed what other studies have found, namely that \nthe university is the single most costly source of physicians for the \nmilitary.\n  The findings of the GAO, released after the Senate could amend the \nfiscal year 1996 Defense authorization bill, confirm previous analyses \nof the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and \nBudget, and the Department of Defense itself, and are a powerful \nargument for the Pentagon to close the university, or dramatically \nchange its mission.\n  Last session, in assessing the 5-year budget impact of a plan to \nphase down the school, the Office of Management and Budget estimated \n$286.5 million in savings, including offsetting increases in the \nmilitary's physician scholarship program--a less costly mechanism for \nobtaining military physicians. After the university is fully closed, \nthe annual savings would be in excess of $80 million.\n  Mr. President, as GAO has confirmed, the university is the single \nmost expensive source of physicians for the military.\n  As a practical matter, though, the military does not rely primarily \non the university for its doctors.\n  The Pentagon's medical school provides only about 1 of every 10 of \nthe physicians for our military, while nearly three-fourths come from \nthe scholarship program.\n  Nor, evidently, has relying primarily on these other sources \ncompromised \n\n[[Page S18876]]\nthe ability of military physicians to meet the needs of the Pentagon.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, of the \napproximately 2,000 physicians serving in Desert Storm, only 103, about \n5 percent, were USUHS trained.\n  More generally, testimony by the Department of Defense before the \nSubcommittee on Force Requirements and Personnel suggested that, based \nupon a 1989 study, it needed to maintain a 10 percent of retention rate \nof physicians beyond 12 years, and that alternative sources like the \nscholarship program may already be meeting the retention needs of the \nservices.\n  Even if military planners decide this level of retention is \ninsufficient, as the GAO report proposed, changes could be made to the \nscholarship program to address any perceived need for higher retention \nrates.\n  The GAO report specifically cited a possible enrichment component for \nthe scholarship program which would require a longer payback obligation \nfor selected students in return for additional benefits, training, and \nmilitary career opportunities.\n  The GAO report also suggested that additional readiness training \ncould be provided through a postgraduate period specifically designed \nto enhance the physician's preparation for the special needs of \nmilitary medicine.\n  Mr. President, this latest GAO report joins work done by the CBO, the \nVice President's National Performance Review, the Grace Commission, and \nthe Department of Defense itself in questioning whether the cost of \nmaintaining an entire medical school for the Pentagon is justified.\n  The sense-of-the-Congress provision slipped into this conference \nreport cannot change these fundamental judgments.\n  The overall DOD authorization bill is defective in many ways, \nespecially in its failure to shoulder the kind of significant share of \ndeficit reduction necessary to balance the Federal budget in 7 years.\n  The sense-of-the-Congress provision relating to the Uniformed \nServices University of the Health Sciences is emblematic of that flaw, \nand I urge the President to veto this measure when it is presented to \nhim, and push Congress to craft a more fiscally responsible measure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I oppose the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report on a number of grounds. There are some \npositive provisions, such as those concerning pay, family and troop \nhousing, and other issues. But the conference report remains wholly \nunacceptable, indeed worse in some key ways than the Senate bill. If it \npasses today, I earnestly hope the President will veto the bill so that \nwe can begin a more genuine effort to pass a bipartisan defense bill.\n  I am all for a strong national defense, and I too want to ensure that \nour troops in Bosnia have everything they need to defend themselves. \nBut that operation in its entirety is scheduled to cost about $1.5-2 \nbillion; this bill provides over $260 billion in Defense spending \noverall--over $7 billion more than the President's request. I had urged \nthe President to veto the DOD appropriations bill, and I also hope he \nwill veto this one.\n  The conference report moves in exactly the wrong direction concerning \nAmerica's real priorities during extremely difficult fiscal times. At \nthe very moment that Republicans are forcing a shut-down of parts of \nthe Government over our disagreement about how much to cut from vital \nprograms that benefit the country's working middle class, as well as \nthose which serve the Americans, including the elderly and children, \nwho are most in need of Government services, this bill substantially \nincreases funding for weapons programs which are not needed.\n  Let me offer just a few examples. The bill adds $493 million for new \nB-2 bombers, and it adds $925 million for ballistic and cruise missile \ndefense initiatives. A number of weapons program earmarks and other \npork projects have been included which do not represent rational \ndefense policy and spending. Many were also included in the Senate \nbill. The bill also establishes an arms sales loan-guaranty program, \nfurther subsidizing militarization in other countries, flying in the \nface of U.S. arms control efforts around the world.\n  It includes $50 million for unnecessary, even counterproductive, \nhydronuclear tests. In fact, the bill adds $7 billion overall to the \nDefense Department's own request for funding for the fiscal year. Over \n$7 billion more than the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of \nDefense, and the President requested. That is astonishing, especially \nin this budget climate. How can we consider cutting food stamps, low-\nincome heating assistance, Medicare and Medicaid before we even begin \nto tighten the military's belt in areas where the Department itself has \nsaid it can save?\n  The bill would undermine major arms control treaties against nuclear \nproliferation. Through its requirement of deployment of a national \nmissile defense system, beginning by 2003, many are concerned that the \nbill signals an intention on the part of this country unilaterally to \nviolate the Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty. I share that concern, \nas well as the concern that provisions of this bill could negatively \naffect Russian consideration of the START II Treaty. I have spoken on \nthe floor regarding these topics in the past, and a number of my \ncolleagues have done so today. Undermining these treaties would \nrepresent an historic error, and set us back many years in our arms \ncontrol efforts. They have received bipartisan support in this body and \nwere negotiated and approved by administrations of both parties. They \nshould be strictly observed, not abrogated. And negotiations on the \nnext phase should be pressed ahead quickly.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to raise an issue about which a \nnumber of colleagues and I have communicated to the chairman and the \nranking member of the committee. That is the issue of procurement. As a \nmember of the Small Business Committee, I have attempted to follow \nclosely issues that affect small businesses in the area of procurement, \nand this bill, as many of my colleagues know, has become contentious \ndue to its actions in this area of policy. Provisions were added to the \nbill in conference in the name of acquisition reform which have \ngenerated some alarm in the small business community and among some who \nhave worked carefully on Governmentwide procurement reform in recent \nyears. In the very short time that has been available to study the \nprovisions of the report, it has been difficult to assess all of its \nlikely effects on procurement. But an initial reading indicates to me \nthat there are areas of legitimate concern.\n  On December 4, along with Senators Bumpers, Kerry and Moseley-Braun, \nI wrote to Chairman Thurmond of the Armed Services Committee and to \nSenator Nunn, who is the committee's ranking member. We expressed \nconcern that provisions relating to acquisition, not only by the \nDepartment of Defense, but Governmentwide, were being included in the \nconference report: provisions that were not contained in the bill as \noriginally passed by either the Senate or the House. Some of the \nprovisions were derived from H.R. 1670, a House-passed bill, and some \nwere derived from a Senate bill, S. 946. The provisions, as it turns \nout, underwent some modification before being added to this bill during \nthe conference. But substantial changes to Governmentwide procurement \npolicy are indeed contained here. The concern which my colleagues and I \nexpressed in our letter, that such changes might undercut important \nprocurement reforms undertaken by Congress in recent years, especially \nby weakening the practice, if not the principle, of full and open \ncompetition, remain. I therefore hope that following a veto of this \nbill by the President, the issue can be reexamined.\n  I share these concerns not only with my Senate colleagues with whom I \nhave worked on this issue in recent weeks. I also would like to point \nout the important work done on the House side by Small Business \nCommittee Chair Jan Meyers of Kansas. Mrs. Meyers has championed small \nbusiness interests during this process, and has reached similar \njudgments to those which I am setting out here. We both question the \nwisdom of undertaking significant Governmentwide procurement \nlegislation, even in the name of ``streamlining,'' in the very \nrestricted process of passing a Defense authorization conference \nreport. And we both believe that the objections raised by a \n\n[[Page S18877]]\nnumber of small business organizations to the provisions themselves \nhave some merit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWashington Post dated November 17, 1995, be printed in the Record. And \nI point out that the Small Business Legislative Council, National Small \nBusiness United, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the \nNational Association for the Self-Employed and others all have \nexpressed serious reservations about the procurement provisions. I hope \nwe will have a chance to revisit the issue.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1995]\n\n                        Uncle Sam's Buying Power\n\n                           (By Kathleen Day)\n\n       A quiet storm has erupted in Congress over efforts to \n     reform how the government spends $200 billion a year to by \n     items ranging from paper clips and computers to jet fighters \n     and tanks.\n       Supporters of the proposal, led by Rep. William F. Clinger \n     Jr. (R-Pa.) and the Clinton administration, say pending \n     legislation would save taxpayers millions of dollars by \n     reducing bureaucracy, giving procurement officers by reducing \n     bureaucracy, giving procurement officers throughout \n     government more flexibility to buy items as they see fit and \n     allowing the government to pay the same competitive prices as \n     private businesses.\n       ``We think on balance it would be a good set of additional \n     reforms,'' said Leroy Haugh of the Aerospace Industries \n     Association, which represents defense giants such as General \n     Dynamics Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp.\n       But others, including Rep. Jan Meyers (R-Kan.), AT Corp. \n     and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the proposed changes \n     will return the federal government to the days when the \n     Pentagon paid $7,400 for a coffeepot and $640 for a toilet \n     seat. They contend the proposed changes would cut competition \n     by letting the government limit the number of companies \n     making bids and allowing the White House to waive purchasing \n     rules at will.\n       They say the result would be a system that shuts out many \n     small companies and enables a few large players to dominate \n     federal contracting, making it tougher for others to win \n     government business. Worst of all, they say, the proposals \n     are being crafted behind closed doors, without the benefit of \n     public scrutiny.\n       ``This would fundamentally change public procurement,'' \n     said Edward J. Black, president of the Computer and \n     Communications Industry Association, whose members include \n     Amdahl Corp., AT, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Oracle Corp. \n     ``For that to be done in some secret room without everyone \n     being able to see what's going on is a problem.''\n       ``I wouldn't characterize it as a secret, but as a \n     proposal that's followed an unusual legislative path,'' \n     said the Aerospace Industry Association's Haugh.\n       The changes are being considered by House and Senate \n     conferees who are working on legislation setting the Defense \n     Department's budget for fiscal 1996. That, critics say, is \n     part of the problem: A proposal to change purchasing rules \n     for all federal agencies, not just the Pentagon, should not \n     be considered as an amendment to a military funding bill, but \n     in separate legislation.\n       Lawmakers in the conference could finish their work on the \n     DOD funding bill as early as today, congressional aides said.\n       The effort comes just a year after Congress approved \n     legislation changing procurement procedures, and a decade \n     after it passed a law requiring more competition in \n     government contracting. About the only thing that both sides \n     agree on is that the controversy over purchasing rules \n     highlights the difficulty of cutting government red tape \n     while preserving safeguards that ensure taxpayer funds are \n     spent wisely.\n       Legislation being discussed would:\n       Give government buyers more leeway in eliminating companies \n     early in the bidding procedure. The goal is to save the time \n     and money the government spends in considering companies that \n     clearly are not qualified to win a contract.\n       Encourage the government to purchase, whenever possible, \n     off-the-shelf items available to the general public, instead \n     of paying to create goods or services from scratch. (The \n     storied $7,400 ``hot brewing machine,'' better known as a \n     coffee-pot, was so costly because it was built from scratch \n     for the Air Force.)\n       Simplify how the government makes requests for goods and \n     services, with the goal of curtailing waste of time and money \n     writing needlessly detailed specifications.\n       Change the system that allows losing companies to challenge \n     contract awards. The goal is to eliminate frivolous protests.\n       Allow agencies to spell out contracting rules through \n     regulation, rather than laying down those rules by law. One \n     proposal would give the White House appointee in charge of \n     federal procurement policy power to waive rules governing a \n     particular contract--rules specifying, for example, how many \n     companies need to bid or what the bidding deadline is.\n       ``What comes out of this conference could be a very \n     positive approach,'' said Steven Kelman, head of the White \n     House's Office of Federal Procurement Policy. The assertions \n     that changes could bring back high-priced coffeepots ``are \n     scare tactics,'' he said.\n       Kelman said more companies would compete for government \n     business if there were less red tape. The legislation also \n     would reduce the time it takes the government to award \n     contracts, sending a signal to companies that the government \n     will no longer tolerate sloppy work and delays, supporters \n     say.\n       Others disagree. ``The decision to bid on a government \n     contract is a business decision that should not be wrested \n     away by faceless government bureaucrats,'' said Jody Olmer of \n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents 215,000 \n     companies--96 percent with 100 or fewer employees.\n       ``If the rules regarding who can do business with the \n     government are changed in the manner under consideration,'' \n     she said, ``it could lead to higher prices, less competition. \n     It could eliminate a number of smaller businesses from the \n     process.''\n       ``The government has an obligation to play fair so that all \n     citizens have a chance to bid for contracts involving \n     taxpayers' dollars,'' Black said.\n       He and others say that last year's reform law, which is \n     supported by both sides in this year's debate, didn't take \n     effect until last month and therefore hasn't had enough time \n     to work before being tampered with.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have divided feelings about the \nconference report on the fiscal year 1996 Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. I am very pleased that the conferees have retained \nmy amendment prohibiting members of the Armed Forces convicted of \nserious crimes from receiving their pay. However, I am strongly opposed \nto a number of policy provisions and spending requirements in the bill. \nHowever, on balance, I believe that this conference agreement would \nmove our national defense strategy into a new and unwise direction.\n  Early this year, I was shocked to discover that the Pentagon \ncontinued to keep violent military criminals on the payroll even after \ntheir conviction by courts martial. Each month, about $1 million is \npaid to incarcerated murders, rapists, child molesters, and other \nconvicted criminals.\n  When I learned of this outrageous practice, I immediately began \nworking with Pentagon and Armed Services Committee leaders to craft a \nlegislative solution to this outrageous abuse. Working together, we \nwere able to craft a successful fix, which was approved by the Senate \nby an overwhelming vote. I wish to thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Nunn, and the Personnel Subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Coats, for their thoughtful cooperation and helpful suggestions \nin addressing this problem.\n  While I am pleased that my military convicts amendment was retained \nin conference, I believe that on balance, this bill takes our national \ndefense strategy in the wrong direction.\n  This bill spends $7 billion more than the Pentagon's military \nplanners believe they need to meet our national security needs. Much of \nthis $76 billion bonus is earmarked for special interest pork-barrel \nprograms that our military planners neither need nor want. This kind of \nwasteful spending should not be permitted.\n  The bill undermines the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty requiring the \ndeployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It more than \ndoubles the administration's funding request for the National Ballistic \nMissile Defense Program. This return to the Reagan-era ``star wars'' \nprogram is a clear waste of tax dollars.\n  The conference report virtually eliminates the Office of the Director \nof Test and Evaluation. This office is the cornerstone of our ``fly \nbefore you buy'' policy, which was created as a remedy for the \nnotorious procurement abuses of the late 1970's and early 1980's. I was \na member of the House Armed Services Committee when the OT office was \ncreated in 1983 and played an active role in crafting the legislation \nestablishing the office. In my view, the OT has saved billions of \ntaxpayer dollars and has ensured that the weapons our troops in the \nfield receive will function properly. To abandon the OT in the name \nof procurement streamlining will waste billions of dollars and put our \ntroops at needless risk.\n  This conference report contains a pair of irrational personnel \nprovisions that are unfair to our troops and will \n\n[[Page S18878]]\nundermine morale and degrade readiness. First, it denies the rights of \nmilitary personnel and their dependents to terminate pregnancies in \nmilitary hospitals. I believe it is fundamentally wrong to deny \nconstitutionally protected rights to our troops and their families \nsimply because they are stationed overseas.\n  Second, the conferees accepted an outrageous House provision \nrequiring the discharge of military personnel who test positive for the \nHIV virus. There is no rational basis whatsoever for this provision. \nThe current Pentagon policy on this issue is wholly adequate.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that it be divided equally, charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom New Hampshire [Mr. Smith].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding, and I rise in support of the Defense authorization conference \nreport.\n  At the outset, Mr. President, I want to congratulate Senator Thurmond \nfor his strong and determined leadership and tireless efforts on behalf \nof this legislation. It is a very, very difficult process to get this \nbill to the floor, but Senator Thurmond never gave up, and he has spent \nan awful lot of time talking to Members trying to work out agreements \nto get us here.\n  It was a difficult conference with the House. While we experienced \nsome growing pains in the process, I think the product, even though we \ndo not all agree with it, is something we can be proud of. We do not \nagree with everything in it, but it is something we can be proud of.\n  The Senator from South Carolina deserves a great deal of credit for \nhis leadership and, more importantly, for his commitment to the men and \nwomen who wear the uniform of the United States of America.\n  We are always grateful to the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina for that strong leadership.\n  The legislation before us authorizes approximately $264 billion for \nnational defense. This funding level is about $7 billion more than the \nPresident's request, but it is consistent with the concurrent budget \nresolution adopted by Congress earlier this year.\n  Some have questioned this level, and I want to emphasize that even \nwith the increased funds, the bill provides 2.3 percent less than last \nyear's defense bill in real terms. The truth is that real defense \nspending has declined every year since 1985. Of course, you do not hear \nabout that much in the news, but for the last 11 straight years, \ndefense spending, in terms of a percentage of the entire U.S. budget, \nhas gone down.\n\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I want to briefly summarize some of \nthe highlights of the bill before us.\n  There is a 2.4-percent pay raise for our troops and a 5.2-percent \nincrease in the basic allowance for quarters. I find it somewhat ironic \nthat the President, who sends the troops to Bosnia, now may veto this \nbill which provides them with a 2.4-percent pay raise. Some of these \ntroops may even be eligible for food stamps, and we are putting them in \nharm's way in Bosnia. I think it would be immoral for the President to \nveto this legislation.\n  It includes an adjustment to equalize the schedule for military \nretiree COLA's to be sure they are provided the same schedules as \nFederal civilian COLA's and also includes a variety of acquisition \npolicies urgently needed to maintain the pace of procurement reform \nbegun last year. These are items under my subcommittee, and they are \ngoing to significantly increase the ability of Federal agencies to buy \nstate-of-the-art technology from the commercial sector and reduce \nbarriers for companies, both large and small, who want to sell their \ngoods and services to the Government.\n  All of these provisions are fully consistent with the existing \nrequirements for full and open competition.\n  In the area of relieving burdens on contractors, we provided a total \nexemption for the suppliers of commercial items from the requirement to \nprovide certified cost and pricing data under the Truth in Negotiations \nAct. We also provided extensive relief from requirements for special \ncertification of compliance of laws applicable to Government \ncontractors and eased the requirements governing acquisition of \ncommercially off-the-shelf products.\n  In addition to these changes, we have included a series of \ninitiatives which are intended to streamline acquisition. For instance, \nwe have included a provision allowing agencies to use streamline \nsolicitations and flexible notice deadlines in the procurement of \ncommercial items under the amount of $5 million.\n  This is a 3-year test program that does not alter the requirements \nfor notice or the requirements for full and open competition in these \nprocurements.\n  Finally, under acquisition, we have included a major reform in the \nmanner Federal agencies purchase information technology. This has been \nspearheaded, for the most part, by my colleague and friend from Maine, \nSenator Cohen. We have eliminated the jurisdiction of the General \nServices Administration over Federal agency information technology \nprocurements, including the role of the General Services Board of \nContract Appeals in bid protests.\n  So the acquisition reform provisions were developed in a bipartisan \nmanner, with the involvement and cooperation of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the participation of representatives from the \nSmall Business Committee staff.\n  These changes have been the subject of hearings, numerous hearings, \nover the past years. They are issues thoroughly researched and \nconsidered prior to inclusion in this bill.\n  Let me talk about a few other things in the bill, Mr. President. \nThere is a $480 million increase in military construction funding \nwhich, although it takes great criticism from some here, it enhances \nthe life of our troops and their families. They have to be able to live \nin a decent place. In some cases, prisoners who serve in penitentiaries \nin the United States of America have better quarters than our armed \nservices.\n\n  This Senator is not going to stand out here on the floor and watch \nother Senators demagog the whole issue of military construction when, \nin fact, it is necessary. It is not all pork. There is some pork, and \nwe tried to get that pork out. Did we get it all? Probably not, but we \ngot a lot of it. But building good housing and having decent places for \nmilitary to work and live in is not pork.\n  There is $300 million to continue the so-called Nunn-Lugar \ncooperative threat reduction program with the states of the former \nSoviet Union. You can see what is happening now in the Soviet Union. \nThat is taking on more importance. There is an increase of over $1 \nbillion in operation and maintenance accounts to enhance readiness. And \nmost importantly, perhaps, from this Senator's point of view, is the \nBallistic Missile Defense Act of 1995, which establishes policies on \ndevelopment and deployment of missile defenses, and this includes an \nincrease of $604 million to accelerate promising theater missile \ndefense programs.\n  Not everyone is going to like every provision in this bill. I \ncertainly do not. But it is the nature of the legislative process that \na good bill reflect the philosophies and priorities of all of us as \nmuch as possible.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, to be very candid, it troubles me \nvery much that the administration has announced its intent to veto, \neven before we adopt it, this conference report. As the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Acquisition and Technology, I worked very hard, \nfrankly, to accommodate the interests and priorities of the \nadministration in my areas, sometimes taking on some of my own party to \ndo it. I am not happy about the fact that one of the veto message items \nin this bill deals with areas that were under my jurisdiction, \nspecifically the Technology Reinvestment Program.\n  Frankly, I was specifically assured by Under Secretary Paul Kaminski \nfor \n\n[[Page S18879]]\nAcquisition that the administration appreciated the support and would \naccept our funding level, and now I find that it is one of the reasons \nfor being vetoed. I was surprised and offended to see the TRP issue \nlisted as a reason for the President's threat to veto the bill. I have \ndealt in good faith with the administration on this issue. If this is \nthe reward for being open and accommodating, I can assure my friends in \nthe administration, I may not be so open and accommodating the next \ntime around. I do not appreciate it, and I want everybody to understand \nthat. I deal in good faith with people, and I expect reciprocal \ntreatment.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am also troubled by the statements of the \ndistinguished ranking member, whom I respect immensely and he knows \nthat, Senator Nunn, regarding the ballistic missile defense provisions \nof the bill. We have met a number of times with Senator Nunn, many of \nus who worked on this negotiation.\n  The bill before us accommodates virtually every single concern \nSenator Nunn raised, as far as I am aware. It retains the compromise \nlanguage on demarcation that was included in the Senate bill, and it \neliminates the requirement to deploy a multiple-site national missile \ndefense, much to my consternation. In addition, it retains program \nguidance from the Senate-passed bill.\n  These were big concessions to the minority, huge concessions to the \nadministration, and, quite honestly, we had a tough time swallowing \nthem, but we did it to get a bill here that would move us in the right \ndirection, even though it was not as far as we wanted to go on missile \ndefense, and we did it in good faith, and now we find the rug is pulled \nout from under us.\n  It is clear that there was not a good-faith negotiation on the part \nof the administration on this issue. The administration has told us \nwhat the veto debate was, and we moved away from that, and still we \nhave that action hanging over us. I do not want to be on that side of \none--if the administration wants to be there, that is fine--that takes \nthe position that the administration now has no intention of ever \nprotecting the American people from ballistic missile attack. If they \nwant to be on that side of the issue, that is fine. I do not want to be \non that side of the issue. In its statement of policy, the \nadministration specifically calls national missile defense ``unwanted \nand unnecessary.'' Let me repeat that. The administration calls \nnational missile defense unwanted and unnecessary.\n  With all due respect, who is it that defines protecting all Americans \nin all 50 States to be unwanted and unnecessary? I have not heard \nanybody say that. I find it difficult to believe that there are people \nout there who would not want to be protected from a missile. That is \nwhat has been said.\n  So it is President Clinton--let us be very clear about it--that is \nthe problem. The United States currently has no defense against \nballistic missile attacks. Zero. We are totally vulnerable. If a \nmissile is fired at us, we cannot stop it. Believe that or not. The \nadministration does not intend to correct that. We fought hard to get \nthese provisions in there.\n  So the administration does not intend to ever deploy national missile \ndefenses. And now, when Congress takes action to correct this \nvulnerability, as we have done in this bill, we get the veto threat.\n  The truth is that nothing in this bill violates the ABM Treaty. It \nonly calls for deployment, by 2003, of a ground-based national missile \ndefense. There is no requirement that it be a multiple-site system. I \nwish it was, but it is not. We went as far as we could go to get the \nsupport of the minority, and the minority pulls out the rug. I find it \nunbelievable that this President, and some here in the Senate, with \ntroops in the field in Bosnia--we heard a lot of speeches about how we \nhave to support the men and women in Bosnia. That is why we should send \nthem there, because we have to support them. The President wants them \nto go there. I disagreed with all that. I believe in supporting the \ntroops once they are there, and the best way to do that is voting for \nthis bill. If you do not, you are not supporting the troops, you are \nnot giving them a pay raise, better housing, better weapons. If you do \nnot vote for this, you are not. Let us not hear about any of this \nconversation and discussion out here about how you are supporting the \ntroops in the field because you are not doing it.\n  The Russians have taken full advantage of this single-site ground-\nbased system and ABM deployment talk, and they have deployed a national \nmissile defense system near Moscow. There is no breach of the ABM \nTreaty and no anticipatory breach of the treaty in this bill, period. \nYet, that is what we are being told on the floor.\n  How is the President going to explain this to the American people? He \nis going to veto a bill--to put it another way, he sends troops to \nBosnia and will veto the bill that provides a pay raise and improves \nquality of life for their families, provides ammunition and the spare \nparts and equipment they need to do their jobs. That is what is \nhappening, and this should be exposed on the floor of the Senate. This \nis an authorization bill, and it gets a little dry in the discussion. \nBut let us call it what it is. That is what it is.\n\n  How is the President going to explain this? I do not know. How is he \ngoing to explain it? We have heard a lot of talk about the importance \nof supporting the troops in the past few days. Well, that is not \nhappening today. If you vote against this bill, you are not supporting \nthe troops. You are not supporting the necessary programs for them and \ntheir families.\n  So we have a Commander in Chief here, who, by vetoing this bill or \nthreatening to veto the bill, is abandoning his troops when they need \nhim the most. He sends them all over the world--to Bosnia, Somalia, \nHaiti, Cuba, wherever he feels like sending them to do police work--\nwithout the support of the American people in most cases. And he cannot \nsign a defense bill that provides a pay raise and gives them the \nequipment and facilities, maintenance, and materials they need. And \nanother reason for not signing the bill and vetoing it is because he \ndoes not want to protect the United States of America from missile \nattack. That is the reason the President has given for vetoing this \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about these comments \nwhen you vote. If the President is about to walk off a cliff when he \nvetoes this bill, do you want to be hanging onto his coattails when he \ngoes? I hope not. If you vote against the defense bill, you are doing \nthat.\n  The troops and their families are watching, I can tell you. They know \nwhat the stakes are. They know what the stakes are. These are the \nfamilies on food stamps out there, whose parents are headed to Bosnia. \nIf you vote against this bill, you will be voting to deny them that \nraise, deny them housing upgrades, and deny the very basic subsistence \nthey so badly need.\n  Who is really abandoning our troops then? It will be very clear to \nthe American public I assure you.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support the bill before us. The \nlegislative initiatives and funding authorizations contained in the \nconference report are essential to keep faith with our men and women in \nuniform and to preserve our national security. Those troops, including \nthe 20,000 who will be deploying to Bosnia, need us now more than ever.\n  I urge each of you to send the strongest message possible that you \nsupport them and their families by supporting this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nNew Hampshire for the excellent remarks he made on this bill. He is a \nvaluable member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he renders \nthis country a great service.\n  I will yield 10 minutes to the able Senator from Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne, and after that, I will yield 10 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, then 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, and then 10 minutes to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to pick up on the theme \nthat the Senator from New Hampshire \n\n[[Page S18880]]\nwas referencing--that is, the troops. When I go out and visit the \ntroops, wherever they may be, throughout the world, whether it was in \nSomalia, or Bosnia, or what have you, and I discuss their thoughts with \nthem and ask them, ``What is on your mind? What are your top \nconcerns?'' they bring up the whole question of the benefits.\n  Remember, we have volunteer armed services. They want to know what \nCongress and the President is really doing with regard to the benefits, \nsuch as their pay and their living conditions. It is a well-known fact \nthat we can be very effective at recruiting these very, very talented \nyoung men and women into the military. But whether or not we retain \nthem is based upon whether we really are serious and whether we deliver \nwhen we say that we are going to take care of the best fighting forces \nin the world.\n  Now, in this particular legislation that is before us, this Defense \nauthorization bill, if in fact we support the troops, then this is the \nbill that we must vote for. Only by voting for this bill do we give to \nthe military the full military pay raise. How in the world do you \nexplain to those troops that we have sent to Bosnia for Christmas that, \nby golly, we support you with everything we have here, with the \nexception that I did vote against the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, and I denied you the full pay increase that you are \ndue? I do not think that squares. I think it is pretty easy to stand in \nthe luxury of this facility and say how much we support them, but then \ncast a negative vote against a pay increase; or how about the increase \nin the quarters allowance, so that we can retain them, because you are \ngoing to have to do things for the families of our military if you are \ngoing to retain them. The Secretary of Defense's military housing \nprogram--it is estimated that it will take us 30 years to upgrade the \nhousing that we put the best fighting force in the world in as their \nliving quarters. Or the cost-of-living allowance--in order to provide \nthem equity with the civil Federal employees, you have to vote for this \nbill. If you do not vote for this bill, then you are denying the \nmilitary of this Nation equity with the other Federal employees.\n\n  There are many provisions in this bill, as has been pointed out in \nthe debate that has taken place on the floor of this Senate. There are \nmany provisions that Senators have come to my office and have said: We \ncertainly ask you and urge you to vote with us regarding, for example, \nThe Seawolf program, whether or not we ought to build this third \nSeawolf. There were discussions in my office. I support the \nconstruction of the third Seawolf. I think it is absolutely the right \nthing to do. I voted for it. Those Senators that came to my office \nurging me to vote for it, now I am told, are going to be voting against \nthe conference report that does authorize the funds for the Seawolf. \nThey are also the ones that, by casting that negative vote, are denying \nthe military the full military pay increase. I do not think it squares. \nDoes that mean that I like everything in this bill? Absolutely not.\n  I think, for example, Mr. President, that the B-2 bomber is truly one \nof the most fantastic aircraft that will ever be designed. We are \nfortunate that we have in our arsenal B-2 bombers. I would love to see \nus have additional B-2 bombers.\n  In this particular report, as we did in the Armed Services Committee, \nI had to ask the question, how is it that we only provide $493 million \nfor the B-2 bomber program? Yes, we can come up with $493 million this \nyear, but no one has been able to adequately tell me after this year \nhow do you come up with $20 billion to provide for the additional B-2 \nbombers. No one has been able to answer that question. It should be \nanswered. This commits us to going down that road.\n  I do not agree with that based on the rationale I just mentioned, \nbased upon what I argued in the Armed Services Committee, but that does \nnot mean I will walk away from my responsibility to support this \nconference report and what it means to the men and women that wear the \nuniforms of the armed services of the United States of America.\n  This conference report has real cleanup at the Department of Energy \nsites throughout the United States. It expedites the environmental \nrestoration at a variety of these sites--the environmental restoration. \nHow is it that so many of our colleagues say they are out front on all \nthe efforts toward environmental sensitivity cleanup, but on some of \nour own Federal sites they will walk away from that by voting against \nthis conference report?\n  This conference report also includes a landmark sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution describing and affirming the recent settlement between the \nState of Idaho, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Navy \nregarding the shipment and storage on an interim basis of spent nuclear \nfuel in the State of Idaho. The settlement between the State and the \nFederal Government will allow the Navy and Department of Energy to meet \ntheir national security requirements to the Nation over the next 40 \nyears. But the settlement also significantly assures the people of the \nState of Idaho that all spent nuclear fuel will leave the State by the \nyear 2035. The agreement is the result of long and difficult \nnegotiations between the Governor of Idaho, Phil Batt; the attorney \ngeneral, Al Lance; the Assistant Secretary of Energy, Tom Grumbly; the \nDOE General Counsel, the Director of Nuclear Naval Propulsion and the \nNavy General Counsel.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like give my colleagues some \nbackground to explain the importance of the Sense of the Congress \nResolution in the fiscal year 1996 Defense authorization conference \nreport concerning the shipment and interim storage of spent nuclear \nfuel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.\n  Since the 1950's, the Navy sent its spent nuclear fuel to the Idaho \nNational Engineering Laboratory [INEL] for reprocessing at the Idaho \nChemical Processing Plant [ICPP], known as the Chem Plant, in eastern \nIdaho. At the Chem Plant, the uranium contained in the naval spent fuel \nwas extracted and sent to Oak Ridge for use in the Nation's weapons \ncomplex. The resulting liquid waste was stored and later calcined into \na dry substance. In 1992, the Nation stopped reprocessing spent nuclear \nfuel. After 1992, spent nuclear fuel from naval reactors came to INEL \nfor interim storage at the Chem Plant.\n  In the wake of the decision to end reprocessing, Idaho Governor Cecil \nAndrus went to court to block the shipment and storage of Department of \nEnergy and Navy spent nuclear fuel to Idaho. On June 28, 1993, Judge \nHal Ryan of the District Court of Idaho issued an injunction blocking \nthe shipment of Navy and DOE spent nuclear fuel to Idaho until an \nenvironmental impact statement assessed the impact of storing this \nmaterial in Idaho.\n  The injunction against shipments to Idaho threatened to delay the \nNavy's ability to refuel and defuel nuclear powered ships because the \nNavy possessed limited storage space for this material at the shipyards \nthat did this work. As the threat to the Navy's refueling and defueling \nschedule increased and the threat of job losses at the nuclear \nshipyards grew, supporters of the Navy's position sought to include a \nlegislative exemption from the National Environmental Protection Act \n[NEPA] for the Navy's nuclear shipments to Idaho. In fact, the \nchairman's mark of the fiscal year 1994 Defense authorization bill \nconsidered by the Senate Armed Services Committee included such a \nwaiver.\n  During the markup of this bill, I argued strenuously against the \nlegislative waiver. As I said at the time, it was inappropriate for the \nSenate to consider a waiver before we knew the facts about the impact \nof the court's injunction. At my urging, the legislative waiver was \ndropped from the bill approved by the Armed Services Committee. In lieu \nof a legislative waiver, the Armed Services Committee held a hearing on \nJuly 28, 1993, to assess the facts about the situation.\n  At the July 28 hearing, Governor Andrus, Senator Craig, Congressman \nCrapo, Admiral DeMars, and Tom Grumbly and others outlined the issues \nfacing the Navy, the Department of Energy, and the State of Idaho. In \nmy opening statement, I urged Chairman Exon to lock the doors until the \nparties at the witness table reached an equitable agreement that \nprotected the interests of the people of Idaho, the Navy, and the DOE. \nI also urged the witnesses and the members of the committee to \nestablish a new partnership to implement long-term solutions. The \n\n[[Page S18881]]\nhearing reaffirmed Governor Andrus' willingness to accept additional \nnaval spent nuclear fuel shipments if the shipments were required for \nnational security and work on the EIS continued.\n  On August 9, 1993, Governor Andrus, the Navy, and the DOE announced \nagreement on an interim settlement which allowed a minimum number of \nshipments to Idaho while the Navy and the DOE completed the \nenvironmental impact statement. I strongly supported the agreement \nnegotiated by Governor Andrus and the Federal Government because it \nprotected Idaho's rights, it allowed the Navy to meet its national \nsecurity requirements, and it avoided a legislative waiver of the NEPA \nlaw. On December 22, 1993, Judge Ryan accepted the settlement and \nmodified the injunction to allow the shipments required for national \nsecurity.\n  On April 28, 1995, the Department of Energy released the final EIS on \nspent fuel management which recommended consolidating spent nuclear \nfuel at INEL, the Hanford reservation, and the Savannah River site. At \nthat time, I called the Secretary's recommendation unfair and I urged \nher to reconsider this recommendation. A few weeks later, Governor Batt \nand the State of Idaho went to court to block the recommendations of \nthe EIS. On May 19, 1995, Judge Edward Lodge agreed to Governor Batt's \nrequest to maintain the injunction on spent nuclear fuel shipments \nwhile the court assessed the adequacy of the final EIS.\n  On June 1, 1995, Secretary O'Leary signed the record of decision \nwhich codified the administration's decision to send 1,940 additional \nshipments of spent nuclear fuel to the INEL. For the next 2 months, the \nDepartment of Justice and the Navy tried, but failed, in their appeal \nefforts to get Judge Lodge's injunction lifted.\n\n  As the dispute lingered, Governor Batt announced three conditions for \na settlement of this issue. In exchange for a binding commitment to: \nFirst, remove all spent nuclear fuel from Idaho by a date certain; \nsecond, accelerate clean up at the INEL; and third, provide new \nmissions for the site, Governor Batt announced he would accept some \nadditional shipments of spent nuclear fuel to the INEL for temporary \nstorage and preparation for ultimate disposition. Once the Governor set \nout the parameters of a fair agreement, I expressed my support for his \nthree conditions and urged the DOE and the Navy to meet his concerns. \nThroughout the months of negotiations that led to this agreement, I \nspoke with a variety of DOE, DOD, and Navy officials, including \nSecretary O'Leary, Deputy Secretary of Defense White, Navy Secretary \nDalton, Tom Grumbly, Admiral DeMars, and Steve Honigman, urging a \nsettlement along the terms outlined by Governor Batt. For example, at a \nJuly 20 meeting in Senator Warner's office, I told Admiral DeMars and \nthe Navy general counsel that I would vigorously oppose any effort to \nseek a legislative waiver for nuclear shipments to Idaho. Instead of \nseeking a legislative quick fix, I urged the Navy and the DOE to \nintensify negotiations with Governor Batt.\n  As the negotiations plodded along, Navy supporters once again sought \na legislative waiver to allow Navy spent nuclear fuel shipments to \nIdaho to continue. In fact, the House passed DOD appropriations bill \nincluded a legislative waiver for Navy shipments. When the Senate \nconsidered the defense authorization bill, I worked with Senators \nWarner, Exon, Smith, Craig, Cohen, Thurmond, and others to include an \namendment which urged a continuation of good faith negotiations between \nIdaho, DOE and the Navy. The defense authorization and appropriations \nbills considered and passed by the Senate did not include any waiver \nthat prejudiced Idaho's interest during these negotiations.\n  During the end game of the conference on the defense appropriations \nbill, Chairman Stevens called me at home one Friday evening to inform \nme that the House conferees insisted on their language allowing naval \nnuclear fuel shipments to Idaho despite the court's injunction. I \nthanked Senator Stevens for his heroic efforts on my behalf to delete \nthe House provision. In light of the position of the House conferees', \nI informed the Senator from Alaska that I would use every option at my \ndisposal to oppose the appropriations conference report if it included \na legislative waiver. He said he understood my position.\n  The final Department of Defense appropriations conference report \nincluded the House language exempting Navy shipments from the NEPA law \nand Senator Craig and I prepared to filibuster the bill. When it \nappeared that the Senate would take up the Defense appropriation \nconference report, Senator Craig and I went to see Senator Dole, the \nmajority leader, expressing our strong opposition to the bill. Senator \nCraig and I asked the Majority Leader to delay consideration of the \nbill to give Governor Batt additional time to negotiate with the DOE \nand the Navy. Senator Dole agreed to our request and delayed Senate \nconsideration of the bill. In the end, the House defeated the \nconference report on unrelated issues.\n  On October 16, 1995, Governor Batt, the Navy, and the DOE reached an \nagreement to allow around 1,100 nuclear shipments to Idaho over the \nnext 40 years in exchange for a court enforceable commitment to remove \nall spent nuclear fuel from Idaho by 2035 and expedite the clean up and \nwaste management activities at the INEL. The agreement also included a \nprovision to fund new missions at the INEL. I joined the rest of the \nIdaho congressional delegation in hailing this settlement as an \nhistoric agreement for the people of Idaho and the Nation. A day later, \nthe court accepted this settlement and shipments of Navy nuclear fuel \nto Idaho safely resumed.\n  Today, the Senate will consider the fiscal year 1996 defense \nauthorization conference report which includes the sense-of-the-\nCongress language on this agreement that I requested. The language \nreads: ``Congress recognizes the need to implement the terms, \nconditions, rights and obligations contained in the settlement \nagreement'' and ``funds requested by the President to carry out the \nsettlement agreement and such consent order should be appropriated for \nthat purpose.'' This sense-of-the-Congress resolution brings the \nlegislature into this settlement agreement. Under the U.S. \nConstitution, the obligation to provide the funds to implement this \nagreement falls on the Congress and I am pleased by my colleagues' \nrecognition of the importance of this accord.\n  Today, the Senate will take a big step forward in recognizing that we \nmust address the waste and spent nuclear fuel that has resulted, and \nwill result, from our national security policies. Today, the Senate \nwill state its intention to provide the funds to implement an agreement \nthat allows the Department of Energy and the Navy to meet their \nnational security requirements to the Nation.\n  In the years ahead, I will work tirelessly with my colleagues to \ninsure the Congress meets its responsibilities to implement this \nhistoric accord. I can assure my colleagues I will do everything I can \nto explain the importance of this agreement to every Senator. I want to \nthank my colleagues for their support for this sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say I have heard a lot in the \nlast 10 days, the last week we cast some tough votes with regard to \nBosnia. Everyone was making the points about supporting the troops. \nHere is your opportunity to support your troops by saying we will make \nsure that they have the full pay increase for them. It will assure that \nwe have the acquisition streamlining so they do not have to wait for \nthe moms, dads, husbands or wives to send equipment, as we did in \nDesert Storm, because it took too long to get it through the Federal \nprogram where you could buy things like a GPS system through Radio \nShack. That is wrong. If you support the troops you vote for this.\n  I conclude by saying I want to commend the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Strom Thurmond. What a remarkable man. He \nhas been leading us on this conference report. He has been leading that \ncommittee with the same vigor, the same determination as when he rode a \nglider behind enemy lines in World War II. Just as at that time he was \nserving the country, again as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, he is serving the country. He is doing all that he can to \nmake sure that we provide the necessary support for the men \n\n[[Page S18882]]\nand women in the uniform of the armed services of this Nation. I am \nproud to serve on a committee that Strom Thurmond is a chairman of. I \nurge all of my colleagues to join in voting for this conference report. \nThat is a signal you will send to the troops. It is the right signal. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to oppose the \nconference report, and I regret doing that. I have great respect for \nthe Senators who have worked on this. I have great respect for Senator \nThurmond and others.\n  It is interesting to me that we find ourselves during Christmas week \ntalking about a balanced budget. We find ourselves in meetings all over \nthe Capitol and at the White House trying to figure how do you struggle \nto cut spending to balance the budget, and we bring a defense \nauthorization bill to the floor that follows an appropriations bill \nthat said, ``By the way, Pentagon, one of the largest areas of public \nspending, you did not ask for enough money. We insist you spend more.''\n  That is what this bill says. This bill says to the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marines, ``You do not know what you need. We demand you buy more \ntrucks, more planes, more ships, more submarines because we do not \nthink you ordered enough. We will plug in some more money for you.''\n  We are debating all of these budget issues and appropriations bills, \nand we say we cannot quite afford the entire Head Start program so \n55,000 kids, all of whom have names, will no longer be in Head Start \nbecause we cannot quite afford it; 600,000 low-income inner-city \ndisadvantaged kids will not get summer jobs because we cannot afford \nthat; got to cut the Star Schools Program by 40 percent; we cannot \nafford energy assistance in the middle of winter for low-income folks \nwho live in Minnesota and North Dakota and elsewhere in this country.\n  But we say: By the way, there are some things we can afford. We can \nafford some things the Pentagon said it did not want. We can afford \n$493 million to start buying new B-2 bombers for a total bill of $31 \nbillion; we can afford $1.3 billion for an LHD-7 amphibious ship; $974 \nmillion for a second amphibious ship; we can afford more money for 6 F-\n15's that were not ordered; 6 F-16's that were not requested; 14 Kiowa \nWarrior helicopters that were not asked for.\n  Of course, the hood ornament on all of this extravagance is the \nNational Missile Defense Program. I know there is great disagreement \nabout this, and others will stand up and forcefully defend national \nmissile defense. I respect their views, and I will not in any way be \ncross about them personally, but only to say I think this is a terrible \nwaste of the taxpayers' money. Maybe we could get some old newspapers \nto put on the desks to say that the Soviet Union is gone. There is not \na Soviet Union any longer. The Republics are today, as I speak, \ndestroying missiles and nuclear warheads per an arms agreement. They \nare destroying both delivery systems and warheads as a result of an \narms agreement in which we reduce the number of weapons.\n  But we are saying we want to spend $450 million more in this \nconference report than the administration asked for, for a national \nmissile defense, better known as star wars. ``Star wars\" because this \nsays it ought to be a spaced-based component, ought to be multiple \nsites and we ought to deploy it immediately.\n  Let us decide as a country if our priority is to build star wars. \nDoes anybody think this makes sense--a 40 percent cut in Star Schools--\na tiny program to make American schools better, we cannot afford it, so \nwe cut it 40 percent--but we decide what is really important is $493 \nmillion added on for star wars? Someone somewhere is not thinking very \nclearly.\n  It would be interesting to have had this bill brought to the floor at \na different time. But it is brought to the floor in the middle of a \nwrenching debate about what we have money to spend on and what our \npriorities are, and we now say some of the most conservative Members of \nthis body say, ``By the way, we are deficit hawks. We are for a \nbalanced budget. We are for cutting Federal spending, except today, \nTuesday.'' This bill we are going to do our way. And our way is to say \nto the Secretary of Defense: You do not know what you are talking \nabout; to the Air Force, to the Navy, to the Army and to the Marines: \nYou do not understand what you need. You order trucks? We insist you \norder more. You want submarines? We insist you buy more. Jet fighters? \nYou did not buy enough.\n\n  What on Earth is going on? I just do not understand it.\n  I know it will be justified in the name of national defense, it is \nfor national defense. If it is for national defense, stuff their \npockets with money, the sky is the limit, we have no end, no limit on \nthe American credit card when it comes to national defense. I tell you, \nthere are at least some Americans, this one included, and I think a \nnumber of my constituents, who wonder why you would want to put on \ntheir credit card $493 million for B-2's or $48 billion to build a star \nwars program in December of 1995. That seems, in my judgment, \ncompletely out of step with the priorities this country ought to be \nseeking.\n  They say, ``It is not star wars, it is national missile defense.'' \nOne of the sites may well be in my State. In fact, it is likely one of \nthe sites will be in northeastern North Dakota. Some people up there \nare sore at me because I will not support a program that may provide \nsome jobs up there. Maybe so. I know what it will provide, a $48 \nbillion deficit to build a star wars program--$48 billion to build a \nstar wars program, building an astrodome over America, as it were.\n  This makes no sense at all. Again, I will end as I started. I have \ngreat respect for Senator Strom Thurmond. I said it before, I think he \nis one of the legends of this Senate. He has done wonderful work for \nthis country, and I regret not being able to support this conference \nagreement. There are a number of things in it that are useful and \nimportant and make good investments in our armed services.\n  It gives me heartbreak to see the priorities that are established in \nthis Chamber. When it comes to helping people, helping kids, providing \nan entitlement for a school lunch for a poor kid in the middle of the \nday, or providing hope to a 4-year-old that he or she will be able to \ngo to a Head Start program that we know works to improve their life--\nwhen it comes to that, we say, ``I am sorry, we just can't afford it. \nWe will just tighten our belts.'' When it comes to this, it is like \nshopping at Toys-R-Us with a credit card that has no limits.\n  You want weapons programs? The Pentagon said you do not need \namphibious ships, and we have to decide between two, one costs $1.2 \nbillion and the other is $900 billion. The Pentagon wants neither. What \ndo we do? We buy both. Why limit ourselves? The conservative members of \nthe Congress say, ``The sky is the limit. Buy everything. Buy it all.''\n  I hope the next time we go around on this issue of establishing \npriorities for this country's spending, we will decide to do two \nthings. We will decide that we want to invest in a strong defense in \nthis country, but we will also decide that we are not going to add \nmegabucks to the budgets that were requested by the people who head the \narmed services who ought to know what we need to defend our country, \nmegabucks in terms of $7 billion this year, some $30 billion over the \nnext 7 years, added, layered on, despite the fact it was not requested \nand is not needed.\n  My hope is that in the coming couple of days, as we sort through \nthese priorities about what we think really strengthens this country \nand what we think our spending priorities ought to be, we will be able \nto do far better than this.\n  Mr. President, 100 years from now we will all be gone. None of us \nwill be here 100 years from now. The only thing they will know about \nthis group of people will be what we stood for, what our values were. \nThey can take a look at how we spent the public's money, how we used \nthe public's resources, what we thought was important, what we invested \nin.\n  They can look at the Federal budget and see something about what our \nvalues were, and they can see this group, at least, decided its values \nwere to try to get involved once again in another arms race by starting \nan ABM program. We decide we do not have any big programs started now, \nlet us restart it. Let us figure out how we can create a $48 billion \nstar wars program. Let us figure how we can add 20 B-2 bombers to the \ntune of $21 billion. \n\n[[Page S18883]]\n\n  I hope maybe we can change those decisions when we go back around \nthis next year, so those who study history and look at what we stood \nfor, what we thought was important, will understand we promoted a kind \nof investment strategy in this country that recognized the importance \nof defense, that recognized a strong defense is important, but also \nrecognized you do not get that by throwing money at defense. You do not \nget that by building every gold-plated weapons program that comes to \nmind. And you do not get it by shortchanging education and a whole \nrange of other areas that make this country stronger as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator has 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me yield back the 10 seconds. I \nappreciate the Senator from South Carolina and his work on this \nlegislation. Even though I am not intending to vote for it, let me hope \nwe reach a different result next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I regret the able Senator is not voting \nfor the bill, but I thank him for his kind comments.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the able Senator from Oklahoma, Senator \nInhofe. He is a valuable member of the Armed Services Committee, and we \nare very pleased to have him speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, for yielding. I am proud to be serving with such a great \nAmerican hero as Senator Strom Thurmond. It is such an honor to be in a \nposition to be able to do that.\n  The speaker just before me from North Dakota commented about our \npriorities and what has happened to our priorities in this country.\n  I am very happy to stand here and announce that today--at least it is \nscheduled for today--should be the birth of a great American by the \nname of James Edward Rapert, who will be my third grandchild.\n  When you stop and think about what we are looking for in this \ncountry, what we are planning for, and what this administration is \ntrying to do with all of the social programs that were mentioned by the \nprevious speaker from North Dakota, at the expense of building a strong \nnational defense, I wonder what is in line for someone like James \nEdward Rapert, who is coming into this country with a defense budget \nthat is much lower than it was last year, with a defense budget that \nhas fallen more than 40 percent over the past 11 years.\n  While I am rising in support of this conference report, I still say \nthat it is inadequate to take care of this country's strategic \ninterests. This bill does add $7 billion to the President's request. \nCongress is trying to fix what the President has been doing to our \ndefense system. But it is still 2.3 percent less than we spent on \ndefense last year.\n  I think it is very significant to realize and to understand and to \nsay on the floor of this Senate that the President of the United States \ndoes have a defense plan. It is called the Bottom-Up Review. It started \nin early 1993, when President Clinton became President. He started \nreviewing what we need to defend this Nation. Mr. President, his \ndefense budgets are still ranging from $50 billion to $150 billion less \nthan his own program requires.\n  We have had more than 10 years, more than a decade of cuts in our \nNation's security. In 1988, the Defense Department bought 438 combat \naircraft. This year it will be 34--and the administration only wanted \n12.\n  The citizens of Oklahoma sent me to Washington to try to restore \nAmerica's defense and not to watch the budget continue to fall, over \nand over and over again. I intend to support this bill, but I am hoping \nnext year we can do a better job.\n  Let me cover a couple of things that were mentioned by the previous \nspeaker.\n  First of all, I am very proud that this bill has a little bit of \nmoney in there to sustain a program that was put together some time ago \nso that we would have a national missile defense system in place by the \nyear 2000. The previous speaker used the term ``star wars.'' That is \nkind of a fun term to use because that makes people believe that this \nis kind of a Buck Rogers program --some kind of a science fiction \nprogram where you build this dome over the country against some type of \nattack. But we know that this is not science fiction, but a reality--we \nare $4 billion away from establishing a credible defense for the \nAmerican people against ballistic missiles. I remind my friend from \nNorth Dakota: former CIA director Jim Woolsey has said: ``We know of \nbetween 20 and 25 nations that either have, or are building, weapons of \nmass destruction, either chemical, biological, or nuclear, and are \nworking on the missile means of delivering these weapons.''\n  Maybe I am a minority, but I am willing to believe that we can \ndocument a case where the threat to this country is greater today than \nit was during the cold war. During the cold war, we knew who the enemy \nwas. It was the Soviet Union. So we could watch them. Now we know that \nwhile there is no longer a Soviet Union, there is a Russia, there is a \nChina, and they have this missile technology. There is every reason to \nbelieve that they are selling missile technology to places like Iraq, \nLibya, Iran, and other places--North Korea is working on the Taepo Dong \nII missile right now. That missile--our intelligence sources tell us, \nit is not even classified--should be able to reach both Hawaii and \nAlaska by the year 2000 and the rest of the continental United States \nby the year 2002, and we do not have a national missile defense system \nin place.\n  The previous Speaker keeps using the figure $48 billion. I have \nrefuted that over and over and over again on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate because it is not $48 billion. We have a $38 billion investment \nalready in the Aegis system that is already deployed. It is already out \nthere; 22 Aegis ships with missile launch defense capability. With only \napproximately $4 billion more, we could take that Aegis system and give \nthat the capability of knocking down missiles coming into the United \nStates. It is not $48 billion. We are talking about $4 billion more, \nand we can do that just by protecting an investment that is already \nthere of $38 billion. That was money well spent, but this bill puts us \nin the position where we are going to actually do something about \nprotecting ourselves against missile attack.\n  I wish there were more time to talk about that, but there is not, \nbecause this missile has too many other things that we need to talk \nabout.\n  The B-2 has taken a lot of hits. The very distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, Senator Kempthorne, characterized the B-2 as the ``most \nfantastic aircraft built.'' I agree with him. I think it is an \nincredible aircraft--and it is the only one that can carry out a \nmission that this country needs to be able to accomplish. This bill \nadds $493 million for continued B-2 production. The restrictions on the \nnumber of aircraft, and the restrictions on purchasing long lead items, \nhave been lifted. That means that, while we are in a position prior to \nthis particular bill, or this conference report, of cutting off \nproduction and being terminated at 20 aircraft, we can now go beyond \n20, if we determine that is in the best interest of the Nation's \nsecurity. Right now we are working on the 16th B-2 bomber. When this \nrolls off, we still have four more that will be produced. But we have \n$125 million left in the previous program to take care of that. That \nmoney will, of course, be most likely used by March 31 when the moneys \nthat we are talking about now would go into production. It will be a \nlot cheaper to keep a program going than to go through the very \nexpensive restart program for the B-2.\n  I agree in this case with the Secretary of Defense when he said, \n``Because potential regional adversaries may be able to mount military \nthreats against their neighbors with little or no warning, American \nforces must be postured to project power rapidly to support the U.S. \ninterests and allies.''\n  The B-2 provides rapid, long-range precision strikes anywhere in the \nworld on short notice and without refueling.\n  I have often thought to ask those individuals who argue against the \nB-2--what happens if we cut it off? What \n\n[[Page S18884]]\nhappens if we just discontinue the program, as many would like to do, \nat 20 aircraft? The Pentagon's long-range bomber study suggested \nearlier this year that we can rely on the existing B-52 until the year \n2030. Mr. President, the B-52 would be 70 years old by that time. I \nthink when you talk about cost effectiveness, two B-2 and four crewmen \ncan do the job of 67 aircraft and 132 crewmen, and we can no longer \nrely on the B-52 for our future bomber needs.\n  I am pleased that Congress has had the wisdom to continue to support \nthe B-2 bomber program. And I look forward to providing it further \nsupport in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to ask for an additional 2 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes without it \nbeing charged against our time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 2 \nadditional minutes be allowed to the Senator and that it not be charged \nto anybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot about supporting the troops. There \nare those of us who spent hours on this Senate floor trying to get \nresolutions passed to stop the President from sending American troops \ninto Bosnia. We will not give those arguments again. We lost that \nbattle. The President won by a very narrow margin and, although it was \nwithout the full support of Congress, was able to deploy the troops.\n  Now that the troops are there, we are going to support our troops. \nThose of us who argued and argued and attempted to pass a resolution of \ndisapproval to stop the President from sending troops into Bosnia are \nnow saying, now that the troops are there, we have to support our \ntroops. For those Senators who really want to do it, this is the first \nopportunity you have to really support the troops.\n  If we do not pass the bill, then the troops that we have sent over \nthere would not receive the 2.4 percent pay increase, they would not be \nable to have the 5.2 percent increase in housing allowance, and all the \nhuge quality-of-life increases that are in this particular conference \nreport. There is $1 billion more for operation and maintenance so that \nthe troops are better trained. There is new technology that is going to \nallow better equipment to protect their lives while they are over \nthere.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that, if you oppose this bill, if you vote \nagainst this bill, it is a vote against our troops that are currently \non the ground in Bosnia. If the President vetoes this, the President \nwill have sent our troops into Bosnia and will have then turned around \nand said we are not going to send you the benefits, the technological \nadvantages, and the equipment necessary to survive over there, or in \nany other conflict in the future.\n  I would like to make a brief comment about the defense authorization \nconference action concerning the B-2 bomber program. I am a proponent \nof the B-2. I believe its capabilities represent a true revolution in \nmilitary affairs that the DOD is only on the verge of fully integrating \ninto defense planning. I believe long-range quick strike aircraft are \nan essential element of the U.S. Air Force and the B-2 is the only tool \nwe have to ensure this capability. A force of more than 20 B-2's will \nbe required to achieve this situation. The defense authorization \nconference provides the funds to continue this necessary B-2 \nproduction.\n  The conference report language, however, states that the Senate \nconferees believe that the new funds provided may only be spent on \nitems related to the first 20 B-2 aircraft. I was a Senate conferee and \nI want to go on record that I do not believe this, I did not agree to \nthis language, and I expect these funds to be used for long-lead items \nto continue the B-2 production. I know other conferees share this view.\n  This is a vote to support our troops who are already in Bosnia.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nOklahoma for his excellent remarks. He does a fine job as a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, and we are very pleased to work with him.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe that the UC allocates 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, regrettably I will vote against the defense \nauthorization bill. As I said yesterday, I regret being in this \nposition for many reasons, but particularly because of the strong \neffort that Senator Thurmond has made to get a bill passed this year. I \nwish that I could be able to vote for this bill for that reason alone. \nBut there are just too many reasons that I am unable to vote for this \nbill.\n  First, two brief points on some of the issues in the bill which \ntrouble me. There have been comments that this bill needs to be passed \nin order to provide for pay and allowances for our service personnel. \nIn light of the fact that the President has said he is going to veto \nthis bill--and we know he is going to veto this bill because that has \nbeen made public--we should now be making preparations to attach those \nmust-pass provisions to the next legislative train, which may be, \nindeed, the continuing resolution.\n  That way we can provide the pay raise, cost of living allowance and \nthe housing allowance that would otherwise not be available. As the \nWhite House statement of policy concludes, the President calls upon the \nCongress ``to provide for pay raises and cost of living adjustments for \nmilitary personnel prior to the departure for the Christmas recess.''\n  So the statement of administration policy makes it very clear the \nPresident is going to veto this bill, but the President is asking us, \nand I think those of us who are voting against this bill concur, to \nprovide for pay raises and cost of living adjustments for military \npersonnel prior to departure for the Christmas recess. We do not have \nto vote for this bill, which has so many flaws, in order to provide for \nthose cost of living allowances and pay raises for our military \npersonnel. I believe it would be wrong to approve this bill for many \nreasons which I went into yesterday, which Senator Nunn and others have \ngone into, but I think it also would be irresponsible for us to not \npass the needed pay raise and cost of living adjustments, and we can do \nboth. We can both reject this bill, which we should, and provide for \nthe cost of living allowance which our military personnel, both those \nin Bosnia and here at home, so rightly deserve.\n  Mr. President, the bill has many flaws and many of those were \noutlined yesterday. One of the biggest problems with this bill is that \nit puts us on a collision course with a treaty which we have lived \nunder, which we negotiated, which we ratified with the then Soviet \nUnion, which Russia as the successor to the Soviet Union has adhered \nto. And if we undermine that ABM Treaty, as the language in this \nconference report does, we will be undermining a treaty which has not \nonly provided stability in a very dangerous world of nuclear weapons, \nbut we will be undermining a treaty which has allowed the Soviet Union \nand now Russia to agree to dismantle thousands of nuclear weapons which \notherwise would directly or could directly threaten us.\n  Now, Russian parliamentarians have told us this. They have told us \nthis directly: the START II treaty is in jeopardy of failing \nratification. It is difficult enough in the Russian Duma, but that if \nwe adopt language which says it is our policy to deploy a system which \nviolates the ABM Treaty, it is not going to be possible for the Duma to \nratify the START II treaty which provides for reductions in nuclear \nweapons because those reductions were based on the assumption that the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is going to be in effect. It is the \nabsence of nationwide defenses which has allowed Russia to negotiate \nthe reduction of offensive weapons. And they not only will not ratify \nSTART II, if they are threatened with a defensive system in violation \nof the ABM Treaty, they have also indicated that they would view this \nas such a major change of circumstance that they are no longer going to \ncomply \n\n[[Page S18885]]\nwith START I because of change of circumstances that our breach, or our \nintention to breach the ABM Treaty would reflect.\n  That is why General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, has stated so clearly to us from his military security \nperspective: do not adopt a policy which says that we are going to \nviolate a treaty which then in turn is going to cause the Russians to \nrefuse to ratify another treaty, called START II, which will reduce the \nnumber of offensive nuclear weapons that could threaten the United \nStates.\n  Is there a conflict? I cannot think of any clearer conflict that \nexists between the ABM Treaty, which says you cannot deploy a \nnationwide ABM system, and the language in this conference report, \nwhich says it is the policy of the United States to deploy a national \nmissile defense system. The ABM Treaty says you cannot deploy it on a \nnationwide basis; the conference report says it is our policy to deploy \nit--not only that but to deploy it by the year 2003.\n  Now, that is a direct conflict in language. We avoided that conflict \nin the Senate bill. There was a bipartisan group of four who were \nselected by the majority leader and by the Democratic leader, and four \nof us spent day after day after day working out a bipartisan approach \nto this language, and we did work out that approach. The language which \nwas worked over very carefully said that--and this is now the Senate \nbill--we are committed not to deploy the system but to develop such a \nsystem, leaving the deployment decision open for a later date. Now, \nthat is a very critical difference, and I think all of us know it. Do \nwe want to commit ourselves right now to deploy a system which violates \na treaty, the treaty which has allowed Russia to agree to another \ntreaty, START II, which is reducing by 4,000 the number of nuclear \nweapons in the Russian inventory? I do not think we want to do it. Far \nmore important, our military has urged us not to adopt language which \ndirectly conflicts with the ABM Treaty.\n  May we want to change the ABM Treaty through negotiations? Yes. Might \nwe want to deploy a system after it is developed? Yes; if it is cost \neffective and operationally effective, if the threat is real. But do we \nnow want to unilaterally declare it is the policy of the United States \nto deploy this system when it runs head on against the prohibition on \nsuch deployment in the ABM Treaty? Do we want to do so when General \nShalikashvili is telling us something we ought to heed, which is that \nit would be foolish to trash the treaty unilaterally and thus to \nundermine the basis which has allowed the Russians to agree in START II \nto reduce 4,000 nuclear weapons in their inventory--weapons which can \nthreaten this country so directly?\n  Now, the statement of administration policy on this says that if this \nbill were presented to the President in its current form, this \nconference report, the President would veto the bill. And the language \nrelative to this point is in the third paragraph on page 1 which says \nthat:\n\n       The bill would require deployment by 2003 of a costly \n     missile defense system to defend the U.S. from a long-range \n     missile threat which the Intelligence Community does not \n     believe will ever materialize in the coming decade. By \n     forcing an unwarranted and unnecessary National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) deployment decision now, the bill would \n     needlessly incur tens of billions of dollars in missile \n     defense costs and force the Department of Defense prematurely \n     to lock into a specific technological option. In addition, by \n     directing that the NMD be ``operationally effective'' in \n     defending all 50 states (including Alaska and Hawaii), the \n     bill would likely require a multiple-site National Missile \n     Defense architecture that cannot be accommodated within the \n     terms of the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting U.S. \n     policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty, the bill \n     puts at risk continued Russian implementation of the START I \n     Treaty and Russian ratification of START II.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that since I \nunderstand Senator Kennedy is not going to be utilizing his 5 minutes, \n2 minutes of his 5 minutes be allocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. To conclude, Mr. President, the statement from the \nadministration:\n\n       By setting U.S. policy on a collision course with the ABM \n     Treaty, the bill puts at risk continued Russian \n     implementation of the START I Treaty and Russian ratification \n     of START II, two treaties which together will reduce the \n     number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by two-\n     thirds from cold war levels, thus significantly lowering the \n     threat to U.S. national security.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of \nadministration policy, stating that the President will veto this \nconference report and the reasons why be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Office of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC., December 15, 1995\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the \n     concerned agencies.)\n       H.R. 1530--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1996 Conference Report, Senators Thurmond (R) SC and \n     Nunn (D) GA.\n       If the Conference Report on H.R. 1530 were presented to the \n     President in its current form, the President would veto the \n     bill.\n       The Conference Report on H.R. 1530, filed on December 15, \n     1995, would restrict the Administration's ability to carry \n     out our national security objectives and implement key \n     Administration programs. Certain provisions also raise \n     serious constitutional issues by restricting the President's \n     powers as Commander-in-Chief and foreign policy powers.\n       The bill would require deployment by 2003 of a costly \n     missile defense system to defend the U.S. from a long-range \n     missile threat which the Intelligence Community does not \n     believe will ever materialize in the coming decade. By \n     forcing an unwarranted and unnecessary National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) deployment decision now, the bill would \n     needlessly incur tens of billions of dollars in missile \n     defense costs and force the Department of Defense (DOD) \n     prematurely to lock into a specific technological option. In \n     addition, by directing that the NMD be ``operationally \n     effective'' in defending all 50 states (including Hawaii and \n     Alaska), the bill would likely require a multiple-site NMD \n     architecture that cannot be accommodated within the terms of \n     the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting U.S. policy on a \n     collision course with the ABM Treaty, the bill puts at risk \n     continued Russian implementation of the START I Treaty and \n     Russian ratification of START II, two treaties which together \n     will reduce the number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear \n     warheads by two-thirds from Cold War levels, significantly \n     lowering the threat to U.S. national security.\n       The bill also imposes restrictions on the President's \n     ability to conduct contingency operations that are essential \n     to the national interest. The restrictions on funding to \n     commence a contingency operation and the requirement to \n     submit a supplemental request within a certain time period to \n     continue an operation are unwarranted restrictions on the \n     authority of the President. Moreover, by requiring a \n     Presidential certification to assign U.S. Armed Forces under \n     United Nations (UN) operational of tactical control, the bill \n     infringes on the President's constitutional authority.\n       In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about \n     the following: onerous certification requirements for the use \n     of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds, as well as \n     subcaps on specified activities and elimination of funding \n     for the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrictions on the \n     Technology Reinvestment Program, restrictions on retirement \n     of U.S. strategic delivery systems; restrictions on DOD's \n     ability to execute disaster relief, demining, and military-\n     to-military contact programs; directed procurement of \n     specific ships at specific shipyards, without a valid \n     industrial base rationale; provisions requiring the discharge \n     of military personnel who are HIV-positive; restrictions on \n     the ability of the Secretary of Defense to manage DOD \n     effectively, including the abolition of the Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity \n     Conflict and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation; \n     and finally the Administration continues to object to the \n     restrictions on the ability of female service members or \n     dependents from obtaining privately funded abortions in U.S. \n     military hospitals abroad.\n       While the bill is unacceptable to the Administration, there \n     are elements of the authorization bill which are beneficial \n     to the Department, including important changes in acquisition \n     law, new authorities to improve military housing, and \n     essential pay raises for military personnel. The \n     Administration calls on the Congress to correct the \n     unacceptable flaws in H.R. 1530 so that these beneficial \n     provisions may be enacted. The President especially calls on \n     the Congress to provide for pay raises and cost of living \n     adjustments for military personnel prior to departure for the \n     Christmas recess.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is a finding concerning the ballistic \nmissile threat to the United States, which is cited in the bill as \njustification for deploying an NMD system, and doing so quickly. \nSection 232, paragraph (3) of the Senate-passed bill is the following \nfinding:\n\n       The intelligence community of the United States has \n     estimated that (A) the missile \n\n[[Page S18886]]\n     proliferation trend is toward longer range and more sophisticated \n     missiles, (B) North Korea may deploy an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within \n     five years, and (C) although a new indigenously developed \n     ballistic missile threat to the United States is not forecast \n     within the next 10 years there is a danger that determined \n     countries will acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \n     the near future and with little warning by means other than \n     indigenous development.\n\n  Mr. President, this statement of threat sounded too dire to me and to \nSenator Bumpers, so we wrote to the Director of Central Intelligence to \nask whether it was an accurate statement of the intelligence \ncommunity's assessment. It is not.\n  The CIA response to our letter said that ``the bill language \noverstates what we currently believe to be the future threat.'' Here is \nwhat the intelligence community believes, which is rather different \nfrom the bill language I just read:\n\n       Several countries are seeking longer range missiles to meet \n     regional security goals; however, most of these missiles \n     cannot reach as far as 1,000 kilometers. A North Korean \n     missile potentially capable of reaching portions of Alaska--\n     but not beyond--may be in development, but the likelihood of \n     it being operational within 5 years is very low.\n       The Intelligence Community believes it extremely unlikely \n     any nation with ICBM's will be willing to sell them, and we \n     are confident that our warning capability is sufficient to \n     provide notice many years in advance of indigenous \n     development.\n\n  I bring this to the Senate's attention because it is clear evidence \nthat the rationale given for moving ahead so rapidly with a deployment \nof a national missile defense system, what we used to call ABM, is \nsignificantly overstated. There is no imminent threat from ballistic \nmissiles to the United States, and there isn't likely to be one anytime \nsoon. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letters to and \nfrom the CIA be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the U.S. currently has a policy of \ndeveloping ballistic missile technologies to find which ones are most \nlikely to work, and to have a capability to deploy a national missile \ndefense system within about 4 years if necessary--well within the \nwindow of warning that the intelligence community estimates it will \nhave for indigenous development of missiles that could threaten the \nUnited States. That is a rational, reasonable and prudent policy, and \nthere is no need to replace it with a policy that would likely increase \nthe threat to our Nation by committing up to breach the ABM Treaty and \npushing the Russians to abandon START II, and possibly even cease \nimplementing the START I reductions which are well ahead of schedule.\n  Mr. President, I think our colleagues should be aware that the \nactions the Senate has already taken in considering proposals to \nabandon the ABM Treaty have already taken a toll on Russian confidence \nin our commitment to abide by our treaty obligations, as was clearly \nexplained in an article in yesterday's Washington Post, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the article by Rodney Jones and Yuri Nazarkin be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Even though we have not decided to commit to deploy a \ntreaty-busting ABM system, some Russian policy makers and \nparliamentarians have already concluded that we don't care much for the \nABM Treaty, and that we wish to free ourselves of its constraints. This \nis putting in doubt the Russian ratification of the START II Treaty.\n  It is important that we help make clear that the Senate, which gave \nits advice and consent to the ABM Treaty, and which has a unique \nconstitutional responsibility to consider treaties for ratification, is \nfirmly committed to the proposition that the United States will meet \nits obligations under the ABM Treaty and all treaties into which we \nsolemnly enter. Let us leave no doubt that we understand our security \nis intertwined with Russia's security. We cannot simply act \nunilaterally and expect to be more secure.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this Conference Report \nbecause of its missile defense provisions, if for no other reason. But \nthere are many other reasons, and I know my colleagues will discuss \nsome of them in detail. I might mention a few briefly now.\n\n\n                      Civil-Military and STARBASE\n\n  Mr. President, This conference report effectively would terminate the \nPentagon's civil-military cooperation programs, including the drug \ndemand reduction programs. These were deemed to be non-defense defense \nspending. While I acknowledge the need to carefully examine the defense \nbudget for unneeded spending, I question the conclusion that these \nprograms are not supportable. There are clearly many truly egregious \nexamples of spending in the conference report, but some of these civil-\nmilitary programs are a defense and national security bargain.\n  One program I know well is the Starbase program, a National Guard \nyouth program that targets at risk youth and provides them with a very \ncost-effective program in math, science and technology and teaches them \ndrug demand reduction, all with hands on activities on Guard bases. The \nconference report seeks to terminate this program after 18 months.\n  Considering the high priority placed on recruiting, and considering \nthat the military spends over $650 million each year on drug \ninterdiction and counter-drug missions, one would think the Starbase \nprogram would be a winner at just $5 million per year. If an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure, we seem more than happy to pay for \nmore than half a billion dollars of cure, while cutting off the \nprevention: drug demand reduction. I would also point out that the \nconference rejected a Senate-passed amendment by Senator Nunn to extend \na pilot program on drug demand reduction. This is totally inconsistent \nwith the emphasis and resources devoted to drug interdiction and \ncounter-drug activities of the Department, which the conference \nsupported.\n  Besides providing a pool of potential recruits who have the requisite \nmath and science skills, plus strong admiration for the military \nbecause of Starbase, the program is a great recruiting tool. The head \nof National Guard recruiting in Kansas, who was chosen as the top \nrecruiter of the year, says that Starbase is his best recruiting tool \nbecause the community learns good things about the Guard Bureau through \nit. He told my office that he would gladly use his recruiting budget to \npay for the Starbase program if he could, because it's such an \neffective tool.\n\n\n                           Ongoing Operations\n\n  This conference report does not fully authorize funds for continuing \noperations involving U.S. forces around the world, and it places \nonerous restrictions on funding future operations. Defense Secretary \nPerry told the committee in June that ``funding these ongoing \noperations is a high priority'' and he stressed ``the importance of \navoiding any negative effect on readiness of U.S. forces'' by putting \nfunds in this budget. The gap in this bill threatens the very readiness \nand training accounts that members of the Armed Services Committee have \nraised alarms about, because that is where funds will have to be \nborrowed to pay these costs we know we are incurring.\n  Those who protested the most about shortfalls in readiness and \ntraining are now, by failing to fund ongoing operations in this bill, \ninsuring that the Pentagon will have to cannibalize those readiness and \ntraining activities to pay for missions that U.S. combat forces are \nactually performing.\n\n\n                            Abortion and HIV\n\n  This conference report also contains two provisions affecting \nmilitary personnel which I oppose. The Senate Armed Services Committee \nexplicitly rejected a provision that would have prohibited women in the \nmilitary stationed overseas from obtaining abortions in military \nhospitals, even with their own money. This conference report would \nestablish such a restriction, which is contrary to the situation faced \nby servicewomen stationed stateside, not to mention the right of women \noutside the military to pay for abortions.\n  And the Senate bill contained no provision regarding service \npersonnel who test positive for the HIV virus, but this conference \nreport would require those individuals to be separated from the \n\n[[Page S18887]]\nservice. That provision could actually hinder efforts to protect \nservice personnel from HIV by creating an incentive for secrecy, and it \npresumes that those who test positive could not serve effectively and \nsafely in some capacity within the armed forces.\n\n\n                     Operational Test & Evaluation\n\n  The conference report also makes a very unwise change in the DOD's \nOffice of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation [OT] at the \nPentagon, which would render this important office useless or eliminate \nit altogether. We created the office of OT 12 years ago in a \nbipartisan effort. It has saved lives, saved the taxpayers billions of \ndollars and prevented our soldiers from receiving poor or unsafe \nequipment. The Senate did not vote to undermine this crucial office, \nand the conferees should have rejected the House's proposal. Instead, \nthe House prevailed and we will no longer have independent operational \ntests and evaluations of our critical combat equipment.\n  Mr. President, section 903(g) of the bill would repeal section 139 of \ntitle 10--the provision that establishes an independent Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation [OT] in the Department of Defense. \nThis repeal would not only undermine the confidence of taxpayers that \nthey will get their money's worth for the billions of dollars that they \nspend on defense procurement, but could also place in question the \nsafety of our troops in the field.\n  The Director of OT is the DOD official who is responsible for \nensuring that our servicemen personnel receive weapons that are tested \nin an independent manner and in an operationally realistic environment. \nWithout strong and effective operational testing, we cannot be sure \nthat the weapons our soldiers take into the field will be ready for \ncombat, and without independent oversight we cannot be sure that we \nwill have strong and effective operational testing.\n  This is precisely why we established the independent Director of OT \nposition 12 years ago. Because the Director is required ``to safeguard \nthe integrity of operational testing and evaluation,'' the conference \nreport on the FY 1984 DOD bill explained:\n\n       The conferees also intend the Director to be independent of \n     other Department of Defense officials below the Secretary of \n     Defense. The Director should not be circumscribed in any way \n     by other officials in carrying out his duties.\n\n  Above all, the independent Director of OT position was established \nto remove operational testing and evaluation from the influence of the \nDOD officials who are responsible for the acquisition of weapons \nsystems. These DOD acquisition officials have already given a green \nlight to a weapons purchase long before it reaches the operational test \nand evaluation stage and have too strong a stake in continuing the \nprocurement, to serve as independent evaluators.\n  Over the last decade, the actions of the independent Director of OT \nhave caused the cancellation of some weapons programs and significant \nmodifications to others, often over the objections of the military \nservices. The result has been the purchase of weapons systems that have \nbeen safer and more reliable than ever before. Indeed, after the \nPersian Gulf war, Secretary Cheney credited the independent operational \ntesting of the Bradley fighting vehicle with ``sav[ing] more lives'' in \nthat war than perhaps any other single initiative.\n  For these reasons, Secretary Perry has called the independent \nDirector of OT ``the conscience of the acquisition process'' and \ndeclared his support for a strong and independent OT organization. \nFor this reason, too, the Senate-passed version of this authorization \nbill contained a provision which expressly reaffirmed the importance of \nan independent Director of OT ``to provide an independent validation \nand verification of the suitability and effectiveness of new weapons, \nand to ensure that the United States military departments acquire \nweapons that are proven in an operational environment before they are \nproduced or used in combat.''\n  Yet the conference report would eliminate the independent Director of \nOT, allowing DOD to once again place operational testing in the hands \nof acquisition officials. This change would not eliminate the office or \nreduce its budget requirements--operational testing would still be \nperformed and it would still cost just as much--but it would eliminate \none key independent check that we have to ensure that weapons systems \nperform as they are supposed to.\n  DOD's Deputy Inspector General, Derek Vander Schaaf, has criticized \nthis provision in the strongest possible terms. In a December 14, 1995, \nletter, Mr. Vander Schaaf stated:\n\n       I strongly disagree with the proposal to eliminate the \n     independence of the DOT and replace him with a designated \n     official within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The \n     Office of the Director was created by Congress to provide \n     independent validation and verification on the suitability \n     and effectiveness of new weapon systems and to ensure that \n     the Military Departments acquire weapons that are proven in \n     an operational environment. I am strongly for acquisition \n     reform in the Department of Defense and have offered many \n     suggestions to improve the acquisition process. However, \n     this is not reform but a step backward in the direction of \n     deploying weapons and equipment that are later proven to \n     be ineffective or inefficient to operate and maintain.\n       This proposal eliminates one of the independent checks in \n     our weapon systems acquisition process. An independent \n     Director is the conscience for contractors and project \n     managers and ensures they deliver usable weapon systems to \n     the military members. I have testified in the past against \n     proposals to weaken the authority of the Office of the \n     Director, and steadfastly believe the Director saves the \n     Department funds while ensuring Service members receive \n     operationally effective weapons.\n\n  Mr. President, this provision is misguided, it is shortsighted, it \ncould needlessly endanger our troops in the field, and it does not \ndeserve the support of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. \nVander Schaaf be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n\n\n                           Acquisition Reform\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bill represents a significant \ndeparture from the bipartisan tradition of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and from the way that we have handled DOD Authorization bills \nin the past.\n  There was only one area of which I am aware in which the conferees \nwere permitted to work to a bipartisan consensus in the way we have \ntried to do in the past--and this issue was not even a defense-specific \nissue. The bipartisan, cooperative way in which the conference handled \ngovernment-wide acquisition provisions in the bill stands in stark \ncontrast to the way in which the bulk of the bill was handled, and \nclearly shows the constructive results that can still be achieved when \nwe work together across the aisle.\n  This does not mean that I am completely satisfied with every element \nof these acquisition provisions. It is in the nature of a conference \nagreement--even one that is worked out on a bipartisan basis--that it \nrepresents a compromise, and a true compromise is completely \nsatisfactory to no one.\n  The acquisition provisions that trouble me include the following:\n  Section 4301 establishes a congressional policy against the \nimposition of nonstatutory certification requirements on contractors. \nWhile some certifications may be burdensome and unnecessary, many have \nbeen imposed as a substitute for even more burdensome government audit \nand review requirements. If we now drop the certification requirements \nas well, we may in some cases be left with no means at all for \nenforcing important Federal policies.\n  Section 4303 would give the Department of Defense broad authority to \nwaive statutory recoupment requirements in foreign military sales, \nsubject to the approval of legislation offsetting the costs of the \nwaiver. I am concerned that this provision amounts to a giveaway to \ninternational arms merchants, which cannot be paid for without making \nsubstantial cuts elsewhere in an already extraordinarily tight budget.\n  Section 4205 would make the cost accounting standards inapplicable to \nall contracts for the purchase of commercial items--even contracts in \nwhich cost reimbursement or progress payment provisions make clear \naccounting for contractor costs a vital priority. I am concerned that \nthis provision could lead to a dangerous erosion in the accountability \nof contractors for costs incurred on cost-type contracts.\n  Section 822 would establish a pilot program to test the use of \ncommercial \n\n[[Page S18888]]\npractices including the waiver of procurement laws for particular \ncontractor facilities to be designated by the Department of Defense--\nsubject to the approval of Congress. I have been told that candidates \nfor inclusion in this program could include facilities in which \nmilitary aircraft are built. I know of no military aircraft that \nqualify as commercial items under the law as we have written it, or \nunder any plausible definition of the term, and I continue to believe \nthat tough quality, audit and oversight provisions are needed to \nprotect the taxpayers' interest in the production of military-unique \nitems.\n\n  Despite these concerns, I believe that, on balance, we got the best \nagreement that was possible in a conference which the Senate and the \nHouse entered with diametrically opposing positions. I am particularly \npleased that on the acquisition reform provisions of the bill, unlikely \nmany other issues, the Senate was able to retain a constructive, \nbipartisan working relationship between members and staff of the Armed \nServices Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Small \nBusiness Committee.\n  That constructive, bipartisan cooperation, which led to the enactment \nof the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act in the last Congress, has \nyielded substantial dividends in this bill as well. For example:\n  Division E of the bill contains the Cohen-Levin Information \nTechnology Management Reform Act, which would substantially streamline \nthe management and procurement of computer and communications systems \nby the Federal Government. These provisions would eliminate the process \nof delegations of procurement authority by the General Services \nAdministration and consolidate bid protests in a single administrative \nforum, eliminating unneeded paperwork from our information technology \npurchasing systems.\n  Section 5401 of the bill contains my proposal to reduce paperwork in \nthe acquisition of off-the-shelf products by providing Government-wide, \non-line computer access to GSA's multiple award schedules. The \nimplementation of these provisions should bring effective competition \nto the multiple award schedules and make it possible to reduce or even \neliminate the need for lengthy negotiations and burdensome paperwork \nrequirements placed on vendors to ensure fair pricing.\n  Section 4304 of the bill would clarify and substantially streamline \nthe procurement ethics laws. While I would have preferred a broader \nrevolving door provision than the conferees ultimately agreed to, I \nhave been working for years to simplify these overly complex, \ninconsistent, and overlapping statutes. I believe that this change is \nlong overdue.\n  Finally, I would like to respond to the concerns that have been \nraised about the competition provisions in the bill. As one of the \nSenate authors, with Senator Cohen, of the Competition in Contracting \nAct, I am a strong believer in the importance of full and open \ncompetition. I was as astonished as were many others to see some of the \nproposals that were made on the House side to undermine this \ncornerstone of the Federal procurement system. I believe that these \nproposals would not only have been unfair to small businesses and other \nvendors, but could have cost the taxpayers billions of dollars in lost \ncompetition for Federal agency contracts.\n  I want to assure my colleagues, however, that this conference \nagreement does not contain any of those changes. We did not and we \nwould not agree to change the standard of full and open competition \nthrough the front door, through the back door, or in any other way. \nThis was a fundamental issue in the conference not only for me, but for \nother Senate conferees as well. Senator Cohen and I have put together a \njoint statement explaining the competition provisions in the bill, \nwhich I believe Senator Cohen will be placing in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I may not be pleased with every aspect of the \nacquisition reform package before us, but I am satisfied that on this \nmatter, at least, we have continued to work on a bipartisan, consensus \nbasis. I wish I could say the same for other provisions in the bill, \nbut I cannot.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, on no set of issues is bipartisan cooperation more \nimportant than in the area of national security. We need not all agree \non every issue, but we must strive to work together in a bipartisan \nspirit. We have a broad spectrum of views on the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees, but we have a long history of working together, \nacross party lines to try to put together the best bill we can. \nRegrettably, the conference this year fell short of that objective both \nin process and in spirit. Too many of these contentious issues were \nleft to only the majority staff of the two committees to hash out, and \nmonths passed without resolution. By that time, the defense, military \nconstruction and energy and water appropriations bills had been passed \nand enacted. I urge the leadership of both the House and Senate \ncommittees to reexamine what transpired and accelerate the learning \nprocess so that next year, and I stand ready to work with them to try \nto restore the tradition of cooperation on the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this conference report, in this regard alone, would \nhave us threaten a very, very significant gain that we have made four \nour security. That gain is the actual reduction of nuclear weapons and \nthe commitment to reduce thousands more nuclear weapons in the Russian \ninventory.\n  We should not do this against the clear advice of our military. And \nthere are many other reasons for rejecting this conference report.\n  Again, I regret that I have reached this conclusion because of my \naffection for Senator Thurmond, but I feel, given the flaws in this \nreport, that we should defeat this report, and I will vote against it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1995.\n     Hon. John Deutch,\n     Director of Central Intelligence,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: When the Senate considers the Conference Report \n     on the FY 1996 Defense Authorization Bill, we will again \n     debate the ballistic missile threat to the United States.\n       Sec. 232 para. (3) of the Senate version of the FY 1996 \n     Defense Authorization Bill states ``The intelligence \n     community of the United States has estimated that (A) the \n     missile proliferation trend is toward longer range and more \n     sophisticated missiles, (B) North Korea may deploy an \n     intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska \n     or beyond within 5 years, and (C) although a new indigenously \n     developed ballistic missile threat to the United States is \n     not forecast within the next 10 years there is a danger that \n     determined countries will acquire intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles in the near future and with little warning by means \n     other than indigenous production.''\n       We would appreciate your unclassified comments on whether \n     the above statement accurately reflects the present position \n     of the intelligence community. We would also appreciate your \n     assessment of the likelihood that countries will acquire \n     ``with little warning'' ICBMs either through indigenous \n     production or by other means.\n       We would also welcome your providing us with any other \n     information that you feel is relevant to this issue.

Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The DCI has asked me to respond on his \n     behalf to your letter of November 1, 1995, asking for the \n     Intelligence Community's comments on the Defense \n     Authorization Bill language that discusses the future \n     ballistic missile threat to the United States. In the past, \n     representatives of the Intelligence Community openly \n     portrayed the future ballistic missile threat to the US as \n     reflected in the statement from Sec 232, para (3) of the \n     Defense Authorization Bill. We wish to point out, however, \n     that the Intelligence Community continuously evaluates this \n     issue and the Bill language overstates what we currently \n     believe to be the future threat.\n       Several countries are seeking longer range missiles to meet \n     regional security goals; however, most of these missiles \n     cannot reach as far as 1,000 kilometers. A North Korean \n     missile potentially capable of reaching portions of Alaska--\n     but not beyond--may be in development, but the likelihood of \n     it being operational within five years is very low.\n       The Intelligence Community believes it extremely unlikely \n     any nation with ICBMs will be willing to sell them, and we \n     are confident that our warning capability is sufficient to \n     provide notice many years in advance of indigenous \n     development. \n     \n[[Page S18889]]\n\n       An original of this letter is also being provided to \n     Senator Dale Bumpers.

We hope this information is \n     useful. Please call if I can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Joanne O. Isham,\n                                Director of Congressional Affairs.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 1995]\n\nOff to a Bad START II--In Both the United States and Russia, Hopes for \n                   the Strategic Arms Pact Are Fading\n\n               (By Rodney W. Jones and Yuri K. Nazarkin)\n\n       After months of delay, the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee moved last week to bring the START II treaty up for \n     a vote on the Senate floor. The pact would reduce U.S. and \n     Russian strategic nuclear weapons to 70 percent of Cold War \n     levels and also eliminate land-based multiple-warhead \n     missiles, the most threatening of Russia's weapons. \n     Unfortunately, while a favorable Senate vote on the treaty is \n     virtually assured, ratification of the pact by Russia has \n     become increasingly uncertain in recent months. As Russians \n     go to the polls today, many will be voting for politicians \n     who question whether START II is still in Russia's best \n     interest.\n       The prime cause of Russian second thoughts, according to \n     parliamentarians and defense experts in Moscow, is the \n     Republican-led effort that began this summer to mandate the \n     deployment of a multi-site strategic anti-ballistic missile, \n     or ABM, system by the year 2003. This system was called for \n     originally in the Senate version of the defense authorization \n     bill and endorsed last week by a House-Senate conference \n     committee. Yet it will violate the 1972 ABM Treaty, which for \n     more than two decades has helped curtail a costly buildup of \n     defensive nuclear weapons and countervailing offensive \n     weapons.\n       It first became clear that START II was in serious trouble \n     last month when parliamentary leaders in Moscow who had \n     supported START II hearings in July concluded that a \n     ratification vote in the waning months of 1995 would fail. To \n     avoid a foreign policy crisis over a negative vote, they \n     postponed further action on the treaty.\n       Regrettably, the prospect for unconditional Russian \n     ratification of START II next year is no more promising. \n     Following today's election, the State Duma, Russia's lower \n     house of parliament, is expected to be even more critical of \n     START II and of the United States than its predecessor. \n     Russian political parties and factions opposed to the treaty \n     will probably gain seats at the expense of the reformist and \n     democratic parties that generally support it. President Boris \n     Yeltsin's poor health and the growth of assertive nationalism \n     in Russia further clouds START II's chances.\n       Even the Russian military leadership, which had steadfastly \n     supported START II, shows signs of cooling toward the treaty \n     in the wake of U.S. congressional action threatening the ABM \n     Treaty. The Russian military fears the United States' real \n     intent is to gain strategic superiority over Russia. The \n     Russian military dismisses as preposterous U.S. assertions \n     that the legislation is aimed at protecting American soil \n     from the threat of a handful of long-range missiles from \n     North Korea and other small countries. In effect, Russian \n     military leaders argue, the United States would be deploying \n     new defensive missiles just as Russia was completing the \n     reduction of its offensive missiles under START II's \n     requirements. Russia would be more vulnerable and the United \n     States less so.\n       Ivan Rybkin, the Duma speaker, expressed the growing \n     disenchantment with START II in the newspaper Nezavissimaya \n     Gazeta on Nov. 5: ``We cannot be bothered any longer, given \n     this situation that propels plans for NATO enlargement and \n     reveals our U.S. congressional colleagues' intentions to \n     begin a process that threatens the ABM Treaty--the \n     cornerstone of the existing arms control regime.''\n       Russian misgivings about START II haven't come overnight. \n     Initially Yeltsin and the Russian military leadership firmly \n     believed that START II was in Russia's interest. They \n     recognized benefits for Russia--the fact that START II's deep \n     reductions would enhance stability, reduce future defense \n     costs, ensure formal strategic parity with the United States \n     and contribute to long-term cooperation between the two \n     powers. The Clinton administration also worked to alleviate \n     Russian uneasiness over U.S. national missile defense \n     activities. But the ABM developments of late have changed \n     Russian feelings toward START II.\n       If Clinton vetoes the defense authorization bill as he has \n     promised, a direct conflict over the ABM Treaty will be \n     avoided. Congressional direction of the U.S. military might \n     then be provided exclusively in the defense appropriations \n     bill. That legislation, which the president approved earlier \n     this month, says nothing about deploying an ABM system.\n       This silence, however, is unlikely to assuage Russian \n     concerns, since Russia must worry that the ABM issue will \n     return in the next congressional session. Moreover, the \n     appropriations bill mandates completion of the Navy's ``Upper \n     Tier'' system, a defense initiative to produce shorter-range \n     missiles that Russia also finds objectionable because of its \n     potential for use against long-range weapons.\n       Russian arms control experts are also troubled by the \n     thinking of some U.S. lawmakers who believe that the ABM \n     Treaty is an obsolete Cold War measure. The Russians point \n     out that if the ABM Treaty is to be revised in light of the \n     post-Cold War situation, they see it as equally reasonable to \n     amend and adapt the START treaties. After all, they argue, \n     the cumbersome and intrusive START verification provisions \n     were elaborated in a climate of mutual suspicion and mistrust \n     and were based on worst-case scenarios about the other side's \n     intentions.\n       These Russian critics suggest that Moscow's obligations \n     under START II are largely irrelevant to current realities. \n     The Russians are required by the treaty to alter the \n     structure of their strategic triad by 2003. This will entail \n     sizable expenditures both to eliminate all multiple-warhead \n     land-based ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) and to \n     replace them with single warhead missiles. Given the current \n     U.S.-Russian partnership, Russian START II critics argue, \n     such measures are not essential to the strategic security of \n     both nations and should be open to revision.\n       The Russians are completely uninterested in negotiating \n     amendments to fundamental provisions of the ABM Treaty. This \n     apparently was well understood by those pushing the \n     antiballistic missile initiative in Congress, for they also \n     included the possible alternative of U.S. withdrawal from the \n     ABM Treaty. Russia might consider changes to the ABM Treaty--\n     but only along with parallel changes in START II.\n       Would this be acceptable to U.S. officials, legislators and \n     1996 Republican presidential candidates? Renegotiating \n     current nuclear treaties with the purpose of adapting them to \n     new realities--as instruments for regulating the nuclear \n     forces of both nations--would mean embarking on a long and \n     formidable process.\n       If the United States is not prepared to enter such a \n     process, yet withdraws from the ABM Treaty or takes steps in \n     that direction it would mean the end of START II--the end of \n     real, dramatic reductions in the numbers of the world's most \n     destructive weapons.\n       Is it still possible to resuscitate START II in Russia? \n     Right now, it seems unlikely. If Clinton vetoes the defense \n     authorization, with its ABM mandate, the prospects for saving \n     START II would improve, but only slightly.\n       Russian opponents of START II may now insist on delaying \n     Russian ratification until the results of the 1996 U.S. \n     presidential (and congressional) elections can be evaluated. \n     Repairing the growing damage to U.S.-Russian relations and \n     U.S. interests in nuclear threat reduction will become \n     steadily more difficult unless Congress revives the tradition \n     of bipartisan statesmanship on nuclear weapons issues that \n     has prevailed since the end of the Cold War.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, December 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This is in response to a request from \n     your staff concerning the position of the Office of the \n     Inspector General on Section 901(j), ``Conforming Amendments \n     Relating to Operational Test and Evaluation Authority,'' of \n     H.R. 1530. This section substantially diminishes the \n     independence, authority and responsibilities of the Director \n     of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT) and may lead to \n     the eventual elimination of the office and its functions. \n     This action is being taken ``under the cover'' of eliminating \n     from statute all of the Assistant Secretaries of Defense. \n     However, in the case of the DOT, the impact is \n     significantly different. For example, the importance and \n     input that the office can have in ensuring that weapons are \n     suitably for operational deployment is effectively restricted \n     by deleting the annual reports to Congress summarizing \n     operational test and evaluation activities and deleting the \n     duties of the office contained in Section 139 of title 10.\n       I strongly disagree with the proposal to eliminate the \n     independence of the DOT and replace him with a designated \n     official within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The \n     Office of the Director was created by Congress to provide \n     independent validation and verification on the suitability \n     and effectiveness of new weapon systems and to ensure that \n     the Military Departments acquire weapons that are proven in \n     an operational environment. I am strongly for acquisition \n     reform in the Department of Defense and have offered many \n     suggestions to improve the acquisition process. However, this \n     is not reform but a step backward in the direction of \n     deploying weapons and equipment that are later proven to be \n     ineffective or inefficient to operate and maintain.\n       This proposal eliminates one of the independent checks in \n     our weapon systems acquisition process. An independent \n     Director is the conscience for contractors and project \n     managers and ensures they deliver usable weapon systems to \n     the military members. I have testified in the past against \n     proposals to weaken the authority of the Office of the \n     Director, and steadfastly believe the Director saves the \n     Department funds while ensuring service members receive \n     operationally effective weapons. \n     \n[[Page S18890]]\n\n       If we may be of further assistance, please contact me or \n     Mr. John R. Crane, Office of Congressional Liaison, at (703) \n     604-8324.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Derek J. Vander Schaaf,\n                                         Deputy Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to correct several incorrect \nstatements that have been made over the last several days regarding the \nballistic missile defense provisions in this conference report. It has \nbeen asserted that this conference report requires the United States to \ndeploy a multiple-site national missile defense system and even a \nspace-based system. Both of these assertions are flat wrong.\n  The conference report does require the Secretary of Defense to deploy \na ground-based national missile defense system by the end of 2003. But \nnothing in the conference report requires the system to include \nmultiple sites. I continue to believe that the United States should \nultimately deploy a multiple-site system, but nothing in this \nconference report requires such a system. Nor does the conference \nreport advocate, let alone require, a violation of the ABM Treaty. The \nlanguage in the conference report urges the President to undertake \nnegotiations with Russia to amend the ABM Treaty to allow for \ndeployment of a multiple-site national missile defense system. This and \nother provisions in this conference report envision a cooperative \nprocess, not unilateral abrogation.\n  It has been asserted that there is no way to defend the territory of \nthe United States from a single site, and therefore this conference \nreport indirectly requires a multiple-site system. While I believe that \na multiple-site system should be our goal, I must point out that the \nArmy has concluded that it can defend all 50 States, including Alaska \nand Hawaii, from a single, ABM, Treaty-compliant, site. I would also \npoint out that the Army's report on this subject was prepared at the \nrequest of the ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee. \nI ask unanimous consent that the Army report, entitled ``Evolutionary \nApproach to National Missile Defense,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Evolutionary Approach to National Missile Defense [NMD]\n\n       1. The Army's Program Executive Office for Missile Defense \n     (PEO-MD) has made a proposal that would take advantage of the \n     significant investment that BMDO has made in ground-based \n     missile defense technology. Planning includes an evolutionary \n     deployment for defense against long range ballistic missiles, \n     initially focusing on unsophisticated intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The approach is to provide a cost \n     and operationally effective single-site system as the first \n     step in system deployment. This initial system will provide \n     defense of all 50 states against an unsophisticated ICBM \n     attack.\n       2. The Army PEO's NMD approach is to take advantage of the \n     infrastructure at Grand Forks, North Dakota and deploy an \n     initial NMD system and then grow this system in response to \n     changes in the quantity and quality of the threat and in \n     accordance with the modifications negotiated in the treaty \n     over time. The initial capability can be expanded by adding \n     additional interceptors and by adding more sites. Space-based \n     sensors (Space and Missile Tracking System (SMTS)) could be \n     added to provide increased battle space and dual \n     phenomenology tracking and discrimination to enhance defense \n     effectiveness against more advanced threats.\n       3. The Army PEO has shown that the initial NMD system can \n     provide effective defense of the 48 continental United States \n     against limited threats (a few RVs with simple penetration \n     aids and/or jammers). Analysis indicates that, with certain \n     enhancements, the initial system can also provide an \n     effective defense for all states. These enhancements include \n     the following:\n       a. Improved quality of Early Warning Radar (EWR) data \n     including additional advanced radars at Shemya (in the \n     Aleutian Islands of Alaska), in Hawaii, and on the east \n     coast.\n       b. Increased interceptor booster velocity.\n       c. Onboard target selection capability of the kill vehicle.\n       4. Each of these improvements is discussed below:\n       a. Improved EWR data is necessary to provide tracking \n     information of sufficient quality for the NMD battle \n     management/command, control, and communications (BM/C3) \n     system functions. The concept of using EWR data is not \n     different from the CONUS defense concept; however, to extend \n     this capability to Alaska and Hawaii requires upgrades to the \n     EWRs, adding advanced EWRs at Shemya, in Hawaii, and on the \n     east coast. The upgraded EWRs and additional EWRs would \n     provide early acquisition of the ballistic missile threat and \n     allow the interceptors sufficient time to intercept these \n     targets. The advanced EWRs would be based on the technology \n     the Army has developed with BMDO sponsorship.\n       b. Another important change is an increase in the \n     interceptor velocity to reduce the fly-out time and increase \n     coverage. For CONUS defense, a velocity of about 6.5 km/sec \n     is sufficient; however, defending Alaska and Hawaii from a \n     single interceptor site at Grand Forks, North Dakota, \n     requires a velocity greater than 7.2 km/sec. The Army NMD \n     Program Office has identified commercial booster motors that \n     will provide a velocity greater than 8 km/sec and plans to \n     utilize this capability in the ground-based interceptor.\n       c. The third characteristic required is the onboard \n     capability of the kill vehicle to select the lethal object \n     from a cluster of objects. The Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle \n     (EKV) was specifically designed to achieve this capability. \n     This capability allows the system to commit the interceptor \n     against a cluster of objects, designate, and intercept the \n     lethal object in a target complex.\n       5. The Army PEO has proposed an accelerated, evolutionary \n     NMD development program which will meet requirements if \n     funded at the appropriate level. The proposed NMD Program \n     will develop a system for deployment that will provide an \n     effective defense of the entire United States against a \n     limited threat. The proposal begins with an initial \n     deployment of an NMD system of ground-based interceptors \n     (GBI), a ground-based radar (GBR), upgraded and advanced EWRs \n     (U/AEWR), and associated BM/C3. The proposal would initially \n     deploy about 20 Developmental or User Operational Evaluation \n     System (UOES) GBIs, an X-band NMD GBR, and associated BM/C3 \n     in the Grand Forks, North Dakota, vicinity. This system would \n     be supported by existing space-based sensors. A/UEWRs, and \n     upgraded command and control (C2) to support USCINCSPACE in \n     the centralized control of the NMD mission. This initial \n     capability would be fully utilized in the continued \n     evolutionary development of the objective system.\n       6. This proposed system could provide effective protection \n     of the entire United States in the 2000 time frame from a \n     limited ICBM attack of a few RVs for an acquisition cost of \n     about $5B. The initial NMD system could be augmented through \n     negotiations to deploy additional GBIs, additional ground-\n     based sites, a space-based sensor system (SMTS), and/or a \n     space-based weapon system as required and permitted by treaty \n     obligations to address a larger and/or more sophisticated \n     threat.\n       7. In summary, the initial system, using additional EWRs, \n     can provide costs and operationally effective defense of all \n     50 states against ballistic missile threats limited to a few \n     RVs and simple penetration aids. The ground-based radar being \n     developed will provide high quality track and discrimination. \n     On threats that require early commit of the interceptor, the \n     kill vehicle will have the capability to receive in-flight \n     updates including target object map data. The kill vehicle \n     will also have onboard target selection and designation \n     capability. By combining these capabilities and allowing for \n     multiple interceptor shots at each threatening object, a very \n     high probability of kill can be achieved. Additional \n     interceptor sites would provide increased defense robustness \n     as threat quantity and quality increase. Space-based sensors \n     would increase defense confidence against larger and more \n     stressing threats.\n       8. This evolutionary deployment approach is a prudent, \n     affordable, and effective means of providing protection for \n     all 50 states against a limited ballistic missile attack. It \n     must be noted, however, that current budgetary constraints \n     preclude the Army and BMDO from substantially accelerating \n     NMD. This evolutionary program is executable only with strong \n     continued congressional support at the $1B per year level, \n     which must not come at the expense of other critical Army or \n     BMDO programs.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, unfortunately, despite all our efforts \nin conference to resolve concerns related to the ABM Treaty, we \ncontinue to hear the artificial argument that this conference report \nconstitutes an anticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty. Since there is no \nrequirement to deploy a multiple-site national missile defense system \nin this conference report, there can be no anticipatory breach \ncontained in it.\n  But even if there were a multiple-site requirement, this would still \nnot constitute an anticipatory breach. Since there are treaty-compliant \nways to get to a multiple-site system, just having a policy that points \nus in that direction cannot constitute an anticipatory breach. To quote \nthe senior Senator from Alabama, who was a distinguished judge prior to \ncoming to the Senate, ``While there are legal methods to deploy \nmultiple sites within the framework of the ABM Treaty, there can be no \nanticipatory breach.''\n  It has also been argued that this conference report requires a space-\nbased defense. The conference report does call on the Department of \nDefense to preserve the option of deploying a layered defense in the \nfuture. But there is no requirement to deploy any specific \n\n[[Page S18891]]\nspace-based system or to structure an acquisition program that includes \nspace-based weapons. The conference report does increase funding for \nthe space-based laser program. But this increase is merely to keep a \ntechnology program alive. We have asked for a report to illustrate what \na deployment program would look like, but this is hardly a mandate to \ndeploy.\n  We can certainly debate the merits of what this conference report \nrequires. But let's be clear about what it actually contains. If \nSenators want to debate the need for deployment of a national missile \ndefense system by 2003, that is a legitimate debate. But to argue, as \nseveral Senators have, that this conference report requires deployment \nof space-based weapons and mandates a violation of the ABM Treaty is \nsimply an act of disinformation. Senators are entitled to their views, \nbut they owe the American people an honest statement that distinguishes \nbetween fact and fiction.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed on the remaining time of Senator Kennedy, 5 \nminutes from the time allocated to the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, and 2 minutes to correspond to the 2 minutes given to Senator \nInhofe.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, it is an interesting paradox that I have noted since I \nhave been here that the things that are really the most important and \nthe most serious to our Nation and, indeed, to the world are the ones \nthat seem to draw the least attention and are least understood.\n  The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is one of those things. It was \nentered into in 1974 between Brezhnev and President Nixon. The really \nsalient language of that treaty is found in article I. Here it is on \nthis chart. As they say, the mother tongue is English, and this is as \nclear in English as you can get.\n  Article I:\n\n       Each party shall be limited at any one time to a single \n     area out of the two provided in Article III of the treaty for \n     deployment of antiballistic missile systems or their \n     components.\n\n  Single means one. The ABM Treaty limits each party to one strategic \nanti-ballistic missile site. It was ratified in 1976, and it is a \nbinding treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, now \nRussia.\n  There is not any question that this bill intends to proceed with the \ndeployment of a strategic antiballistic missile systems at multiple \nsites. The bill also says that we will decide whether a missile defense \nsystem is tactical or strategic; that is, whether it is designed to \nintercept tactical missiles or strategic missiles. The United States \nwill decide. And if the Russians do not happen to like our decision, \nthat is just tough, and we will abrogate the treaty.\n  How does the bill justify these new policies? Here on this chart is \nwhat the 1995 Ballistic Missile Defense Act says. Here is the threat \nthat is being used by those who want to deploy this National Missile \nDefense System. Here is what the Missile Defense Act says:\n\n       North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic \n     missile capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within 5 years.\n\n  Within 5 years, the bill says.\n  Second:\n\n       Determined countries--\n\n  I do not know what a determined country is. I guess you have \ndetermined countries and undetermined countries.\n\n       Determined countries can acquire intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles in the near future and with little warning by means \n     other than indigenous production.\n\n  Senator Levin and I wondered where this information came from. So we \ntook this language and wrote to John Deutch, the Director of the CIA, \nand said, ``What does the intelligence community have to say about this \nthreat?''\n  Here is what he wrote back to us a little over 2 weeks ago; this is \nwhat the CIA said:\n\n       The bill language overstates what we currently believe to \n     be the future threat.\n\n  The CIA goes on to say:\n\n       A North Korean missile potentially capable of reaching \n     portions of Alaska--but not beyond--may be in development, \n     but the likelihood of it being operational within 5 years is \n     very low.\n\n  Third, the CIA says:\n\n       The intelligence community--\n\n  On whose information we are supposed to be relying around here when \nwe spend money--\n\n       The intelligence community believes it extremely unlikely \n     any nations with ICBM's will be willing to sell them, and we \n     are also confident that our warning capability is sufficient \n     to provide notice many years in advance of indigenous \n     development.\n\n  So what is our response to the intelligence community? It is to spend \n$200 million more for the Navy's upper-tier system and $400 million \nmore for the national missile defense system. So much for the $30 \nbillion or so per year that we spend on intelligence. What is the \nnational missile defense system required to do in this bill? It is \nrequired to cover all 50 States, including Hawaii and Alaska. How will \nit do that? The only way it can be done, by deploying interceptors at \nmultiple sites.\n  What do you do when you deploy multiple sites? You say to Russia, \n``Adios, friend. If you don't like it, we'll pull out of the treaty,'' \nwhich we have a right to do.\n  But the danger of abrogating the ABM Treaty and the Russians and the \nUnited States both having antimissile defense systems, strategic and to \na lesser extent tactical, is the world becomes a much less safe place. \nEveryone knows that, if Russia and China think the United States has an \nABM system that can shoot down their ICBM's, they will begin to deploy \nmore ICBM's to compensate. Instead of arms cuts, we will have a new \narms race.\n  I do not know of a single person in the world, I do not know anybody \nwho really studies this and keeps up with it who thinks what we are \ndoing here is in our best interest. It is not.\n  The bill says that the national missile defense system has to be \ndeployed by the year 2003. That is 8 years from now. We may lock \nourselves into a technology we do not even want.\n  Do you know what the Russians have already said? ``We summarily \nreject this unilateral action you are taking.'' We summarily reject it, \nand if you do it, Russia will have no choice but to stop implementing \nthe nuclear weapons cuts specified in the START Treaty.\n  I do not have much time, so let me go on to a couple of other items.\n  The bill repeals the prohibition on buying more B-2 bombers than the \n20 we have already agreed to procure. We put $493 million in there for \nB-2 procurement. It is not clear whether that $493 million is to \ncorrect some of the flaws in the present B-2 or whether it is to buy \nlong-lead items for more B-2's.\n  If it is the latter, it is terribly misguided. I defy anybody in this \nbody, as I did yesterday, to read the report, read the conference \nreport and tell me how the $493 million is to be spent.\n  Even Senator Nunn, who favors the B-2, says he cannot decipher it.\n  What else is in the bill? Yet a new method of financing arms exports. \nThe United States now has between 50 and 55 percent of all the arms \nexports in the world, and the Defense Department said we are headed for \n60 percent of all the arms exports. In other words, we ship more arms \nin the international arms trafficking business than the rest of the \nworld combined. We have four methods of financing arms right now, and \nthis bill provides yet a fifth. Yes, we are the arms merchants of the \nworld.\n  What else does it do? I can remember back, I guess, in 1983, when \nsome lobbyist downtown did not have anything better to do, so he came \nhere and convinced the U.S. Congress to start bringing old battleships \nout of mothballs. I stood here and wailed like a banshee, saying this \nis an absolute abject, utter mistake. So what did we do? We did not \nbring one out; we brought four out. What did it cost? About $2 billion. \nWhat happened? After we did it, we put them back in mothballs. But some \nNavy contractors got a couple of billion dollars out of it.\n  Now the Defense Department has removed the four battleships from the \nNaval Register. That means the Pentagon has no more use for the ships \nand it can dispose of them. So what does the bill do? It orders the \nNavy to return at least two of the battleships to \n\n[[Page S18892]]\nNaval Register so they can be returned to duty someday. That does not \ncost anything, Mr. President. I am happy to report that is one thing in \nthe bill that does not cost a thin dime--that is, to put two \nbattleships back on the Naval Register. I only hope and pray that at \nsome point we do not decide to start bringing those suckers out again. \nBecause that will cost a small fortune.\n  I remember the first one they brought out--I think it was the Iowa or \nthe Missouri--I forget which--and it started firing those big 16-inch \nguns and found out that it totally threw all the new electronics on the \nship off, and they had to go back through all the electronics and \nencompass them in rubber so the guns did not throw everything off. God \nforbid that those old battleships are ever put into service again. The \ngood news is that the Appropriations Committee has already prohibited \nthe Navy from spending any money for bringing out battleships. So while \nthis bill would like to bring the battleships out again, there is no \nmoney appropriated for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask that the time for the quorum call \nnot be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time do I have at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I ask to be notified if I exceed 10 minutes.\n  This morning during remarks on problems that I see in the conference \nreport, I noted that I would have a separate statement addressing the \nmissile defense provisions in the conference report.\n  I had adressed this subject at the end of last week.\n  After I spoke, Senator Lott made an eloquent, but occasionally \ninaccurate, statement in defense of the conference report. I want to \nbriefly comment on and correct a few of the Senator's statements about \nmissile defense, particularly regarding my role.\n  The Senator from Mississippi suggested that, since I supported the \ndeployment by a fixed date--1996--of a limited NMD system in the 1991 \nMissile Defense Act, I was being inconsistent in opposing the \ndeployment of an NMD system by 2003 in the conference report.\n  I first observe that I was not a party who injected the 1996 date in \nthat act. I thought it was unrealistic but I did not oppose it in \ntheory, I opposed it in terms of practicality. But it did go into the \nreport and I did not oppose the overall act. I supported the overall \nact, notwithstanding my feeling at that time that 1996 was not \nrealistic.\n  There are a couple of very, very significant differences between the \n1991 Missile Defense Act and the language in the conference report \nbefore us today.\n  Let me begin by quoting exactly what the 1991 Missile Defense Act \nsays about the NMD system:\n\n       (2) Initial deployment.--The Secretary shall develop for \n     deployment by the earliest date allowed by the availability \n     of appropriate technology or by fiscal year 1996 a cost-\n     effective, operationally-effective, and ABM Treaty-compliant \n     anti-ballistic missile system at a single site as the initial \n     step toward deployment of an anti-ballistic missile system \n     designed to protect the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile threats, including accidental or \n     unauthorized launches or Third World attacks. The system to \n     be developed should include--\n       (A) 100 ground-based interceptors . . .\n       (B) Fixed, ground-based, anti-ballistic missile battle \n     management radars; and\n       (C) optimum utilization of space-based sensors, including \n     sensors capable of cueing ground-based anti-ballistic missile \n     interceptors and providing initial targeting vectors, and \n     other sensor systems that also are not prohibited by the ABM \n     Treaty, such as a ground-based sub-orbital tracking system.\n\n  Mr. President, it is clear from this paragraph that the NMD system \nspecified in the 1991 act was to be developed to be fully compliant \nwith the ABM Treaty as it then existed. A similar paragraph was \nincluded in the Senate compromise language passed last September, which \nstated that it is the policy of the United States to:\n\n       (8) carry out the policies, programs, and requirements of \n     (this Act) through processes specified within, or consistent \n     with, the ABM Treaty, which anticipates the need and provides \n     the means for amendment to the Treaty.\n\n  This language, which was dropped in conference, stands in sharp \ncontrast to the language in the conference report, which merely states \nin a completely different section that the programs contained in the \nconference report, quote, ``can be accomplished'' in ways consistent \nwith the ABM Treaty--it nowhere requires that the NMD Programs shall be \ncarried out in compliant fashion.\n  As a matter of fact, it implies very strongly just the opposite, \nwhich is the reason so many of us oppose it.\n  The conference report also abandons other safeguards found in the \nSenate compromise. Gone is a requirement for a congressional review \nprior to a decision to deploy the system to determine whether the \nproposed deployment would be affordable and cost effective, whether the \nthreat has developed as anticipated, and whether ABM Treaty \nconsiderations should affect the decision to deploy.\n  In other words, Mr. President, all of these safeguards that we had in \nthe Senate bill are omitted from the new conference report language. \nThere is no requirement to determine prior to a decision to deploy \nwhether the proposed system would be affordable, cost effective, \nwhether the threat has developed as anticipated, and whether the ABM \nTreaty considerations should affect the decisions to deploy. In my \nview, all of those are absolutely essential preconditions to making an \nintelligent decision about whether to deploy a system and when to \ndeploy a system.\n  So, the conference report language, contrary to the assertion made \nearlier, does not have the same effect as the language in the 1991 \nMissile Defense Act--not by a long, long shot. That act clearly calls \nfor a ABM-compliant system--a system compliant with the ABM Treaty. In \nmy view, the administration has rightly found the language in the \nconference report to be unacceptable because of these considerations.\n  I repeat what I have said earlier. The last thing we want is to take \nan effort to mandate now certain language that the administration--and \nthey are the ones negotiating this with the Russians--that the \nadministration believes is likely to have the result of not having a \nratification of START II, and perhaps not even a continuation of START \nI reductions.\n  We have had two Republican Presidents do a very good job in \nnegotiating both START I and START II. Those treaties, if they are \ncomplied with, will require a two-thirds reduction in the number of \nmissiles aimed at the United States, including the missiles we have \nalways felt were more likely to be launched early, perhaps by mistake, \nperhaps by the other military leaders making a mistake in terms of \nwarning, because these are highly MIRV'd systems with a lot of warheads \nand the fear would be, by the other side, that they might be knocked \nout on a preemptive strike.\n  We have always worried about those MIRV'd missiles. These two \ntreaties are able, after lots of negotiations over more than 10 or 12 \nyears, to get rid of those systems that we have always considered to be \nhighly destabilizing as applied in the cold war period. We finally \nachieved that. And to take language in this bill and to take a real \nrisk that the results of those two treaties would be obviated is not \nonly unwise but it is totally unnecessary.\n  I repeat, also, what I have said earlier. The administration and \nthose of us negotiating offered to take on the section of national \nmissile defense language, we offered either the House version or the \nSenate version, on the national missile defense language. Why in \nconference you cannot solve the national missile defense language with \neither the House version, as passed by the House, or the Senate \nversion, as passed by the Senate, when you offer the conferees either \nversion, is beyond me. It is a real puzzle.\n  Of course, what happened is that we made the compromise on the Senate \nfloor--which Senator Levin, Senator \n\n[[Page S18893]]\nWarner, Senator Cohen, and I worked out and which every Republican \nvoted for except one, and the people who were opposed to it were mainly \non the Democratic side, because they felt it went too far. We had an \nunusual 4- or 5-day intensive, word-by-word examination and we got, not \nonly the agreement in this body, with every Republican but one voting \nfor it, but we got the administration signing off on it, albeit \nreluctantly with some concerns. And then we went into conference and we \noffered either the Senate-passed language or the House language--not \nthe entire language of the House on everything, but on the national \nmissile defense part--and we could not satisfy people because they \nwanted to go much further than either the House version or the Senate \nversion. To me that is just very puzzling.\n  It is sad to see a bill jeopardized, in terms of becoming law, \nbecause of that.\n  Mr. President, I will now address the negotiations as I saw them, \nfrom my point of view, and the possibilities that still exist in \nputting this bill together if it is vetoed, and if the veto is not \noverridden.\n\n\n                       ballistic missile defense\n\n  The administration strongly objects to the ballistic missile defense \nlanguage adopted by the conferees, and I agree with the \nadministration's assessment. Mr. President, the Congress has been \ndealing with difficult issues related to BMD since the star wars \ndebates of the early 1980's. I have been part of putting together \nbipartisan agreements on BMD for over a decade, many years facing much \nmore difficult challenges than this year. That is why I am puzzled that \nthe Republican majorities--with two bipartisan paths open to approval \nby the President--chose a third path to certain opposition.\n  As Members will recall, the issue of ballistic missile defense was \none of the primary subjects of debate and difficulty when the Senate \nconsidered the National Defense Authorization bill during the summer. \nThere was strong opposition on the floor to the BMD provision reported \nby the committee. During the debate, the bipartisan leadership \ndesignated a group of Senators to address this subject. Senator Dole \ndesignated Senators Warner and Cohen to represent the Republicans. \nSenator Daschle designated Senator Levin and myself to represent the \nDemocrats.\n  Mr. President, we dealt with that issue in the old-fashioned way, \nwith Senators closely examining each word of the proposed amendment. \nSenators Warner, Cohen, Levin, and I worked and reworked the amendment, \nline-by-line, to address the issues raised by the administration and \nour respective party caucuses.\n  It was clear to all concerned that the administration had serious \nreservations even bout the bipartisan amendment we developed in the \nSenate. After expressing their concerns and examining every word and \nevery phrase carefully, the administration reluctantly agreed to accept \nthis final Senate compromise language.\n  On August 11, 1995, Senators Warner, Cohen, Levin, and I each \nprovided detailed explanations of the bipartisan amendment in speeches \nto the Senate. We also placed extensive information in the \nCongressional Record, including the text of the bipartisan amendment, a \ndetailed comparison to previous language, and related materials. As a \nresult, detailed explanatory information was available to all Senators \nand the public for a thorough review for nearly a month before we \nactually voted on the amendment on September 6.\n  The bipartisan amendment provided extensive guidance to ensure that \nthe United States would develop a more focussed missile defense program \nthan we had previously authorized, particularly in the area of national \nmissile defense.\n  The bipartisan amendment stated that it--\n\n       . . . is the policy of the United States to . . . develop \n     for deployment a multiple-site national missile defense \n     system that: (i) is affordable and operationally effective \n     against limited, accidental, and unauthorized ballistic \n     missile attacks on the territory of the United States, and \n     (ii) can be augmented over time as the threat changes to \n     provide a layered defense against limited, accidental, or \n     unauthorized ballistic missile threats.\n\n  The bipartisan amendment required the Secretary of Defense to \n``develop an affordable and operationally effective national missile \ndefense system to counter a limited, accidental, or unauthorized \nballistic missile attack, and which is capable of attaining initial \noperational capability [IOC] by the end of 2003.''\n  The bipartisan amendment also set forth the understanding of the \nSenate as to the demarcation between theater and ballistic missile \ndefense systems, and established a prohibition against use of funds--\n\n       . . . to implement an agreement with any of the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union entered into after January \n     1, 1995 that would establish a demarcation between theater \n     missile defense systems and anti-ballistic missile systems \n     for purposes of the ABM Treaty or that would restrict the \n     performance, operation, or deployment of United States \n     theater missile defense systems except: (1) to the extent \n     provided in an Act enacted subsequent to this Act; (2) to \n     implement that portion of any such agreement that \n     implements the criteria in subsection (b)(1); or (3) to \n     implement any such agreement that is entered into pursuant \n     to the treaty making power of the President under the \n     Constitution.\n\n  The amendment was approved overwhelmingly by a vote of 85-13, with \nonly one Republican voting against the amendment. Without this \nbipartisan agreement and approval, it is doubtful the Senate would have \npassed the authorization bill.\n  Although the conference on this bill was convened on September 7, \nthere were no Member-level bipartisan House-Senate discussions on this \nsubject by members of the conference for over 2 months. Eventually, we \nwere able to reach agreement on the theater missile defense demarcation \nlanguage, but could not reach a consensus on the national missile \ndefense provisions. The failure to reach an agreement is puzzling to \nme, since the administration was prepared to accept either the House-\npassed or Senate-passed versions of the national missile defense \nlanguage.\n  The Senate, as I noted earlier in my remarks, established a \nrequirement to ``develop an affordable and operationally effective \nnational missile defense system to counter a limited, accidental, or \nunauthorized ballistic missile attack, and which is capable of \nattaining initial operational capability [IOC] by the end of 2003.'' \nThe House established a requirement to ``develop for deployment at the \nearliest practical date an affordable, operationally effective national \nmissile defense [NMD] system designed to protect the United States \nagainst limited ballistic missile attacks.''\n  Either version of this language--approved overwhelmingly by each \nHouse--would have been acceptable to the administration, but neither \nwas approved in conference. The main stumbling block was the insistence \nof some of the conferees that Congress go beyond language approved by \neither the Senate or the House and mandate a specific requirement to \ndeploy a national missile defense system by 2003. This problem was \ncompounded by an insistence that the conferees use a new baseline draft \nproposal in conference, rather than work off the carefully crafted \nbipartisan Senate language. As a result, the conference report lacks \nmany of the carefully drafted provisions of Senate-passed bill.\n  During attempts to forge a conference agreement acceptable to the \nadministration, I emphasized that we could use national missile defense \nlanguage that had received overwhelming Republican support this year. I \nbelieve that it is still possible to do so if this bill is not enacted. \nThere are two primary options, each of which would use language \napproved by an overwhelming majority in the Senate or the House.\n  The first option would simply use the bipartisan national missile \ndefense and theater missile defense provisions which were approved by \nthe Senate on September 6, 1995 by a vote of 85 to 13, with only one \nRepublican Senator voting against that amendment.\n  The second option would substitute the House-passed national missile \ndefense language for the national missile defense portion of the \nbipartisan Senate-passed bill, using the Senate-passed bill for the \nremainder of the missile defense language. Either of these provisions \nwould provide the basis for renewed focus in our National Missile \nDefense Program and an even stronger effort on theater missile \ndefenses.\n  Mr. President, if the national missile defense language in the Senate \nbill was strong enough to win virtually unanimous Republican support, \nit should \n\n[[Page S18894]]\nhave provided an adequate basis for our conference report.\n  If the national missile defense language in the House bill was strong \nenough to win overwhelming Republican support in the House, it should \nhave provided an adequate basis for a conference agreement.\n  Either of these approaches could have represent a solid step forward \non the important subject of national missile defense. The alternative \nultimately chosen by the conferees was to use language that was in \nneither bill mandated a specific requirement to deploy a national \nmissile defense system by 2003. That language is unacceptable to the \nadministration, and is a major element of the administration's \nannounced intention that this bill will be vetoed.\n\n  The administration is very concerned that the national missile \ndefense language in the conference report goes well beyond the mandates \nof both the House-passed and Senate-passed bills.\n  The administration has expressed serious concerns about the impact of \nthe conference report language on Russian consideration of the START II \nTreaty, which is designed to produce a second major reduction in United \nStates and Russian nuclear weapons. The administration is also \nconcerned that the language could lead the Russians to abandon other \narms control agreements if they conclude that it is United States \npolicy to take unilateral action to abandon the ABM Treaty. Russian \nspokesmen have made plain that Russia has neither the technology nor \nthe defense resources to allow them to match United States missile \ndefense efforts. Therefore, they state that their only available \nreaction to a large-scale U.S. national missile defense program would \nbe to retain additional strategic missiles and nuclear warheads, which \nwould require them to forego START II and perhaps even abrogate START I \nlimitations. This is what is at risk. These are not small stakes.\n  In a letter to Senator Daschle, dated December 15, Secretary of \nDefense Bill Perry stated:\n\n       [B]y directing that the NMD [National Missile Defense] be \n     ``operationally effective'' in defending all 50 states \n     including Hawaii and Alaska, the bill would likely require a \n     multiple-site NMD architecture that cannot be accommodated \n     within the terms of the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting \n     U.S. policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty, the \n     bill puts at risk continued implementation of the START I \n     Treaty and Russian ratification of START II, two treaties \n     which together will reduce the number of U.S. and Russian \n     strategic warheads by two-thirds from cold war levels, \n     significantly lowering the threat to U.S. national security.\n\n  In my judgment, the administration's concerns are well-placed. \nMoreover, this struggle over language is, in my judgment, completely \nunnecessary. I believe we can achieve both START II ratification and \nprogress toward the deployment of a highly-effective national missile \ndefense system to protect against accidental, unauthorized, or limited \nthird-world attacks. Since the late 1980's I have advocated development \nof a National missile defense system in the form of an accidental \nlaunch protection system [ALPs].\n   Mr. President, it is important to understand the historical context \nfor this concept. National missile defense proposals began with \nPresident Reagan's star wars proposal in 1983, designed to render \nballistic missiles ``impotent and obsolete.'' This was followed in the \nmid-1980s by a slightly more modest proposal, called the ``Phase-I'' \nsystem, with the objective of defeating a full Soviet counterforce \nfirst-strike. This, in turn, was followed in the early 1990s by G-PALS, \nor Global Protection Against Limited Strikes, which also turned out to \nbe too ambitious.\n  This progression was what led to the Missile Defense Act of 1991, \nwhich envisioned simply getting on with the development of a treaty-\ncompliant NMD system. And, when I say ``treaty-compliant,'' that means \nwith the treaty as it currently exists, not as it might someday be \nmodified.\n  In my judgment, even if the ultimate answer to our requirements is a \nsystem requiring amendment to the ABM Treaty--such as a multiple-site \nNMD system with more than 100 interceptor missiles--there is no need to \ninsist on a commitment to that today. Common sense tells us that even \nif a multi-site system is the end-objective, we will begin by deploying \na small number of interceptors at a single site. At this stage, we do \nnot know what the performance or cost of the various NMD system \ncomponents under development will be, or whether such a system would be \n``affordable and cost-effective.''\n  Also, Mr. President, the strategic environment is different today \nthan it was in 1991. When the Missile Defense Act of 1991 was passed, \nwe faced thousands of Soviet missiles and more than 10,000 warheads, \nall aimed on hair-trigger alert at the United States or its military \nforces. The consequences of even a small accidental launch would have \nbeen enormous, because of the likelihood of escalation. Today, START I \nhas cut the inventory of weapons, and START II will cut levels further, \nonce it enters into force. Moreover, the Soviet Union is gone, replaced \nby a less hostile Russia; United States and Russian missiles are now \ntargeted on broad ocean areas, rather than on each others' territory. \nThe policy of targeting broad ocean areas has reduced but not \neliminated the consequences of an accidental launch.\n\n  Finally, there is a future threat of missile attack on the United \nStates by some rogue Third World power. This was recognized as a \npossible threat in the 1991 act, and in the Senate compromise. However, \nno such threat has yet materialized, and the latest from the \nintelligence community on the likelihood of such an event reads as \nfollows:\n\n       Several countries are seeking longer range missiles to meet \n     regional security goals; however, most of these missiles \n     cannot reach as far as 1,000 kilometers. A North Korean \n     missile potentially capable of reaching portions of Alaska--\n     but not beyond--may be in development, but the likelihood of \n     it being operational within five years is very low.\n       The Intelligence Community believes it extremely unlikely \n     that any nation with ICBMs will be willing to sell them, and \n     we are also confident that our warning capability is \n     sufficient to provide notice many years in advance of \n     indigenous development.\n\n  That information was provided in a December 1, 1995 letter on behalf \nof CIA Director Deutch by Joanne Lsham, CIA Director of Congressional \nAffairs. The missile defense language in the conference report is \nmisguided. There is no need for: First, strident language or second, \nironclad commitments today to deploy by a date certain an NMD system \nthat is clearly an anticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty. Enactment of \nthis language is likely to prevent the START II Treaty from entering \ninto force, which would compound the problem of developing affordable \nand cost-effective defenses. Without the START II reductions, missile \ndefenses capable of dealing with potential accidental or unauthorized \nlaunches would likely have to be much more extensive. If the 5,000 or \nso warheads to be retired under START II remain in Russian inventories, \nthis will greatly complicate our missile defense problem. Because of \nthe magnitude of the threat, star wars and its successors were deemed \ntoo costly and of too limited effectiveness to be worth pursuing.\n  In my judgment, we should be pursing first things first. First, the \ndevelopment of all the components of an NMD system, and a limited \ndeployment of a strictly treaty-compliant system, so as to learn more \nabout the cost and effectiveness of NMD systems. Then, depending on \ncost and effectiveness, depending on the evolution of the threat and \nthe course of negotiations to amend the ABM Treaty, we can make further \ndecisions on further deployments. But, let us not jeopardize the \nadvantages of the START II Treaty by a headlog rush to deploy \nsomething.\n  Mr. President, there are four fundamental aspects to an effective \nprotection against nuclear weapons. The first is to reduce nuclear \nwarheads by two-thirds as envisioned by START I and START II, thereby \nsubstantially decreasing the weapons that could be used against us \ndeliberately or accidentally.\n  The second is to vigorously pursue the Nunn-Lugar program for \ndismantlement of nuclear weapons in the states of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  The third is to develop and deploy effective theater missile \ndefenses. A strong majority in the Senate and the Congress fully \nsupport the development and deployment of highly effective theater \nmissile defenses.\n  The fourth is to develop for deployment an affordable and cost-\neffective national missile defense program to address the potential for \naccidental, unauthorized, or limited strikes. \n\n[[Page S18895]]\n\n  No one of these programs, by itself, is sufficient. Each one can have \na significant impact on the other. The national missile defense \nprogram, in particular, could have either a positive or negative impact \non the pace and likelihood of START I and START II reductions. \nMoreover, even in combination, these programs are not a guarantee \nagainst threats by other means, such as conventional delivery by a \nterrorist through a smaller aircraft or vessel. That threat will \nrequire additional counterproliferation and counterterrorist efforts.\n  In summary, Mr. President, it is important to pursue the development \nof a national missile defense system, but we must do so in a manner \nthat preserves and encourages the important reductions we can achieve \nthrough START I, START II, and Nunn-Lugar. Because the language in the \nconference agreement is likely to severely undermine these efforts in \nRussia, I cannot support the conference agreement in its current form.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now yield to the able Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner. Senator Warner has been on the Armed Services \nCommittee a long time. He is a very effective, able member. We are very \npleased to have him here to speak for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman. It has \nbeen a real pleasure to have worked with him all these many, many years \nthat I have been in the U.S. Senate. I can remember when I appeared \nbefore his committee, at that time for confirmation as Under Secretary, \nand then, again, as Secretary of the Navy, that he, frankly, Mr. \nPresident, coached me through that procedure--he and that fine Senator \nfrom Virginia known as Harry Byrd. I remember those days very well and \nalways am appreciative.\n  I am always appreciative too, to serve with my former chairman, the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia. Leadership was his hallmark on the \ncommittee through those many years, and I was pleased to serve with him \nas ranking member for some several years and to work with him on many \npieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, earlier today I made reference to the portion of our \nbill which deals with the equipment added for the National Guard and \nReserve components. I would like to include in the record a statement \nfrom the December 15th Congressional Record in which Congressman \nMontgomery, a senior Democratic Member of the House of Representatives, \nsaid the following: ``I have great respect for the gentleman from \nCalifornia--speaking of Mr. Dellums--my ranking member, but I strongly \nsupport this bill, and I believe that he will oppose it. One area that \nI have worked very hard in over the years, Mr. Speaker, is working to \nhave a strong National Guard and Reserve.''\n  And unquestionably he has done that, and indeed our distinguished \nchairman likewise has been a pillar of strength for the Guard and \nReserve through these many years.\n  Continuing, ``We now have the total force. We are using the Reserves \nfor the first time, and it is paying off.''\n  An example of that, of course, Mr. President, being the number of \nflights going into Sarajevo formerly, and now Tuzla and elsewhere. It \nwill be interesting to note how many of those flights are being flown \nby Reserve units from all over the United States.\n  Mr. Montgomery continued, ``As we move into Bosnia, the Guard and \nReserve will be totally used. In this bill, we have a lot of things \nthat will help the National Guard and Reserve and the different States \naround the country will benefit by this bill. I certainly hope that \nthis conference report will be adopted. In the area that I have worked \nover the years, serving 27 years on the Armed Services Committee and \nCommittee of National Security, the Guard and Reserve have the best \npackage they have had in 10 years.''\n  That is the package, Mr. President, in this report.\n  Mr. President, I would like to also take an opportunity here to thank \nthe members of the Senate Budget Committee for negotiating a budget \nresolution under the leadership of Senator Domenici, and, indeed, \nSenator Exon also--a resolution which provided for increases to Defense \nbudgets in fiscal year 1996, and in future years as well.\n  Notice that there are those who ask why, as we strive to reduce the \ndeficit and move toward the balanced budget, we should increase the \nlevel of defense spending, especially when we are making reductions in \nalmost every other area of the budget. Too often those who clamor for \nfurther Defense cuts fail--I think it is important, and I do this on \neach bill--to note that Defense has already paid more than its fair \nshare, that in fact Defense has already been cut in my judgment, very \ndeeply. Fiscal year 1996 represents the 11th consecutive year, Mr. \nPresident, of declining Defense budgets, the longest continuous decline \nsince World War II. DOD spending, as a share of the Federal budget, has \ndeclined 42 percent--which it was in 1968--to 18 percent in 1994, and \ncontinues that decline.\n  As a percentage of gross domestic product, defense spending has \ndeclined to its lowest level since 1940, the year before America ended \nthe war.\n  We should not lose sight of the fact that the end of the cold war did \nnot usher in a new era of peace and stability in the world.\n  According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, there are currently 60 \nareas of conflict throughout the world, and as we are seeing today in \nBosnia, the United States can be drawn militarily very quickly into \nthese conflicts.\n  In addition, the Communist resurgence in the recent elections in \nRussia should give rise for great concern. Russia remains the only \ncountry with the capability to inflict considerable damage on the \nUnited States of America. Hopefully, we will not witness a return to \npast policies with Russia. But we must be vigilant and maintain our \ndefense capabilities in these times of uncertainty.\n  In earlier remarks today, Mr. President, I singled out the very \nsignificant amount of money that Russia is investing in its submarine \nprogram and other strategic systems beneath the sea. That should bring \nto the attention of all Senators the need to keep the strongest \nresearch and development capability of this country addressing that \narea, and this conference report does just that, Mr. President.\n  Further, as chairman of the Subcommittee or AirLand Forces, I have \noversight over the research and development, R and procurement \nprograms for the Army, the Air Force, and the tactical fighter aircraft \nfor both the Navy and the Air Force.\n  I thank at this moment, Col. Les Brownlee, my professional staff \nmember who has been with me for 12 years working on various areas of \nthe national security aspects of our committee, and I want to pay \nspecial recognition also to Mrs. Judy Ansley who is also on my staff \nand works in this area.\n  The modernization accounts, R and procurement, have clearly been \nunderfunded by the Clinton administration. The procurement accounts to \nprovide for the future readiness of our military forces have been \nreduced by 44 percent since fiscal year 1992, the last defense budget \nfrom the Bush administration.\n  In my subcommittee we address some of these deficiencies. In 1986 we \nbought over 400 tactical fighter aircraft for the Navy and the Air \nForce. I will repeat that--400. In the fiscal year 1996 defense budget \nthe Clinton administration requested funds to buy a total of only 12--\n400 compared to 12 such aircraft. We more than double that number with \nthe additional funding provided by the Budget Committee here in the \nSenate.\n  In the Army's truck program--that is always considered the last item \nin these programs. As our distinguished chairman, a former Army man \nknows, the Army may travel on its stomach but it cannot move without \nits trucks. In the Army truck program, the funding has ranged over the \npast 10 years from a high of $917 million per year to a low of $419 \nmillion, with an average of $720 million per year over the last 10-year \nperiod. The administration's budget request for the Army's truck \nprograms for the fiscal year 1996 was only $128 million. That is \ncompared, Mr. President, I repeat to the average of $720 million. We \nrecommended an increase of over $300 million to help alleviate this \ndeficiency. The committee \n\n[[Page S18896]]\naccepted it and it is included in this conference report.\n  Clearly, without the additional funds provided by the Congress, the \nadministration's shortcoming in the Defense spending would mortgage the \nfuture of our military capabilities. This administration has made \nreadiness the keystone of the Defense program, and in fact has funded \nreadiness at the expense of modernizing our military. Not only have the \nprocurement and R accounts deteriorated but because the overall \nDefense budget is so severely underfunded, readiness has suffered as \nwell, despite its high priority.\n  In the State of the Union Address in 1994, President Clinton implored \nthe Congress not to cut defense further. That defense had been cut \nenough. That was just in 1994. Then this year, in his budget request \nfor fiscal year 1996, the President recommended $5.7 billion less than \nhe recommended in the previous year. In real terms, this is over $13 \nbillion less than last year. Mr. President, that sounds like a cut to \nme.\n  Mr. President, funds which the Budget Committees of this Congress \nhave proposed to add over the next 7 years are in fact quite modest, \nand may not be enough. By any measure, this is not another Reagan \nbuildup.\n  I would like to dispell a notion which has appeared recently in \nvarious articles in the Washington press and is repeated frequently on \nthe Senate floor--that the uniformed leaders of our military services \ndo not want the weapons and equipment bought with the funds added by \nthe Congress. Our military chiefs testified before our committee \nregarding the lack of funding were experiencing--specifically for \nmodernization. Of course they want the equipment, and our military \nservices desperately need it. It is difficult for our military to ask \nfor resources that are not in the President's budget request, because \nthey are bound to support the President's budget. But, there is plenty \nof evidence that these additional funds were very much needed by our \nmilitary services and very much appreciated.\n  The Armed Services Committee has used these funds wisely, in my view, \nto increase the capabilities of our military forces now and in the \nfuture. The committee has given priority to increasing the \nmodernization accounts in order to buy the weapons and equipment needed \nto fight and win decisively with minimal risk to personnel. The \ncommittee utilized the following precepts in allocating congressional \nincreases to the defense budget: buy basics; invest to achieve savings; \nand invest in the future.\n  Because the procurement of basic weapons and items of equipment has \nbeen neglected during the decline in defense spending, the conference \nreport includes increases in such basic items as new ships, trucks, \nsmall arms and upgrades to weapon systems and items of equipment \nalready in the inventory.\n  While the conference report adds a significant amount of the \ncongressional increase for defense to the procurement accounts, we did \nso without initiating significant numbers of new programs to avoid \ncreating ``bow-waves'' of funding that the military services could not \nafford in the out years. Instead, we recommend increases for weapons \nand items of equipment currently in production and the use of multiyear \nprocurement contracts, where savings might be achieved. Buying more \nweapons and equipment currently in production at more efficient rates \nlowers overall costs to the Government. It also avoids overlapping \nprocurement sequencing and reduces competition for procurement \nresources in the future.\n  Mr. President, this conference agreement authorizes a much-needed \n$7.1 billion increase in the defense budget over the amount requested \nby President Clinton. This additional funding was used to improve the \nquality of life of our troops and their families, to revitalize the \nreadiness of our Armed Forces, to fund a robust modernization program \nand to accelerate the development and deployment of missile defense \nsystems.\n  While the ultimate fate of this conference agreement may be in doubt, \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation which contains many \nprovisions which are of vital importance to the men and women of the \nArmed Forces. At the very time that we are deploying troops to Bosnia, \nall Members of Congress should support this conference agreement which \ngoes a long way toward improving the quality of life of our service \npersonnel and their families. All members who spoke so eloquently \nduring the Bosnia debate about supporting our troops now have a real \nopportunity to show that support by voting to support this conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nVirginia for his able remarks he made on this bill. He is chairman of \nthe Rules Committee but he is a prominent member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and has rendered great service to his country. We all \nappreciate that very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, and I \nthank the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a few moments ago I cast my vote in \nfavor of the Defense authorization conference report for fiscal year \n1996. I did so with very mixed feelings. There are many provisions in \nthe conference report which I worked hard to attain and I am delighted \nthey are in this report. But there are other provisions that I have \nopposed for several years and, in fact, voted against during the markup \nof the bill in the Armed Services Committee--restrictions on abortion \nand additional B-2 funding to name just two. There is also a provision \non how the military must treat HIV positive soldiers which I believe is \nwrong-headed and discriminatory. I regret that in order to complete \nthis conference the majority felt it necessary to accept these sorts of \nprovisions. My vote today for passage of this conference report does \nnot alter my determination to see that these provisions are changed \nbefore they can have the adverse impact on our military men and women \nwhich I fear is likely. As I weighed the bad against the good in this \nconference report, I have concluded that the good is essential for our \nservicemen and women and their families as they serve our country in \nBosnia or wherever they are serving around the world.\n  Mr. President, one of the many reasons I sought to serve on the Armed \nServices Committee is that it operated on a bipartisan basis for the \ngood of our national security and our men and women in uniform. The \nfact that Senator Nunn, the former chairman, during his time on the \ncommittee has voted for more than 20 authorization bills regardless of \nwho was in the majority is an indicator of this bipartisan spirit. The \nfact that Senator Nunn did not vote for this report is an indicator \nthat this spirit was eroded this year. I greatly regret that. This \nerosion occurred, I believe, in spite of the hard work and best efforts \nof the distinguished current chairman, Senator Thurmond. I hope that we \ncan take a hard look at ourselves and that we will be able to make \nwhatever changes might help us return to where this great committee \nused to be.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the defense \nauthorization conference report today with some regret. I did not care \nfor the bill as it left the Senate, and I voted against it then. Now \nthe conferees have contended at length and come back with I believe a \nmore objectionable bill.\n  I know that a number of the Senate minority conferees tried to return \nwith a workable bill devoid of excesses, but, unfortunately, they did \nnot prevail.\n  I am particularly concerned by the provisions setting the stage for a \nnational missile defense. This legislation requires that the United \nStates build an ``operationally effective'' defense of all 50 States by \nthe year 2003.\n  Such a new system almost certainly would require deployments of \nballistic missile defenses at multiple sites, since such a defense \nwould likely be well beyond any capabilities we could put into our \npresently mothballed single ABM site at Grand Forks, ND. The cost could \nquickly mount into the tens of billions of dollars over the next 7 \nyears.\n  An immediate problem with all of this is that it could send a message \nto the Russians that we do not intend to live up to the ABM Treaty. \nThis could well undermine any prospects we might \n\n[[Page S18897]]\nhave that they, in turn, will ratify and abide by the terms of the \nSTART II Treaty. That treaty has just been approved by the Committee on \nForeign Relations in an 18 to 0 vote and is awaiting Senate action.\n  Heretofore, both we and the Russians have been comfortable with \nmutually agreed steps to curb and reduce nuclear armaments secure in \nthe knowledge that the ABM Treaty ensured that our deterrent worked and \nwould work at lower levels. It would be very much against our interests \nif the train of reductions were to stop now. A renewed strategic arms \nbuildup might even be in prospect.\n  If all of that happened, the new National Missile Defense System \nwould be woefully outmatched, since it would be designed to deal with \naccidental launches and new and emerging threats and not with a major \ncontinued Russian threat. One might ask why we need new defenses \nagainst accidental launches when we did not need them before.\n  Mr. President, we should pause to think of these new threats. First, \nit is important to understand that there is no official intelligence \nanalysis to indicate that we are likely to have any new missile threat \nover the next decade or so. Any nation thinking of moving in that \ndirection would have a very hard time finding a supplier or suppliers. \nIt is extremely difficult to develop missiles indigenously, and any \nnation doing so would certainly be caught at it.\n  We should ask ourselves how we would react if some nation were trying \nto get a small fleet of missiles to attack us with. We and others could \napply serious political and economic pressures to make that nation \ncease and desist. If we and others had to act militarily to end the \nthreat, we could. That fact alone would add strength to our diplomatic \nefforts.\n  The least reasonable response would be to spend billions of dollars \ndeploying a last-ditch, Fortress America ballistic missile defense that \nwould, at best, make little or no contribution to our national defenses \nand would, at worst, start a process under which strategic stability \nand the very fruitful process of arms control could be dealt a terrible \nblow.\n\n\n                 shipments of spent nuclear fuel appear\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senate for \nincluding language in the Defense authorization bill that recognizes \nthe need to implement the terms, conditions, right and obligations \ncontained in the recently signed agreement between the Navy, Department \nof Energy, and the State of Idaho and the consent order of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Idaho that effectuates the \nsettlement agreement. I am also pleased that it is the Senate's sense \nto appropriate funds called for by the President to carry out the \nagreement.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Governor Batt as he crafted a \nhistoric agreement between the State of Idaho, the U.S. Navy, and the \nDepartment of Energy. Shipments of spent nuclear fuel began \naccumulating at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory [INEL] when I \nwas a child growing up in Midvale, ID, in 1949 and continue to this \nday. However, until Governor Batt signed an agreement in 1995, there \nwas no provision to remove this material from Idaho. I am proud to have \nworked with him to help to craft the agreement that assures liquid \nwastes will be put into dry form to protect the Snake River aquifer and \napproximately 10,800 shipments of spent nuclear fuel and transuranic \nwastes will begin to be shipped from Idaho in 1999 and be completely \nremoved by 2035.\n  Mr. President, Idaho has had a long history with the nuclear Navy and \nnuclear reactor research. We are proud of that involvement with our \nNation's defense. We are just as proud that Idaho, for the first time, \nhas an agreement and timeline for the removal of spent fuel from our \nState. I am glad to have played a role in moving this agreement.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that a time line that indicates the history \nof the Navy and DOE's involvement at the Idaho National Engineering \nLaboratory be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Idaho's Nuclear Waste Timeline\n\n       W.W.II, the area that is now the Idaho National Engineering \n     Laboratory is used by the Navy to test ship gun barrels and \n     by the Army Corps to train bombardier crews.\n       1949, the ``National Testing Station'' is established in \n     Idaho--the forerunner of today's Idaho National Engineering \n     Laboratory.\n       1950, the Navy begins work on their first nuclear reactor \n     in Idaho--the Submarine Thermal Reactor prototype (S1W \n     prototype).\n       1951, a reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station \n     (now INEL) called ``Experimental Breeder Reactor-1'' (EBR-1) \n     becomes the first nuclear reactor in the world to produce \n     electricity.\n       1952, the first shipment of spent nuclear fuel arrives from \n     Hanford, Washington.\n       1954, the first shipment of transuranic wastes (items like \n     gloves, tools and pipes contaminated with plutonium) arrives \n     from Colorado.\n       1955, the first nuclear powered U.S. Naval vessel, the \n     U.S.S. Nautilus submarine is launched.\n       1957, the first shipment of spent Navy fuel comes to Idaho.\n       From 1949 to 1995, there have been 627 Navy spent nuclear \n     fuel shipments and approximately 1,032 Department of Energy \n     shipments. In addition, there have been approximately 3,225 \n     shipments of transuranic materials. All told, about 4,884 \n     shipments have come to Idaho. Additional waste material is \n     also generated at INEL.\n       From 1957 to 1970--Republicans Robert Smylie and Don \n     Samuelson were Governors of Idaho. During their \n     administrations, there were 140 Navy spent nuclear fuel \n     shipments, 50 foreign fuel shipments and about 1,550 \n     transuranic waste shipments. The total number of shipments \n     that came into Idaho during the Smylie and Samuelson \n     administrations: approximately 1,740.\n       From 1970 to 1994--Democrats Cecil Andrus and John Evans \n     were Governors of Idaho. During their administrations there \n     were 456 Navy spent nuclear fuel shipments, 532 commercial \n     spent nuclear fuel shipments, about 500 U.S. Department of \n     Energy/federal government shipments and 1,675 transuranic \n     shipments from Rocky Flats, Colorado. The total number of \n     shipments that came into Idaho during the Andrus and Evans \n     administrations: approximately 3,163.\n       1970, Senator Frank Church received a letter from the head \n     of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (forerunner of the \n     current U.S. Department of Energy). The letter says that \n     transuranic nuclear waste would begin to be removed from \n     Idaho ``within the decade.''\n       1973, Governor Cecil Andrus has said that he received \n     assurances that the nuclear wastes in Idaho would be removed \n     ``within 10 years.''\n       1974, the National Reactor Testing Station is renamed the \n     Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) to reflect its \n     changing mission.\n       1975, the Energy Research and Development Administration \n     (forerunner of the current U.S. Department of Energy) chooses \n     a site in New Mexico for the disposal of transuranic wastes.\n       1979, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (later renamed the \n     Waste Isolation Pilot Plant--WIPP) in New Mexico is \n     authorized by Congress.\n       In 1982, Congress passes the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. \n     Spent nuclear fuel is to be shipped to two repositories--one \n     in the eastern U.S. and the other in west--and to an interim \n     facility for Monitored Retrievable Storage--by 1998.\n       1987, Congress realizes that site characterization costs \n     have escalated from $100 million per site to $2 billion per \n     site. The law is amended and Yucca Mountain Nevada is \n     designated by Congress as the only spent nuclear fuel site to \n     be considered for characterization.\n       1987, the office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator is established \n     by Congress. Former Idaho Attorney General Dave Leroy \n     (Republican) is named as the first administrator. He is \n     charged with finding a state, county, reservation or U.S. \n     territory that will accept a Monitored Retrievable Storage \n     facility for spent nuclear fuel.\n       1988, WIPP does not open as scheduled. Governor Andrus \n     begins legal battles to stop shipments into Idaho.\n       1993, Governor Andrus reaches an agreement with the federal \n     government that allows in 19 shipments of Navy spent nuclear \n     fuel, with as many as 45 more to come if deemed necessary for \n     national security. The Andrus agreement requires the federal \n     government to do an EIS, but places no limit on the number of \n     shipments into Idaho once the document is completed. The \n     agreement requires that some liquid radioactive wastes be \n     dried up in a process called ``calcination.'' Some spent \n     nuclear fuel will be moved from one wet storage facility to \n     another--newer--on-site wet storage facility. The agreement \n     does not require any nuclear waste to leave the state.\n       January, 1995, Governor Batt takes office. As he is sworn \n     in there are already 261 metric tons of spent fuel in Idaho, \n     along with approximately 2 million gallons of liquid \n     radioactive wastes and over 120,000 cubic meters of \n     transuranic wastes in Idaho.\n       That same month, the U.S. Navy notifies Governor Batt that \n     in accordance with the Andrus agreement, they need to make 8 \n     more shipments of spent fuel. Governor Batt honors the \n     legally binding commitment Andrus made. Batt also learns for \n     the first time that under the Andrus agreement, Idaho is \n     likely to receive thousands of shipments of nuclear waste \n     with no requirement that the material ever leave the state.\n     \n[[Page S18898]]\n\n       Feb. 1995, after finding no location in the United States \n     willing to accept a Monitored Retrivable Storage facility for \n     spent nuclear fuel, the Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator is \n     abolished. Former Idaho Congressman Richard Stallings \n     (Democrat) is the program's second and last administrator.\n       In March, Governor Batt establishes points to guide the \n     state on the nuclear issue:\n       1. We will oppose the shipment of nuclear waste material to \n     Idaho until we receive an absolute assurance that the \n     material will ultimately be moved outside our state.\n       2. We will insist on a proper clean-up of existing storage \n     problems.\n       3. We will seek attractive projects that will create new \n     employment opportunities at INEL.\n       In May, Governor Batt starts legal action to stop the \n     shipments.\n       June 1, Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary announces the \n     Record of Decision on the EIS. It targets 1,940 shipments \n     (165 metric tons) of spent nuclear fuel and 690 to 2,300 \n     shipments (6,000-20,000 cubic meters) of transuranic waste to \n     be shipped to Idaho with no requirement that it ever leave.\n       October 17, 1995. Governor Batt announces he has reached an \n     historic agreement to get nuclear waste out of the state. \n     U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge Incorporates the settlement \n     into a federal court order. Idaho becomes the only state in \n     the nation with a court order that requires the federal \n     government to remove nearly all nuclear wastes from a \n     specific state. Under the new legally binding agreement, all \n     liquid radioactive wastes will now be dried up and all spent \n     fuel removed from water storage into dry storage, enhancing \n     the protection of the aquifer. Shipments of spent fuel into \n     Idaho are reduced by 42 percent. Transuranic waste will only \n     be allowed in if it is treated and removed from Idaho within \n     six months. The Navy and DOE are limited to, on average, 20 \n     shipments each per year into Idaho providing the state \n     leverage to ensure cleanup takes place. Total value of the \n     agreement is estimated at nearly $800 million over the next \n     ten years. Approximately 10,800 shipments of spent nuclear \n     fuel and transuranic wastes are now required by a federal \n     court order to leave Idaho. First shipments out of Idaho will \n     begin no later than 1999. The last shipments will leave Idaho \n     by 2035.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the hard \nwork of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I believe that \nthe bill makes significant strides in correcting glaring shortfalls of \nthe administration's defense policies.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side have attacked both the \nDefense appropriations bill, crafted by my friends and colleagues on \nthe Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations chaired by the senior \nSenator from Alaska, and this bill on the grounds that they include \nitems not requested by the Nation's military leaders in the President's \nrequest. Well, they are correct. But, why didn't they request these \nitems? He wouldn't let them, because he artificially constrained their \nrequest by cutting their budget dramatically and some say recklessly, \nat the same time that he has increased their mission requirements. Left \nwith increased responsibilities and fewer dollars to accomplish them, \nthe military leaders were forced to make deep procurement cuts. They \nwon't complain lest they be viewed as disloyal. They salute and do the \nbest they can. Well, I for one do not believe that those who put their \nlives on the line must be forced to just make do.\n  We in the Senate, have done much to insure that or marines, soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen will be provided the best equipment and in \nquantities which will provide them more than merely adequate \nprotection. I fully agree with the senior Senator from Hawaii and take \nthe liberty of paraphrasing him when I say, ``I never want our troops \nto be in a fair fight. They should always be overwhelmingly superior.''\n  I have reservations about some of the provisions in this bill, and I \nwish it more closely reflected the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations \nbill, but I will support it, for it is in the right direction.\n  One other concern I have with this bill is a section that was not \nfully considered by the Senate which makes significant changes in the \nway the Federal Government procures goods and services. I had the \nopportunity to work with my colleagues on conference committee, and \nthis new section on Federal acquisition reform has been modified and \nimproved in many areas. In spite of changes, I am concerned about the \nimpact these new provisions will have on small businesses seeking to do \nbusiness with Federal agencies.\n  I am pleased the Senate prevailed in its consideration of the House \nprovision to amend the Competition in Contracting Act requirement for \n``full and open competition.'' This section was limited, at my urging, \nto a revision of the FAR to insure that competition is consistent with \na need ``to efficiently fulfill the Government's requirements.'' The \nchange in CICA was dropped.\n  In addition, I supported a delay in the Cooperative Purchasing \nProgram that was included in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act \n[FASA] which we adopted last year. The Cooperative Purchasing Program \nwould allow State and local governments and certain nonprofit groups to \npurchase items carried on the Federal supply schedule. At the same time \nwe passed FASA, we did not analyze the impact this new provision would \nhave on small businesses. I successfully sought a moratorium of 18 \nmonths on implementation of this program to allow GAO the opportunity \nto review the impact of the program.\n  As this new law is being implemented, we cannot lose sight of the \npositive impact that full and open competition has had on our Federal \nprocurement system. I am the first to agree with the premise that the \ncurrent system is flawed and can be improved. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business I intend to monitor closely the impact this \nnew law will have on the small business community, and make suggestions \nas to how their interests can be protected in the future.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before making remarks about the pending \nconference report, I want to commend the chairman, Senator Thurmond, \nand the members of the Armed Services Committee for their efforts to \nhammer out this conference agreement. There were over 1,000 items in \ndisagreement, which presented the conferees with a daunting task. \nDespite the obstacles, Senator Thurmond and our colleagues on the \ncommittee have crafted a strong bill.\n  It is important that everyone understands the issue before us. This \nbill is a serious effort to ensure that the men and women of our Armed \nForces remain the best-trained and best-equipped force in the world. \nThis conference agreement contains a number of provisions which enhance \nthe quality of life of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. It ensures \nforce readiness. And, to protect the readiness of tomorrow's forces, it \nbegins to restore the procurement and research and development accounts \nthat have suffered from years of cuts.\n  Let me add, that with the ongoing deployment of U.S. forces to \nBosnia, this bill takes on increased importance. The men and women who \nhave been ordered to Bosnia are brave Americans who have volunteered to \nserve their country. They are answering their Nation's call. The least \nwe can do for them is to support the initiatives in this bill that will \ndirectly impact them as they embark on this mission.\n  There are a number of significant provisions in the bill which will \nimprove the quality of life of the members of our Armed Forces. The \nlegislation authorizes a 2.4-percent pay raise and a 5.2-percent \nincrease in allowance for quarters. In addition, it authorizes an \nIncome Insurance Program for involuntarily mobilized reservists and \nestablishes a reserve component dental insurance program. These \nprovisions will enhance the readiness of our Reserve component forces--\nforces that also are mobilizing for deployment to Bosnia.\n  Additionally, the bill authorizes a new military housing \nprivatization initiative. This initiative, which was requested by the \nadministration, will allow the Department of Defense to utilize new \napproaches to reduce the family housing backlog. To further enhance the \nquality of life of our troops, the agreement increases military \nconstruction funding by $480 million.\n  In order to ensure the readiness of our forces, the conferees added \nover $1 billion to the operations and maintenance accounts. To further \nprotect the readiness accounts, the conferees also provided $647 \nmillion for ongoing operations in northern and southern Iraq.\n  The conferees, understanding the importance of preserving long-term \nreadiness, also authorized significant increases in the procurement and \nR accounts. They took steps to ensure that the United States \nmaintains its technological edge over any potential enemy, and that our \nsmaller force becomes a more capable force. The B-2 \n\n[[Page S18899]]\nbomber is just one example. The conferees repealed the previous \nrestrictions on procurement of long-lead items for the B-2 program and \nthe standing cap on the number of bombers produced. They also added \n$493 million for B-2 procurement. The B-2 represents this Congress' \nrenewed effort to preserve a strong American defense.\n  Finally, in an effort to assist communities affected by base \nclosures, the conferees attempted to improve the process for disposal \nof property and included authorization for important projects such as \nthe conversion of Joliet Arsenal to the Midewin National Tallgrass \nPrairie. Under the plan, this former Army facility will provide the \nJoliet community with the increased economic opportunity, while \nallowing for the establishment of a premier conservation and recreation \narea in the most populous region in the Midwest. I was pleased to \nassist in including this important provision and look forward to seeing \nits successful implementation.\n  With this bill the Republican-led Congress has met its responsibility \nto provide our forces with the most modern equipment available, \nensuring their overwhelming superiority on the battlefield. We have \ntaken steps to ensure that our forces, though smaller, maintain the \nability to project power around the world--quickly and decisively. We \nhave taken the lead in protecting both our deployed forces and our home \nland against ballistic missile attack.\n  The President and many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle oppose this bill. But the choice is clear. A vote for this bill \nis a vote to restore our national defense, and a vote to support the \nAmerican men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. A vote against \nit, is a vote to continue down the path to a hollow force.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes, 36 seconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, who is a \nreal defense expert, having been involved in defense appropriations for \nquite a while, made a point this morning that I had been making about \nthis bill that I think bears repeating, and that is he said there are \nfar too many reports and certifications. And one example he gave was a \ndelay of all defensewide research funds until 14 days after a report is \nreceived. That includes even the BMD program which so many people here \nare concerned about.\n  Mr. President, this report can be made, but it is a 14-day \ninterruption. This is the kind of thing that drives defense management \ncrazy because this interrupts ongoing defense research contracts. So \nthis is just one example of what I call micromanagement that is all the \nway through this bill.\n  Mr. President, as we close this debate, I wish to summarize the \nreasons why I am voting against the defense authorization conference \nreport for the first time since I have been in the Senate, including 6 \nyears that I have served in the minority. While there are a number of \nprovisions I support, and I enumerated those this morning, the \nconference report contains many fundamental flaws that are contrary to \nthe best interests of sound management of our national defense \nactivities as well as the U.S. taxpayers.\n  On balance, Mr. President, this bill's bad policy outweighs its good \npolicy. I am particularly troubled by the bill's numerous provisions \nwhich are simply what I would call bad government. These include \nelimination of the independent oversight position of Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation. This position was established in 1983 \nunder an initiative from Senator Roth, Senator Grassley, and Senator \nPryor to ensure the testing of major weapons systems would be evaluated \nby an office independent of those developing and managing the weapons \nprograms.\n  Senator Pryor has spoken on this subject, and I had expected Senator \nGrassley and Senator Roth to speak on the subject, but I am sure this \nis of some concern to them.\n  It not only abolishes the position, but it repeals key protections \nfor the Director of the OTE.\n  Second, elimination of the key civilian oversight position for \nspecial operations. This was part of a comprehensive effort in 1986 by \nSenators such as Senator Cohen and myself to improve our special \noperations forces. The military commander of those forces was given \nauthority akin to a civilian service secretary, making the Assistant \nSecretary even more important to civilian control, and this position is \neliminated in this bill.\n  Third, the unseemly and I think unnecessary rush to sell the Naval \nPetroleum Reserve in 1 year, which the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates could cost the taxpayers up to $1 billion. Because of the CBO \nreservations, the reconciliation bill dropped this provision \naltogether, yet this conference report still mandates the sale within a \nyear, and one company has a potential inside track, according to all \nthe information I have received. This lessens the competitive climate \nand could cost the taxpayers a lot of money.\n  Fourth, the inclusion of numerous ``buy American'' protectionism \nprovisions where there is no showing of a critical domestic industrial \nbase need. The conference agreement does not add just one ``buy \nAmerican'' provision; it adds over eight. It also makes existing ``buy \nAmerican'' provisions more onerous and undermines some of the key goals \nof last year's Acquisition Streamlining Act. And I repeat what I said \nthis morning, Mr. President. Our advantage in defense exports is a \nsignificant part of our trade picture. We have an advantage here. It is \nvery strange that we would be inserting ``buy American'' provisions in \nthis bill in large number when that is likely, very likely to end up \nhurting our own export capabilities. I find it strange that the \nRepublican majority of the House and Senate, committed to free trade \nand market competition, would inject the most sweeping ``buy American'' \nprovisions we have had in a defense bill in many years.\n  Fifth, a prohibition on purchasing foreign vessels to convert the \nremaining five sealift ships. All conversion is currently done in U.S. \nyards but this provision would mean an expenditure of $1 billion to \n$1.5 billion for new ships versus the $350 million for conversion of \nexisting ships. This provision is a sweetheart deal for certain \ndomestic shipbuilders.\n  Sixth, nonmerit, noncompetitive earmarkings. Through the bill are \nnumerous legislative and report language earmarkings for specific \ncontracts to specific contractors.\n  We worked very hard over the years in the authorization committee to \navoid this approach because there is too great a danger that awards \nunder such a system could be based on political and parochial \nconsiderations rather than the best interests of national defense. \nThese earmarks are costly to the taxpayers because they freeze out \ncompetition, and they are bad for defense capabilities because they are \nnot based on merit or quality.\n  Seventh, the shipbuilding provisions contain numerous provisions that \ncan only be labeled sweetheart deals for specific shipbuilders. A very \ninnovative Senate concept developed by Senator Lott and Senator Cohen \nwas broadened in conference into a shipbuilding grab bag with something \nfor everyone. This includes directed procurement of roll-on/roll-off \nships at specific shipyards, directed procurement of six destroyers at \nspecific shipyards and directed use of a ship maintenance contract at a \nspecific shipyard.\n  Mr. President, while we are trying to reduce the budget, I find it \nvery ironic and sad that we are restricting competition; we are \nbasically making every effort in this bill to assign certain ships to \ncertain places without competition, which is the most expensive \npossible way you can build these ships and repair the ships.\n  Eighth the conference committee includes submarine research and \ndevelopment language that ignores the crucial tradeoff in very high \ntechnology, cutting-edge technology, which is what submarines really \ninvolve. The tradeoff, the critical tradeoff is between cost and risk. \nThere simply is no accounting for risk in this provision.\n  Ninth, the Guard and Reserve equipment. The bill that came out of \nconference in this area is worse than either one that went in. This is \nbecause all of the additional funds for Guard and Reserve equipment are \ndesignated for specific programs, thus eliminating any kind of real \nweighing or \n\n[[Page S18900]]\nprioritization within the Department of Defense. The appropriations \nbill which took a generic approach and put the money in a broad account \nfor the determination of the Secretary of Defense and others familiar \nwith the procurement system is a much better approach.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my detailed listing of \nprovisions here as well as information from the Secretary of Defense \nand the administration with their objections be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga), Ranking Member of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, today released the following statement:\n       I congratulate Senator Thurmond upon the completion of the \n     House-Senate conference on the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1996. Senator Thurmond has shown great \n     patience and endurance through a long and difficult \n     negotiation with the House.\n       Out of respect for Senator Thurmond, particularly in his \n     first year as chairman, I have signed the conference report. \n     This will give the Senate the opportunity to consider the \n     report. I want to make it clear, however, that I have serious \n     reservations about the conference report, and I plan to vote \n     against the report when it is considered by the Senate.\n       During the conference, the Administration raised a number \n     of important objections to the bill:\n       The Administration identified constitutional problems with \n     the restrictions on the President's foreign policy and \n     Commander-in-Chief powers imposed by the provisions on \n     contingency funding and UN Command and Control.\n       The Administration also raised serious objections to the \n     ballistic missile defense legislation, which contains \n     National Missile Defense language that goes well beyond the \n     mandates of both the House-passed and Senate-passed bills.\n       The Administration has expressed serious concerns about the \n     impact of the proposed conference report language on Russian \n     consideration of the START II Treaty, which is designed to \n     produce a major reduction in Russian nuclear weapons.\n       The Administration is also concerned that the language \n     could lead the Russians to abandon other arms control \n     agreements if they conclude that it is U.S. policy to take \n     unilateral action to abandon the ABM Treaty.\n       I have serious reservations about these provisions and \n     numerous other provisions of the conference report, \n     including:\n       Legislation that would abolish the statutory requirement \n     for an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations \n     and Low Intensity Conflict, which could undermine civilian \n     oversight of special operations.\n       Legislation that would abolish the statutory requirement \n     for an independent Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation, which could undermine unbiased testing of major \n     weapons systems.\n       The Naval Petroleum Reserve Sale provision, which unwisely \n     establishes a one-year time frame for the sale, even through \n     the budget reconciliation bill no longer mandates sale within \n     a year. The one year period is insufficient to ensure that \n     the taxpayers get the maximum value though knowledgeable \n     competitive bidding.\n       Directed procurement of specific ships at specific \n     shipyards without a clear industrial base requirement, which \n     undermines the cost-saving potential of competition.\n       Buy American provisions for ships and naval equipment which \n     will result in enormous cost increases for naval vessels and \n     which could produce an unfavorable reaction against U.S. \n     military sales abroad--one of the strongest elements of our \n     export economy.\n       Mandated spending ``floors'' in the shipbuilding language--\n     requirements to spend specified amounts for particular \n     programs--which directly contravene the longstanding \n     agreement between the Armed Services and Appropriations \n     Committees to not place ``floors'' in the Authorization bill.\n       An earmarked non-competitive ship maintenance contract for \n     a specific shipyard.\n       Creation of a special congressional panel on submarines, \n     which needlessly duplicates the oversight role of the Armed \n     Services Committee.\n       Failure to include Senate-passed provisions which should \n     have been non-controversial, such as U.S.-Israeli Strategic \n     Cooperation, the Defense Business Management University, and \n     a North Dakota land conveyance that meets all of the Senate's \n     objective criteria.\n       Weakening the Senate-passed formula for equity in cost-of-\n     living adjustments for military retirees.\n       Designating every single line of National Guard and Reserve \n     procurement funds, rather than providing generic categories \n     that can be used by the Department of Defense to meet \n     priority Guard and Reserve requirements.\n       Earmarking Department of Energy defense funds for numerous \n     unrequested projects and programs at designated sites.\n       Restrictions on access of servicewomen and dependents \n     overseas to privately-funded abortions, and the imposition of \n     special discharge procedures for HIV-positive \n     servicemembers--a small fraction of our military population--\n     which needlessly inject domestic political issues into \n     military manpower policies.\n       I recognize that the Senate could not prevail on all \n     issues. There are many other compromises within the \n     conference report which I do not particularly support but \n     which I understand in the context of the give and take of \n     conference. The issues I have raised in this statement, \n     however, represent fundamental flaws in the conference \n     agreement.\n       If the conference report is not approved by the Senate, or \n     if the legislation is vetoed by the President, we will have \n     an opportunity to correct these flaws. The conference report \n     contains important legislative authorities, such as:\n       A variety of military pay and allowance provisions.\n       Approval of Secretary Perry's family and troop housing \n     initiative.\n       Detailed acquisition reform legislation that complements \n     last year's Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act.\n       Senator Thurmond and the Committee worked long and hard to \n     develop these important provisions, and I pledge to work \n     towards their enactment in a subsequent bill if the \n     legislation in this conference report is not enacted into \n     law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I would like to convey my assessment of \n     the conference on the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1996 (H.R. 1530). The bill in its current form \n     continues to contain objectionable provisions that raise \n     serious constitutional issues and unduly restricts our \n     ability to execute our national security and foreign policy \n     responsibilities.\n       The bill would require deployment by 2003 of a costly \n     missile defense system to defend the U.S. from a long-range \n     missile threat which the Intelligence Community does not \n     believe will ever materialize in the coming decade. By \n     forcing an unwarranted and unnecessary NMD deployment \n     decision now, the bill would needlessly incur tens of \n     billions of dollars in missile defense costs and force the \n     Department of Defense prematurely to lock into a specific \n     technological option. In addition, by directing that the NMD \n     be ``operationally effective'' in defending all 50 states \n     (including Hawaii and Alaska), the bill would likely require \n     a multiple-site NMD architecture that cannot be accommodated \n     within the terms of the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting \n     U.S. policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty, the \n     bill puts at risk continued Russian implementation of the \n     START I Treaty and Russian ratification of START II, two \n     treaties which together will reduce the number of U.S. and \n     Russian strategic nuclear warheads by two-thirds from Cold \n     War levels, significantly lowering the threat to U.S. \n     national security.\n       The bill also imposes restrictions on the President's \n     ability to conduct contingency operations that are essential \n     to the national interest. The restrictions on funding to \n     commence a contingency operation and the requirement to \n     submit a supplemental request within a certain time period to \n     continue an operation are unwarranted restrictions on the \n     authority of the President. Moreover, by requiring a \n     Presidential certification to assign U.S. Armed Forces under \n     United Nations (UN) operational or tactical control, the bill \n     infringes on the President's constitutional authority.\n       In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about \n     the following: onerous certification requirements for the use \n     of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds, as well as \n     subcaps on specified activities and elimination of funding \n     for the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrictions on the \n     Technology Reinvestment Program; restrictions on retirement \n     of U.S. strategic delivery systems; restrictions on the \n     Department of Defense's ability to execute disaster relief, \n     demining, and military-to-military contact programs; directed \n     procurement of specific ships at specific shipyards without a \n     valid industrial base rationale; restrictions on my ability \n     to manage the Department of Defense effectively, including \n     the abolition of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \n     Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the \n     Director of Operational Test and Evaluation.\n       We will weigh heavily the actions of the Congress on these \n     matters in advising the President whether to veto the Defense \n     authorization bill that is ultimately presented to him. This \n     letter outlines many, but not all of the concerns with the \n     legislation. I continue to be willing to work with the \n     Congress to develop an acceptable bill. In its current form, \n     however, I would have no recourse but to recommend a veto.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       If the Conference Report on H.R. 1530 were presented to the \n     President in its current form, the President would veto the \n     bill.\n       The Conference Report on H.R. 1530, filed on December 15, \n     1995, would restrict the Administration's ability to carry \n     out our national security objectives and implement key \n     Administration programs. Certain provisions also raise \n     serious constitutional issues \n\n[[Page S18901]]\n     by restricting the President's powers as Commander-in-Chief and foreign \n     policy powers.\n       The bill would require deployment by 2003 of a costly \n     missile defense system to defend the U.S. from a long-range \n     missile threat which the Intelligence Community does not \n     believe will ever materialize in the coming decade. By \n     forcing an unwarranted and unnecessary National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) deployment decision now, the bill would \n     needlessly incur tens of billions of dollars in missile \n     defense costs and force the Department of Defense (DOD) \n     prematurely to lock into a specific technological option. In \n     addition, by directing that the NMD be ``operationally \n     effective'' in defending all 50 states (including Hawaii and \n     Alaska), the bill would likely require a multiple-site NMD \n     architecture that cannot be accommodated within the terms of \n     the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting U.S. policy on a \n     collision course with the ABM Treaty, the bill puts at risk \n     continued Russian implementation of the START I Treaty and \n     Russian ratification of START II, two treaties which together \n     will reduce the number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear \n     warheads by two-thirds from Cold War levels, significantly \n     lowering the threat to U.S. national security.\n       The bill also imposes restrictions on the President's \n     ability to conduct contingency operations that are essential \n     to the national interest. The restrictions on funding to \n     commence a contingency operation and the requirement to \n     submit a supplemental request within a certain time period to \n     continue an operation are unwarranted restrictions on the \n     authority of the President. Moreover, by requiring a \n     Presidential certification to assign U.S. Armed Forces under \n     United Nations (UN) operational or tactical control, the bill \n     infringes on the President's constitutional authority.\n       In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about \n     the following: onerous certification requirements for the use \n     of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds, as well as \n     subcaps on specified activities and elimination of funding \n     for the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrictions on the \n     Technology Reinvestment Program, restrictions on retirement \n     of U.S. strategic delivery systems; restrictions on DOD's \n     ability to execute disaster relief, demining, and military-\n     to-military contact programs; directed procurement of \n     specific ships at specific shipyards without a valid \n     industrial base rationale; provisions requiring the discharge \n     of military personnel who are HIV-positive; restrictions on \n     the ability of the Secretary of Defense to manage DOD \n     effectively, including the abolition of the Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity \n     Conflict and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation; \n     and finally the Administration continues to object to the \n     restrictions on the ability of female service members or \n     dependents from obtaining privately funded abortions in U.S. \n     military hospitals abroad.\n       While the bill is unacceptable to the Administration, there \n     are elements of the authorization bill which are beneficial \n     to the Department, including important changes in acquisition \n     law, new authorities to improve military housing, and \n     essential pay raises for military personnel. The \n     Administration calls on the Congress to correct the \n     unacceptable flaws in H.R. 1530 so that these beneficial \n     provisions may be enacted. The President especially calls on \n     the Congress to provide for pay raises and cost of living \n     adjustments for military personnel prior to departure for the \n     Christmas recess.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, in closing, I understand the give and take \nof a conference and that no bill is perfect. I have never seen a \nperfect bill on this floor, and I do not have that as my standard. \nHowever, this conference report goes far beyond that which can be \njustified in that give and take context.\n  I would further point out that a full defense appropriations bill \nincluding $7 billion more than the President requested has been signed \ninto law. I supported that bill. I spoke for it. I urged that the \nPresident not veto it. I urged that he approve it. So the money is not \nthe issue here with me.\n  I favored increasing the defense budget. We are not debating the \nfunding bill. We are debating an authorization bill and the issues of \nmatters of policy, very important matters of policy, not matters of the \nlevel of appropriations. I cannot vote for the bad policy embedded in \nthis conference report. If the bill is vetoed, as has been recommended \nby the Secretary of Defense, we will have an opportunity to correct the \nmany flaws and produce a bill that can be signed into law. There are \nother provisions which I enumerated this morning which I strongly \nsupport, and I will work certainly with Senator Thurmond in retaining \nthose and in making whatever corrections are required if this bill is \nvetoed by the President and if a veto is not overridden.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. This defense authorization bill is a sound bill and \nshould be enacted into law. I wish to thank the Senators and the staff \nmembers on both sides who helped to prepare and support this bill for \nthe great service they rendered to their country.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Senators will now have the \nopportunity to express their support for our military men and women by \nvoting to approve the conference agreement on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996.\n  As my colleagues prepare to vote on this agreement, I would ask them \nto make absolutely sure that they do so with the full knowledge that \nthis is a period of high risk and exceptional danger for our military. \nThe President has committed more than 30,000 uniformed men and women to \na hazardous and lengthy operation in the former Yugoslavia. The \nCongress must make every effort to ensure that nothing--absolutely \nnothing--is done to jeopardize or impede them in any way.\n  I find it impossible to understand how any Senator could vote against \na defense authorization bill when the President is ordering troops into \nharm's way. This bill contains many essential authorities for programs, \nsystems, acquisitions, administration, operations, and quality of life. \nI do not know how I could face my constituents if I voted against \ntaking care of the troops, who are on their way to Bosnia, for any of \nthe reasons I have heard offered by those who want to defeat this bill.\n  Mr. President, the fine men and women who now serve in our military \nare being asked, once again, to put their lives at risk in a foreign \nland. They do not have the option to refuse to go if they disagree with \nsome aspect of the operation. Many of us in the Senate continue to have \nserious doubts about this mission, yet, every member of the Senate has \ngone on record to support the troops unequivocally and to provide them \nwith all the necessary resources and support to carry out their mission \nand ensure their security. The Senate resolution in support of the \ntroops will ring hollow without the action to back them up. The \nauthority necessary to translate those words into real, tangible \nsupport, is contained in the conference agreement now before the \nSenate.\n  I am dismayed to see so many of my colleagues picking out some \nprovision in the report, and then stand here on the floor of the Senate \nto say that they cannot vote for the bill because they disagree with \nthe provision. There are 995 pages in the conference agreement this \nyear. It reconciles two of the most complex bills produced by the \nCongress. I would suggest to my colleagues that no bill meets \neveryone's expectations completely. Only gridlock could result from \nsuch an approach.\n  Mr. President, this is not the time to turn a defense bill into a \npolitical issue, as some have chosen to do. The only result of \npoliticizing this bill will be to disadvantage the Department of \nDefense and our troops at a time when they are focused on a major \ninternational operation. The House recognized this and approved the \nconference agreement on a vote of 267 to 149. It is important that my \ncolleagues and the administration clearly understand that every \nsoldier, sailor, airman and Marine will feel the effects if this \nagreement is not adopted.\n  We have heard objections from the minority that this bill adds $7 \nbillion that the President did not ask for. However, they have not \nmentioned that defense is now underfunded by at least $150 billion, \naccording to the General Accounting Office. The Comptroller of the \nDepartment of Defense, John Hamre, testified before the Committee on \nArmed Services that defense is underfunded by at least $50 billion. Now \nwe are engaged in a major deployment when the resources of the \nDepartment of Defense will be stretched even more. After having \ndramatically underfunded defense, reducing the Armed Forces, and at the \nsame time requiring the military to perform at an operations tempo \nhigher than during the Cold War for missions in Somalia and Haiti, the \nPresident is again deploying troops. How can there be any objection to \nadditional funds?\n  One of the most important parts of this agreement is a provision that \nadjusts the automatic level at which \n\n[[Page S18902]]\nservice members can enroll in the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance \nprogram to $200,000. Ironically, we need to make an adjustment to SGLI \nagain as we are deploying U.S. Forces in harm's way; the last time we \ndid this was prior to the Persian Gulf war. I sincerely hope that no \nfamily will lose a loved one and therefore need to receive this \nincreased benefit. However, the President has told us to expect \ncasualties in Bosnia, and this protection will not take effect unless \nthis bill is enacted.\n  The Committee on Armed Services concentrated on improving the quality \nof life for our military personnel and their families. We did not do \nthis because our forces would deploy to Bosnia, but because there was a \nneed. The list of initiatives in this area reflects a high degree of \nsuccess. However, none of these improvements will occur unless this \nagreement is enacted.\n  We authorized a 2.4-percent pay raise and a 5.2-percent increase in \nthe basic allowance for quarters effective January 1, 1996. We also \nattempted to repair a breach of faith with our military retirees by \nrestoring the military retirement COLA dates to the same schedule as \nFederal civilian retirees. If the authorization is not approved, \nmilitary retirees will continue to be treated unfairly, and military \npersonnel will be denied the full pay raise and increase in the \nquarters allowance.\n  We included a provision that permits military families to use CHAMPUS \nfor well-baby care, routine immunizations, and school physicals. The \nadministration talks about doing this, but military families will \ncontinue to do without, or pay for these services out of pocket, unless \nthis conference agreement is enacted.\n\n  I cannot understand how any Senator or the President could ask our \nservice members to go to Bosnia, leaving their families alone in \nGermany and other places far from their homes, while at the same time \ndenying them the pay raise, insurance coverage, allowances, and other \nquality of life improvements they deserve.\n  The bill contains the authority to reform the acquisition and \nprocurement processes in accordance with the general effort to \nstreamline Government. It also reforms the process for managing the \nprocurement of information technology in order to provide our front-\nline troops with the latest and best information about their situation. \nAll the acquisition reform provisions contained in sections D and E of \nthe bill will be lost if the conference agreement is not enacted.\n  Procurement funding has declined by 44 percent since 1992 and \nprocurement is at the lowest level as a percentage of the budget since \nthe years prior to the Second World War. This agreement takes a step \ntoward resolving that deficiency by authorizing items needed to fight \nand win decisively while minimizing the risk to our troops. It buys \nbasics, invests to achieve savings, and focuses on the future.\n  The conference agreement would also authorize funds for the \ncounterproliferation support program. The nerve gas attacks in Japan \nand the bombing in Oklahoma this year show the need to protect not only \nour military personnel but also our citizens within the United States \nagainst the use of weapons of mass destruction. The conference report \nrequires the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other \nappropriate Government agencies to report to Congress on their military \nand civil defense preparedness to respond to such emergencies. The \nconference report also authorizes DOD to provide assistance in the form \nof training facilities, sensors, protective clothing, antidotes, and \nother materials and expertise to Federal, State, or local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  The conference agreement authorizes funds for arms control to enable \nthe United States to meet its treaty obligations to destroy or \ndismantle chemical and strategic nuclear weapons and material. It also \nprovides $300 million for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram for the destruction of nuclear and chemical weapons in the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  On the question of theater missile defense demarcation, the \nconference outcome is virtually identical to the Senate-passed \nprovision. This should alleviate concerns about constraining the \nPresident's prerogatives in negotiations while fulfilling the \nconstitutional responsibility of Congress to review the results of \nthose negotiations. I believe we have addressed all the concerns of the \nadministration and the minority conferees on this issue.\n  I am very disturbed to hear that some are working to defeat or veto \nthe conference agreement over the ballistic missile defense provisions. \nThese provisions are balanced and fair. If this veto comes to pass, it \nwill become clear that the administration's arguments over the ABM \nTreaty were merely attempts to block the deployment of any type of \nnational missile defense system, to include one that complies with the \nABM Treaty. I find it hard to believe that the President would veto \nthis important bill simply to deny the American people a defense \nagainst ballistic missiles.\n  Many aspects of this bill are important not only to military men and \nwomen but to all our citizens. The section on Department of Energy \nNational Security Programs focuses resources on cleaning up the highest \npriority nuclear waste problems at the former nuclear materials \nproduction sites. It also funds the isolation and reduction of spent \nnuclear fuel rods, some of which are beginning to corrode. These \nproblems cannot be addressed in fiscal year 1996 unless the \nauthorization bill is enacted.\n  The agreement establishes uniform national discharge standards for \nvessels of the Armed Forces and directs the clean up of DOD \nenvironmental problem sites. These and other environmental initiatives \nwill be lost if the bill is not enacted.\n  President Clinton has urged our citizens and the Congress to support \nhis Bosnia intervention. I have listened to his arguments about world \nleadership and our role in the world. Our troops will bear the brunt of \nhis decision and they deserve to be supported, but their support will \nbe compromised without the defense authorization. I am dismayed that \nany Senator would consider voting against this legislation or attempt \nto use this bill for political purposes. Politics used to stop at the \nwater's edge, especially when our forces were deployed to a hostile \nfire area. I urge my colleagues and the administration to work toward \nthe enactment of this conference agreement and not to jeopardize, \ndisadvantage, or impede our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 35 seconds left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest we take 20 minutes to wait for \nSenator Daschle to get here from the White House.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate is waiting for our leaders to \nreturn from an important meeting with the President. I wish to address \nthe Senate on another matter. I will be glad to yield to the managers \nat the time they want to request the vote on the defense authorization. \nI appreciate their courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask to be able to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18856-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18902-S18904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ENCOURAGING A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

It says, \n``Without a Balanced Budget, the Party's Over, No Matter Which Party \nYou Are In.'' These corporate and business leaders urge that the \nCongress move ahead with the President and pass it at the earliest \npossible time. I want to read to the Senate a letter I just sent to \nthose who have signed this advertisement and point out the following \nreaction that I had to the letter itself:\n\n       Dear Sirs: I welcome and agree with the message in your \n     two-page advertisement in the New York Times and the \n     Washington Post this morning that America should live within \n     its means and achieve a balanced budget. The issue is not \n     whether we achieve a balanced budget, but how to do it in a \n     way that assures that the sacrifices as well as the benefits \n     of reaching a balanced budget are fairly shared among all \n     Americans. I hope you agree that equal sacrifice is the heart \n     of a fair balanced budget.\n       The original Republican budget plan was properly vetoed by \n     President Clinton last week, because it failed to meet this \n     test. It inflicted deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, \n     education, the environment, and other important national \n     priorities, and it included large tax breaks for wealthy \n     individuals and corporations. Half of all the spending cuts \n     in the Republican plan came from the bottom 20% of families \n     in America, while only 9% of the cuts came from the top 20% \n     of families in America. Two-thirds of the tax breaks in the \n     Republican plan go to this same top 20% of Americans, while \n     the bottom 20% would face a tax increase. The middle 60% of \n     Americans would also be hit unfairly. They would lose an \n     average of $600 each because of the spending cuts, and get \n     back only a third of that amount in tax reductions. These are \n     conservative distributional estimates, and they plainly \n     demonstrate the unequal sacrifices and unequal benefits \n     contained in the Republican plan.\n       You say that every form of spending should be on the table, \n     ``including long term entitlement programs.'' I agree. By the \n     year 2002 the largest of all entitlement programs will be the \n     tax entitlements. Between now and the year 2002, the federal \n     government will spend over $4 trillion in tax loopholes and \n     tax preferences which go disproportionately to wealthy \n     individuals and corporations. In 2002, these tax entitlements \n     will represent a large share of the budget than Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or any of the other entitlement \n     programs. But so far, out of the $4 trillion of tax \n     entitlements, the Republicans are willing to cut only $16 \n     billion.\n       Surely, if elderly couples depending on Medicare and having \n     an average income of less than $17,000 a year would be \n     required by the Republican plan to pay an additional $2,500 \n     in Medicare premiums to balance the budget over the next \n     seven years, corporations can be asked to contribute their \n     fair share. If four million children would lose their health \n     care and five million senior citizens and disabled Americans \n     would lose their Medicaid protection to balance the budget, \n     corporations can be asked to bear their fair share. Surely, \n     if education funding would be cut by 30% and millions of \n     college students would have the cost of their student loans \n     increased to a point where they may no longer be able to \n     afford college, corporations can be asked to bear their fair \n     share.\n       If you are truly interested in balancing the budget, I hope \n     you will agree that corporations should bear their fair share \n     of the cuts, along with working Americans, senior citizens, \n     children, and students.\n       I make the following proposal. The Republican plan would \n     provide a reduction of 17% in the Federal budget over the \n     next seven years, exclusive of defense spending and Social \n     Security. Reducing the $4 trillion in tax subsidies by 17% \n     would achieve savings of $680 billion. If we applied the 17% \n     reduction to only one-quarter of the tax expenditures, we \n     would save $170 billion--more than enough to provide the \n     additional savings needed in the current impasse to balance \n     the budget fairly in seven years. Surely it makes sense to \n     reduce corporate subsidies by a similar percentage as \n     programs that benefit working Americans and the poor are \n     being cut.\n       Or, a number of specific corporate loopholes that are \n     contrary to sensible national policy could be eliminated \n     entirely to achieve the needed savings. It would make sense \n     under this approach to focus specifically on tax subsidies \n     that have the direct or indirect affect of encouraging \n     American businesses to move transactions and jobs overseas. \n     It is particularly offensive, at a time when large numbers of \n     American workers are losing their jobs and being dislocated \n     by changes in the economy, that the tax code is subsidizing \n     corporations to move transactions and job overseas.\n       I urge you to appoint a task force of CEOs to put together \n     a proposal by which tax entitlements would bear their fair \n     share of needed budget reductions. I am ready to meet with \n     this task force at any time to discuss your proposals. If you \n     took this step, the balanced budget which we all support \n     would be within our grasp almost immediately. Most \n     importantly, the balanced budget would be achieved with equal \n     sacrifice from all Americans, without destructive cuts to \n     Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment.\n       I look forward to hearing from you that you are prepared to \n     bear your share of the sacrifice in the name of fairness as \n     we put America on a course of living within its means.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Edward M. Kennedy.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two-page \nadvertisement be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, December 19, 1995]\n\n   A Bipartisan Appeal from Business Leaders to the President of the \n    United States Bill Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate \n  Majority Leader Bob Dole, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, House \n Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and \n                        All Members of Congress\n\n       Without a balanced budget, the party's over. No matter \n     which party you're in.\n       There are moments in history when a single choice can mean \n     the difference between vastly differing futures--one bright, \n     the other dark. We believe that you, the political leaders of \n     this country, are now confronting such a choice in your \n     deliberations over a plan to balance the federal budget.\n       We are convinced that the health of our economy rests on \n     your ability to avoid political gridlock and give the \n     American people what leaders of both parties say they favor \n     and, indeed, have agreed to--a credible plan to balance the \n     budget. By ``credible'' we mean that such a plan should:\n       Use realistic projections that assume the fiscal and \n     economic scenario developed by the Congressional Budget \n     Office and reviewed by objective third parties:\n       Take no longer than seven years as the maximum time period \n     by which a balanced budget would be achieved;\n       Ensure that the process of deficit reduction is achieved in \n     roughly equal steps throughout these seven years, rather than \n     ``backloading'' the politically difficult decisions into the \n     next century; and\n       Have everything on the table, including long-term \n     entitlement programs as well as the size and shape of any tax \n     cuts.\n       Included among us are Democrats and Republicans, Liberals \n     and Conservatives. What unites us in this appeal is our \n     common concern for America's future.\n       All of us are leaders of institutions keenly sensitive to \n     interest rates and the short- and long-term outlook for the \n     U.S. economy. We believe that the recent decline in long-term \n     interest rates and much of the boom in the stock market is \n     directly predicated on the financial markets' expectation \n     that a successful bipartisan budget-balancing compromise will \n     be reached quickly, and that a credible long-term plan will \n     be put in place in short order.\n       Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently \n     observed: ``If there is a shattering of expectations that \n     leads to the conclusion that there is indeed an inability to \n     ultimately redress the corrosive forces of deficit, I think \n     the reaction would be quite negative--that is, a sharp \n     increase in long-term interest rates . . . I think we would \n     find that with mortgage rates higher and other related rates \n     moving up, interest-sensitive areas of the economy would \n     begin to run into trouble.''\n       As you continue your negotiations, we ask you to reflect on \n     the full consequences of success or failure. However \n     Americans ultimately resolve our honest and principled \n     disagreements over the size and scope of government, America \n     must begin to live within its means.\n       The time for good economics as well as good politics is \n     NOW.\n       America is waiting.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Paul Allaire,\n                              Chairman and CEO, Xerox Corporation.\n     Richard H.

It is one that we all should be mindful of, and I hope that \nour friends that were signatories to that proposal would also feel that \nin a sense of fairness and equity, they, too, would like to do their \npart. We invite them to be a part of the solution to this challenge \nthat we are all facing at this time so that what is eventually \nproposed, which hopefully will have bipartisan support, will be able to \nbe looked on as being fair to all Americans. It is in that spirit that \nthese remarks are made.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER.

I think we can work it out because we have already passed \nthose priorities once, talking about veterans, Medicare, agriculture. \nThere are I think six or seven. So let us see what we can do, or if the \nminority would like to propose an amendment, we could modify it. I \nthink there are some who would like to speak even though there has been \nobjection, if that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Sure.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate to my colleagues who are in the Chamber and \nthose who may be in their offices that we have had, as I have said \nearlier, a very constructive discussion with the President and Vice \nPresident and Chief of Staff with reference to achieving a balanced \nbudget over the next 7 years. There will be a meeting going on tonight \nwith Mr. Panetta, Senator Domenici, Congressman Kasich, and others, and \nthen, depending on what happens in that agreement, there may be another \nagreement of the principals either tomorrow morning or early afternoon, \ndepending on everyone's schedule.\n  I think it is fair to say that at least I am optimistic about getting \nsomething done here that will satisfy a great majority of Americans and \nprobably most people on both sides of the aisle--not everyone but most \nof my colleagues on each side of the aisle. There are certainly areas \nof difference, and we will not go into those at this time, but I think \nthere was an agreement that there are at least five or six or seven \ncategories where the leaders are going to have to be directly involved \nand the President is going to be directly involved, and he has agreed \nto be directly involved.\n  We hope to give you more detailed information as soon as it is \navailable and as soon as we have something that we can really say this \nis it; we are serious; we are going to go to work; we are going to stay \nhere today, tomorrow, whatever. It is our hope--and we have not worked \nout the schedule because I know some have some difficulties with it, \nbut hopefully if we have, if we put it together tomorrow morning, then \nthere will be a CR passed that would extend at least until December 27 \nor December 28 and perhaps an adjournment resolution to extend from \nthis Friday until December 27.\n  We have not worked out those details. But in any event, I think the \nimportant point I should make is that I really believe we are going to \nstart the process.\n  Now, will we finish the process and when will we finish the process? \nWe would like to say we could put together the framework this year, by \nthe end of the year, and then take some days for drafting, come back a \ncouple days in January and finish the product. Some would like to do it \nall before New Year's Eve. I am not certain that is possible. But in \nany event, I think there is reason for optimism, bipartisan optimism \nand I hope it continues.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I share the views expressed by the majority leader. I \nthink there is reason for optimism tonight. I think the meetings held \nat the White House have been very productive. The President has \ncommitted to become personally involved in these negotiations. With a \ngood-faith effort on both sides, there is renewed hope that we can \nreach an agreement. As the majority leader said, I do not know that \nthere is any timeframe within which we can realistically reach that \nagreement tonight. We certainly know that these are difficult issues.\n  We agreed to reach an agreement in three areas. First, on the \ncontinuing resolution; second, on the schedule; and third, on the \nframework within which these negotiations would take place.\n  Leon Panetta will be talking with our Budget Committee people on both \nsides to discuss all three of those and hopefully reach an agreement \nsometime tomorrow, which then would allow us to go to our caucuses to \ndiscuss in detail what that agreement may entail. But there is no \nagreement tonight. There is simply an agreement to work out in three \nareas what that agreement might look like. If we can reach that \ntomorrow morning, I hope our caucuses could be informed and we will \nbegin to go to work. But I again share the optimism expressed by the \nmajority leader, and hopefully it will lead to even more optimistic \ndevelopments in the days ahead. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  \n[[Page S18906]]\n\n\n                      PAYMENT OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are now in the fourth day of \nanother Government shutdown.\n  I do not know how many more days it is going to go on. I hope there \nis some reason for optimism. But I want to point out, once again, as I \nhave with the Senator from California, that over 200,000 Federal \nemployees are not at work and, as a matter of fact, no Federal \nemployees are getting paid for these 4 days. Right before the holiday \nseason, right before Christmas, Federal workers all over this country \nare unsure of just how much money they are going to be paid or when \nthey are going to be paid.\n  This is grossly unfair, Mr. President, grossly unfair that Congress \nwould act so cavalierly toward decent, hard-working people. I know it \nis fun to point fingers at bureaucrats and that type of thing, but just \nkeep in mind, many of those Federal workers who are now not being paid \nare the same Federal workers, or the same type of Federal workers, who \nwere killed in the Oklahoma City bomb blast--our hearts went out to \nthem--people doing their job, working for their country, doing the best \nthey can to make sure our Government operates fairly and justly and in \nthe best interest of our people. And yet now, right before Christmas, \nthey are told, ``We don't know if we can pay you.'' Some are told to go \nhome, not come to work. But what is so grossly unfair about this, Mr. \nPresident, is that Members of Congress who caused this whole thing are \ngetting paid. Senators continue to get paid. Members of the House \ncontinue to get paid.\n  Earlier this year, one of the first bills that we passed was the \nCongressional Accountability Act. As a matter of fact, here is the so-\ncalled Contract With America that Members of the House of \nRepresentatives put out. The first item in that Contract With America \nsays: ``It requires all laws that apply to the rest of the country also \napply equally to Congress.''\n  That was the first bill we picked up this year, and we passed it. I \nhappen to have supported it. I thought it was long past time when \nMembers of Congress should be covered by the same laws that apply to \nthe people around the country. But the country found out during last \nmonth's partial Government shutdown that when it comes to paychecks, \nCongress gets special treatment. Congress is not covered by the same \nlaws as other Federal workers. They do not get their pay, but Congress \ncontinues to get its pay during periods of shutdown.\n  We have passed three times this year a no-budget/no-pay bill or \namendments that say if Congress shuts down, Members of Congress do not \nget paid or that we get treated exactly like the most adversely \naffected Federal worker.\n  It has been passed three times, but what happened? It just sort of \ngot lost when it went to conference. In fact, I am told that the no-\nbudget/no-pay amendment which was attached to the ICC bill was dropped \nin conference--just dropped in conference. It is still a part of the \nD.C. appropriations bill that is now languishing in the House. Let us \nsee if the House has the courage to live up to its own Contract With \nAmerica to make the laws that apply to Federal workers also apply to \nCongress, so that in periods of shutdown, Members of Congress will be \nhit in the pocketbook just as well as other Federal workers.\n\n  I have heard from my constituents. I know that people around the \ncountry have now been alerted to this, and they know we are getting \ntreated differently. What difference does it make to the Speaker of the \nHouse if the Government shuts down? He gets his paycheck. What \ndifference does it make to anyone in this body or the House? It does \nnot make any difference. If the Government shuts down, Congressmen and \nSenators still get their pay.\n  So for those of us in the Congress, we do not have to worry about \nmaking the house payment or the car payment or buying presents for the \nkids, because we know that paycheck is going to be there. But for over \n200,000 Federal workers, many of whom live in Virginia and Maryland, \nmany of whom live in my State of Iowa and across this land, they do not \nknow.\n  I saw an interview on television last night with some of these \nFederal workers. One after the other was saying, ``We just don't know \nwhat kind of Christmas it is going to be. We don't know whether to buy \npresents or not because we don't know when and if we are going to get \npaid, we don't know when and if we are going to go back to work.''\n  What a terrible thing to do to people. It is unconscionable that we \nwould allow this to happen. I, for one, think we should have gone on a \ncontinuing resolution until January or February, keep these people on \nthe job and let us work out this budget arrangement. Let the people go \nto work, but at least have enough decency and kindness and compassion \nthat Federal workers can at least enjoy their Christmas. That is, \nunless you just absolutely do not care about them. Maybe there are some \nwho do not care. But I care about them. I care very much about them, \nbecause they are doing a good job for our country in carrying out the \nmandates of Congress and this Government, and it is not right that we \ntreat them differently than we treat ourselves.\n  So we should have no exemptions for Congress, no special deals. We \nshould say that we are like the most adversely affected Federal worker. \nIf we have a Government shutdown, Members of Congress and the Senate \nshould not get their paycheck.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I will speak about it again tomorrow and every day \nthat the Government remains shut down, pointing out the unfairness of \nit. I just hope that the House of Representatives will finish their \nwork on the District of Columbia appropriations bill. We will see if \nthey have the guts to leave on the no-budget/no-pay amendment that was \nadopted in the Senate. Send it to conference and let us get it acted on \nonce and for all. I daresay, if Members of the House and the Senate \nwere treated like the most adversely affected Federal worker, I just \nwonder how many days we would shut down the Government. I bet the \nnumber would approach zero.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is time Members of the House and Senate \nbe treated just like other Federal workers. With that, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18905-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18906-S18907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS' BENEFITS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nputting together a letter to the President asking the President to do \nwhat we believe he has the right to do, and that is pay veterans' \nbenefits.\n  Obviously, all of us are going to continue to negotiate and work with \nour leaders and are negotiating to stop the shutdown of Government. \nBut, Mr. President, we do not have a whole lot of time before veterans' \nbenefits are going to be late or will not be there at all, and that is \nnot right. These are earned benefits.\n  We believe and we have gotten legal opinions that say that the \nPresident has the right to declare that veterans' benefits are \nessential. Who could question that veterans' benefits are an essential \npart of Government?\n  But, in fact, the Veterans Affairs bill that was passed by both \nbodies and sent to the President was vetoed in recent days. Now, once \nagain, we are faced with veterans' benefits not being paid. The \nPresident and his administration said during the last Government \nshutdown that veterans' benefits are not on the list, not on the \nessential list. We believe that is an erroneous assumption; that is an \nerroneous look at the regulation and the laws that are in place right \nnow. If anything is essential in this Government, it should be \nveterans' benefits. In fact, the President has declared that the people \nwho process the veterans' benefits are essential, but the benefits are \nnot. I would leave you to get the logic of that.\n  Mr. President, we have sent a letter to the President--Senators \nWarner, Simpson, Dole, and myself, along with 34 other cosigners of the \nletter--asking the President merely to do what we believe he has the \nright to do, and let veterans know just before the holiday season that \ntheir benefits will not be late.\n  But, in fact, if the President does not do this, we are prepared to \npass a bill through the Senate that would require \n\n[[Page S18907]]\nhim to do it, or give him the authority to do it. The House is going to \ntake that bill up tomorrow or the next day. We will take it up \nimmediately thereafter. But the President could keep us from having to \ngo through that routine if he is sincere in wanting to do what is right \nfor the veterans of our country.\n  I want to say thank you to Senator Warner for starting this process, \nfor bringing it to our attention. I also want to say, because there are \npeople on the floor here, that the authorization bill for the \nDepartment of Defense that just passed was obviously tough. It was a \nclose vote. A lot of people are responsible for the authorization going \nthrough, making sure that the Defense Department does have the funding \nthat it needs, especially in this time when we have young men and women \ngoing to Bosnia and who will be there and will look to us for the \nstability of funding to make sure that they have what they need.\n  I thank Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee, for his \nleadership. He did a wonderful job. Without him, this bill would not \nhave gone through. There are two or three other people who were \nintegral to this process, and I want to say that Senator Warner from \nVirginia, Senator Lott from Mississippi, and Senator Cohen from Maine \nwere essential to getting this bill through, to working it and staying \nwith it and not giving up, despite the differences on the two sides of \nthe aisle.\n  So I thank the Senator from Virginia, and I commend him for getting \nhis letter to the President. I hope the President will respond to the \nveterans and give them a Christmas present. They should not be put at \nperil and should not have to worry about it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for her \nthoughtful remarks. Indeed, she deserves an equal amount of credit for \ngetting this conference report passed. True, our distinguished whip, \nMr. Lott, Mr. Cohen, and others, took active negotiating roles, but \nshe, too, was there. We thank her.\n  I am delighted that the Senator mentioned the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines going to Bosnia because this letter, Mr. President, \nreflects the sentiment of the Congress of the United States toward \nveterans. But they will be veterans some day. It is the continuity of \nthe treatment of veterans by the Congress of the United States that \nenables this country to continue to get the finest and the best \nqualified to come in and wear the uniforms of our armed services today, \ntomorrow, and in the future. So each time we deal with a veterans \nissue, we should think about the current generation serving, for they \nwill some day be veterans, together with their families and loved ones.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter prepared by the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Simpson, Senator Dole, myself, and others, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are disappointed that you chose to \n     veto the 1996 Veterans Affairs, Housing, and Urban \n     Development and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. \n     Your veto threatens hardships for our nation's veterans, \n     unless you exercise your authority to ensure basic \n     entitlements required by law are continued.\n       We consider it an unresolved issue whether the ``faithful \n     execution of the laws'' clause of Article II of the \n     Constitution permits the President, in the absence of an \n     appropriation, to enter into any obligation to pay benefits \n     that are expressly required by law. It is our view that \n     veterans' benefits have the same status as other earned \n     benefits upon which people depend to live, and should be \n     designated as essential and payments continued.\n       Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, in his \n     memorandum interpreting earlier Department of Justice \n     opinions on the consequences of a lapse of appropriations, \n     writes that, ``Efforts should be made to interpret a general \n     statute such as the Antideficiency Act to avoid the \n     significant constitutional questions that would arise were \n     the Act read to critically impair the exercise of \n     constitutional functions assigned to the executive.'' Rather \n     than avoiding this question, or ceding authority to Congress, \n     we believe you should act to carry out the laws of the United \n     States for the benefit of veterans.\n       If you decide not to declare veterans benefits essential, \n     we intend to bring up a funding resolution quickly to provide \n     necessary appropriations. We hope you will act first, making \n     such action unnecessary.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Warner; Alan Simpson; Kay Bailey Hutchison; Bob \n           Dole; Lauch Faircloth; Dan Coats; Pete V.

Mr. President, I, too, want to join in saying how pleased I \nam that we have passed this very important piece of legislation. There \nwas extensive debate today, and I think all the important points have \nbeen made. I am proud of the Senate, that we did get it passed and sent \nit to the President. The defense of our country should be our highest \npriority. We have lived up to that responsibility in the passage of \nthis legislation.\n  I want to, again, commend the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the Senator from South Carolina, for his dogged \npersistence in moving this legislation. Without his efforts, without \nhis coming on to the floor of the Senate and in committee and grabbing \nus by the arm and saying, ``We have to move this issue,'' and, ``Let us \nget agreement on missile defense and on the B-2. We have to move this \nlegislation,'' it would not have happened, in spite of the efforts of \nall of us. But he just stayed with it and we got it done. This should \nbe the Thurmond bill because he really made it happen.\n  I have enjoyed working with all the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, especially the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and \nall of the others. I want to say, also, I think a lot of staff on both \nsides of the aisle need to be recognized. There are too many to name, \nbut Senator Thurmond's staff, Senator Warner's fine staff, and my own \nstaff assistant, Sam Adcock, put a lot of time in this bill, and they \nshould be congratulated.\n  I certainly agree with the Senator from Texas--with the letter she \nhas developed to say that we should make sure that our veterans are \npaid, and there is no reason why they should not be. I assume they will \nbe taken care of by administrative decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18907-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18907-S18908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to also talk a little bit about \nthe joint resolution. An effort was made to call it up tonight. This \njoint resolution passed the House of Representatives just yesterday by \nan overwhelming vote of 351-40; over 130 Democrats voted for it. This \njoint resolution is pretty simple and direct and to the point. It just \nsays that as we voted a month ago on a similar resolution, which the \nPresident signed, that the Congress is reaffirming its commitment to a \nbalanced budget in 7 years with honest numbers, as scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office. That is all it does.\n  Now, when the distinguished majority leader attempted to bring this \njoint resolution up in the Senate that passed the House overwhelmingly \nyesterday, there was objection to it by the minority leader, but he \nindicated if we could add the additional language that we had in our \nearlier resolution, perhaps we could get it worked out and get it \npassed. I think we should be able to do that. We worked on that \nlanguage earlier. We are all committed to making sure that Medicare is \nprotected and, in fact, strengthened. We are all committed to a strong \nnational defense and agriculture programs, along with the whole list of \nissues that we included in that earlier legislation. So I think we can \nprobably work that out and get it agreed to tomorrow. I hope so.\n\n  We have had the additional development now that it appears that maybe \n\n\n[[Page S18908]]\nthe principals of the Congress and the administration--the President, \nand the distinguished majority leader, the Speaker, and the Vice \nPresident--have met now and it appears that they have made some \nprogress. I thought they said they had reached some agreement, among \nother things, to in fact have scoring by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I am not quite sure if that was exactly what was agreed to. But \nthere is a supplementary meeting now occurring with the Chief of Staff \nof the President, along with the chairman of the Budget Committee in \nthe House and Senate, and I am sure there will be some further \ndevelopment of exactly what was discussed and what was agreed to. There \nwill be meetings that will follow on tomorrow. That is good. I wonder \nwhy it has taken so long to get this serious meeting. I think it is \nappropriate, when you are talking about the future of your country, \nthat the President be directly involved and not be speaking through \nagents. Our leaders are willing to get together to talk about this very \nimportant matter.\n  So it looks like we are finally making some progress right here as we \napproach this holiday season. I think it is worth staying here a little \nlonger and coming back a little earlier because we are talking about a \nbalanced budget. We are talking about taking actions now that will lift \nthe burdens from the backs of our children and our grandchildren. We \nare talking about taking an action that will lead to lower interest \nrates and more jobs and a stronger economy. We are talking about \ngetting some agreements on controlling entitlements.\n  I have always wondered why we call these programs entitlements \nbecause, in America, you should not say that regardless of what money \nis available or what parameters should be placed on these various \nprograms, people are entitled to automatically get them. They are only \nentitled to them because Congress said they are.\n  This reform is long overdue. Reform in welfare--everybody said we \nneed it. The President says we should change it as we have known it. We \nare on the verge of doing that. We have a welfare conference report \nthat would, in fact, really reform welfare. We should get that done \nbefore we leave to go home for Christmas, or certainly before this year \nis out. Medicare, Medicaid, all of the so-called untouchables must be \nreformed, not to try to weaken them, but to control the rate of growth \nso we can guarantee they will be there in the future, not just for this \ngeneration, but for the next generation.\n  I really resent some people saying, my goodness, you have various \nagencies or park programs that are being temporarily closed down and \nthat is so bad. Yes, we do not want that to happen, but it trivializes \nwhat we are trying to do here. This is a major effort we are trying to \naccomplish with this balanced budget. We should not quit. We will not \nquit until we get a balanced budget that has some effort to encourage \ngrowth in the economy, that reforms these programs. It can be done. It \nshould be done, certainly, within the next week or 10 days.\n  I am pleased that it looks like we may be able to get an agreement on \nthis Joint Resolution. I am pleased finally, finally, the President of \nthe United States is meeting with the leaders of the Congress to get an \nunderstanding about how we will draw this to a conclusion, which would \nlead to a balanced budget with real and honest numbers before this year \nis out. I hope it happens. We will all be waiting and watching and \nhoping to participate as this process goes forward. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18907-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I echo the statements made by the floor leader on our \nside who has very concisely outlined the importance of the issues \nbefore us. I agree with him that we should not only pass this \nresolution but we should stay here as long as we have to to get the \nbigger job of passing a balanced budget done.\n  Today I was struck by comments made in the Washington Post business \nsection from various financial market experts who said that people are \nwaking up to the stalemate here in Washington. Yesterday was the wake-\nup call that we might not get real entitlement reform and bring the \ndeficit under control.\n  We saw the result with the stock market dropping dramatically. There \nis a real fear on Wall Street, as was indicated in that article, that \nWashington might be contemplating a plan that fails to reform our \nentitlement programs.\n  Mr. President, that is a prescription for disaster, not just in the \nshort term but for the long term, as well. What we have tried to offer \nwith the Balanced Budget Act adopted earlier was a solution to the \nentitlement problems that have confronted Congress for a long time. We \nhave understood that while there is a need to act quickly to address \nthe solvency of Medicare part A, this is just the first step in a long \nseries of reforms needed to accommodate the changing population that we \nwill confront as the baby boom generation ages.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the resolution which the majority leader \noffered earlier will be available for us to vote on very soon. I \nstrongly support the principles that are enunciated in it. I think the \nAmerican people and certainly the people in my State support it as \nwell. They are impatient with Congress. They cannot understand why it \nis taking us so long to get to the finish line. By combining reductions \nin the growth of Government with an opportunity to allow hard-working \nAmericans to keep more of what they earn, we can dramatically shift the \nwhole equation of government in this country.\n  For too long we have watched as dollars flow from hard-working \nAmericans to fund Washington-knows-best rules dictating how our \nNation's welfare, health, and other domestic programs will be run. We \nneed to change from that approach to one where we let people keep more \nof what they earn, in which we let the States and the people on the \nfront lines address the problems of our needy citizens more effectively \nthan the Federal bureaucracy could hope, and ultimately in which we \nreshift the balance in this country from Washington-knows-best to a \nreliance on initiatives that take place at the States, and the \ninitiatives that come from the people themselves.\n  Mr. President, that is the solution I think would work best and why I \nsupport this resolution as it was pronounced by the majority leader \nearlier. It is why I hope we will soon enact a balanced budget plan \nthat yields, at least for the people in my State, lower interest rates, \na chance to keep more of what they earn, and most importantly for the \nchildren in my State, a chance to grow up without spending most of \ntheir working lives paying off the bills that their parents left them. \nInstead, they should be free to spending their incomes on their own \npriorities. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18908-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18908-S18910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REVIEW OF RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thought I would take a few moments to \nreview the resolution that was offered by the distinguished majority \nleader and objected to by the distinguished minority leader, because I \nfrankly did not think it was all that controversial.\n  The joint resolution is stated as follows:\n       Affirming that budget negotiations shall be based on the \n     most recent technical and economic assumptions of the \n     Congressional Budget Office and shall achieve a balanced \n     budget by fiscal year 2002 based on those assumptions.\n       Whereas on November 20 the President signed legislation \n     (Public Law 104-56) committing Congress and the President to \n     ``enact legislation in the first session of the 104th \n     Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than fiscal \n     year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office;\n       Whereas Congress has approved legislation that achieves a \n     balanced budget in fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       Whereas congressional Democrats have offered alternative \n     budgets in the House and Senate which also achieve balance in \n     fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget \n     Office;\n       Whereas the commitment to enact legislation in the first \n     session of Congress requires action now in negotiations;\n       Whereas the negotiations have no preconditions on levels of \n     spending or taxation, except that the resulting budget must \n     achieve balance by fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office;\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has updated its \n     technical and economic assumptions following a thorough \n     consultation with government and private experts; and\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has begun \n     consultation and review with the \n\n[[Page S18909]]\n     Office of Management and Budget: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     current negotiations between Congress and the President shall \n     be based on the most recent technical and economic \n     assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office, and that the \n     Congress is committed to reaching an agreement this year with \n     the President on legislation that will achieve a balanced \n     budget by fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n\n  Now, as I understand it, the minority leader objected to this \nresolution being brought up because it did not include, I guess, the \nfull text of the language that was passed a month ago, and I must say \nthat at this point I do not think I can speak for every Member on our \nside of the aisle, but I think that we are perfectly willing to put the \ncomplete text in the resolution.\n  Again, I do not want to bore everybody, but let me read what the \nadditional text would be:\n\n       And the President and the Congress agree that the balanced \n     budget must protect future generations, ensure Medicare \n     solvency, reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for \n     Medicaid, education, agriculture, national defense, veterans \n     and the environment. Further, the balanced budget shall adopt \n     tax policies to help working families and to stimulate future \n     economic growth.\n\n  Now, that is the full text. So again, we are at a point now where we \nreally do not know how this will play out tomorrow. The majority leader \nindicated that he certainly was willing to accept the full text. I \nsuspect that one of the reasons the full language was not included was \nbecause, again, it required us to adopt tax policies to help working \nfamilies and to stimulate future economic growth. These two \nrequirements may have caused some problems for some people.\n  We thought that, by offering the single question about endorsing the \nuse of Congressional Budget Office numbers, it would frankly be \nsupported easily by both sides of the aisle. Yesterday in the House, \n133 Democrats, in fact, supported this language.\n  So maybe tomorrow we will be able to work out this apparent \ndisagreement, add the additional language, and be able to come to \nclosure, again and finally. We think these negotiations, which may \nbegin tomorrow in fact, will be done on a basis in which the \nCongressional Budget Office will be scoring. Everything that will be \ndealt with will be done so by using the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers.\n  So, I would say again, in context with what has happened today, I \nhave a greater sense of hope that maybe we might be moving towards some \nagreement. Or maybe, without being too hopeful, maybe the way to say it \nis I am under the impression that serious negotiations will begin \ntomorrow.\n  I do not see how this would be harmful in stating, once again, the \ncommitment that both the Congress and the President of the United \nStates made 1 month ago to have a balanced budget, scored by CBO, in 7 \nyears. So I think that is a fairly reasonable position for us to take.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MACK. I will be delighted to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the principles that we agreed to in the \nbeginning are excluded from this resolution that was sent over to us \nfrom the House. I think the majority leader readily agreed that they \nshould have been in it, a few moments ago. He even suggested that he \nwould accept whatever the Democratic leader might put together as an \namendment and you could then alter this resolution to accommodate that.\n  So, really, I do not know why we are talking about it tonight. \nEverybody is agreeable. Unless you are trying to make a point that you \nmade yesterday and the day before and the day before that. And people \nare trying to work things out.\n  The principles here, that we had put in there, are the things that \nare very dear to all of us. The majority leader did not object to it. \nIn fact, he was very gracious in offering the Democratic leader an \nopportunity to give an amendment which he would modify. So I think we \nwill do that tomorrow. So the only agreement is on principle, I say to \nmy friend from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I would pick up on that. It may be that we are, in fact, \nmoving towards times where there will be more agreement as opposed to \ndisagreement. I think all of us hope that that day will come.\n  The other comment you made, that we might again hammer a point we \nhave made before, I guess, maybe for the last several days, is a fair. \nFrankly, yes, we do want to make the point that it has now been 1 month \nsince the Congress passed a continuing resolution which had, in that \nlanguage, a requirement for CBO to score a budget that balanced in 7 \nyears and which contained the other items I spoke about a moment ago. \nFor 1 month, frankly, the President of the United States has failed to \nproduce a proposal that balances the budget in 7 years. The closest the \nPresident has come is a proposal that came out, I believe a week ago--\nactually this past Friday. Actually, I think it was a week prior to \nthat, which was scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which said--\nlet me just finish--\n  Mr. FORD. Two weeks with CBO, now.\n  Mr. MACK. It was scored by CBO as being $116 billion short of \nbalancing the budget in the 7th year. I do not know what the total \namount would be over the 7-year period, or what our differences were, \nbut it was $116 billion over the mark. So, yes, I must admit that one \nof the reasons we do want to have a little discussion about this \nresolution is to make the point that in 30 days the President has \nutterly failed to come forward with a plan that balances the budget.\n  Mr. FORD. If the Senator will yield for another question? I just do \nnot want to leave him out there without our trying to help our side a \nlittle bit.\n  Mr. MACK. I will yield.\n  Mr. FORD. I do not want him to yield. I just want to ask a question. \nWas not part of that delay, 2 weeks that it took CBO to score what was \noffered?\n  Mr. MACK. If I can respond?\n  Mr. FORD. Yes. Sure.\n  Mr. MACK. The President agreed to scoring budgets through CBO. OMB is \nwell aware of CBO's----\n  Mr. FORD. Senator, that is not what I asked. I asked, did it not take \n2 weeks for CBO to score what the President sent in, offered? That was \npart of the delay.\n  Mr. MACK. If the Senator will allow me to respond? I have no problem \nin saying it took 10 days, 12 days, 14 days. But my point is, the \nadministration clearly had the ability to put together a budget based \non the economic assumptions it knew CBO would produce. They refused to \ndo that.\n  Mr. FORD. No, they did not.\n  Mr. MACK. They offered a plan about which they then could say to the \nAmerican people, ``according to the OMB it balanced the budget.'' It \ndid not balance according to CBO. And that is the whole point. The last \nplan presented by the President of the United States is $116 billion \nshort in year number 7.\n  I think it ought to be pretty obvious that that is the case. So, \nagain, we have been debating this. We will have an opportunity, I \nbelieve, tomorrow to deal with this resolution because I am under the \nimpression that there will be an agreement to add the additional \nlanguage, which is important, I understand from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  The additional language in there is very important to us as well, \nespecially the tax cut for America's families and the reduction in the \ncapital gains tax rate to spur economic growth. That language in \nessence will be included if there is an amendment tomorrow.\n  It is interesting to note that what seems to be creating some angst \nhere this evening is a resolution that was supported without any \namendment by 133--I think 133 Democrats in the other body in \nyesterday's vote. So it seemed fairly obvious to me that we could push \nthis forward without any major controversy.\n  What we hope to accomplish, once again, is to get from the President \nof the United States a budget that is balanced in 7 years, scored by \nCBO, which is to say using real numbers. I do not think that is \nunrealistic. I am hopeful, after what has occurred in the meetings at \nthe White House earlier this evening. But I have been hopeful before. \nSo I hope my colleagues will excuse me for some degree of skepticism on \nmy part.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. \n  \n[[Page S18910]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, you are going to move back and forth, is \nthat right?\n  Mr. FORD. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair heard the Senator from Washington \nfirst.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be happy to listen to my friend from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to listen to my friend from Nebraska. \nI am not in that much of a hurry and he always has wise counsel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I intend to be here until this discussion is \nover. I was going to ask a question of my colleague from Florida, if I \ncould, before he leaves the floor? Will he yield for a question, with \nthe understanding he is not losing the right to the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask my friend from Florida, does he have any idea \nthat, if and when we come to a resolution with regard to balancing the \nbudget by the year 2002, as to what the chances are, given the $242 \nbillion tax cut, and if that remains in the final product does the \nSenator from Florida believe that, if the tax cut remains in the \npackage, that the budget would remain balanced in the year 2003? 2004? \nAnd 2005?\n  Mr. MACK. I will say to my distinguished colleague, it is my \nunderstanding that what we are dealing with here is a budget resolution \nthat covers the 7-year period. It is my understanding, according to \nCBO's estimate of that, that it would be in balance in the year 2002, \nwhich is the timeframe that we have established. Yes, you can make the \nreductions in spending, reduce the rate of growth in entitlement \nprograms, balance the budget, produce a bonus as a result of balancing \nthe budget that will pay for the tax proposals.\n  So, I am of the opinion that, in the year 2002, that is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. But he is asking about 2004 and 2005.\n  Mr. MACK. I understand what he is talking about.\n  Mr. EXON. Even if it comes to that, you have not looked beyond that \nto see whether or not it would remain balanced in the year following, \nor the year following that, or the year following that? After 7 years?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if I may respond, it is the opinion of this \nSenator that, again, if we can keep a very significant component of the \ntax proposal intact--that is, the lowering of the capital gains tax \nrate--that when we hit the years numbered 8, 9, and 10, that we are \ngoing to see that the revenues that are going to be projected in fact \nwill increase beyond that because having freed up capital that is now \nlocked into old investments, old technologies, it will create the jobs \nand the opportunity in the years ahead to, in fact, create the balanced \nbudget in year 8, year 9, and year 10.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say to my friend from Florida, I hope that works \nout that way. But all of the figures I have seen indicate just the \nopposite, and we may have some more information on that in detail form \nin the near future.\n  I simply point out to all that this magnificent exercise that we are \ngoing through should be better understood by all for what it is right \nnow. The reason that I am worried about the outyears is that the \npresent Republican plan is so heavily loaded with regard to the cuts in \nspending that are necessary to balance the budget in the 6th and 7th \nyears--and that happens to be a situation where, under the Republican \nplan, 60 percent of the cuts, 60 percent of the reduction in spending \nthat will have to be made to meet that 7-year balanced budget, is done \nin year 6 and year 7. That is a pretty heavy load in years 6 and 7. \nThat is called back loading.\n  Backloading is one of the concerns that I have about the whole \nproposition. But while we are backloading, where we are going, if this \ndeal materializes, we are going to have 60 percent of the cuts made in \nthe year 6 and in the year 7. So the first 5 years are not so bad. \nKatie bar the door when you come to those last 2 years. Then on top of \nthat, Mr. President, at the same time is when the cost of the $242 \nbillion tax cut kicks in. That is also backloaded into this program, \nand there the major portion of the money necessary to pay for that $242 \nbillion tax cut comes in the 7th year and then really escalates in year \n8 and year 9 and year 10.\n  What I am saying is that, while I hope this works out, there are lots \nof problems ahead as we move forward. And we have to be realistic.\n  I would simply say that I will be here while the rest of this \ndiscussion is going on. I was very pleased with the report from the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader that things now seem to be \nmoving. But, unfortunately, I thought things were moving when we were \nstarting detailed specific negotiations for tomorrow afternoon. It \nmight be wise if we would all be quiet, you know, tone down our \nrhetoric at a time when we hope our leaders can come to some kind of an \nagreement and not be here on the floor making pontifical statements, \nthat we have every right to do, but that I do not believe is going to \ncontribute very much to the bipartisan effort that is going to have to \nbe made to come up with a balanced budget in 7 years using the \nCongressional Budget Office scoring. There is going to have to be a lot \nof give and take. And certainly the leadership, which is undertaking \nthose negotiations at the White House, is going to be under enough \nstress and strain without us on the floor of the Senate trying to take \npartisan shots one against the other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18908-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18910-S18911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this year the House of \nRepresentatives passed by substantially more than a two-thirds majority \na constitutional amendment which would have mandated a balanced budget \nin the year 2002 and in every year thereafter. Later in the Senate of \nthe United States that constitutional amendment was defeated by a \nsingle vote. The reason, of course, that the constitutional amendment \nhad that kind of prospective application was that to undo the disparity \nbetween spending and revenue which has built up over the years, \ncontributed to by administrations both Republican and Democratic, would \nin all probability require that amount of time.\n  Since many of the Members in both Houses who voted against that \nbalanced budget in the year 2002 did so on the stated ground, at least, \nthat Congress should take responsibility into its own hands and balance \nthe budget without what they called the crutch of the constitutional \namendment, Members primarily on this side of the aisle took that \ncounsel seriously. That was the origin of the drive toward a budget \nresolution and a series of changes in our laws which would bring the \nbudget into balance by that year.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what Members of this body will think in \nthe year 2003 or 2004 and 2005, and it was for exactly that reason that \nI voted in favor of that constitutional amendment, so that the kind of \ngames of backloading, about which my distinguished friend from Nebraska \ncomplained, simply could not take place in the future. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, I am quite optimistic that a Congress will soon be elected \nwiser in that respect than this one, a Congress that does in fact \nsubmit such a constitutional amendment to the people.\n  In the meantime, however, Mr. President, I believe that it would be \nan accomplishment beyond anything dreamed of by more than a handful of \nMembers of our predecessor Congresses actually to pass a series of laws \nthat would create that balance in the year 2002. And it is to that end \nthat we have been driving over the course of the last 6 months and \nmore. It was that goal which we finally thought, believed, hoped that \nthe President of the United States had joined when he signed a law \ncreating a continuing resolution before Thanksgiving Day which included \nthe statement that there would be a balanced budget using honest \nnumbers derived by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office this \nyear, a year that is almost over.\n  The disappointment, the bitterness, here and elsewhere, the shaking \nof faith, the faith that has caused interest rates to drop by a full 2 \npercent over the last year, the faith that has sustained our economy, \nthe shaking of \n\n[[Page S18911]]\nthat faith in recent days has been derived, Mr. President, solely, I am \nconvinced, from the failure of the administration to meet the \nobligation which it entered into jointly with those of us here in \nCongress.\n  This Congress passed a balanced budget, a set of proposals that would \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. Every Member who voted for that \nbudget believed not only that obligation, but every one of the other \npriorities set forth in our continuing resolution just before \nThanksgiving with respect to the protection of Medicare, the more \nfavorable tax treatment of working Americans, education, the \nenvironment, the entire list. It was perfectly appropriate, I suppose, \nfor the President to disagree with that proposition. That is what makes \nup political debate. It is perfectly appropriate for Members of the \nother party to disagree with that proposition. What was inappropriate \nwas the absolute, total, complete, abject failure to come up with an \nalternative that met their priorities, and met the legal requirement \nfor balance using these honest figures.\n  It is for that reason, and one other that I will mention in a moment, \nthat we have this second crisis, this second partial shutdown of the \nexecutive branch.\n  Now we are given hope once again that in a relatively short period of \ntime between this evening and the end of the year in fact we will be \nable to work out a truly balanced budget using the honest figures, the \nconservative figures supplied by the Congressional Budget Office. \nPerhaps--perhaps--tomorrow we will see for the first time, for the \nfirst time a submission by the President of the United States that \nmeets those requirements, and then we can join in a discussion of how \nsignificant the tax reductions for working Americans should be, how \ndramatically we should reform and strengthen Medicare, what we should \ndo about education and the environment. But to this point we have only \nbudgets which say we ought to spend money in these various areas but \nnot pay for those services, send the bills to our children and to our \ngrandchildren. And that is the cause of the situation in which we find \nourselves today.\n  Even so, Mr. President, we could be discussing this issue more \nobjectively perhaps if there were not the constant interference of the \nshutdowns of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Department of Interior, our museums, \nour national parks, and the like.\n  Well, Mr. President, in that connection, this Congress passed and \nsent to the President appropriations bills for the whole next year \npursuant to which none of those departments would have been shut down \nwhatsoever and bills that were consistent with reaching a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002. And yesterday, the President vetoed those \nbills. He vetoed those bills and closed down the national parks, closed \ndown the Department of Veterans Affairs, closed down our museums and \ntourist attractions here in this city. Why? At least in part because we \ndid not appropriate enough money for them, appropriations inconsistent \nwith ever reaching a balanced budget, and often on rationales which \ncontradicted what he has done earlier during the course of this year.\n  And so now we have a bit of static in public opinion. We have \ndepartments shuttered, closed down, parks shuttered and closed down \nbecause of Presidential vetoes on particular appropriations bills \npassed by this Congress and sent to him but interfering with the far \nmore important long-range goal of seeing to it that we finally give up \nthe habit of determining that today we cannot do without various \nservices, however important they sound, whatever the interest groups \nare that support them, but that we are not willing to pay for them \nourselves. And so we sent the bills to those who cannot vote today, \nthose who are already born, who are children in school but who are \nunder the age of 18 and those who are not yet born. They can pay for \nwhat we want for ourselves today.\n  Mr. President, that is fundamentally wrong. It is wrong from the \nperspective of our economy. We know that if we honestly balance the \nbudget, we will retain and strengthen lower interest rates. We will \nstrengthen our economy, or new job opportunities that we have. We will \ngive people hope. It is morally wrong to demand services today that we \nare unwilling to pay for. And the one thing we have not heard in this \ndebate at any time from either the President or the Members of the \nother party, we ought to spend what the President asked us to spend and \nwe ought to increase taxes. By what, Mr. President, half, two-thirds, \nthree quarters of $1 trillion over the next 7 years? So that we can \nhave these services but pay for them ourselves. They have not suggested \nthat. Their suggestion remains let us have these goodies now and let us \nsend the bill to someone else, someone without a voice in this \nCongress.\n\n  Now, my friend from Nebraska, who has stayed in the Chamber, has made \nwhat I think is an excellent suggestion, and I know that he does share \nour goals with us. He has said that he is troubled by the fact that so \nmuch in the way of these spending reductions are deferred to the end of \nthis 7-year period. And can we continue beyond the year 2002? Well, Mr. \nPresident, even if the Medicare reforms that we have proposed were \npassed lock, stock, and barrel, without any change, we would not have \nsolved the problem of the burden that creates for the American people \nin perpetuity by any stretch of the imagination.\n  Oh, yes, Mr. President, I say in response to my friend from Nebraska, \nthere would still be more to do in the year 2003 and 2004 and 2005 and \nprobably before then. But most of the objections to what we are doing \nfrom his party have not come from the proposition that many of these \nspending cuts take place in the last 2 years. They come because the \nspending cuts are there at all. They simply do not want to do them at \nall. And I believe, Mr. President, that if we will look a little bit \nbeyond ourselves, look across the Atlantic Ocean, we will see the \nultimate result of a refusal to deal with the social and financial \nburdens imposed on a society by unrestrained entitlements. We simply \nhave to look at what is going on in France today, a much worse \nsituation than we have here: Strikes and disruptions in services all \nacross the territory of a free country caused by a set of social \npolicies which have choked its economy, which have created unemployment \nmore than twice that in the United States and with no hope for any \nchange whatsoever.\n  This task that we are taking on now would have been easier had our \npredecessors taken it on 5 years ago or 2 years ago. It will be more \ndifficult if we defer it until next year or into the next century and \nthe longer we defer it, the more we will look like France.\n  The time is now. If the Senator from Nebraska has a suggestion that \nwill cause more of these spending cuts to take place earlier rather \nthan later, and to be more permanent, I think he will find many who \nwill support him on this side. Nor does this Senator nor most others \nsay that any one of the numbers within this budget is sacrosanct, \nwhether it is particular spending numbers, particular tax numbers or \nthe like. What we do regard as the bottom line is that we really get to \nbalance; that we provide that dividend to the American people of half a \ntrillion dollars or more which we are told will come from a truly \nbalanced budget using honest figures.\n  Perhaps we will look back and say today was a major day in the course \nof reaching that goal. Perhaps this is the day on which the President \ntruly joined in the search for that balanced budget and those \ndividends. I sincerely hope that that is true. I am certain that if it \nis true, this will no longer be a partisan exercise but will be one in \nwhich the Senator from Nebraska enters into enthusiastically and \nsuccessfully.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

All right. Mr. President, I was interested in the \nstatement that was made by the very distinguished Senator from \nWashington State a few minutes ago when he was talking about those who \nare not represented here and the moral issue of the conduct in which we \nhave been conducting our country over the past 30 years.\n  I was reminded of an experience the other day of back when we had our \nprayer breakfast. This was the international prayer breakfast where we \nhad people here from all over the world, and I was in charge of \ninternational visitors, when one of the visitors who was here from \nMoldavia, which was a former Soviet republic that had gained its \nfreedom, came in and he asked me a question during one of our visits \nthat we had.\n  He said, ``Senator Inhofe, I have a question to ask you. In the \nUnited States, how much can you keep?'' And I said, ``I am sorry, I do \nnot understand what you mean.'' He said, ``How much money do you have \nto give the government?'' Then I got a little better idea of what he \nwas asking.\n  So I asked the question--in fact, I would be a little embarrassed to \ntell you the answer that I gave the gentleman that was here from \nMoldavia. He was so proud. And he said, ``In Moldavia, we have a new \ndemocracy. We have new freedoms. And when we''--they have some type of \na tax collection system where every 3 months or so they collect the \ntaxes. And he said, ``Every time we make a dollar, we get to keep 20 \ncents.'' In other words, they have to pay 80 cents out of every dollar \nto support the government there. And he was rejoicing because this was \nthe new freedom that he had discovered.\n  I got to thinking and looking at the facts, that I do not think \nanyone will refute, and that is that if we do not do something now \nabout changing this pattern that we established back in the Great \nSociety days of the middle 1960's, that someone who is born today will \nhave to pay not 80 cents out of every dollar but 82 cents out of every \ndollar just to support government.\n\n  I bring that up today because today is a day that a very important \nperson is to be born, and that person has the name or will have the \nname--and maybe as we speak has the name--of James Edward Rapert. This \nwill be my third grandchild. So it becomes a much more personal thing \nwhen you think of someone coming into this world--such as the Presiding \nOfficer who recently had a young child named Daniel born in his \nfamily--all of a sudden it becomes personal. It comes out of the realm \nof the normal discussion as to the various social programs that the \nvarious Senators have stood on the floor of this Senate today talking \nabout--the education programs, the social programs, the poverty \nprograms, the nutrition programs, and all of these--and it becomes an \nissue of, what are we willing to do to those who cannot be heard, those \nfor whom there is no lobby, such as James Edward Rapert?\n  I understand that yesterday the House, by a very decisive margin, \nwith many, many of the Democrats, voted to reaffirm the commitment we \nhave to a balanced budget by the year 2002 using real figures, not \nsmoke and mirrors, but using real figures and using the CBO figures. In \nfact, I cannot imagine when I go back to Oklahoma, such as I was this \nweekend, everybody saying, well, what is there to debate? I mean, we \nhave the Democrats who ran for office on a balanced budget. We have a \nPresident of the United States who ran for office on a balanced budget \nto the Constitution. And everyone is for it. Who is against it? And I \ntried to explain the reality up here is not always what it seems to be \nat home because this, in fact, is Washington.\n  So we are in a situation--I know there are several who want to be \nheard tonight. I just want to make a comment about a statement that was \nmade by a very distinguished Member of the other body, John Kasich. The \nother day he said, ``We're in a frustrating situation where we have a \nbalanced budget amendment or Balanced Budget Act that we passed in both \nthe House and Senate, and it was vetoed by the President, and yet we \ndon't have anything from him.'' And he said, ``It is like going \nChristmas shopping and going up and saying, `I want to buy this tie. \nHow much is it?' And they will not tell you.\n  So he said, `I will give you $100.' They said, `No, that's not \nenough.' `How much more?' Well, they will not tell you.''\n  That is the situation we find ourselves in right now. So we have \nprobably the second most significant issue facing us that we will face \nfor maybe the last 10 years, and that is doing something about a \nbalanced budget. We have an opportunity that is coming up any hour now, \nany day, certainly I hope it is going to happen prior to Christmas. \nWhen that time comes, I hope we will all remember not ourselves, not \nall the nutritional programs, not all the things we talk about and how \nwe can wisely spend the people's money that we are borrowing from \nfuture generations, but I hope we think of James Edward Rapert who will \nbe paying for all this fun that we are having.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18912-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18912-S18914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Washington said a number of \nthings that I want to respond to. I have a great deal of respect for \nthe senior Senator from Washington, and he and I serve together as \nchairman and ranking member of an appropriations subcommittee. I have \nfound him to be an extremely easy person to work with, and I have \ndeveloped during that process great respect for his legislative \nabilities. But I think it is important to mention a number of things \nthat I think need to be responded to in regard to his statement.\n\n  He talks about the second crisis. The first crisis and the second \ncrisis were caused not by the minority, which is the Democrats. The \nfact of the matter is that by October 1 of each year, it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress to pass appropriations bills. The record \nis very clear. By October 1 of this year, the majority in the House and \nin the Senate had not passed bills that could be sent to the President.\n  The second crisis referred to by the Senator from Washington again \nwas not created by virtue of something that the Democrats did that was \nwrong, the minority did that was wrong. The fact of the matter is that \nthe majority did not pass appropriations bills. This crisis that we \nhave is not something caused by the minority. The fact of the matter \nis, on October 1 the bills were not passed.\n  I also think it is important to acknowledge again on this floor, we \nhear constant talk about the fact that the majority is now pushing for \na balanced budget. I think that is good. I think that is important. But \nthe fact of the matter is that the 1993 budget plan that was passed in \nthis body and the other body--it was the so-called Clinton plan--was \nthe largest deficit-reduction plan in the history of this country. It \nreduced the deficit over $500 billion over a 5-year period of time, the \nlargest deficit-reduction program in the history of this country.\n  Yesterday it was an unusual day in the last couple years in this \ncountry. It was unusual because the stock market went down. It was an \nextremely unusual day that the market went down. Today it went back up. \nBut the stock market is over 5,000, Dow Jones. The stock market has \nbeen hot. Why? Because the economy has been doing extremely well.\n  We have had the lowest unemployment, lowest inflation in 40 or 50 \nyears; \n\n[[Page S18913]]\nhighest economic growth since the days of John Kennedy; corporate \nprofits have never been higher. There has been a time or two in the \npast 200 years when they have been as high, but never higher than they \nare today.\n  The Federal work force has been reduced by 175,000 people in the last \n2\\1/2\\ years, excluding the military; civilian reduction by 175,000. No \nwonder the economy is doing fine.\n  That does not mean that we should not do some very important things \nregarding the annual deficits. They are too high, even though it is the \nlargest deficit reduction plan in the history of this country. The \ndeficits are too high and we should do better.\n  There has been talk by a number of Senators from the other side about \nwhy did we not just approve this resolution that came from the House \nthat calls for a balanced budget? The reason it was not approved, as \nindicated in the dialog between the majority and minority leader, is \nthat the resolution needs an amendment. Why? Because it needs to \nprotect priorities that we on this side feel are important: Medicare, \nMedicaid, veterans' benefits, education, the environment.\n  Maybe it was an oversight. Whatever it is, if you are going to have a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, a sense-of-this-Congress resolution, as \nto what we want, then you have to include the fact that we are willing \nto go for a 7-year balanced budget, but in the process of doing that, \nwe want Medicare protected, we want Medicaid protected, veterans' \nbenefits, environment, and education.\n  So the resolution will pass tomorrow. We will stick those things in \nit and it will pass, as indicated by the majority leader and the \nminority leader.\n  The reason we hang out and talk about certain things being important \nis because they are important. My friend, the minority whip, who has \nleft the floor, has long been a supporter of a balanced budget, as has \nbeen many people in this Chamber, including the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. I would put the balanced budget credentials of the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska up against anybody in this Congress. It is \nnot something that my friend from Nebraska suddenly said this year, \n``I'm retiring from Congress in a couple years. I think I'll come out \nfor a balanced budget amendment.'' From the day he stepped in here, \nafter his service as Governor of Nebraska, he started talking about a \nbalanced budget.\n  He has voted for balanced budgets. A constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget would have passed by probably 80 votes this year \nif--if--we had excluded Social Security trust funds. As a result of the \nmajority not being willing to exclude the Social Security trust funds, \nthe constitutional amendment failed, as well it should have failed.\n  We are very concerned about Medicare. Why? Because today Medicare \nprovides coverage for over 37 million Americans. Medicare has been \nsuccessful in fulfilling its mission to provide health insurance \ncoverage to America's senior citizens.\n  Today, 99 percent of senior citizens have health care coverage. Why? \nBecause of Medicare. That is not the way it was 30-odd years ago. \nAround 40 percent of the people who were senior citizens then had \nhealth insurance.\n  It has been good. It has been good not only giving people peace of \nmind but it has extended their lives. For those 65 and older in the \nUnited States, life expectancy is now higher than in any country in the \nworld, with the simple exception of Japan. And why? Most people who \nunderstand what has happened in this country in the last 30 years say \nit is because of Medicare.\n\n  Medicare has been one of the primary reasons that poverty has been \nreduced among the elderly. When Medicare came into being, almost 30 \npercent of senior citizens were below the poverty level. Now, Mr. \nPresident, it is about 12.5 percent--a dramatic reduction. One of the \nmain reasons is because of Medicare.\n  Medicare is a very efficient program. We bash Government programs. I \nhave done a little of it myself, but do not bash Medicare, because it \nis a very good and it is a very efficient program. Medicare \nadministrative costs average 2 percent of program outlays, compared \nwith 5 percent for large group plans and as much as 25 percent for \nsmall group plans in the private sector. Medicare works and it works \nwell, and it benefits all Americans regardless of income status.\n  Mr. President, 83 percent of outlays go to beneficiaries with incomes \nof $25,000 or less. Only 3 percent goes to elderly individuals or \ncouples with income in excess of $50,000. The No. 1 priority, Mr. \nPresident, for the minority is that any budget plan must continue \nMedicare's guarantee of high-quality medical care for senior citizens \nand people with disabilities by ensuring trust fund solvency and \nprotecting beneficiaries.\n  I have heard numerous statements on this floor of people coming and \nsaying, ``The reason we're making all these punitive changes is because \nthe Medicare trustees have said we have to do something or Medicare is \ngoing to go broke.''\n  For 27 years, we have had Medicare in existence. Twenty-five of the \ntwenty-seven years the trustees have reported the program is going to \ngo broke and, as a result of that--it is a pay-as-you-go system--we \nhave had to change the way that we fund Medicare, and we need to do it \nnow.\n  Any plan that we come up with must ensure the viability of the \nMedicare trust fund for at least 10 years, must protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from premium increases beyond current law, and promote \nchanges that would not drive up overall costs.\n  We must keep Medicare a first-class program, something we are all \nproud of and especially something senior citizens are proud of. In \ndoing that, we must ensure the viability of hospitals and other \ncritical care health care providers in rural and urban areas.\n  I think it is important that we understand that we, the minority, \nhave been fighting to protect Medicare. Why? Because some of the \nleaders, Mr. President, on the other side are talking about Medicare \nwithering on the vine, and the GOP plan threatens to have Medicare \nwither on the vine by encouraging doctors to leave the current Medicare \nprogram and penalizing seniors who choose to stay. They are extreme \ncuts--$270 billion. They may have been dropped, with the latest CBO \nnumbers, but they are large cuts and budget gimmicks.\n  One of the things that is suggested in the plan by the majority is \nthat there be group health care plans that allow managed care. That is \nfine, but the fine print says that the $50 billion that the majority \nsays will be saved with that program, if they are not saved, if those \nsavings do not come, there will be across-the-board cuts in Medicare.\n  So we have to watch very closely that these plans do not use budget \ngimmickry. We talk about more choice. We have to make sure there are \nnot bad choices.\n  Mr. President, I want to just mention a couple things, and I do this \nbecause we have people coming on the floor and saying, ``Democrats \ndon't want to balance the budget. The minority doesn't want to balance \nthe budget.'' We want to balance the budget. We have voted for a 7-year \nbalanced budget plan, but we want to protect Medicare, we want to \nprotect Medicaid, and the program the majority has put out repeals the \ncurrent Medicaid program which serves 36 million needy and vulnerable \nAmericans and replaces it with an underfunded and inflexible block \ngrant.\n  The majority proposal ends a guarantee for 18 million children and 8 \nmillion women who receive preventive and primary care, 4 million \nelderly Americans who get help with Medicare payments--it would end \nthat--6 million disabled Americans, who receive coverage for physician \nand hospital and specialized services. The cuts there are as much as \n$420 billion because, remember, any money that goes to the States from \nthe Federal Government is matched by the States. So it is a double loss \nfor recipients.\n  Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I know the streets are icy, \nbut I have been waiting to get the floor. I want the Record to make \nsure that it reflects that the minority believes in certain standards. \nWe believe in not devastating Medicare, and we want to maintain \nMedicaid so that it is a system that does not--as the report says by \nthe Consumers' Union and the National Senior Citizens Law Center, some \n395,000 nursing home patients could lose their Medicaid coverage under \nthe proposal the majority has put out. Without these payments, nursing \nhomes could force patients to leave \n\n[[Page S18914]]\nunless the families pay for care. This was not just dreamed up. If you \nread the Washington Post and other major newspapers, that came out \nyesterday, and that is what the story says. Families are going to have \nto start paying.\n  Mr. President, I have a lot more to say. I am only going to say that \nwe have a lot of problems with the deficit that comes every year. We \nhave a bigger problem with the debt that is accumulating. That was not \ndone with the Democratic administrations. We have $5 trillion in debt. \nI hope that we will not only talk about balancing the budget on a \nyearly basis but we talk about doing something with the underlying \ndebt. I hope that is something that is addressed in the immediate \nfuture. Not only should we be concerned about the annual deficits, but \nthe underlying $5 trillion in debt is something we must address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18912-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like to set forth my general \nconcerns about S. 1394, a bill passed out of the Judiciary Subcommittee \non Immigration a few weeks ago. In general, this bill would combine \nmeasures aimed at reducing illegal immigration with dramatic reductions \nin legal immigration. In my view, illegal and legal immigration are \nvery different issues. Illegal immigration is a significant national \nproblem, one that we should address by discussing ways to deal with \npeople who cross our borders unlawfully. In contrast, legal immigrants \nare overwhelmingly law-abiding and hardworking people who contribute to \nour economy and our society. We should deal with the real problem of \nillegal immigration without retreating from America's historic \ncommitment to legal immigration.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make an obvious point: America is a \nland of immigrants. For most of our history we have welcomed anyone \nwith the desire and fortitude necessary to come here in search of a \nbetter life.\n  Lady Liberty has held our door open to the teeming masses of the \nworld, not out of pity, but out of respect for our Nation's immigrant \nroots, and in the knowledge that immigrants made this country strong \nand prosperous, and will continue to do so, so long as we let them.\n  We as a people will remain a vibrant, shining example to the world, \nso long as we continue to look out to that world, welcoming those who \nwould join us in building a free and open society.\n  We have every right and even responsibility to expect those who come \nto our land to live up to our standards of decency and responsibility. \nWe can and should expect able-bodied immigrants to work. We can and \nshould expect them to forego the often debilitating effects of welfare.\n  But we should not slam the door shut to people yearning to be free, \nand to build a better life for themselves and their families.\n  My grandparents were all immigrants. They came to this country from \nLebanon about a century ago in search of freedom. None of the four \ncould speak English. And they had few material resources to speak of. \nBut they came to America because they wanted to live in a country that \nwas free and they wanted their children and their grandchildren to live \nin a nation that was free. My grandparents did not come here pursuing \ngovernment benefits. They believed in their own capacity to do things, \nand they wanted a place where they would have a chance to enjoy the \nfreedom to do the things they wanted.\n  My parents did better in America than their parents. My parents were \nvery hard-working folks. Neither of them had a college education. My \ndad worked almost 20 years as a UAW member on an assembly line in an \nOldsmobile factory in Lansing, MI. After that, he and my mom started a \nsmall business. They worked hard; 6 sometimes 7 days a week in order to \ngive me and my sisters a chance to share in the American Dream--to have \nmore freedom and opportunity than they did. Their hard work has allowed \nme to succeed in turn; I was the first child in our family to go to \ncollege.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that this bill will make it more difficult \nfor people like my grandparents to come to America.\n  Specifically, S. 1394 would significantly reduce the quotas for legal \nimmigration, restrict immigration as a means to re-unite separated \nfamilies, and eliminate whole categories of legal immigration.\n  I believe these measures will cause real harm to our economy and to \nour Nation as a whole. Most damaging, they will keep us from benefiting \nfrom the hard work, experience and expertise of legal immigrants.\n  Immigrants are the ultimate entrepreneurs. They are people willing to \nrisk it all in a new and different land. They are self-selected and \nseek to make a better life for themselves and their families.\n  As economist Thomas Sowell writes in his Ethnic America: A History:\n\n       The fact that immigrants not only equal, but eventually \n     surpass, their native-born counterparts suggests that they \n     brought some advantage in terms of human capital, that \n     migration is a selective process, bringing the more ambitious \n     or venturesome or able elements of a population.\n\n  Mr. President, these are the kind of people we want to become \nAmericans. These are the kind of people who sacrifice so their children \ncan rise to the top of their class.\n  Immigrants also create a brain gain for the United States. One in \nthree people who have graduated from college in engineering in this \ncountry is an immigrant, according to the National Research Center.\n  Immigrant expertise is widespread and impressive. In the 20th century \nbetween 20 and 50 percent of all Nobel Prize winners, depending on the \ndiscipline involved, have been immigrants to the United States. As of \n1988 there were more Russian Nobel Prize winners living in the United \nStates than living in Russia.\n\n[[Page S18915]]\n\n  These highly educated, highly skilled immigrants are essential to the \ncompetitiveness of America's high-technology industries. Consider \nIntel, one of the most prolific and expanding companies in the United \nStates, employing tens of thousands of American workers.\n  Intel constantly develops cutting edge technologies that will define \nthe computer industry in the 21st century. And it is doing all of this \nwith a great deal of help from America's newest immigrants.\n  At one point not long ago three members of Intel's top management, \nincluding chief executive officer Andrew S. Grove, from Hungary, were \nimmigrants.\n  Intel and other high-technology firms must seek out and hire \nimmigrants because the demand for highly skilled workers exceeds the \nsupply. After recruiting on American campuses, these companies still do \nnot have enough highly skilled engineers, scientists, and computer \nspecialists they need to remain competitive. Only because their need is \nreal do companies go through the trouble, expense and government \npaperwork necessary to hire foreign workers.\n  But productive immigrants are not just computer programmers in \nSilicon Valley. Arab-Americans in Dearborn and Detroit, Vietnamese in \nArlington, Cubans in Miami, and a number of other immigrant groups in a \nnumber of cities have revitalized America's urban areas.\n  Whether it is the Korean grocer or the Chinese restaurateur, our \nurban areas in particular owe a great deal to entrepreneurial, hard-\nworking immigrants willing to take chances, to start small businesses \nin areas others have ignored.\n  Mr. President, immigration is not a zero-sum game in which every job \nthat goes to a foreign-born worker means one less job for an American \nworker. Immigration is a positive-sum gain for Americans in terms of \njobs, living standards, and economic growth. When a business adds a new \nresource--whether it is a labor or capital resource--it generates more \njobs, more income, and more opportunities for Americans, not less. This \nis especially true when the resource is a talented, creative, and \ninventive worker. As George Gilder points out, the beneficial impact of \nimmigrants on the U.S. economy ``is overwhelming and undeniable: it is \nall around us, in a spate of inventions and technical advances, from \nmicrowaves and air bags to digital cable and satellite television, from \nhome computers and air conditioners to cellular phones and lifesaving \npharmaceutical and medical devices.'' Mr. Gilder estimates that without \nimmigration over the last 50 years, U.S. real living standards would be \nat least 40 percent lower. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nan article by George Gilder on the economic benefits of immigration in \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal be placed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, lowering the legal immigrant quota will \nlower the benefit we can gain from hard-working and highly-skilled \nimmigrants. Tightening restrictions on family unification also will \ncost us a great deal. It will cost us our principles because we know \nwell that U.S. citizens should be able to bring their elderly parents \nto this country after he has established himself here. And we know well \nthat others, adult sisters and brothers and other relatives, \nparticularly those living under the many repressive regimes in this \nworld, should be allowed to join their relatives in the land of \nfreedom.\n\n  And keeping families separated also will be bad for our economy. \nSkilled workers will be less likely to come to America if they know \nthat they will not be allowed to reunite their families. Most people \nare reluctant to move out of town if they cannot see their families. In \nmy view, America will not be able to attract the ``best and the \nbrightest'' from around the world if we impose barriers that prevent \npeople from re-uniting with their parents and siblings.\n  Mr. President, in my view S. 1394's provisions restricting legal \nimmigration are misconceived; they are misconceived because they are \nbased on misconceptions: first, that immigrants take jobs away from \nAmericans who need them, second, that immigrants are a drain on our \ngovernments and third, that immigrants are a danger to our culture.\n  Contrary to popular myth, immigrants do not increase the rate of \nunemployment among American workers.\n  There is a great deal of empirical evidence to support this position.\n  First, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution studied immigration \npatterns over the long term in America. They found that, historically, \nperiods of heavy immigration have not been associated with subsequent \nhigher than normal unemployment.\n  Second, the Manhattan Institute compared the ten states with the \nhighest immigrant presence with the ten states with the lowest \nimmigrant presence and found that the high-immigrant states actually \nhad lower unemployment rates, in the aggregate, than did the low-\nimmigrant states.\n  The median unemployment rate in States with large immigrant \npopulations was 5.1 percent while that for the 10 States with low \nimmigrant populations was 6.6 percent--a full 1.5 percent difference.\n  I could go on, Mr. President, but there is no need. Let me instead \nquote Julian Simon. This University of Maryland professor and author of \nthe seminal work on ``The Economic Consequences of Immigration'' \nrecently finished an immigration report for the Cato Institute. In that \nreport he states unequivocally: ``The studies uniformly show that \nimmigrants do not increase the rate of native unemployment.''\n  It's as simple as that. Immigrants do not increase unemployment. In \nfact, Mr. President, immigrants do not take jobs, they crate jobs. By \nadvancing our technology, by developing better products, by starting \nnew businesses and by themselves consuming goods, immigrants expand and \ncreate whole new areas of production employing thousands of native-born \nAmericans.\n  This brings us to the second mistaken assumption underlying attempts \nto restrict immigration: that legal immigrants are a drain on the \npublic coffers.\n  Mr. President, when total government expenditures per capita are \nconsidered, the government spends about one third less per immigrant \nthan it does per native. This is because immigrants are more likely \nthan natives to be of working age. They pay into the tax system without \ntaking out, for example, Social Security payments. Further, refugees \nfleeing persecution automatically qualify for government benefits when \nthey are admitted into the United States. If we factor out the use of \nwelfare among refugees, immigrants or working age are less likely to \nuse welfare than are the native born.\n  As Julian Simon of the University of Maryland reported recently in \nthe Wall Street Journal, ``the immigrant family contributes yearly \nabout $2,500 more in taxes to public coffers than it obtains in \nservices.'' And those who still fear the costs of immigration should \nremember a policy option which we already have substantially put in \nplace: ``immigration yes, welfare no.''\n  Current law already forbids almost all immigrants from receiving \nwelfare for their first three years in this country. We can \nlegitimately toughen these standards. And our welfare reform bill does \nso by denying noncash benefits such as supplemental security income and \nfood stamps to immigrants.\n  But we should recognize that the vast majority of immigrants are \nworking hard, in real jobs that add to the well-being of our people and \nour country.\n  There is one final misconception underlying S. 1394's provisions \nrestricting immigration. It has been said that America needs a \nreduction in immigration for the sake of our culture.\n  Some Americans have expressed concern about a new wave of immigrants, \nbringing new customs and ways of life to our shores.\n  Despite the scare tactics we sometimes hear, however, immigrants are \nnot breaking down our culture. First, Mr. President, immigrants are not \ncoming to America in unprecedented numbers. Professor Simon's cautious \nestimate, based on census data, is that as of 1990, immigrants made up \nonly 8.5 percent of our population. That compares with averages over 13 \npercent between 1860 and 1920. As a proportion of \n\n[[Page S18916]]\nthe total population, then, immigrant numbers have dropped by more than \na third.\n  What is more, the Manhattan Institute's ``Index of Leading \nImmigration Indicators'' shows that, compared with the native born, \nimmigrants are more likely to have intact families, more likely to have \ncollege degrees, more likely to be working, and no more likely to \ncommit crimes than native born Americans.\n  We are not being swamped by unmanageable numbers of immigrants. \nFurther, Mr. President, immigrants are like the rest of us in all the \nways that matter. They are hard-working, family-oriented people who \ncome here to make a better life for themselves and their children. They \nare, in fact, the kind of people each and every one of us would and \nshould be happy and proud to have as neighbors.\n  It seems clear to me, Mr. President, that legal immigration is a boon \nto our Nation's economy and society. Unfortunately, S. 1394 tends to \nobscure the benefits of legal immigration because it contains \nprovisions addressing illegal immigration as well. Indeed, much of the \ndriving force behind S. 1394 is directed, not at those who legally come \nto this country, but at those who come here illegally. We can address \nthe illegal immigration problem through better border policing and \nbetter and swifter methods of deportation, particularly in regard to \ncriminal illegal aliens. And as I mentioned earlier, we have addressed \nthe welfare magnet problem in our welfare reform bill.\n  That's why I think we should split S. 1394 and move on illegal \nimmigration reform separately from legal immigration reform.\n  But even some of the illegal immigration components of S. 1394 go \nmuch farther than is necessary. Illegal immigrants now constitute 1.5 \npercent of our population. That is too high a percentage, but we need \nto examine more effective--and less intrusive ways--to control illegal \nimmigration.\n  This legislation proposes to end illegal immigration by requiring a \nnational Identification system for all employees. In order to get a new \njob, every American will have to prove his or her citizenship by \nshowing that he or she is listed on a specific, national computer \nregistry.\n  Before an employer can hire a new worker that employer will have to \ncontact the Federal Government for verification of the would-be \nemployee's citizenship. Thus we will construct a vast new Government \nbureaucracy, with vast new powers and, Mr. President, with cast new \ncosts.\n  Current estimates suggest that, with a national I.D. system, each \nwork place would have to spend nearly $800 for equipment alone. And the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service Telephone Verification Pilot \nSystem, often seen as a prototype for the new I.D. System, shows that \noperating costs could put many companies out of business. It is for \nthis reason that the Nation Federation of Independent Businesses--\nAmerica's leading small business organization--strongly opposes the \nI.D. system in S. 1394.\n  It is clear that the system itself will not work. It will be riddled \nwith errors. Indeed, current Social Security Administration files and \nerror rates show a probable error rate of between 25 and 28 percent for \nthe new system, making it far from effective. Even assuming an error \nrate of only 3 percent, the system would put in bureaucratic limbo or \neven deny jobs to 2 million Americans, most of them native-born U.S. \ncitizens.\n  Advocates of the proposed I.D. system in S. 1394 claim that it is \nonly a ``pilot project'' that would cover workers in just five States. \nHowever, these States--Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York and \nCalifornia--have a population greater than that of Mexico, indeed of \nall but the 10 largest countries in the world. According to Stuart \nAnderson of the Cato Institute, employers in these States would have to \ncheck the legal status of each new hire--an estimated 22 million \nannually in these five States--through this government I.D. system.\n  In my judgment, we should reject the national I.D. Cards and other \nsimilar schemes designed to control illegal immigration because they \nwill result in more government intrusion in the affairs of U.S. \ncitizens and businesses.\n  I am also troubled by other aspects of this bill that I will comment \nupon in more detail in the near future. For example, I am very \nconcerned about the proposed border tax, which would in effect \ndiscourage foreign tourists from spending their money in this country.\n  The debate over immigration reform will be a major issue in this \nchamber over the next year. I hope that we in this body will, first, \nreject some of the severe provisions of S. 1394 and second, move \nseparately on bills dealing with legal and illegal immigration. This \nwould constitute a statement of confidence in ourselves, in our nation \nand in the ability of immigrants, when extended the opportunities of \nour land to become productive members of our communities.\n  In closing Mr. President, I believe that our immigration policy both \nreflects and projects our Nation's character and level of decency. One \nman above all said it best. In his farewell address to the Nation, \nPresident Ronald Reagan declared:\n\n       I've spoken of the shinning city all my political life, but \n     I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I \n     said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on \n     rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and \n     teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace, \n     a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and \n     creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had \n     doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and \n     heart to get here. That's how I saw it and see it still.\n\n  The question for America is this: Shall we have a shining city on a \nhill or will we construct a fortress America? It is my hope that we \nwill choose the shining city.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 18, 1995]\n\n                          Geniuses From Abroad\n\n                           (By George Gilder)\n\n       The current immigration debate founders on ignorance of one \n     huge fact: Without immigration, the U.S. would not exist as a \n     world power. Without immigration, the U.S. could not have \n     produced the computerized weapons that induced the Soviet \n     Union to surrender in the arms race. Without immigration, the \n     U.S. could not have built the atomic bomb during World War \n     II, or the hydrogen bomb in the early 1950s, or \n     intercontinental missiles in the 1960s, or MIRVs in the \n     1970s, or cruise missiles for the Gulf War in the 1990s.\n       Today, immigrants are vital not only for targeted military \n     projects but also for the wide range of leading-edge ventures \n     in an information age economy. No less than military \n     superiority in previous eras, U.S. industrial dominance and \n     high standards of living today depend on outsiders.\n       Every high-technology company, big or small, is like a \n     Manhattan Project. All must mobilize the personnel best \n     trained and most able to perform a specific function, and \n     deliver a product within a window of opportunity as fateful \n     and remorseless as a war deadline. This requires access to \n     the small elite of human beings in the world capable of \n     pioneering these new scientific and engineering frontiers. \n     For many specialized high-technology tasks, the pool of \n     potential talent around the world numbers around 10 people, \n     or even fewer.\n\n\n                            The Right people\n\n       If you are running such a technology company, you will \n     quickly discover that the majority of this cognitive elite \n     are not citizens of your country. Unless you can find the \n     right people wherever they may be, you will not be able to \n     launch the exotic innovation that changes the world. Unless \n     you can fill the key technology jobs, you will not create any \n     other jobs at all, and your country will forgo the cycle of \n     new products, skills, and businesses that sustain a world-\n     leading standard of living.\n       Discussing the impact of immigration, economists and their \n     followers are beady-eyed gnatcatchers, expert on the \n     movements of cabbage pickers and au pair girls and the \n     possible impact of Cubans on Miami wage levels. But like \n     hunters in a cartoon, they ignore the tyrannosaurus rex \n     crouching behind them. Thus sophisticated analysts, such as \n     George Borjas of the University of California, San Diego, and \n     artful writers, such as Peter Brimelow, conclude that the \n     impact of immigration on the U.S. economy is slight or \n     negligible.\n       In fact, the evidence is overwhelming and undeniable; it is \n     all around us, in a spate of inventions and technical \n     advances, from microwaves and air bags to digital cable and \n     satellite television, from home computers and air \n     conditioners to cellular phones and lifesaving \n     pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Without immigration over \n     the last 50 years, I would estimate that U.S. real living \n     standards would be at least 40% lower.\n       The underplaying of immigration as an economic force stems \n     from a basic flaw in macroeconomic analysis. Economists fail \n     to account for the indispensable qualitative effects of \n     genius. Almost by definition, genius is the ability to \n     generate unique products \n\n[[Page S18917]]\n     and concepts and bring them to fruition. Geniuses are literally \n     thousands of times more productive than the rest of us. We \n     all depend on them for our livelihoods and opportunities.\n       The feats of genius are necessarily difficult to identify \n     or predict, except in retrospect. But judging from the very \n     rough metric of awards of mathematical doctorates and other \n     rigorous scientific and engineering degrees, prizes, patents, \n     and publications, about a third of the geniuses in the U.S. \n     are foreign born, and another 20% are the offspring of \n     immigrants. A third of all American Nobel Prize winners, for \n     example, were born overseas.\n       A stellar example of these elites in action is Silicon \n     Valley in California. Silicon Valley companies have reduce \n     the price of computer MIPs and memory bits by a factor of \n     some 10,000 in 2\\1/2\\ decades. Although mainstream economists \n     neglect to measure the qualitative impact of these \n     innovations, most of the new value in the world economy over \n     the last decade has stemmed, directly or indirectly, from \n     the semiconductor and computer industries, both hardware \n     and software.\n       Consider Intel Corp. Together with its parent, Fairchild \n     Semiconductor, Intel developed the basic processes of \n     microchip manufacture and created dynamic and static random \n     access memory, the microprocessor, and the electrically \n     programmable read-only memory. In other words, Intel laid the \n     foundations for the personal computer revolution and scores \n     of other chip-based industries that employ the vast bulk of \n     U.S. engineers today.\n       Two American-born geniuses, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, \n     were key founders of Fairchild and Intel. But their \n     achievements would have been impossible without the help of \n     Jean Hourni, inventor of planar processing; Dov Frohmann-\n     Benchkowski, inventor of electrically erasable programmable \n     ROMs; Federico Faggin, inventor of silicon gate technology \n     and builder of the first microprocessor; Mayatoshi Shima, \n     layout designer of key 8086 family devices; and of course \n     Andrew Grove, the company's now revered CEO who solved \n     several intractable problems of the metal oxide silicon \n     technology at the heart of Intel's growth. All these Intel \n     engineers--and hundreds of other key contributors--were \n     immigrants.\n       The pattern at Intel was repeated throughout Silicon \n     Valley, from National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro \n     Devices to Applied Materials, LSI Logic, Actel, Atmel, \n     Integrated Device Technologies, Xicor, Cypress, Sun \n     Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, all of which from the \n     outset heavily depended on immigrants in the laboratories and \n     on engineering workbenches. LSI, IDT, Actel, Atmel, Xicor, \n     and Sun were all founded or led by immigrants. Today, fully \n     one-third of all the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign \n     born.\n       Now, with Silicon Valleys proliferating throughout the U.S. \n     economy, with Silicon Deserts, Prairies, Mountains, and even \n     Alleys being hopefully launched from Manhattan to Oregon, \n     immigration becomes ever more vital to the future of the U.S. \n     economy. And microchips are just the beginning. On the \n     foundation of silicon have arisen world-leading software and \n     medical equipment industries almost equally dependent on \n     immigrants. As spearhead of the fastest growing U.S. \n     industry, software, Microsoft offers some of the most coveted \n     jobs in the U.S. economy. But for vital functions, it still \n     must turn to immigrants for 5% of its domestic work force, \n     despite the difficult and expensive legal procedures required \n     to import an alien.\n\n\n                         freedom of enterprise\n\n       In recent congressional testimony, Ira Rubenstein, a \n     Microsoft attorney, declared that immigration bars could \n     jeopardize the 58 percent of its revenue generated overseas, \n     threaten American dominance of advanced ``client-server'' \n     business applications, and render ``stillborn'' the \n     information superhighway. In particular, Corning and other \n     producers of fiber-optic technology have faced a severe \n     shortage of native engineers equipped to pursue this \n     specialty crucial to both telecommunications and medical \n     instruments.\n       With U.S. high school students increasingly shunning \n     mathematics and the hard sciences, America is the global \n     technology and economic leader in spite of, not because of, \n     any properties of the American gene pool or dominant culture. \n     America prevails only because it offers the freedom of \n     enterprise and innovation to people from around the world.\n       A decision to cut back legal immigration today, as Congress \n     is contemplating, is a decision to wreck the key element of \n     the American technological miracle. After botching the issues \n     of telecom deregulation and tax rate reduction, and wasting a \n     year on Hooverian myths about the magic of a balanced budget, \n     the Republican Congress now proposes to issue a deadly body \n     blow to the intellectual heart of U.S. growth. Congress must \n     not cripple the new Manhattan Projects of the U.S. economy in \n     order to pursue some xenophobic and archaic dream of ethnic \n     purity and autarky.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18914-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

and\n       ``Whereas this plan has far-reaching implications and was \n     developed without consultation with key elected leaders, \n     including state governors, members of the United States \n     Congress, or community, tribal government, and the Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) corporate leaders in \n     contradiction of President Clinton's Executive Order No. \n     12875 ``Enhancing Intergovernmental Partnerships''; and\n       ``Whereas Vice-President Gore's ``Report on Reinventing \n     Government'' was developed with the promised intent of \n     empowering local governments and decentralizing decision-\n     making power; and\n       ``Whereas the ``Reinvention of the Forest Service'' \n     strategic plan approved by Secretary of Agriculture Mike \n     Espy, just before his resignation, eliminates the very \n     foundation of locally based authority that had the \n     responsibility of working with states, local communities, \n     tribal governments, and ANCSA corporations and masks and \n     diffuses decision-making authority and withdraws it to \n     Washington, D.C., making the Forest Service less \n     responsive to local concerns; and\n       ``Whereas moving the Alaska Region Forest Service office to \n     Portland, Oregon, is an example of the flawed science being \n     used to define ecosystems and ecological boundaries; and\n       ``Whereas the newly defined purpose of the Forest Service \n     to promote the sustainability of ecosystems without \n     specifically retaining the traditional Forest Service \n     objective of promoting community stability has already \n     created problems and crises for hundreds of communities \n     dependent upon the national forests and state and private \n     forest ecosystems;

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to submit a \nreport on Indian tribal school construction funds to certain committees \nof Congress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n              tribal school construction funds legislation\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwould require the Department of Interior to report to Congress within \n30 days on the availability of unobligated tribal school construction \nfunds. These are funds that were appropriated for construction in a \nprevious fiscal year, but never spent.\n\n  Tribal schools have a deplorable backlog of needed construction and \nrepairs. Indian children continue to attend school in dilapidated and \neven condemned buildings despite congressional efforts to correct the \nproblems over the last several decades. Many in Congress are interested \nin finding ways to finance the cost of these needed improvements in the \nface of limited Federal resources. However, the first step is to \ndetermine and account for funds previously appropriated. This \naccounting is necessary in order to consider financing options.\n  I sincerely regret that it takes legislation to request an accounting \nof these unobligated funds. The distinguished chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, Senator McCain, and I repeatedly have asked the \nBureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] for a report, but the BIA has refused to \nprovide this information. I sincerely hope that this refusal is not due \nto mismanagement of this particular BIA account. Therefore, in light of \nthe BIA's failure to accurately account for its own budget, legislation \nis necessary. I look forward to hearing from the BIA on this matter and \nwill work with my colleagues on this important issue. The bottom-line \ngoal is to provide native American children a positive, healthy, and \nsafe environment to learn.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I submit a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nurging Trinidad and Tobago's accession to the North American Free Trade \nAgreement [NAFTA]. Trinidad and Tobago's admission to the NAFTA between \nthe United States, Mexico and Canada is essential to ensuring continued \ngrowth and prosperity. Participation in the NAFTA and the contemplated \nFree Trade Agreement of the Americas will promote sustained economic \ndevelopment and increased commercial activity between Trinidad and \nTobago and its hemisphere neighbors. Indeed, free trade in the western \nhemisphere would be in the common economic interest because it would be \nwealth-maximizing for all members.\n  Trinidad and Tobago is well prepared to undertake the obligations of \nNAFTA. As one of the most advanced economies in the Caribbean, the \nisland nation has successfully implemented economic reforms that have \nderegulated industry, lowered tariff barriers, and promoted investment. \nIts achievements are in keeping with criteria for NAFTA eligibility \nthat the Administration has laid out in negotiations with Chile.\n  Trinidad and Tobago has enjoyed good relations with the United States \nthrough the years. The two countries share a fundamental commitment to \ncivil liberties and human rights. In recent years cooperation has \nincluded working to curtail illegal drug shipments and money laundering \nin the hemisphere and sharing information relating to customs \nmodernization and reorganization. Trinidad and Tobago and the United \nStates have long enjoyed cordial diplomatic relations as well as strong \neconomic ties arising from the investment of United States companies in \nthe energy sector of Trinidad and Tobago. Both countries have dedicated \nsignificant resources to the full restoration of democracy and free \nmarket development in nearby Haiti and Cuba.\n  The end of the cold war has altered the nature of the U.S. interest \nin the Caribbean. Apart from geographic proximity, the flow of people, \ncommodities, culture, and a shared interest in combatting drug \ntrafficking, protection of economic interests and fragile ecosystems \nhave bound the hemispheric together as never before. As with United \nStates-Mexico relations, United States-Caribbean relations dramatically \ndemonstrate the inseparability of foreign and domestic issues.\n  The opportunities for growth and investment for U.S. companies are \nincreasing. The Trinidad and Tobago oil and gas industry is growing \nsteadily, spurring growth in an increasingly diversified economy. This \npresents excellent opportunities for United States companies interested \nin conducting operations in the Caribbean as a nexus for trade with \nSouth America and the Pacific Rim through the Panama canal.\n  Sustainable growth can be most readily achieved in Trinidad and \nTobago by its integration into the regional trade framework. Trade \nbetween Caribbean countries accounts for a mere 4 percent of their \nexports, and investment between the countries of the region is \nnegligible. Trinidad and Tobago is an economic leader within CARICOM, \nprovides most of the current investment and is major creditor in the \nregion. The economies are small; domestic markets and intra-Caribbean \nmarkets cannot absorb production and therefore cannot foster meaningful \ntrade expansion. Future economic prosperity for Trinidad and Tobago \nlies in its rapid integration into the North American market.\n  Economic Reform. Over the past several years, Trinidad and Tobago has \ncreated a solid macroeconomic climate through a strong governmental \ncommitment to private-sector-led expansion and export growth. Trinidad \nand Tobago has had an aggressive program of divestment of public \nholdings in commercial companies. Fifteen companies have been divested \nover the past 3 years, including the generation division of the \nnational electric company, the national airline and the iron and steel \ncompany. Divestment procedures are in progress for another 13 \ncompanies.\n  Trinidad and Tobago's aggressive economic reform policy decisions, \nrigorously implemented, have yielded positive results and created \nallies out of many skeptics in the business community. Despite the \nsupport for high labor standards and protection of workers' rights and \ndespite actual reductions in unemployment--currently about 18 percent--\nthe macro-economic reforms cannot by themselves reduce unemployment to \nacceptable levels.\n  Trinidad and Tobago's Government accounts are now tractable. The \nfiscal deficit, which averaged 7.2 percent in 1986-88, has been reduced \nto 1.7 percent over the last 5 years. In 1994, the government closed \nthe year with a small \n\n[[Page S18922]]\nfiscal surplus and expects a similar result again in 1995.\n  The balance of payments in Trinidad and Tobago has also begun to \ndemonstrate a new robustness. Following 11 years of continuous deficit, \nfor the past 2 years the external accounts were in surplus. A \nsupportive monetary policy is in place, aimed at restraining exchange \nreserves. As a result, inflation is moderate and falling. The inflation \nrate from September 1993 to September 1994 was only 6.4 percent. The \ngovernment floated the Trinidad dollar in 1993 and has now fully \nabsorbed the devaluation occasioned by that flotation. The exchange \nrate has held remarkably firm. Consequently, the inflation rate is \nexpected to fall under 5 percent this year.\n  The external debt service payments have been onerous--well over a \nhalf a billion U.S. dollars last year. Nevertheless, the government has \nreduced the debt significantly and it now represents barely 30 percent \nof GDP--this down from 42 percent in 1992.\n  Trinidad and Tobago has instituted a major structural adjustment away \nfrom import substitution and is vigorously pursuing a policy of export \nled growth. Almost overnight, the old tariff structure has been \ndismantled. In 1991, 40 percent of the items were removed from the \nimport negative list. In 1995, the temporary surcharge imposed \nsubsequent to the removal of items from the negative list, was reduced \nto zero.\n  In 1994, the majority of agricultural items were removed from the \nnegative list. Nevertheless, total output in this sector increased by \nalmost 12 percent. Consistent with the obligations within CARICOM, the \nexisting maximum tariff of 30 percent will be phased down to 20 percent \nby 1998. It is important to note, however, that a more accurate \nreflection of the openness of the trade regime is that average tariff \nrates are now less than 6 percent for imports from the United States.\n  Favorable Investment Climate. The best proof of the success in \ncreating a favorable investment climate is evidenced by the surge of \ndirect investment. In 1995, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago \nreduced the corporate tax rate for foreign investors from 45 to 38 \npercent. In 1994, investment flows from the U.S. reached almost $700 \nmillion and for 1995, the country has commitments for $1.2 billion. \nTrinidad and Tobago will easily surpass all other countries in the \nhemisphere in attracting foreign investment.\n  Trinidad and Tobago will, as a member of the NAFTA, maintain United \nStates environmental, health and safety workplace standards. Trinidad \nand Tobago's Government procurement provisions guarantee United States \nfirms the ability to compete for government contracts. Tariffs on most \nU.S. exports have been eliminated in the computer, oil refining \nequipment, special industrial machinery, pharmaceutical, \ntelecommunications and photographic equipment and sectors. In addition, \nTrinidad and Tobago has signed both a Bilateral Investment Treaty [BIT] \nand Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights with the United States.\n  Hemispheric Energy Security. Trinidad and Tobago is a major oil-\nproducing country. Trinidad's 10.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas \nreserves represents a 45-year reserves life index. The economy is based \nlargely on its plentiful reserves of petroleum and natural gas. As a \nresult, Trinidad and Tobago has developed good relationships with \nUnited States oil companies involved in oil and gas development and \nextraction. The strategic geographic location of the islands has \nfavored the establishment of large oil refineries and other facilities \ndesigned to promote energy research and to produce natural gas and \npetroleum by-products such as methanol and ammonia fertilizer.\n  Trinidad and Tobago is the world's second largest exporter of \nnitrogenous ammonia fertilizer, a natural gas by-product. One-third of \nthe United States 3 million tons of ammonia imports come from Trinidad \nand Tobago annually, valued at $240 million in 1994, according to U.S. \nCommerce Department figures. This is equal to about 5 percent of U.S. \nammonia fertilizer usage annually.\n  The United States currently imports 80 MBD of crude oil and petroleum \nproducts from Trinidad and Tobago valued at over $500 million a year in \n1994, or 1 percent of the Nation's oil imports.\n  Cooperation on Drug Trafficking. Trinidad and Tobago has modernized \nits customs operations. It has introduced the automated system for the \ncollection of customs data, which is now operational in most of the \ncountry. Officials expect that this critical element in the \nadministrative reform of the Customs department will be extended to \nTobago and to the industrial estate at Point Lisas during 1995.\n  Trinidad and Tobago is not a major producer, consumer or trafficker \nof illegal drugs, precursor chemicals, or money laundering. The \nGovernment and the people of Trinidad and Tobago recognize that illegal \ndrugs are disruptive to public health, safety, and the social fabric. \nBusiness people contend that money laundering undermines legitimate \neconomic activities. The effects of illegal drug related activity are \nlikely to increase, particularly if economies suffer and drug related \nwork is seen as one of the few income producing opportunities \navailable.\n  Passage of the Dangerous Drugs Amendment in November 1994 brought the \nlaws of Trinidad and Tobago into conformity with the requirements of \nthe 1988 United Nations Convention. The new law prohibits activities \nregarding the manufacture of precursor chemicals, money laundering \nactivities, assets forfeiture, and removal of impediments to effective \nprosecution.\n  Since 1992, local Trinidad and Tobago banks have voluntarily reported \nlarge deposits to the police department's Office of Strategic Services \n[OSS], a special unit built to diminish the availability of banking \nservices to traffickers. OSS collects intelligence on financial \ntransactions and in 1994 published a money laundering information \npamphlet for local financial institutions.\n  Conclusion. Mr. President, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago \ndeserves consideration as the next country to accede to NAFTA, \nfollowing Chile. It has successfully undertaken economic reforms that \nhave attracted foreign investment, reduced debt, and expanded the \nprivate sector. In order to further expand its economy, Trinidad and \nTobago needs greater access to the larger markets of the hemisphere. \nThe reality is that Caribbean economies are small. Domestic markets and \nintra-Caribbean markets alone, cannot absorb production and therefore \ncannot foster meaningful trade expansion. Future economic prosperity \nfor Trinidad and Tobago--as well as for other eligible countries--lies \nin its rapid integration into the North American market. In submitting \nthis resolution, I hope Trinidad and Tobago can soon be considered for \nmembership in the NAFTA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18921-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               committee on environment and public works\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself \nand my \n\n[[Page S18923]]\ndistinguished colleague, Senator Brown, the senior Senator from \nColorado. I know I speak for him as well, as I address the Senate \ntoday.\n  On April 1, 1954 President Eisenhower signed Public Law 325, the Air \nAcademy Act. On June 24, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Talbott \nannounced that Colorado Springs would be the permanent site of the U.S. \nAir Force Academy and Denver would serve as the temporary site. Senator \nEd Johnson stated, ``This is the greatest thing that has happened to \nColorado since Pikes Peak was discovered by Zebulon Pike.'' The U.S. \nAir Force Academy was officially activated at Lowry Air Force Base, \nJuly 27, 1954, and proceeded to build in strength pending the arrival \nof the first class of cadets--July 11, 1955--which date marks the \nofficial dedication and opening of the U.S. Air Force Academy.\n  Dedication Day began with the arrival of the 307 young men who would \ncomprise the Class of 1959. The morning was spent in processing, \nuniforms, hair cuts, and so forth, and by 11 a.m. they were lined up \nfor intensive close order drill instruction. That afternoon, with the \nstands filled with 4,159 military and civilian dignitaries, public \nofficials, the foreign attache corps, cadets from West Point and \nAnnapolis, the press and parents, with a formation of B-36 bombers \nflying overhead, and with the U.S. Air Force Band playing, the 307 \ncadets marched on the field in such perfect formation it brought tears \nin the eyes of the spectators.\n  At the end of the ceremonies, the guests were invited by the Denver \nChamber of Commerce to attend a real chuck wagon buffalo barbecue at \nthe Red Rocks Park Amphitheater, a fitting climax to a historic day.\n  We Coloradans are, indeed, proud that Colorado was chosen as the \nlocation of the temporary and permanent sites of the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy. The Nation is, indeed, proud of the outstanding leaders who \nhave graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy--both in the Air Force \nand civilian life.\n  We would also like to pay tribute to those officers whose wisdom and \nforesight in the Academy's inception insured a great measure of the \nsuccess that has been achieved by the Academy. Among these are Lt. Gen. \nHubert R. Harmon, the first Superintendent and Father of the U.S. Air \nForce Academy; Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Robert M. Stillman, Commandant \nof Cadets; Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Robert F. McDermott, Dean; Col. \nWilliam B. Taylor III, Assistant Chief of Staff (Special Projects), and \nCol. Robert V. Whitlow, Director of Athletics.\n\n\nLt. Gen. Hubert R. Harmon, first Superintendent and Father of the U.S. \n                           Air Force Academy\n\n  President Eisenhower personally selected his close friend and West \nPoint classmate Lt. Gen. Hubert R. Harmon to be the new Air Force \nAcademy's first Superintendent as he knew ``Doodles'' Harmon would be, \nby far, the best man for the job. General Harmon was from a prominent \nmilitary family as his father and two brothers were West Point \ngraduates, as were the husbands of his two sisters. His wife, Rosa May \nKendricks' father was U.S. Senator John B. Kendricks (Wyoming). He had \na distinguished military career being equally at home at an Academy \nfootball game--even though he weighed only 146 pounds, he won his ``A'' \nin football--piloting a combat airplane--the distinguished flying cross \nwith cluster--on the golf course with President Eisenhower; as Air \nAttache at the Court of St. James; and at the United Nations where he \nwas the Senior U.S. Military Representative.\n  In December 1949, he was given the additional duty of Special \nAssistant to the Chief of Staff for Air Force Academy Matters charged \nwith all details of developing ideas into an operational Air Force \nAcademy. For the next 5 years, General Harmon and his team conferred \nendlessly with distinguished educators from all parts of the country; \nsifted and weighed the curriculum of universities and Service Academies \nin the United States and abroad, searching out the best features of \neach so painstaking by examining every suggestion referred to them by \nCongress or the Defense Department for its merit and workability. Every \neffort was made to select the finest officers for each segment of the \nAcademy, to prepare the academic and military course material and, as \nrequired, to send officers to universities for specific academic \ntraining.\n  During the numerous meetings held in the Pentagon, the Bureau of the \nBudget and in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee hearings, \nGeneral Harmon was the star witness, selling the U.S. Air Force Academy \nconcept, which led to the passage of Public Law 325, 83d Congress, the \nAir Academy Act signed by President Eisenhower April 1, 1954. On June \n24, Secretary Talbott announced that the Academy would be located at \nColorado Springs and pending the design and construction of the \npermanent facilities, the Academy would be located at a temporary site \nat Denver (Lowry). On August 14, General Order No. 1 announced the \nofficial establishment of the Academy at Lowry--effective July 27--with \nGeneral Harmon as its superintendent.\n\n  He was a very meticulous person and was involved in all major aspects \nof the Academy, that is, rehabilitation of Lowry's buildings, the \nphasing in of all personnel; insuring that all items required to \noperate all facets of the Academy were procured and in place and, most \nimportant, that the new Academy would attract the most outstanding \nyoung men who were to be the future leaders of the Air Force.\n  General Harmon was an outstanding example of the ideal leader, a \nbrilliant, thoughtful, dynamic, respectful, understanding officer whose \nmen would gladly follow him anywhere.\n  With the arrival of the Academy's first class of cadets at Lowry on \nJuly 11, 1955, the U.S. Air Force Academy was born, with Lt. Gen. \nHubert R. Harmon overseeing them as the Academy's ``Proud Father!'' As \nPresident Eisenhower later wrote ``Hubert was loved and admired by \nmany; to Mamie and me he always seemed the ideal classmate and so we \nhad for him a boundless affection.'' This was shared by Gen. Thomas D. \nWhite, Air Force Chief of Staff, who wrote, ``The Air Force has lost \none of its most inspiring leaders and the Father of our new Air Force \nAcademy.'' Senator Gordon Allott (Colorado), who served under General \nHarmon in World War II, wrote, ``Few have had as much courage and set \nso fine an example as he did. His quiet, fair and, above all, his \ngenuine qualities have been stamped on the entire Academy and I believe \nwill be reflected in every student who graduates.''\n\n\n                 Brig. Gen. Robert M. (Moose) Stillman\n\n  Brig. Gen. Robert M. (Moose) Stillman was the ideal officer to be \nappointed the first Commandant of Cadets. He was a leader's leader \nhaving been a star football player and line coach at West Point, 8th \nAir Force Bomb Group Commander, POW at Stalag Luft III, and, while \nserving in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, was \ninvolved in the early planning of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Moose was \nmore mature than most of the other key Academy officers as he was West \nPoint 1933, whereas McDermott, Whitlow and others were West Point 1943. \nHe was a burly, genial man with a great sense of humor and was an avid \nsportsman. Colorado was his State as he grew up in Pueblo and attended \nColorado College in Colorado Springs before entering West Point.\n  As there were no upper classmen to supervise the ``Doolies'' \n(plebes), outstanding young officers, many with Korean combat records, \nwere assigned to be the Air Training Officers and Air Officer's \nCommanding to fill this vital role. As their careers progressed, many \nof these officers became key U.S. Air Force officials, that is, Chief \nof Staff, Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy, and so forth.\n  ``Moose'' Stillman used a modified version of the West Point \nCommandant of Cadets system which proved to be most successful in the \ninstallation of command and leadership into the future Air Force \nleaders. The basic fundamentals of this system are incorporated into \ntoday's curriculum.\n  The training function as envisioned by General Stillman was divided \ninto three main components: Military training, flying training, and \nphysical training, thus the individual cadets would experience a 4-year \nlaboratory exercise in command and leadership. At all stages of the \nplanning for the Academy, the philosophy of a ``sound mind in a sound \nbody'' was recognized as a fundamental principle. To assist him in \nrunning the Commandant of Cadets Department, he hand picked outstanding \n\n\n[[Page S18924]]\nyoung Majors, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels, many of whom were later \npromoted to General Officer and held major Air Force positions.\n  When General Stillman turned over the Command of the Cadet Wing on \nAugust 1, 1958, the mould had been set which other Commandants were \nprepared to implement. It is only fitting that the Academy Parade \nGround has recently been named the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Stillman Parade \nGround in honor of this outstanding officer.\n\n\n                 Col. (Brig. Gen.) Robert F. Mc Dermott\n\n  McDermott, as his close friends call him, attended Norwich University \nfor 2 years before entering West Point, graduating in 1943. After \nservice as a fighter pilot in the European theater he served as a \npersonnel staff officer in the Pentagon and then to Harvard for his \nMBA. From 1950 to 1954 (when he was assigned to the faculty of the new \nU.S. Air Force Academy) he was an instructor in the West Point \nDepartment of Social Studies under the tutelage of two distinguished \nmilitary educators, Col. Herman Blukema and Col. George Lincoln. From \nthe Academy's inception in 1954 he served as Professor and Head of the \nDepartment of Economics with additional duties as Faculty Secretary, \nVice Dean, Acting Dean and later Dean (replacing Brig. Gen. Don \nZimmerman).\n  McDermott was a visionary in that he realized that the university \neducational system was undergoing a drastic change and that the new \nU.S. Air Force Academy's curriculum must reflect this change in order \nto meet the educational and technological challenges of the modern \nworld. The first major change was the Academy's Enrichment Program \nwhich was designed for the gifted cadets and those who had completed \ncollege level courses at other institutions. The Enrichment Program \nbroadens the field of study, challenging the cadet to advance \nacademically as far and fast as the cadet was able to accomplish. The \nintroduction of the curriculum enrichment program was the first major \ndeparture from the traditional service academy philosophy--that all \nstudents should pursue and be limited to a prescribed course of study--\nand was an outstanding success.\n\n  He also introduced the whole man concept in selecting cadets for \nappointment, which gave weighted recognition to the physical, athletic, \nmoral and leadership attributes of a candidate as well as his academic \npotential and registered scholastic achievements. This soon became the \nstandard admission policy of all Service Academies and earned \nMcDermott,the award of the Legion of Merit. During his long tenure as \nDean, McDermott established programs and policies which two decades \nlater still influence established programs and policies. He created a \ntenure associate Professor Program designed to keep the Academy's \ndoctoral level to that in civilian universities. He established a \nsabbatical leave program for all tenure professors. He started a \nfaculty research program in support of graduate level teaching and \nrelated Air Force research programs, etc.\n  McDermott was an extraordinary individual. His educational \nbackground, with its vigorous training and grueling workload, had given \nhim confidence in his ability to achieve his goals. His influence came \nfrom hard work, mastery of detail, and from his remarkable ability to \nexpress his ideas and express his proposals in a forceful way--as his \nverbal skills were second to none.\n  Under his leadership the Academy experienced unprecedented academic \nachievements. By the time of McDermott's retirement in 1968, graduates \nhad won 9 Rhodes Scholarships, 20 Fulbright Scholarships, and 73 other \nfellowships and scholarships, which no other institution of higher \nlearning has achieved in such a short time of its inception.\n  The Academy and the U.S. Air Force was indeed fortunate to have in \nits formative years a dean with the wisdom and foresight of Robert F. \nMcDermott.\n\n\n                       Col. William B. Taylor III\n\n  Col. William B. Taylor III played two major roles. First as the \nLegislative Officer, representing the Secretary of the Air Force, and, \nin coordination with Lt. Gen. Harmon, was tasked with the Air Force and \ninterservice coordination; White House approval and, action through the \nCongress of legislation to establish a U.S. Air Force Academy. To \naccomplish this, Colonel Taylor absorbed and organized an abundance of \ninformation--which had accumulated for more than 6 years--running the \ngauntlet of wishfulness to projections of an operating Academy with a \nhistory of tradition, picking out the essential information, monitoring \nits organization, and presentation in a manner essential to its \npassage. Colonel Taylor's efforts in behalf of the Air Academy \nlegislation were of inestimable value to the Air Force and it is \ndifficult to conceive of anyone who could have performed this mission \nmore effectively and in such an outstanding manner.\n  Second, as Assistant Chief of Staff (Special Projects) from January \n1955-July 1958, Colonel Taylor had a major input in almost every major \nstaff action. He was project officer for the dedication of the U.S. Air \nForce Academy, July 11, 1955, at Lowry which the arrival of the 307 \ninitial cadets, flyovers, speeches, important military and civilian \nguests, cadets from West Point and Annapolis, parents, receptions, and \nentertainment signified the Academy's first operational day. As the \nLiaison Officer, Air Force Academy Foundation, he replaced the \nfoundation's professional fundraiser and played a major role in the \nplanning and implementation of the following projects: the Eisenhower \nchampionship golf course, the Farrish Memorial Park Cadet Recreational \nCenter, the Professional Football Exhibition Benefit Game program, the \ndrafting of the initial fundraising plans for the Academy stadium, the \nVisitors Center, and other projects adopted by the foundation. He \norganized and was secretary to the Board of Visitors 1956-1958. The \nboard's secretary must show great tact and inspire confidence while \nrepresenting the Academy during the critical annual inspection period. \nRepresentative J. Edgar Chenoweth (CO), Chairman of the Academy's first \nBoard of Visitors, congratulated Colonel Taylor on his performance, \nstating the Board's Report was the best he had seen. Similar comments \nwere received from Representative Errett Scrivner and Gen. Carl Spaatz, \nthe 1957 and 1958 chairman.\n  Cecil B. DeMille, at the request of Secretary Talbott, agreed to \ndesign the cadet uniforms. Colonel Taylor headed the team that worked \nwith Mr. DeMille, and associates from Paramount and Western Costume to \ncreate their successful uniform designs.\n  Colonel Taylor, due to personal contact with Col. Richard Gimbel and \nCol. Robert Elbert, played a main role in the Gimbel Collection of \nAeronautical Memorabilia--the world's finest--and the Elbert paintings \n``The Duke of Wellington (Laurence),'' ``Sir Robert Peele,'' and ``The \nDuke of Douglas (Romney),'' which are worth many million dollars, being \ngiven to the Academy.\n  In order to achieve nationwide support for the Academy, Colonel \nTaylor instituted the Candidate Advisory Program utilizing the Air \nForce Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force ROTC, Air Force Recruiting \nService, Air Force Retired Personnel, and others to appear before the \n26,000-plus high schools and public audiences to promote the U.S. Air \nForce Academy. This program has been an outstanding success.\n  Colonel Taylor implemented the Civic Leaders Program whereby civic \nleaders, educators, clergymen, the press, and others from major cities \nwere brought to the Academy for briefings and indoctrination to insure \nthat on their return they would use their influence to assist the \nAcademy in securing the finest type of young men. As an example of the \neffectiveness of this program, Dr. Edwin D. Harrison, president of \nGeorgia Tech, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, wrote Superintendent M/G \nJames E. Briggs ``In closing, I feel it imperative to mention that I \nbelieve Col. William B. Taylor to be one of the finest officers and the \nfinest gentleman it has ever been my pleasure to meet. I am sure he \nwill leave an indelible mark on the formative period of the Academy.''\n  On his assignment to Spain in July 1958, Colonel Taylor had been \nassociated with the Air Academy project longer than anyone in the U.S. \nAir Force.\n\n\n                         Col. Robert V. Whitlow\n\n  Col. Robert V. Whitlow, the Director of Athletics, played a major \nrole in the \n\n[[Page S18925]]\nAcademy. He was an athlete's athlete. Bob excelled in football in high \nschool and, at UCLA for 3 years before entering West Point, where he \nwon 3 major letters--in football, basketball, and track. After service \nas a pilot in World War II, he was assigned to the Collegio Militar, \nMexico's West Point as an exchange English instructor and football \ncoach. In 2 years, they won Mexico's national football championship. \nDuring his next assignment, at the Air Defense Command, Colorado \nSprings, he played golf with key generals and dignitaries such as Gen. \nRosie O'Donnell, General Harmon, and to be Secretary Harold Talbott, \nthus paving the way for his selection as Director of Athletics.\n  Whitlow believed that football was the way to get the new Academy the \nwidest publicity and football was the best way to raise money quickly \nso that an aggressive athletic program could be launched. His initial \ngoal was to get sixty top flight athletes as cadets as soon as \npossible. Bob was a very determined and intense man, with supreme \nconfidence in his ability to whip the new cadets into a formidable \nfootball team. A most astute move on his part was to hire Buck Shaw, \nformer coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, to coach the football team. He \nthen proceeded to schedule games with top ranked colleges to present \nthe team with the utmost challenge, an almost impossible task--which \nwas farther compounded when you realize the entering first class was \nonly 307 cadets, the second 300 cadets, the third 306 cadets, and the \nfourth 453 for a total of only 1,366 cadets--all representing a brand \nnew college that had just entered the collegiate athletic world.\n  It is almost inconceivable that at the end of the fourth football \nseason, largely due to the spirit, drive and determination of Bob \nWhitlow, Coach Buck Shaw and assistants--and Col. George Simler and \nCoach Ben Martin who followed Whitlow and Shaw--the Air Force Academy \nfootball team battled Texas Christian to a scoreless tie in the Cotton \nBowl--an unbelievable feat not to be duplicated by any team from a \nbrand new college. This performance immediately paved the way for the \nsuccessful fund raising effort to build the Falcon Stadium at the \nAcademy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18922-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SENATE?\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there is a great deal of discussion \nabout Senate retirements, some of it involving this Senator.\n  I think all of our colleagues would do well to read an editorial \nabout the retirements that appeared in the St. Louis Post Dispatch \nwhich I ask to be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     What's Wrong With the Senate?\n\n       With the retirement announcements in recent days of two \n     more veteran GOP senators--Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Mark \n     Hatfield of Oregon--the number of senators stepping down next \n     year has reached a record: 12. It may yet go higher. Not \n     since 1896, when senators were still elected by state \n     legislatures, not directly by the voters, have so many quit. \n     Why?\n       Some suggest three terms is a magic number, after which \n     fatigue sets in, and, indeed, five of the 12 retirees have \n     served three terms. But the rest have had service ranging \n     from one to five terms, and their ages range from 52 to 77. \n     So there's no pat formula when it comes to fatigue.\n       Many of the retirees have expressed disgust with the overly \n     partisan tone today, as well as the distracting burden of \n     constant fund raising--though not all did say so in their \n     retirement announcements. Still, one thing is clear: Most of \n     the retirees were senior members of major committees and held \n     substantial power, and nearly all were pragmatists used to \n     working across party lines. Apparently, the prospect of \n     continued influence wasn't enough to keep the 12 in the \n     Senate.\n       The characteristic all of them have in common was stated by \n     Mr. Simpson. He said, ``The definition of politics is this: \n     There are no right answers, only a continuing flow of \n     compromises . . . resulting in a changing . . . ambiguous \n     series of public decisions, where appetite and ambition \n     compete openly with knowledge and wisdom.'' That is a good \n     description of the legislative process at its best. It is \n     also completely opposed to the philosophy of the newer GOP \n     members who now control Congress and seek to dominate both \n     the party and the country.\n       Under such circumstances, those of moderate tone, even if \n     their politics vary across the spectrum from right to left, \n     inevitably must feel out of place. Though one, Bob Packwood \n     of Oregon, was forced to resign because of scandal and two \n     more are well into their 70s, the retirement of 12 senators \n     in one year suggests Congress is losing many of its best \n     people for the worst reasons. When will the American people \n     put a stop to this by rejecting the poisonous politics of \n     absolute truth and relentless demonization of those who see \n     things differently?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18925-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNITION OF THE BRONZE CRAFT FOUNDRY'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the owners \nand employees of the Bronze Craft Co. of Nashua, NH for over 50 years \nof service and dedication to the community.\n  Bronze Craft was founded in 1944 by Arthur ``Artie'' Atkinson. This \nsmall foundry began its business by making custom architectural \nhardware. Fifty years later, the company is still owned by the same \nfamily, and the traditions of good business and dedication to employees \nare still the hallmark of Bronze Craft.\n  Since its inception, the company has delivered for its employees in \nmany ways, not the least of which has been providing long-term \ndependable employment. It is no surprise that by maintaining a \nprofessional run foundry and adhering to the highest health, safety, \nand environmental standards for its employees, that the foundry can \ntake pride in its many multi-generational employees.\n  Jack Atkinson, who succeeded his father in 1980 as president and CEO, \ncontinues to champion innovative employee participatory programs such \nas continuous improvement through employee suggestions and strategic \naction teams. Mr. Atkinson is a credit to the Nashua community, and is \nto be commended for his innovative thinking. His recent appointment to \nthe executive board of the Non-Ferrous Founders' Society serves as \nrecognition of his leadership in the foundry industry.\n  It is businesses such as Bronze Craft, which put employees and \nquality first, that set such a high standard for others in the \nindustry. Their proven success demonstrates the importance of such \nvision. The American Legion has been a customer since 1944, and \nrecently Bronze Craft was recognized by Steinway & Sons as the Malcolm \nBaldrige Award Winner for quality and service.\n  Mr. President, I praise the owners and employees of Bronze Craft for \ntheir untiring efforts to provide quality products, which help make \nAmerica stronger, independent and economically successful. I would also \nlike to recognize the thousands of small foundries, like Bronze Craft, \nlocated in urban and rural areas alike in all 50 States. Their \noutstanding devotion and contributions to making their workplace, \ncommunity, and country a better place to live ensures a hopeful \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18925-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18925-S18926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IF NOT THERE, WHERE?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as we continue to discuss the \nBosnian situation, and we will continue to discuss it long after the \nresolution has been adopted, I came across an editorial in the \nChristian Century by James M.

He resisted \n     earlier calls for military action, and worked instead for an \n     agreement between combatants which makes it possible for U.S. \n     troops to go to Bosnia not to fight but to prevent others \n     from fighting. Richard Holbrooke's negotiating team in \n     Dayton, Ohio, worked with representatives from Bosnia, Serbia \n     and Croatia to end a war in which at least 250,000 people \n     have died or are missing.\n       The combatants are scheduled to sign the Dayton agreement \n     this month in Paris. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia \n     was persuaded by NATO air strikes, a punishing economic \n     embargo and military successes by Croatia and the Muslim-led \n     Bosnia government that his goal of a greater Serbia was \n\n[[Page S18926]]\n     unattainable. Resistance to the accord has predictably surfaced among \n     Bosnian Serbs because under terms of the agreement Sarajevo \n     will be under Muslim control.\n       Why intervene in Bosnia, and why now? We must first \n     understand that the U.S. is a nation guided by both \n     humanitarian ideals and practical necessities. Our ideals \n     misled us in Vietnam, where we learned the hard way that \n     civil wars are not resolved by outside military force. From \n     our intervention in Somalia we learned that our humanitarian \n     zeal has to be tempered by practical wisdom. We can feed \n     starving people, but we cannot force a political solution on \n     them.\n       Since the end of the cold war the U.S. has been the only \n     world power with the ability to secure a peace through \n     whatever means are appropriate. We have the military might to \n     enforce agreements. The question is: Do we have the will to \n     get involved in conflicts far from American shores?\n       It was clearly the presence of oil in the Persian Gulf that \n     led President Bush to claim that vital American interests \n     were involved when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The former Yugoslavia \n     contains no oil, and trade with the region is not critical to \n     the U.S. economy. Nevertheless, instability in that region \n     could easily spill over into surrounding countries. It was \n     instability in this region that precipitated World War I, a \n     fact which led Pope John Paul II, during his recent visit to \n     the U.S., to plead with Clinton not to let the century \n     conclude, as it started, with a war over Sarajevo.\n       In making his case to the American people and a skeptical \n     Congress, Clinton argued that without U.S. participation the \n     combatants would not have reached the Dayton accord, nor \n     would the European nations in NATO have agreed to supply an \n     additional 40,000 peacekeeping troops to the region. The more \n     persuasive case for U.S. involvement, however, is the harsh \n     reality of the situation: only the commitment of an outside \n     force can keep the warring parties in Bosnia from continuing \n     their mutual slaughter.\n       At one level, the U.S. and NATO assignment in Bosnia is to \n     prevent a recurrence of the war that began in 1991. At \n     another level, however, the U.S. and NATO are making \n     themselves available as a peace broker for enemies who must \n     slowly and painfully build a future together. We cannot \n     arrange that future, but we can help stop those who want to \n     determine the future through violence.\n       Reinhold Niebuhr pointed out that modern technology has \n     increased our capacity for intimacy even as it provides us \n     with the tools to fight wars that avoid intimacy. We need, as \n     Niebuhr argued more than 50 years ago, to develop ``political \n     instruments which will make such new intimacy and \n     interdependence sufferable.'' Our survival depends on finding \n     a way to accept the ``interpenetration of cultures'' rather \n     than turning to mutual destruction.\n       The peacekeeping force that goes to Bosnia will offer only \n     a partial correction of past errors and blatant wrongdoing on \n     the part of several nations and many individuals. We are \n     sending troops to an area that has witnessed ethnic \n     cleansing, torture, indiscriminate killing of civilians, and \n     rape as an instrument of war. We go to the region not to \n     solve problems but to permit Serbs, Muslims and Croats to \n     struggle toward their own solutions. Sending U.S. forces into \n     a region full of generations-old patterns of hatred and \n     aggression is dangerous. But the alternative is worse. If we \n     do not support the peace process, we invite the return of an \n     unceasing war that breeds further hatred and aggression.\n       The U.S. is blessed with wealth and resources and the means \n     to act on behalf of others. We may regard this peace mission \n     as we might speak of any effort on behalf of a people in \n     need. We go to Bosnia not to control or dominate others, but \n     to help others to do what they cannot do for \n     themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18925-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING CATHY MYERS\n\n Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, one of the impressive leaders in \nour world is a legislator little known by most Americans. He is Martin \nC.M. Lee, who has led the forces for democracy in Hong Kong and has \ncourageously stood up for freedom and democracy and human rights in \nHong Kong.\n  He does that in the face of a Chinese takeover of Hong Kong that is \nslated in 1\\1/2\\ years from now.\n  Recently, he had an op-ed piece in the Washington Post that I hope \nthe leaders of China will see.\n  On the possibility that more Chinese leaders will see it, I ask that \nit be printed in full in the Record. I hope that all the Members of the \nSenate and House and their staffs will read it also to help prepare \nthem for what may happen come 1997.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       What Makes Hong Kong Tick\n\n                          (By Martin C.M. Lee)\n\n       Hong Kong.--On June 30, 1997, Hong Kong and its 6 million \n     free citizens will become part of the People's Republic of \n     China. As the countdown to 1997 advances, the people of Hong \n     Kong should be hearing reassurances from China that we will \n     be able to keep our freedoms and way of life. Instead, each \n     day brings a new threat.\n       The latest has thrown Hong Kong into turmoil, both for the \n     harm it will do to human rights and for the message it sends \n     about China's plans for the future. In October China proposed \n     scrapping key sections of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights and \n     reinstating a number of repressive colonial laws that had \n     been removed from the statute books because they violated the \n     Bill of Rights.\n       On Nov. 15, Hong Kong's legislature fought back. The \n     Legislative Council--elected in September with a surprise \n     majority for democrats--passed, by a decisive 40-15 vote, a \n     historic motion to condemn China's efforts to end human \n     rights protection in Hong Kong.\n       That motion drew a line in the sand over human rights \n     here--and even had the support of a large number of pro-\n     Beijing legislators. Even before the motion was debated, \n     Chinese officials had declared that Hong Kong's legislature \n     had no right to discuss the topic of the Bill of Rights. By \n     defying Beijing, Hong Kong's people sent the message that our \n     rights and freedoms will not be given up without a fight.\n       The Bill of Rights was enacted in 1991 as a confidence-\n     building measure to allay fears raised by the Tiananmen \n     Square massacre of 1989. Thus it is not surprising that \n     China's pledge to emasculate the Bill of Rights is having a \n     devastating effect on future confidence in the rule of law.\n       The Bill of Rights--known in Chinese as Yan Kyun Faat, the \n     Human Rights Law--puts into domestic law the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, under which countries \n     agree to a minimum standard of behavior toward their \n     citizens. Britain and more than 80 countries worldwide have \n     signed the covenant. China, however, has not. Beijing, in \n     fact, sees the Bill of Rights as part of a conspiracy by \n     ``international anti-Chinese forces and the agents of the \n     British side,'' according to its own New China News Agency.\n       The core problems is that China does not understand what \n     makes Hong Kong tick. The People's Republic of China is an \n     authoritarian Communist state. Hong Kong has always been a \n     sanctuary from China, where the rule of law held sway and \n     Hong Kong Chinese people were given economic and civil \n     freedoms to make Hong Kong's the most successful economy in \n     Southeast Asia.\n       In the past decade, the world has witnessed countless \n     examples of authoritarian regimes changing into free \n     societies--from Eastern Europe to Asia. Regionally, South \n     Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines have all \n     progressed from authoritarian to representative governments, \n     and other Asian countries are moving steadily in that \n     direction. But the world has no recent experience of a \n     vibrant, cosmopolitan and extremely free society losing basic \n     freedoms.\n       Hong Kong today has all the attributes of a pluralistic \n     civil society; a robust press, clean and accountable \n     government and a rule of law superior to any legal system in \n     Asia. The proposal to scrap Hong Kong's Bill of Rights is the \n     clearest indication yet that Beijing is trying to remake Hong \n     Kong in China's image. Because China has been successful in \n     luring international investment without improving human \n     rights, Beijing may now believe it can sustain Hong Kong's \n     economic success while clamping down on civil rights and \n     freedoms.\n       In 1997, China is set to control all three branches of Hong \n     Kong's government. Beijing says elected legislators will be \n     turned out of office and replaced with a rubber-stamp \n     appointed legislature. Hong Kong's top official, the chief \n     executive, and his cabinet will all be appointed by Beijing. \n     And China has ensured control of the Court of Final Appeal, \n     Hong Kong's highest court, which will not be set up until \n     after the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. Thus all three \n     branches of government are slated to be under China's \n     control.\n       This is why the people of Hong Kong regard saving our Bill \n     of Rights as our last-ditch battle. Just as the Bill of \n     Rights is an important check on abuse of power by the British \n     government today, so will it be an essential check on \n     arbitrary use of power by China after 1997.\n       At least one senior Chinese leader clearly understands the \n     value and fragility of Hong Kong's system. Last March the \n     chairman of the powerful Chinese People's Political \n     Consultative Committee, Li Ruihuan, admitted errors in \n     China's hard-line policy toward Hong Kong and appealed to his \n     fellow leaders to handle Hong Kong with greater care in the \n     future.\n       In a public speech, he used the metaphor of an old woman \n     selling a valuable antique \n\n[[Page S18927]]\n     Yixing teapot. Tea drinkers know that the real value of the Chinese \n     teapot lies in the residue of tea leaves that lines the \n     interior of the old pot. Through ignorance however, the old \n     woman scrubbed the teapot free of the stain, thereby \n     destroying its worth entirely.\n       Mr. Li paraphrased the common-sense adage, ``if it ain't \n     broke, don't fix it,'' pointing out, ``If you don't \n     understand how a valuable item works, you will never be able \n     to keep it intact for a long time.''\n       If, as it now appears, Chinese leaders do not understand \n     how freedom, human rights and the rule of law have laid the \n     foundation of Hong Kong's success, Beijing may scrub them \n     out--and destroy forever the value of Hong Kong, now and in \n     the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18926-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIAL AND CONVICTION OF CHINESE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST WEI JINGSHENG\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Government of China announced \nlast week that it had ``tried'' and convicted Wei Jingsheng of the \ncrime of subversion and had sentenced him to 14 years in prison. The \nChinese regime also stripped Wei Jingsheng of his political rights for \n3 years.\n  I put quotation marks around the word ``tried,'' Mr. President, \nprecisely because the action taken against Wei Jingsheng is a travesty \nand a mockery of the concept of due process of law. The 6-hour court \nproceeding clearly had a pre-ordained result: to severely punish Wei \nJingsheng for daring to speak out--as he has since 1978--against the \nChinese Government's repression of its own people.\n  Wei Jinsheng is no stranger to harsh, unjust punishments; he has \nspent most of the past 16 years of his life in Chinese prisons. Yet, \nwhen he was released in 1993, he immediately resumed his efforts to \nshine a light on Chinese Government human rights abuses. Wei \nJingsheng's tenacity as leader of China's small, albeit admirably \ntenacious democracy movement led again to his 20-month detention since \nApril 1994. The abominable sentence handed down today is yet another \nattempt to muzzle a brave man and to warn any others against dissent.\n  The administration issued a condemnation of the Chinese Government's \naction and called on it to exercise clemency. While I join in \ndenouncing the sentence and in urging Wei Jingsheng's immediate \nrelease, it is also my view--repeated often and publicly--that \nadministration policies toward China have helped pave the way for such \ncavalier abuse of basic human rights.\n  In 1994, over the strenuous objections of those of us concerned over \nChina's atrocious and repeated violations of international standards of \nhuman rights, the administration delinked granting of most-favored-\nnation trade status to China to improvements in its human rights \nrecord. The administration argued then that through ``constructive \nengagement'' on economic matters, as well as dialog on other issues, \nincluding human rights, the United States could better influence \nChinese behavior.\n  It was my view then--and it remains so today--that the correct way to \ninfluence the Chinese regime is by hitting them in the pocketbook. They \nwant our trade and easy access to our markets. Their economic well-\nbeing depends on that access; if we condition our economic relations on \ntheir improvement of human rights conditions and movement toward real \ndemocratic change, I am convinced they will come around.\n  Certainly, Mr. President, the callous disregard for human rights \nexhibited by today's action against Wei Jingsheng demonstrates that, \nafter nearly 2 years, dialog and constructive engagement has made no \nimpact on Chinese behavior. We should make it clear that human rights \nare of real--as opposed to rhetorical--concern to this country. Until \nsuch time as Wei Jingsheng and others committed to reform in China are \nallowed to speak freely their voice and work for change, American-\nChinese relations should not be based on a business-as-usual basis. I \nhope the administration will take this latest sad episode to heart and \nmodify current policy toward China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18927-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTION OF THE INNOCENT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a December 4 editorial in the Washington Post, ``Execution \nof the Innocent,'' which profiles the case of Rolando Cruz.\n  Rolando Cruz was found guilty of raping and killing 10-year-old \nJeanie Nicarico of Naperville, IL, in 1983. Even though there was no \nphysical evidence nor motive, and another man confessed to the killing \nshortly after Mr. Cruz's conviction, two juries voted for the death \npenalty based on testimony from fellow prisoners and police who claimed \nhe had confessed to them. The prisoners' stories have now all been \ndiscredited, the policemen's supervisor recently admitted that he was \nin Florida at the time he claimed he had been told about Mr. Cruz's \nconfession, and recent DNA tests exonerate Mr. Cruz and point to the \nman who confessed many years ago.\n  It took 11 years for the truth in this case to come out. The Senate \nhas passed habeas corpus reform which will severely restrict an \ninmate's ability to appeal a conviction, and has recently voted to \neliminate funding for the post-conviction defender organizations which \nprovide competent counsel to death row inmates. These measures will \nsimply exacerbate the inherent problem with the death penalty: Innocent \npeople are put to death.\n  Our system is comprised of human beings, and human beings, whether by \nmalice or oversight, have been known to be wrong. Rolando Cruz's case \nis a stark example of this reality. The death penalty is already \nreserved for people of modest means who cannot afford the best \nrepresentation. It is already disproportionately applied to black \npeople. Congress' rush to be tough on crime will simply make it even \nmore difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the high standards of \njustice which are the foundation of our Nation. And to put it plainly: \nMore innocent people will be put to death.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 1995]\n\n                       Execution of the Innocent\n\n       The death penalty has broad support in this country, and \n     those who argue against it on moral grounds aren't making \n     much headway. But even the most fervid supporters of capital \n     punishment must have their doubts when it is revealed that \n     innocent people have been convicted of murder and sentenced \n     to be executed. This happens more frequently than one might \n     think. And the increasing availability of DNA technology to \n     prove innocence probably means that these last-minute saves \n     will become more common.\n       The most recent of these cases concerns Rolando Cruz, twice \n     convicted by juries of the 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-\n     old Jeanine Nicarico in Naperville, ILL. Mr. Cruz was \n     arrested with two others--charges against one have been \n     dropped and the other is awaiting his third trial--on \n     extremely thin evidence. He and his codefendants maintained \n     their innocence throughout. There was no physical evidence to \n     tie them to the crime, and no motive was alleged by the \n     prosecution. But successive juries convicted on the basis of \n     testimony from other prisoners that he had confessed to them. \n     These stories were changed, revoked or attacked on grounds of \n     credibility.\n       More persuasive was testimony from two police officers that \n     Mr. Cruz had revealed to them a dream he had had, which \n     contained details of the crime that only a killer would know. \n     Nothing was said or written about this alleged dream for 18 \n     months, and the story appeared only two weeks before the \n     first trial. Last month, after years of litigation and two \n     death sentences, the policemen's supervisor recanted \n     testimony that they had told him of the dream, and confessed \n     that he had been in Florida at the time and could not have \n     had this conversation.\n       Even more compelling is the fact that shortly after the \n     first conviction another man was arrested in the same area \n     who confessed to two rape-killings and numerous assaults, and \n     to the killing of the child for which Mr. Cruz had been \n     convicted. The prosecutors stubbornly refused to believe him, \n     but recent DNA tests exonerate Mr. Cruz and point to this \n     other man.\n       Rolando Cruz spent the years between his 21st and his 32nd \n     birthdays on death row. At his third trial, the judge \n     bitterly criticized the police, the impeached witnesses at \n     the first two trials and the quality of the prosecution's \n     case. He directed a verdict of not guilty even before the \n     defense had presented its case. This prosecution was so \n     egregious that the Justice Department this week directed the \n     FBI to look into possible violations of Mr. Cruz's civil \n     rights. Those who argue that appeals should be curtailed and \n     that executions should become routine should consider Rolando \n     Cruz and the injustice that was visited on him as well as the \n     one he narrowly escaped.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18927-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18927-S18928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRESIDENT CLINTON'S EXTREMISM ON THE BUDGET\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I wish to express my opposition \nto the \n\n[[Page S18928]]\nextremist scare tactics being used by President Clinton and his \nadministration. Day after day, the American people are subjected to a \nsteady stream of disinformation about the economic realities which \nconfront this country.\n  The Clinton administration has raised the standard on Washington \ndoublespeak to a new all time high. It is unfortunate that President \nClinton refuses to offer our Nation leadership at this decisive moment \nin our Nation's history. Instead, the only thing he offers is more \nfear, more taxes, more spending and more debt.\n  Let's look at the facts. On the balanced budget, what has the \nCongress done? The Congress has passed a plan for balancing the budget \nin 7 years using honest and real numbers. What did President Clinton \ndo? He cooked the books and offered four budgets none of which are \nbalanced. Furthermore, he vetoed the only honest balanced budget plan \noffered this year.\n  Looking at the facts and not at the harsh rhetoric of the Clinton \nadministration, it should be clear to all Americans that Congress has \naccepted responsibility for the budget and the President has gone \nAWOL--absent without leadership. Instead of offering a serious plan, he \noffers the American people fear and unending deficit spending. The \nfacts speak for themselves and they speak louder than the \ndisinformation spread at White House press conferences.\n  Let's look at some more facts. We are in the fourth day of a partial \nGovernment shutdown. What has the Congress done? Congress sent three \nspending bills to the President which would have kept open the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs, HUD, Commerce, Justice, State, and \nInterior. What did President Clinton do? He vetoed two of these bills \nand says he intends to veto the third. He had the power to prevent the \nshutdown of these agencies and to keep Federal workers on the job. \nInstead, with the stroke of a pen he sent thousands of Federal workers \nhome.\n  That wasn't enough for this President. He also threw in some fear-\nmongering for good measure. The administration fired-up its \ndisinformation machine and unleashed a tirade of doomsday rhetoric \nagainst those spending bills. The facts speak for themselves. The \nCongress did its job and passed appropriations bills which responsibly \nreduced government spending and which would have kept most agencies \nopen. But, President Clinton wasn't interested in that. He was looking \nfor a photo opportunity. He vetoed funding bills and closed down parts \nof the Government. He should be held and will be held accountable for \nthis shutdown.\n  Let's look at some more facts. The President's Medicare trustees \ninformed the administration earlier this year that Medicare is on the \nverge of certain bankruptcy. What did Congress do? We passed a plan to \nrescue Medicare from bankruptcy and preserve it so that it will be \nthere for all Americans when they retire. What did President Clinton \ndo? At first, he turned a blind eye toward the problem--as if by \nignoring Medicare the problem would go away. Then he engaged in a well \norchestrated campaign to frighten America's senior citizens about \ncongressional efforts to save Medicare.\n  Since President Clinton has no serious Medicare plan to offer, he \ninstead offers fear instead. This display of self-serving political \nopportunism has no match in Washington. Such desperate and dishonest \ntactics should be and will be rejected by all Americans who are serious \nabout integrity in government because the facts simply don't support \nthe President's rhetoric. The Medicare reform plan passed by Congress, \nin reality, provides for greater spending increases than the socialized \nhealth care plan offered by Mrs. Clinton just last year.\n  The President is knowingly misleading the American people about \nMedicare. He should stop his campaign to frighten our senior citizens \nand he should get serious about saving Medicare.\n  When you look at the budget, the Government shutdown, and Medicare--\nthe facts simply don't support the President's false rhetoric. In \nreality, this crisis has been engineered by the President to bolster \nhis reelection campaign. After being viewed as irrelevant for so long, \nthe President has now identified himself with something he believes in \npassionately. He is passionate about deficit spending. He is passionate \nabout the preserving the status quo which heaps trillions of dollars of \ndebt on our children and grandchildren.\n  I hope that he will abandon his extremist scare tactics and get \nserious about balancing the budget. So far, he has stone-walled \ncongressional negotiators. He has refused to offer a balanced budget \nplan using honest numbers. He prefers to cook the books as a way to \nbalance the budget. Such policies will not lead to a balanced budget. \nThey never have and they never will. President Clinton has chosen the \npath of certain failure. Congress will not follow him down that dead-\nend road.\n  I believe that we need another vote on the balanced budget amendment. \nI can think of no better Christmas present for America. I believe that \nthe American people sent a clear message to Congress in 1994. They \ndemanded that Washington put its financial house in order. Another vote \non the balanced budget amendment will show who is serious about \nachieving this necessary goal for our children and grandchildren.\n  Sadly, President Clinton worked hard to defeat the balanced budget \namendment earlier this year. The Nation is now entirely focused on this \nall important issue. Let's bring up the constitutional amendment for \nanother vote before the end of the year. Then the American people will \nknow who is committed to a balanced budget. They will also know who to \nblame if the budget is not balanced. They will know who to blame if our \nfuture is mortgaged beyond our ability to comprehend.\n  I support the balanced budget amendment and I support the legislation \npassed by Congress to balanced the budget in 7 years using honest \nnumbers. Unfortunately, the President oppose both. And, no amount of \nextremist rhetoric from the White House can hide that fact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18927-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18928-S18929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE PRO-SERB MONTENEGRINS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, occasionally as we read magazines \nand newspapers, we find articles on things in unlikely sources.\n  Recently in reading the Christian Century, I came across an article \nby Paul Mojzes titled, ``The pro-Serb Montenegrins'' which I ask to be \nprinted in full in the Record.\n  It describes the situation in Montenegro, a small Province in what \nwas once Yugoslavia but a Province that has produced leaders including \nMilovan Djilas, Slobodan Milosevic, and Karadzic.\n  It is not a particularly encouraging article, but it is informative \nand because I have seen nothing about this anywhere else, I believe it \nmerits placing in the Congressional Record so those interested in this \narea can read it.\n  The article follows:\n\n           Travels in the Balkans: The Pro-Serb Montenegrins\n\n                            (By Paul Mojzes)\n\n       The Montenegrins are fond of joking that if their rugged \n     mountain terrain were ironed out, the area would be as huge \n     as Russia. Living in the tiniest and least populous republic \n     of the former Yugoslavia, Montenegrins have tried to \n     compensate by identifying with Russia and by propelling \n     themselves into the ruling elites of other Yugoslav republics \n     as fiery communists or fierce nationalists. They have \n     produced such leaders as Milovan Djilas, Slobodan Milosevic \n     and Radovan Karadzic.\n       During World War II Montenegro spawned the most feared \n     nationalist Chetnik units as well as fierce communist \n     Partizans. Members of both groups slaughtered the opposition \n     even if that meant turning against their own families. \n     Vendettas and a fixation on revenge complicated the conflict \n     by making people cross ideological lines out of tribal \n     loyalty.\n       During the current Balkan wars no direct fighting has taken \n     place in Montenegro, though Montenegrin ``volunteers'' \n     ravaged nearby Dubrovnik and its vicinity. Consequently, \n     travelers have been able to move about Montenegro \n     unobstructed. The terrain of these ``black mountains'' is \n     rocky, yielding neither timber nor agricultural products. Nor \n     are there many mineral deposits. But fabulous tourist \n     attractions abound, particularly along the Adriatic seashore, \n     one of the most beautiful in the world.\n       Foreign tourists are now avoiding the area while most Serbs \n     and Montenegrins are too impoverished to travel. For those \n     who venture here this may be a plus. None of the services are \n     overburdened and both food and transportation are readily \n     available. However, travelers flying to Belgrade from one of \n     the two Montenegrin airports have been \n\n[[Page S18929]]\n     forced to share space with wounded evacuees from the Bosnian \n     battlegrounds. They apparently have been transported this way \n     in order to avoid the UN-controlled border-crossings between \n     Serbia and Bosnia. The purpose has been to give credence to \n     Milosevic's claim of no longer supporting the Serb warriors \n     in Bosnia. Not many in Montenegro would take such a claim at \n     face value.\n       The single most important issue in Montenegro is defining \n     its people's identity. Some claim that Montenegrins are \n     Serbs, that indeed their country is the very heart of \n     Serbdom, as a politician of the Narodna (People's or Folk) \n     Party told me. Others say that Montenegro is a separate \n     nation now endangered by Serb attempts to absorb it.\n       In Niksic, the ancient capital in which the ecclesiastical \n     head of the Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Amfilohiye Radovic, \n     resides, graffiti declare that he should leave Montenegro, \n     though he is one of the few Serbian Orthodox hierarchs who \n     was born there. Metropolitan Amfilohiye militantly espouses \n     the Serbian cause, and the number of such supporters is \n     growing as the ethnoreligious conflict continues. Both the \n     leftist Democratic Party of Socialists (former communists), \n     which holds a firm grip on power, and the right-wing People's \n     Party are pro-Serb. Only the Liberals, who garner a mere 10 \n     percent of the vote, staunchly proclaim ``Montenegro is \n     Montenegrin,'' though there are others who insist on claiming \n     the sovereignty for Montenegro accorded to it by the 1974 \n     Yugoslav constitution.\n       If one visits only the Adriatic resorts one gets an \n     impression of economic well-being, despite tourist workers' \n     complaints that these resorts are operating at less than half \n     of their capacity. Food in the hotels and at the markets is \n     plentiful though expensive. Other consumer goods are \n     available, since people have found a way to skirt UN \n     sanctions. That cows graze on the lawn of the state \n     government building in Podgorica (formerly Titograd) may be a \n     better overall economic indicator.\n       In Podgorica as elsewhere, the socioeconomic difference \n     between people is striking. In one section of the city the \n     apartments for the old communist elite and the new \n     entrepreneurial class feature TV radar disks for nearly every \n     dwelling. Here people dress with an ostentatious display of \n     wealth. But Podgorica's slums resemble those in greatly \n     impoverished countries. Incomes, while considerably better \n     than in 1993, range between $50 and $150 a month. Many \n     workers, however, are paid only every third or fourth month, \n     and approximately 60 percent of the work force is on ``forced \n     vacation''--unemployed and with no welfare benefits. Even the \n     casual observer will notice huge numbers of people hanging \n     around the streets or the numerous drinking places. Even \n     those who do eke out a meager living say that there is little \n     hope for a better future. People survive by trading in the \n     black market and by accepting bribes. Nearly everyone is \n     engaged in smuggling, selling or reselling something--from \n     the lucrative smuggling of gasoline and weapons to the \n     pitiful reselling of single cigarettes. Police raid only the \n     ``little fry.'' Bigger business is protected by the mafia, \n     which is said to reach to the very top of government. Armed \n     robberies in the rump Yugoslavia have increased from about 70 \n     in 1991 to over 2,000 in 1992-93. Few robbers are \n     apprehended.\n       However, the ``new'' Yogoslav dinar is fairly stable. After \n     1993's great inflation the government pegged the dinar to the \n     German mark at a 1:1 ratio. While on the black market the \n     dinar recently slipped to about a 2.5:1 ratio, it still \n     appears to be economically viable. The locals believe that \n     the hyperinflation of 1993 was approved or even prompted by \n     the government in order to extract foreign-currency reserves \n     from the population.\n       Montenegrins are traditionally Orthodox Christians with a \n     small minority of Roman Catholics (derogatorily called \n     ``Latins'') and Muslims (called ``Turks,'' though they are \n     Montenegrin converts to Islam). The Albanian minority is \n     predominantly Muslim, with a small number of Roman Catholics. \n     There are virtually no Protestants or Jews.\n       The Orthodox Church was nearly wiped out during the \n     communist period. During World War II it had sided with the \n     Chetniks rather than the Partizans and the latter showed no \n     pity toward the losers. Directives from Belgrade to eliminate \n     church activities were taken seriously and religious life \n     became nearly extinct. People would pass by a monastery \n     without even looking at it lest they be called in for an \n     unpleasant talk with the secret police.\n       Only during the last few years under the increasingly \n     liberal Yogoslav regime was church life slowly reactivated. \n     In the postocommunist period Orthodox Church activities are \n     on the rebound. Right-wing nationalistic politicians believe \n     that the church has not only a religious but a political \n     role. Some clergy openly argue that the church should rule \n     over the nation in these difficult times as it did in the \n     distant past.\n       Adjacent to the former royal palace in Cetinje is a large \n     monastic compound nestled against the mountain. Here the \n     archbishop resides. A visit to the monastery was organized \n     for a group of students and professors of which I was a part. \n     Our guide, a middle-aged monk, spoke English fluently. He \n     appeared to be well traveled but displayed an intense Serbian \n     nationalism and an even greater angry anticommunism. He \n     explained that the monastery had been destroyed twice, first \n     by Muslim Turks and then by Latins. A display on the \n     monastery walls credited both destructions to the Turks. \n     Apparently the monk needed to believe that Serbs had been \n     victimized by both of their current antagonists.\n       The Montenegrin government is now making amends for the \n     communist period not only by restoring church properties but \n     also by financing their repair. (The Catholics, on the other \n     hand, complain that the return and repair of their properties \n     is being hampered.)\n       Svetigora, the official publication of the diocese of \n     Montenegro, is disturbing. Even the magazine's title has \n     troublesome implications. Sveta Gora is the Serbian name for \n     the Holy Mount Athos, the monastic republic in Greece. The \n     journal's name suggests that Montenegro is not just a Black \n     Mountain but a ``Mount of Light''--a ``Holy Mount.'' Combined \n     with the ever-increasing claim made by the Serbian Orthodox \n     hierarchs that the Serbs are ``the New Israel,'' the chosen \n     people of God, a ``heavenly kingdom,'' a martyr nation that \n     has suffered more than anyone else on earth except Christ, \n     the name supports the dangerous conviction that all that the \n     Serbs do is somehow of God.\n       A recent issue features a smiling Radovan Karadzic flanked \n     by the patriarchs of Moscow and Belgrade. In a lengthy \n     interview Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, claims \n     the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit in all his political \n     decisions and urges the political involvement of the Orthodox \n     Church in the life of Serbians everywhere. He repeatedly \n     emphasizes the goal of uniting all Serbs into a single state. \n     In another interview Metropolitan Amfilohiye claims that \n     ``the living God can be experienced in the East while the \n     West is a wasteland.'' Another article explains why God \n     allowed Russia, ``the elite people,'' to experience the \n     apostasy of communism. The Herzegovian hard-line Bishop \n     Atanasiye Jeftic associates NATO with Satan and links Ingmar \n     Bergman's films to Protestantism, in which there is ``neither \n     mercy, nor space for the human being, nor salvation.''\n       Svetigora's contents make one wonder whether the effort of \n     some German and Dutch churchmen to expel the Serbian Orthodox \n     Church from the World Council of Churches does not have \n     merit. There is a parallel between the Deutsche Christen \n     aberration during Hitler's era and this militant Serbian \n     Orthodoxy. In Germany, however, there was resistance by a \n     Confessing Church led by people like Karl Barth and Dietrich \n     Bonhoeffer; the Serbian Orthodox Church has not yet produced \n     such internal critics, just as Balkans politics has not \n     produced its Vaclav Havel. The political threat in the \n     Balkans is Nazism; the religious threat is idolatrous \n     nationalism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18928-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18929-S18931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GAMING LOBBY GIVES LAVISHLY TO POLITICIANS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, with monthly profits from single \ncasinos running to millions of dollars, gambling promoters are using \ntheir new-found wealth to increase the spread of gambling. Grassroots \ncommunity groups who raise concerns about new casinos are being \noutspent 50 to 1 in some areas.\n  In Congress, high-priced lobbyists are attempting to stop a simple \neffort to gather information about the impact of the spread of \ngambling.\n  A recent New York Times story, ``Gaming Lobby Gives Lavishly to \nPoliticians,'' clearly describes issues that deserve our attention. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the New York Times News Service, Dec. 18, 1995]\n\n       Special Report: Gaming Lobby Gives Lavishly to Politicians\n\n                            (By Kevin Sack)\n\n       In only five years, the gambling industry has bought its \n     way into the ranks of the most formidable interest groups in \n     American politics, spending huge sums to gain the kind of \n     influence long wielded by big business, big labor and \n     organizations of doctors and lawyers.\n       From the Empress riverboat casino in Joliet, Ill., to the \n     Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Ledyard, Conn., gambling \n     interests, which now run casinos in 24 states, have used vast \n     profits gleaned from their craps tables and slot machines to \n     fatten the campaign coffers of political candidates and wage \n     multimillion-dollar lobbying offensives.\n       While state officials have been the primary beneficiaries \n     of the industry's largess, there has also been a surge in \n     contributions to federal and local officeholders.\n       Gambling-financed political action committees gave three \n     times as much to congressional candidates and the national \n     parties in the 1993-94 election cycle as they gave in the \n     previous two years, according to Common Cause and the Center \n     for Responsive Politics, two Washington-based organizations \n     that monitor campaign financing.\n       The $2 million total for the cycle put the industry in the \n     same league as long-established interest groups like the \n     United Automobile Workers, which gave $2.4 million, and the \n     National Rifle Association, which gave $2.2 million. \n     \n[[Page S18930]]\n\n       At the state level, meanwhile, the rising tide of gambling \n     money has in many places become a flood. In Florida last \n     year, pro-gambling forces spent $16.5 million in an \n     unsuccessful effort to win approval of casinos in a \n     referendum. That sum was almost as much as the state's two \n     gubernatorial candidates spent combined.\n       In other states, the industry's wealth has allowed it to \n     outspend its opponents by as much as 50 to 1. In the process, \n     that wealth has contributed to major corruption scandals in \n     Louisiana, Missouri, Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina and \n     West Virginia, all since 1989, when legalized gambling began \n     its cross-country expansion.\n       Perhaps most significant, the torrent of dollars has \n     rapidly eroded a longstanding stigma against the \n     intermingling of gambling and politics.\n       ``Twenty years ago, if you got support from gambling \n     interests it would have been the kiss of death,'' said Rep. \n     Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., who opposes the continued expansion of \n     gambling. ``If you were running for office in Illinois or \n     Iowa an got money from gambling interests, you wouldn't want \n     to tell your brother or mother.''\n       Noting that today's casinos are run by Indian tribes and \n     Fortune 500 companies, not mobsters, gambling industry \n     officials assert that it is only natural for a heavily \n     regulated, high-growth business to play an active role in \n     politics, just as public utilities and tobacco companies do.\n       ``The only industry that is more regulated is the nuclear \n     power industry,'' said Mark B. Edwards Jr., a gambling \n     analyst for the State Capital Resource Center, a private \n     group that monitors political developments for casino \n     companies. ``Therefore, it's more important for the gaming \n     industry to flex some political muscle.''\n       The gaming industry has focused its lobbying campaigns on \n     state capitals, where governors, lawmakers and regulators \n     hold the authority to determine whether to expand gambling, \n     which companies will get gambling licenses and vending \n     contracts, and how extensively gambling will be taxed and \n     controlled.\n       Gambling opponents say the abundance of lobbying money, and \n     the promise of bountiful tax revenue, has helped the industry \n     move its operations into impoversished communities, with \n     little attention paid to social consequences like the effect \n     on compulsive gamblers or on small businesses there.\n       A backlash has begun to emerge in which grass-roots anti-\n     gambling drives in some states have managed to neutralize the \n     influence of big money. But that is no easy task.\n       In the last two years, campaigns to establish or expand \n     legalized gambling in Florida, Missouri, Virginia and \n     Connecticut have spent more money than was ever before spent \n     in those states on any lobbying effort.\n       During Virginia's legislative session this year, gambling \n     interests hired 48 lobbyists. In Texas, they hired 74, more \n     than two for every state senator and one for every two \n     members of the Texas House.\n       The lobbyists are often enlisted from the ranks of former \n     public officials. The lobbying payroll in Illinois has \n     included a former governor, a former state attorney general, \n     a former state police director, two former U.S. attorneys, a \n     former mayor of Chicago and dozens of former state \n     legislators, including a Senate president and a House \n     majority leader.\n       Two years ago a Nevada casino company, Primadonna Resorts, \n     offered two Illinois lobbyists a compensation package of $20 \n     million over 20 years if they could reel in a riverboat \n     license.\n       For an April 1994 referendum on allowing slot machines in \n     Missouri, committees financed by out-or-state casino \n     companies paid out $4.2 million, outspending the proposal's \n     opponents by 50 to 1, according to a study by Alfred Kahn, a \n     retired professor of planning at Southern Illinois University \n     at Edwardsville.\n       The measure failed by one-tenth of a percentage point. \n     Seven months later, the gambling companies were back, this \n     time spending $11.5 million. The proposal passed with 54 \n     percent of the vote.\n       The gambling opponents, Kahn said, ``were just overwhelmed \n     by wall-to-wall television commercials.''\n       Like lobbying expenditures, campaign contributions have \n     been flowing as freely as complimentary cocktails on a casino \n     floor. Only one state, New Jersey, prohibits political \n     contributions from gambling interests.\n       In Louisiana, in the heart of the nation's oil patch, \n     gambling interests in 1993 and 1994 gave state legislators \n     more than twice as much as did the petrochemical industry, \n     according to a study by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans.\n       ``I've been told by legislator after legislator that the \n     gambling industry has become the single largest political \n     influence in their states,'' said Robert Goodman, a professor \n     at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., who is the author of \n     ``The Luck Business'' (Free Press, 1995), a book critical of \n     legalized gambling's spread. ``It's a sea change in the \n     political landscape in the states where the gambling industry \n     is operating.''\n       As in many other states that now have casinos, the spending \n     in Illinois has been spurred by competition among gambling \n     concerns whose interests conflict.\n       Wealthy businessmen who want to obtain casino licenses from \n     the state, which now allows casino gambling only on \n     riverboats, are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a \n     year in campaign contributions to help persuade legislators \n     to expand gambling to Chicago and any number of suburbs.\n       Fearful of new competition, the owners of the state's 10 \n     existing casino licenses are contributing hundreds of \n     thousands more to protect their monopolies. In doing so, they \n     have placed themselves in an unusual alliance with those who \n     oppose gambling on moral or social grounds.\n       In Washington, the rise of the gambling industry has \n     created influential power brokers. In a single afternoon last \n     June, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, one of the \n     country's largest Casino companies, raised nearly $500,000 \n     for the presidential campaign of Bob Dole, the Senate \n     majority leader.\n       The fund-raising luncheon, at a posh Las Vegas country \n     club, came one day after Dole had traveled to Los Angeles to \n     level a withering attack on what he described as the \n     mercenary values of the entertainment industry.\n       Dole opposes new taxes on the gambling industry, said his \n     spokesman, Clarkson Hine, but supports creation of a federal \n     commission to study gambling's effects. The industry opposes \n     such a commission, believing that it could lead to heightened \n     regulation. But Hine said Dole ``feels strongly'' that \n     regulation should be left to the states.\n       In any event, Mirage Resorts is hardly the only gambling-\n     industry player in the capital. The 370-member Mashantucket \n     Pequot tribe, virtually unknown until it opened the Foxwoods \n     Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn., in 1992, is one of many \n     others, having given $465,000 to the Democratic National \n     Committee and $100,000 to the Republican National Committee \n     from 1991 to 1994.\n       Gambling money is so abundant that on occasion it reaches \n     out even to the most vocal of gambling opponents, like Gov. \n     Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, where casino operations have \n     been growing for five years.\n       In 1993, Fordice accepted $73,500 in contributions from \n     casino interests, almost a third of all the money he raised \n     that year. Then, beginning last Jan. 1, he swore off \n     accepting any more gambling money, although he declined to \n     return the earlier bounty.\n       The purpose of the new policy, said Andy Taggart, his \n     campaign manager, was to take an issue away from his opponent \n     in the gubernatorial race this year. Fordice won.\n       It was political money, along with the promise of new tax \n     revenue for recession-racked states, that provided the \n     kindling for the wildfire spread of legalized gambling in the \n     1990s.\n       In 1988, only Nevada and New Jersey had casinos. Now, 24 \n     states have casinos on land, water or Indian reservations, \n     and 48 states have legalized gambling of some kind.\n       In the last four years, annual legal-gambling revenue has \n     grown by 50 percent, to $39.9 billion. That is nearly a \n     quadrupling since 1982, according to an annual survey by \n     Christiansen/Cummings Associates, a consulting firm that \n     specializes in the gaming industry. On average, profit \n     margins are high, ranging from 15 to 20 percent, said Will E. \n     Cummings, managing director of the firm.\n       ``Without the outside influence coming in'' to lobby in \n     this state or that, ``there would be no spread of gaming,'' \n     said William N. Thompson, a professor at the University of \n     Nevada at Las Vegas who is co-author of ``The Last Resort: \n     Success and Failure in Campaigns for Casinos'' (University of \n     Nevada Press, 1990). ``The opponents don't get to make their \n     case.''\n       In the last year, though, the industry has suffered several \n     financial and political failure, suggesting that the market \n     for betting may finally be saturated. A casino in New Orleans \n     and riverboats in Louisiana and Mississippi have failed, and \n     voters and lawmakers have rejected the expansion of gambling \n     in a number of states.\n       Industry analysts say some of the backlash can be \n     attributed to growing revulsion with the amount of gambling \n     money in politics, and to concern about corruption among \n     holders of public office.\n       In the most recent scandal, the FBI said in August that it \n     was investigating whether video poker operators in Louisiana \n     had bribed lawmakers into killing anti-gambling legislation \n     earlier this year. That inquiry is continuing, but many of \n     the legislators who are targets of it either have chosen to \n     retire or failed to win re-election this fall.\n       In Pennsylvania, state Attorney General Ernie Preate, Jr. \n     pleaded guilty in June to hiding campaign contributions from \n     operators of illegal video poker games. And from 1989 to \n     1992, lawmakers in Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina and West \n     Virginia were convicted of accepting bribes from gambling \n     interests.\n       Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming \n     Association, the industry's trade group, told a congressional \n     committee last month that singling out legalized betting as a \n     corrupting influence was unfair.\n       ``The problem,'' said Fahrenkopf, a former Republican \n     national chairman, ``is that where there is money, there is \n     the potential for corruption, and that is by no means \n     confined to gaming interests.'' After listing political \n     scandals from Teapot Dome to Abscam, he added, ``To suggest \n     that it is unique to our industry is manipulative, cynical \n     and, frankly, dishonest.''\n       Even when operating within the law, though, gambling \n     supporters have sometimes lacked subtlety.\n       In 1994, the president of the Louisiana Senate, Sammy \n     Nunez, handed out envelopes to colleagues on the Senate \n     floor, each containing a $2,500 campaign check from a casino \n     owner. Nunez lost in a bid for re-election in November.\n     \n[[Page S18931]]\n\n       In Illinois in 1993, Al Ronan, a legislator turned casino \n     lobbyist, pulled lawmakers off the floor and handed them \n     white envelopes containing campaign checks of $50 to $300.\n       ``The gambling companies have been like a bull in a china \n     shop,'' said William R. Eadington, director of the Institute \n     for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming, at the \n     University of Nevada at Reno. ``These were companies that did \n     not have the sophistication to understand the nuances of \n     political activity.''\n       Some exports, noting the intense issue that gambling money \n     has become in some states and localities, believe that the \n     industry has turned into its own worst enemy.\n       Despite devoting $16.5 million to the referendum on casino \n     legalization in Florida last year, pro-gambling forces were \n     crushed at the polls, 62 percent to 38 percent, at least \n     partly because of voter discomfort with that level of \n     spending.\n       And given the corruption investigation in Louisiana, \n     candidates for governor there spent much of the race this \n     year trying to trump each other's anti-gambling stands.\n       Further, after St. Louis County Executive George Westfall \n     accepted more than $150,000 in contributions from companies \n     competing for a riverboat casino license, the County Council \n     this year approved a ban on the industry's political \n     donations.\n       In recent months, some casino companies have decided to put \n     a stop to their own multimillion-dollar political wagers.\n       One such company is Mirage Resorts, which spent more than \n     $10 million in a four-year failed campaign to place a casino \n     in Bridgeport, Conn.\n       ``Our company policy right now is that we are not going to \n     go or in any jurisdiction and actively lobby to change any \n     law, to actively try to convince people,'' said Richard D. \n     Bronson, a member of Mirage's board and president of the \n     company's development arm. ``Look what happened in \n     Connecticut.''\n       Added Alan M. Feldman, Mirage's vice president for public \n     affairs: ``It has told us that this isn't our bag. We're just \n     not political animals.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18929-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 132\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would not be on the floor tonight, and had \nnot intended to be on the floor tonight, until I saw a bevy of \nRepublicans coming on the floor to try and beat up on the President, in \nparticular, and the Democratic Party in general. When I heard that, I \nhave responsibilities as the lead Democrat on the Budget Committee, and \nI decided to stay here and hear what is going on.\n  The Senator from Washington made several statements that I would like \nto take issue with. One thing that the Senator from Washington \nrequested was that if I was concerned about the back-loading on the \nRepublican budget plan, where 60 percent of the savings in the \nRepublican budget plan to balance the budget are put off until the \nsixth and seventh year, did I have any suggestions as to how we could \neliminate that. Well, I sure do.\n  If we would eliminate the $242 billion tax cut that basically \nbenefits the wealthiest among us, for the most part, that would be one \nway we could alleviate that.\n  I would also like to comment briefly on the several statements made \non the floor by those on that side of the aisle regarding the President \nof the United States breaking his agreement with regard to the \ncontinuing resolution that we worked out 2 weeks ago, I guess it was. I \nwas there. I was part of that agreement. The President has not broken \nhis word. The President of the United States said that he would accept \na 7-year plan to balance the budget. And he has had a pretty good \nrecord as President, because under President Clinton, we have had 3 \nstraight years of reduction in the deficit of the budget of the United \nStates of America. That is the first time that has happened since Harry \nTruman. So this President has had some experience in fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  The President has said in that agreement that he would agree to \nbalance in 7 years, and that we would accept Congressional Budget \nOffice numbers, with the understanding that CBO would review those \nnumbers with the Office of Management and Budget and outside experts to \nmake sure that their projections were as nearly accurate as possible.\n  He also said the other condition of making that agreement was the \nfact that we wish the Republicans to enter into discussions with us to \nprotect programs that the Democratic Party has worked long and hard to \nprotect--Medicare, Medicaid, educational programs, veterans benefits, \nagriculture, and others. We did not feel that, rushing to judgment, the \nRepublicans had lived up to their part of that agreement. So, \ntherefore, I think that there can be legitimate differences of opinion. \nAnd because that was worded in that manner, I think almost anyone could \nhave interpreted that particular agreement as they wanted to.\n  It has been mentioned by my friend from Nevada that--and we are \ntalking about the appropriations bills--if the President would just \nsign the appropriations bills, that would alleviate some of the \nproblems. The appropriations bill should have been passed by the \nRepublican-controlled Congress by October 1, 1995, when the new year \nbegan. Here we are in December, just passing appropriations bills--it \nis very late, almost 90 days late-- and then we say to the President of \nthe United States that because it is so late, because we are so late \ngetting these to you, of course, you cannot veto them. That would be \nunfair.\n\n  We have also heard said that the President had shut down the \nGovernment. He has not. The President of the United States, through the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, made offer after offer, which the \nRepublicans rejected, regarding a continuing resolution that would not \nhave been necessary to have 1 day of shutdown. So I do not think it is \nfair to blame the President of the United States for that.\n  I am happy to say that I think, given the circumstances, we are now \nmaking some progress, as Senator Dole and Senator Daschle earlier \nindicated on the floor. I am not sure that we accomplish a great deal \nwith partisan bickering over something that we have placed, for their \ndeliberation, consultation, and hope of resolving, in the hands of the \nPresident of the United States, the majority leader, Robert Dole; the \nSpeaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich; the Democratic leader in the House, \nCongressman Gephardt; and our own Tom Daschle, the Democratic \n\n[[Page S18932]]\nleader in the Senate. Those five individuals have heavy, heavy \nresponsibilities, and they have very serious differences of opinion on \na whole series of subjects.\n\n  I just hope that we can in good faith work with them and not bicker, \nat least until after we hear what their results and recommendations \nare. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief. I apologize for the little \ntime that I will take, but there has been so much said here in the last \n10 minutes that needs debunking and refuting, it is all I can do to \nrestrain myself.\n  I would like to take a bipartisan tone and hope that these \ndiscussions would be successful, and I wonder why they were not \ncompleted a week ago, 2 weeks ago, a month more or even longer. There \nare so many inconsistencies being put out that I just cannot stand \nstill and not respond to some of then.\n  With regard to the 60 percent back end question, that there has been \na lot of talk how 60 percent of the savings come at the back end, as a \nmatter of fact, that is the result of genuine real reforms in the so-\ncalled entitlement programs that we make this year. If we do not make \nthem this year, we will never get them. Even if we make them this year, \nthe impact builds over the years.\n  That is the exact reason why we need these entitlement reforms, \nbecause if we do not have these reforms, these programs will continue \nto explode out of control, go up at the rate of 10 percent or 11 \npercent or more. Medicaid, I think, was going up at one point in the \nhigh teens. We want to reform these programs to save them.\n  What really amazes me is my colleagues say, ``Yes, we want a balanced \nbudget. We want to reduce the debt, but we do not want to control \nspending.'' You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say we are not \ngoing to touch the entitlements, we will not touch welfare, we will not \ntouch Medicare or Medicaid, and by the way, we want to spend endless \namounts on appropriations bills. You just cannot have it both ways. To \nget a balanced budget, you have to agree to some controls or, Heaven \nforbid, some cuts.\n  Now, this talk about how the Congress majority this year has not sent \nthe appropriations bills to the President. In 1987 and 1988, the \nDemocratic Congress did not send a single--not one--appropriations bill \nto the President. In 1987, all 13 appropriations bills were lumped into \none big wad, with the budget, with the debt ceiling, sent down to the \nPresident of the United States, President Reagan. The Congress left \ntown and said, ``Good luck, Mr. President. Goodbye.''\n  Do not give me alligator tears how we have not passed appropriations \nbills. When we pass them and send them to the President and he vetoes \nthem and he says the Congress closed down the Government, my goodness, \nall he had to do was to use the Lyndon Johnson pen that has so much \nexperience spending the people's money, sign the bill, and he would \nhave kept the Government open.\n  Why did he not sign them? A couple good reasons: No. 1, this \nPresident wants business as usual. Spend more money. ``I want more \nmoney for Interior Department. I want more money for Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I want more money for State and Justice and Commerce. Yes, \nmore money for everything and everybody. And the other thing is, I have \nthese little policy questions. I do not like it because you are \nallowing too much timber to be cut in Alaska.'' Give me a break. The \npeople in Mississippi think trees are to be harvested. We certainly do \nnot want to see the Government shut down by the President because of \nthe number of feet of timber we are going to cut in Alaska.\n\n  I am amazed that the President of the United States can go on TV and \nsay, ``I am vetoing the appropriations bills, and, gee, I wish Congress \nwould not shut down these departments.'' Yesterday, the last 48 hours, \nif the President signed three appropriations bills, 621,000 Federal \nemployees would have been at work.\n  But look, that is not the big issue. The big issue is what can we do \nto get together to legitimately get a balanced budget. It is time we do \nthat.\n  Now, I believe--I know it is something that a lot of Members do not \naccept--I believe you let the hard-working taxpayers of the country \nkeep a little bit of their money, as a matter of fact, save it or spend \nit, it helps the economy. I know we cannot get dynamic scoring, but \nwhen you let people keep their money, we wind up getting more money in \nthe Treasury, not less.\n  I ask the Democrats, do they want to keep the marriage penalty in the \nTax Code? I assume the answer is no. The only way to get rid of it is \nto do it, and it costs a little money. You call that tax cuts for the \nwealthy? Baloney. That is tax cuts for young people, whom we hope will \nget married and pay not more taxes but at least the same. Do you object \nto spousal IRA for the working spouse in the home? The only people in \nAmerica that cannot have an IRA are working spouses in the home. The \nonly way to get it is to give them an opportunity to save in an \nindividual account. Capital gains tax cut, I am for. A lot of people in \nMississippi like that. They have timberlands and do not want 40 percent \ntaken by the Government.\n  I emphasize this on the floor of the Senate. We really criticize tax \ncuts. Do you know what tax cuts are? This is letting the people that \npay the taxes keep a little of their money. The American people are \ntaxed basically at 50 percent.\n  My time is expired. I could go on and on about all of this. I will \nstop at this point. Yes, I would like for us to cool down the rhetoric. \nIt is a two-way street. Every time the President gets on TV and just \nlowers the boom on us, are we supposed to stand here and say, ``Gee, \nthank you very much.'' No. We have got to stand up and speak up and \nmake sure the American people hear the other side of the story and \nthen, of course, that begets a response on the other side. It is time \nwe bring this to a conclusion and get a balanced budget. That is all I \ncare about. We can do it. We can do it.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Did I understand the Senator to say--what year was it--\n1987?\n  Mr. LOTT. It was at least a couple years in there, 1987 and 1988, the \nDemocratic Congress did not pass a single appropriations bill. Put it \nin a big CR.\n  Mr. EXON. I do not remember the reasons for that, but 1986, of \ncourse, we had a Republican-controlled Senate, and I would not want to \nblame them for that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I said 1987.\n  Mr. EXON. In other words, what you are saying, it was a \nDemocratically controlled House and Senate that did that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe it was, yes, sir.\n  Mr. EXON. It probably was 1987 and 1988 because in that time we did \ncontrol both Houses, not 1986.\n  I have no further comments, and if we are ready to close, I am ready \nto close.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/19/senate-section/article/S18931-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
