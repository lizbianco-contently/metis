Then, \nfollowing morning business--it could be extended, of course--we will \nrecess until 8:35 this evening, at which time the Members will gather \nin the Senate Chamber so the Senate may proceed as a body to the Hall \nof the House of Representatives for the State of the Union Address.\n  It is hoped that we can reach an agreement regarding the \nconsideration of the continuing resolution and the DOD authorization \nconference report for either Thursday or Friday. I am not certain when \nthe House is going to take up the CR, and if it requires a rollcall \nvote, we have sort of indicated we would give Members some notice to \nget back here. So we would at least give them the opportunity to come \nback if there is going to be debate, amendments, and votes on the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  If an agreement is reached on these two items today, the Senate will \nadjourn until this Friday, January 26, to complete action on those \nmatters.\n  Also, to inform all Members, if both of these items are completed on \nFriday as well as the D.C. appropriations or Interior appropriations \nconference reports, if available, then it may be that the Senate would \nnot be in session until February 26. But, again, that depends on what \nmay develop tonight in the President's State of the Union Message and \nwhat may develop during the day in our discussions with the Republican \nleadership on when we may want to proceed to another budget resolution \nto send the President another balanced budget. But we do hope to \ncomplete action on all the previously mentioned items by unanimous \nconsent.\n  I might say, on the other side of the aisle, if someone indicates now \nthat they will not give us consent, then I think we could give notice \nas quickly as we can that Members would have to be back here on Friday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S291-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I intend to use my time to address where \nwe are as a nation in terms of the impact of the continuing resolution \nat 75 percent, but I see the majority leader still here. It is a little \ndifficult to state at this time whether there would be objection to a \ncontinuing resolution since we are not informed at this time as to what \nwould be in the continuing resolution. And I know that there is a \ndesire among some of our colleagues to be able to introduce clean \nbudget ceiling legislation to move toward addressing one of the \ncritical issues before the Nation.\n\n  So I, just for one, want to work in cooperation with the leadership, \nthe majority leader and the minority leader, but I do think it is \nprobably premature to try to make a judgment of whether we are going to \nbe able to get agreements on no votes at all, because we at this time \ndo not have a continuing resolution. We saw the changes that were made \nin the continuing resolution at the final hours the last time. We do \nnot know where we are going to be on the debt ceiling issue. And I, for \none, feel that we ought to be around here doing \n\n[[Page S292]]\nthe Nation's business between now and the end of February.\n  With all respect to those who have different schedules, I find it \nsomewhat difficult to understand why we are not here dealing with the \nNation's business on the range of different issues that have not been \naddressed in the Senate. We have a number of those. One of the most \nimportant is the whole issue of what is going to be the future for the \nyoung people in this country with a continuing resolution that just \nfunds education at some 75 percent of what it was a year ago, with all \nof the implications that that has in higher education and also K \nthrough 12.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S291-6", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S292-S295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EDUCATIONAL IMPACT OF SHORT-TERM FUNDING MEASURES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On Friday, January 26, the continuing resolution that \nhas kept the Government operating for the last 3 weeks will expire. \nOnce again, it will be necessary to enact a temporary funding measure \nto avoid shutting down the Government.\n  Although I understand the need to make certain accommodations while \nwe attempt to negotiate an acceptable budget agreement, many of the \nareas we are fighting to protect, especially education, are facing \nincreasing risk from this series of short-term measures.\n  A new continuing resolution, even for a few weeks, will take us past \ncritical budget, planning, and teacher contract dates in school \ndistricts and will wreak havoc on the college admissions and financial \naid process for high school students making critical college decisions. \nFurthermore, it will take us through half this fiscal year at funding \nlevels that cut education by 13 percent overall and many programs by \nmuch more. This is no way to run a Government or to indicate the \nsupport for education from kindergarten through high school and to the \ncolleges.\n\n  Mr. President, in the case of colleges, they cannot complete \nfinancial aid packages for the spring admissions cycle. By February 1, \nthe Federal Government is required by statute to supply colleges with \nthe numbers showing their Pell grant allocations and tables showing how \nmuch students of different need levels will receive in Pell grants. As \nof now, there are four different Pell grant appropriations numbers--the \nHouse, the Senate, the President's, and the continuing resolution--and \nthere are different minimum and maximum award levels.\n  Likewise, by February 1, the Government is required to supply \ncolleges with their allocation of campus-based aid--college work study, \nsupplemental education opportunity grants, and Perkins loans.\n  In February, March, and April, when high school students are admitted \nto college for next fall, they receive a detailed financial aid offer \nshowing how much each college will cost and how much aid they will get \nfrom each source--Federal, State, or college. Colleges cannot do this \npackaging for individual students without 1996 numbers for each type of \nfinancial aid.\n  Today I received a letter from the American Council on Education \nurging Congress to approve a full-year budget for education. Otherwise, \nthey say, ``The confusion that all students will face as a result of \nthis uncertainty will have its most profound impact on high school \nseniors.'' This is what they say, ``* * * profound impact on high \nschool seniors. As these students sit down with their parents to \nnegotiate the process of selecting a college to attend next fall, or \ndetermining whether they will even be able to enroll, their decisions \nwill be influenced heavily by the level and types of aid for which they \nmay be eligible in a particular school.''\n  Mr. President, just as it affects higher education, let me just \nmention what happens in many of the K-12 programs.\n  School districts across the country face needless uncertainty as they \nstruggle to prepare budgets for next year and enter into teacher \ncontracts. The Committee for Education Funding, a coalition of 90 \neducation groups representing education at all levels, calls the \nfunding levels in the continuing resolution ``a setback for education \nunprecedented in our nation's history,'' that will force ``layoffs of \nthousands of school employees and cutbacks in services to millions of \nchildren.''\n  Boston, for example, is required by State law to submit its school \nbudget for the next year to its school committee by the first Wednesday \nin February. The school committee must submit its budget to the mayor \nby the last Wednesday in March.\n  Teacher union contracts require teachers to be notified of any \nlayoffs for the next school year by May 15, or else teachers must be \npaid for the next year regardless.\n  Because there are no 1996 figures for key Federal education programs, \nBoston feels that it must adopt a budget based on the worst-case--\nHouse--level of funding for the title I Program, there would be a 15-\npercent cut for Boston schools. The city will have to eliminate title I \nservices at 14 of their 79 title I schools, and they will also have to \nlay off teachers.\n  In Framingham, MA, Superintendent Eugene Thayer tells me that they \nwill have to eliminate all title I reading programs in all middle \nschools, and severely cut back the support in elementary schools.\n  The Philadelphia public schools estimate that they will lose $13.5 \nmillion in title I funds under the current continuing resolution. At \nthese levels, they will be forced to eliminate services in 62 schools \nserving 48,000 children. They will also have to lay off 100 teachers \nand 200 aides.\n  In New York, even if a final budget is passed by March 15, school \ndistricts may not be able to learn their allocations before the \nbeginning of May--far beyond the April 1 deadline for teacher contract \nnegotiations.\n  Based on past experience, New York educators say that it will take \nthe Federal Government a few weeks, once a budget is passed, to \ndetermine State allocations for title I. These allocations are based on \ncounties, and it takes New York 2 to 3 weeks to determine sub-\nallocations to its 700 school districts. This timetable would put \nschool districts far behind their required budget schedules to comply \nwith teacher contracts.\n  Mr. President, if you look at what we are doing, it is that \neffectively we will be cutting $3.1 billion, the largest cut in the \nNation's history, in education. Last year, with the rescissions \nprogram, it was more than $600 million, and we are adding to that $3.1 \nbillion in cuts. Those education programs would be cut basically by \nsome 13 percent overall; the title I by 17 percent, and the list goes \non.\n  We should oppose education cuts whenever and wherever they occur. \nPresident Clinton has demonstrated we can balance the budget in 7 years \nand protect education. We should not allow education to be slashed \nthrough the back door when those cuts would not be accepted through the \nfront door.\n  That is the problem. We are going to be asked, on a continuing \nresolution, to fund it at 75 percent on this, with all of the \ndisruption that it is going to be having for hundreds of thousands of \nyoung people who have graduated from high school and who want to go to \ncolleges, with all the disruption it will have for the parents and \nthose young people, with all the disruption it will have for hundreds \nof thousands of young people who will be going, either from Head Start \nthrough kindergarten and all the way up through high school, with all \nthe disruption it will have in the classrooms for the teachers, the \nparents and the students.\n  Effectively, now, we have gone from holding hostage the Federal \nemployees to holding hostage the schoolchildren in this country. That \nwill be the effect and the impact of the continuing resolution, even at \nthe 75 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, when we hear the majority leader talk about \nwhether we can get an agreement, we know what they are saying: You \nbetter take the 75 percent or take responsibility for closing down the \nGovernment. That is the policy which is being announced here on the \nfloor of the Senate this afternoon. That is an intolerable policy. It \nis, in terms of the young people of this country. Why should they, \neffectively, be held hostage? The education policy in this country will \nbe held hostage because of the small minority of Members in this body \nor in the other body who refuse to permit an orderly processing of the \neducation programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent letters from the American \nCouncil on Education and the Committee for Education Funding be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n[[Page S293]]\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations, U.S. Senate, S-128 The \n         Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write on behalf of the nation's \n     colleges and universities to express our hope that Congress \n     will approve a full-year budget that provides adequate \n     appropriations for education programs, especially the student \n     financial assistance programs administered by the Department \n     of Education.\n       As you are aware, federal student assistance is the primary \n     means by which students and their families receive help \n     financing a college education. Nearly eight million students \n     rely on some form of federal student aid. This year, however, \n     the highly effective system to deliver federal aid that was \n     constructed with bipartisan support is threatened with chaos \n     and uncertainty. Deadlines that will set the parameters for \n     the amount of aid our campuses may distribute to needy \n     students are approaching rapidly. Without knowing the Pell \n     Grant maximum award level, or the amount of Supplemental \n     Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) or College Work-Study \n     (CWS) money available, or whether any funding will exist for \n     State Student Incentive Grants (SSIG), Perkins Loans, Javits \n     or Harris Fellowships, college aid officers and admissions \n     counselors will be unable to develop aid packages for the \n     coming academic year or provide accurate and appropriate \n     advice to students.\n       The confusion that all students will face as a result of \n     this uncertainly will have its most profound impact on high \n     school seniors. As these students sit down with their parents \n     to negotiate the process of selecting a college to attend \n     next fall, or determining whether they even will be able to \n     enroll, their decisions will be influenced heavily by the \n     level and types of aid for which they may be eligible at a \n     particular school.\n       As you prepare a Continuing Resolution to keep federal \n     programs operating past January 26th, we urge you to provide \n     secure funding for the federal student assistance programs \n     through the end of the fiscal year. The House and Senate \n     bills provide identical appropriations for SEOG, CWS, and \n     TRIO, and contain similar language regarding the Pell Grant \n     maximum award. We urge the deletion of a Senate restriction \n     limiting Pell Grants to not more than 3,768,000 students. \n     However, we urge you to adopt the Senate provisions \n     continuing the current Pell Grant minimum award level and \n     assuring that funding is provided for the SSIG program, the \n     Perkins Loan program, the Javits Fellowship program, and the \n     Harris Fellowship program.\n       We appreciate your consideration of these views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert H. Atwell,\n                                                        President.\n\n       On behalf of the following postsecondary education \n     associations: American Association of Community Colleges, \n     American Association of State Colleges and Universities, \n     American Council on Education, Association of American \n     Universities, Association of Catholic Colleges and \n     Universities, Association of Community College Trustees, \n     Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities, \n     Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Council of \n     Graduate Schools, Council of Independent Colleges, Hispanic \n     Association of Colleges and Universities, National \n     Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, \n     National Association of College and University Business \n     Officers, National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities, National Association of State Universities and \n     Land-Grant Colleges, United Negro College Fund.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Committee for Education Funding,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: The Committee for Education \n     Funding (CEF), a coalition of ninety major education \n     organizations representing a broad spectrum of the education \n     community, strongly urges you to seek a bipartisan budget \n     agreement that makes education investment a priority and also \n     to approve a continuing resolution that maintains the vital \n     educational opportunities of America's children, youth, and \n     adults while negotiations proceed. We also urge you to oppose \n     a year long extension of the current continuing resolution, \n     which cuts education by $3.1 billion, or targeted \n     appropriations that fund some programs while eliminating or \n     cutting others.\n       Recent polls show that the American public believes \n     strongly that improving education should be a top priority \n     for Congress. The polls also demonstrate overwhelming--92%--\n     support for the same or increased federal funding for \n     education. Yet Congress is about to approve another \n     continuing resolution for FY96 that would cut education by \n     $3.1 billion if extended for the remainder of this fiscal \n     year--a setback for education unprecedented in our nation's \n     history. This is in addition to $600 million in rescissions \n     from education already enacted for FY95.\n       A full year extension of the current continuing resolution \n     would mean severe cuts in basic skills instruction; college \n     grants, scholarships, and loans for needy students; school \n     reform and educational standards; teacher education; \n     vocational and career preparation; educational technology; \n     learning English; school safety and drug abuse prevention; \n     educational research and innovation; impact aid; libraries; \n     Head Start; and other vital education programs. See the \n     attached sheets for details of the impact of these cuts.\n       Almost a third of this fiscal year is over without \n     providing 1996 funding levels for education. Postsecondary \n     institutions across the country are unable to approve \n     financial aid packages for millions of students. States and \n     local school districts are making budget decisions now that \n     will force layoffs of thousands of school employees and \n     cutbacks of services to millions of children.\n       We urge you to oppose these cuts and insist that \n     Congressional leaders make investment in education a top \n     priority in the budget for FY96 and beyond. Americans want \n     greater educational opportunities for themselves and their \n     families to meet the challenges of a changing world economy. \n     Stop the education cuts and secure America's economic future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Violet Boyer,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n              1996 committee for education funding members\n\n       American Association of Classified School Employees, \n     American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, \n     American Association of Community Colleges, American \n     Association of School Administrators, American Association of \n     State Colleges and Universities, American Association of \n     University Professors, American Counseling Association, \n     American Council on Education, American Educational Research \n     Association, American Federation of Labor and Congress of \n     Industrial Organizations.\n       American Federation of School Administrators, American \n     Federation of State, County, & Municipal Employees, American \n     Federation of Teachers, American Library Association, \n     American Psychological Association, American School Food \n     Service Association, American Student Association of \n     Community Colleges, American Vocational Association, \n     America's Public Television Stations, Association for \n     Supervision and Curriculum Development, Association of \n     American Publishers.\n       Association of American Universities, Association of \n     Community College Trustees, Association of Proprietary \n     Colleges, California Department of Education, California \n     State University, Career College Association, City University \n     of New York, Coalition of Higher Education Assistance \n     Organizations, The College Board, Colorado Department of \n     Education.\n       Cooperative Education Association, Incorporated, Council \n     for American Private Education, Council for Educational \n     Development and Research, The Council for Exceptional \n     Children, Council of Chief State School Officers, Council of \n     Graduate Schools, Council of the Great City Schools, \n     Educational Testing Service, Georgetown University.\n       International Reading Association, John F.

Mr. President, I think we are all very much looking \nforward to hearing the President's State of the Union Address tonight. \nIt is a great honor to be a Member of this body and a great honor to be \nable to sit in the room with our national leader and hear his thoughts \nabout the future for this country.\n  I recall just a year ago, when the President gave his first State of \nthe Union Address, under the rule of a different political party in the \nCongress, that some of the pundits said one of the questions was \nwhether President Clinton would be irrelevant to the process; he had to \nestablish his relevance. That was an absurd proposition. Of course we \nfound, during the past year, it is pretty tough to make any President \nirrelevant, given his powers and given the willingness of this \nPresident to use those powers this year to try to represent the reality \nof our Government. The reality of our Government in 1995, and now in \n1996, is we have a split Government. One party is in the majority in \nthe Congress and one party controls the Presidency.\n  What I appreciated at the time, though, despite some of those press \ncomments about the President's possible irrelevance, is that he came \nright out there and talked about many issues, and, in the midst of all \nthis alleged irrelevance, he was willing to put on the table something \nthat had been overlooked, perhaps forgotten, in the language of the \nContract With America. That is, he brought us back to what I like to \ncall--what many people in both parties like to call--the reform agenda, \nthe political reform agenda.\n  Those were issues across party lines that respond to the national \nfeeling that maybe there is a little bit too much money in Washington \nthat is expressed in too many ways and takes the elected \nrepresentatives away from focusing on their constituents. So it was \nvery helpful last year when the President in his State of the Union \nAddress referred to the need for Members of Congress to give up the \ngifts, to have a gift ban. In fact, the President said something like, \n``Why don't you just say no.'' Those words were helpful. And it came to \npass, in part because of his leadership, in part because of the \npublic's interest. The media helped by exposing the reality of the \ngift-giving practice.\n\n  But what helped most of all, along with the President's words, was \nthe fact that there was a bipartisan effort, a true bipartisan effort, \nfirst in the Senate and then in the House, to try to stop this \nridiculous practice of allowing gifts to be given to Members of \nCongress. It went into effect on January 1. I do not think it got \nenough attention in the year-end analysis of what happened in the 104th \nCongress. There were a lot of bad things to talk about, a lot of \nfailure to resolve, a lot of failure to cooperate between the parties. \nBut on that issue, both Houses in the end responded overwhelmingly and \nvery positively.\n  Tonight is an opportunity for the President, President Clinton, to \ntake us to round 2 of the political reform agenda. I refer to it as \nsort of the big daddy of political reform compared to the gift ban. \nThat is the issue of real campaign finance reform.\n  President Clinton is no newcomer to campaign finance reform. I \nremember, as a brandnew U.S. Senator, in January 1993, the President \ncame to our Democratic conference in the Senate. He said he had three \ntop priorities for his term. The first had to do with the deficit and \nthe economy. Of course there has been progress. We are still struggling \nmightily to try to move forward even more in that area. Second, he \ntalked about his desire to reform our health care system. We have not \nachieved our goals in that area. That has been an area of \ndisappointment to which we must return. But the third item he mentioned \nand that not many people are aware that he stressed right from the \nbeginning was his belief that we had to have campaign finance reform \nfor congressional elections, to truly change the tenor of the debate \nand the policy outcomes in this country.\n  So he did not miss any time. He referred to the unnecessary and \nextreme hold that powerful moneyed interests have in this town of \nWashington and he did so in his Inaugural Address. Last summer, when he \nhad the chance to appear jointly with the Speaker of the other body, he \nwas quick to emphasize the issue of campaign finance reform, and did \nthe famous handshake where he indicated his willingness to work \ntogether with both parties to solve the problem. So President Clinton \nhas been there whenever the call for political reform has gone out. He \nhas always been supportive, as we try to solve these problems. So he \nhas been a big help.\n\n  But tonight we need more help. Tonight we need the President of the \nUnited States to specifically put his strength, and the strength of his \noffice, and the strength of his resolve, behind a national effort to \nchange our campaign laws so that the people of our country can feel for \nthe first time in a long time that those elections belong to them, that \ntheir votes count, and that it is not just the power of big money and \ninfluences that they cannot see or hear that control those elections.\n  Mr. President, let us build on the success this year when some \nMembers of this body tried to change the system we have for financing \nour Presidential election. Let us build on that. We were able to defeat \nthat.\n  The Presidential election in 1992 actually involved less expenditures \nthan the Presidential election in 1988. That is because of the national \nlaws we have had in this area. That is lacking in the congressional \narea. We have a complete OK Corral situation where any amount of money \ncan be spent, and there are no rules to speak of about how much is \nspent in these elections. So nothing would be more helpful than to have \nthe President tonight mention the fact that he has been and continues \nto be very supportive of campaign finance reform.\n  I think he knows there is a unique opportunity in the Congress this \nyear. Working with Senator McCain of Arizona and others we have \nintroduced the first bipartisan campaign finance reform bill in 10 \nyears. It is a voluntary bill, as it must be under the Supreme Court \nrule in Buckley versus Valeo, but it addresses several of the major \nareas of concern. It addresses that there is too much money spent in \nindividual elections. It addresses the fact that we would like to \nencourage candidates to get a majority of their campaign contributions \nfrom their own home States. It for the first time addresses the problem \nthat too many people are spending their own personal fortunes to be \nelected.\n  All of these things are addressed in the bill. I am hoping the \nPresident has been made aware of that and is supportive.\n  What is even more exciting is, it is not only bipartisan but it is \nbicameral. In the House there was another bill being promoted that \nseveral of the House Members said, why do we not look at the Senate \nbill? They made their own version of the McCain-Feingold bill, and they \nhave many supporters of both parties involved. People in the country \nhave noticed.\n  A bipartisan, bicameral bill endorsed by over 25 major newspapers in \nthis country--Common Cause, Public Citizen, and many other groups.\n  Mr. President, I think one of the reasons why it has received such \nreception from the public is that people know that it is not just a \nquestion of too much money being spent in elections. They know there is \na connection between what is spent in Washington on campaigns, what is \nconnected to things like why we cannot solve our budget problem, why \nthere is too much money spent in Washington, even though the public is \nbegging us to get our finances under control.\n  In fact, I think there is a direct connection between campaign \nfinancing, overspending in campaigns, the drive to raise all the money \nyou can, and the fact that we still have not resolved the deficit \nproblem. The ability of many special interests to secure millions, and \nsometimes billions, of taxpayers' dollars in Federal contracts and \nsubsidies and other spending programs relates directly to our current \ncampaign finance system where candidates for public office must raise \nmillions of dollars for their campaigns.\n  A report was just issued by the Center for Responsive Politics \nentitled ``Cashing in From A to Z.'' It is a long report, but they list \na few recent examples that I think the public can respond to. Cattle \nand sheep ranch interests contributed over $600,000 during the \n\n[[Page S295]]\nlast election cycle while fighting to protect Federal grazing fee \npolicies that give ranchers access to Federal lands at below-market \nprices.\n  The mining industry spent over $1 million in 1993-94 on campaign \ncontributions to Members of Congress so that they could try to prevent \nthe reform of the 1872 mining law which allows people to pay a few \nthousand dollars for land that contains billions of dollars worth of \ngold and silver and other minerals.\n  The oil and gas interests contributed over $6.1 million during the \nlast election cycle to help back their hefty 1995 agenda, which \nincluded repeal of the alternative minimum tax. They do not even want \nto pay a minimum tax for all the profits they are making.\n  Mr. President, in the 6 weeks following a close House vote on funding \nthe B-2 bomber, opposed by even the Defense Department, contributions \nfrom defense contractor Northrop Grumman's PAC's to House Members who \nvoted for the program totaled over $50,000, just from that one company \nfor that one program that the Defense Department did not even want.\n  Mr. President, obviously I could go on with these examples, but they \nshow the fact it is not just a question of there being too much money \nin campaigns, but the connection between campaigns and the fact that we \nstill have a terrible budget and deficit problem in this country.\n  So, Mr. President, it has become clear to many of us, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, that their failed campaign finance system \ncontributes to keeping many unnecessary Government subsidies flowing, \nand it helps explain why well-financed special interests were able to \ngrab the legislative process by the scruff of the neck in the first \nplace.\n  Mr. President, it is my fond hope the President of the United States \nwill use his bully pulpit and excellent intentions on this issue to \ngive a strong push behind the bicameral, bipartisan effort to reform \nour campaign finance laws.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S292-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I believe we are closer to a balanced \nbudget than we have been in many years. I think the public \noverwhelmingly wants a balanced budget. I think we are moving in that \ndirection. But there are little problems here and there that seem to \nprevent us from getting together in being able to shake hands on a \nbalanced budget.\n  The President and the Republican leadership I think all realize that \nwe need a balanced budget for it will certainly directly affect \nvirtually every segment of the Government and every citizen of the \ncountry. I feel that lost in the political rhetoric over the budget is \nthe fact that we have reached substantial agreements at this stage.\n  We have agreed that the budget ought to be balanced in 7 years. We \nhave agreed that CBO figures ought be controlling. We have agreed that \nthere ought to be less Government. We have agreed that there ought to \nbe a tax cut. And while both sides still have some major differences to \nwork out, I feel that good-faith negotiations on these issues can yield \na budget that is fair and equitable to all segments of society, and \neach party can claim victory.\n  When the recess occurred, there was a statement to the effect that we \nwere going to stop the negotiations and then come back again.\n  There have been three or four efforts that have been made recently to \ntry to get the parties together to start negotiating again. But for \nsome reason or other they have been called off. Now that the recess is \nover, and the recess from the negotiations is over, it is time to begin \nagain and for each side to meet and come to an agreement. The longer \nthe negotiators avoid constructive negotiations the greater the chances \nfor each side to become reentrenched in their policy positions.\n  Compromise is an art that appears to have somehow been forgotten. It \nis apparent that in order for an agreement to be reached, both \nDemocrats and Republicans are going to have to give and take. Each side \nis going to have to have some wins and each side is going to have to \nhave some losses. If the Israelis and the Palestinians can get together \nand negotiate in good faith, there is no reason why the Democrats and \nthe Republicans cannot do likewise. If the Croats, Moslems, and Serbs \ncan agree on a cease-fire, why cannot both parties put their verbal \npistols back in their holsters?\n  I do not know exactly what the solution is. But it may well be that \nwe may have to go to Camp David and tell them to stay there until they \nreach an agreement. Maybe Dayton is the place. Maybe Norway. But \nwhatever it takes in regards to getting together and finding a location \nand staying with it until we reach an agreement, it seems to me to be \nthe proper course to follow. When you add it up, the current Democratic \nproposals and the Republican proposals are less than $100 billion \napart. Taking into account $12 trillion over a 7-year period, this \nfigure amounts to less than .8 of 1 percent. With this in mind, it \nseems to me that the negotiations should proceed with an emphasis on \nwhat each side is willing to give and take in order to reach a long \noverdue budget agreement.\n\n  The State of the Union Address will have a significant impact on the \nnegotiations. It is a good opportunity for the President to demonstrate \nhis willingness to reach an accord. However, if his speech is overly \npartisan, it can harm the negotiating atmosphere by having a hardening \neffect on the Republican negotiators. Likewise, the Republican response \ncan also either help or hurt the negotiating process.\n  Hopefully, the President will extend a hand of conciliation, and if \nhe does, I hope the Republicans will not slap it, but instead shake it. \nI hope that each Senator will keep this in mind when determining \nexactly what he or she wants to convey, when commenting on the content \nof the President's speech. Each Senator must be aware that their \nresponses may affect the overall negotiations pertaining to the budget.\n  We need to adopt a continuing resolution--hopefully a clean one--by \nJanuary 26. The expiration of the current continuing resolution, of \ncourse, runs out on that date. Despite all the heated rhetoric, I do \nnot believe it is in the best interest of our citizens to have the \nremaining portion of Government closed down. A great number of the \nvarious Agencies and Departments will stay open under the legislation \nthat has already been adopted.\n  Taxpayers and Federal employees should not be punished, because \nCongress and the administration have not fulfilled their obligation to \nreach a budget.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated before, I think it is imperative that \nwe reach an agreement on the budget, and I am optimistic that when \nreasonable people sit down together an agreement can be worked out.\n  It seems to me we have made a great deal of progress. We have agreed \non some fundamentals: A 7-year period for a balanced budget; CBO \nfigures; a tax cut; and a cut in Government. We just need to get \ntogether. Perhaps we need a mediator. But I hope that we will let \nreason prevail, and we will not let this opportunity pass to achieve a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

Mr. President, too often here in Washington, politicians \ncome to town with a mission but end up coming down with a severe case \nof Beltway fever.\n  They get caught up in the unreal atmosphere of this place and \neventually forget what it was that first propelled them into public \nservice.\n  They shut themselves away in their Senate or House offices or even in \nthe Oval Office.\n  They spend their time hobnobbing with their new-found Washington \nfriends. And after awhile, they just lose touch with the folks who sent \nthem here. They think they are doing ``the people's business,'' but in \ntruth, they are no longer speaking for the people at all.\n  The 11 Members of the Senate freshman class came to town with a \nmission, too, a mandate given to us by the voters.\n  We met often as a group last year to track our progress. And as 1995 \ncame to \n\n[[Page S296]]\na close, we took a step back and began asking ourselves some pretty \ntough questions, such as:\n  What is the mood of the country?\n  What are people saying about Congress and the decisions we freshmen \nfaced in our first year in the Senate?\n  Did we really hear the message we thought we heard in November 1994, \nwhen the voters sent us here to balance the budget to get Government \nspending under control, to deliver middle-class tax relief, and protect \nand strengthen Medicare and Medicaid?\n  Most importantly, is the message that brought this freshman class to \nthe Senate in 1994 still alive and well in 1996?\n  We thought we knew the answers, and we knew we had delivered on each \none of our promises, but after being in Washington and of course, \ndebating those very important questions over the past year, we thought \nit was time for a reality check.\n  So last week, at the urging of my good friend, Senator Abraham from \nMichigan, nine Members of the freshman class took to the road to take \nour message directly to the people and bring the people's message back \nwith us to Washington.\n  We visited eight cities over 4 days. What we saw and heard truly \nopened our eyes and, I believe, reaffirmed our mission.\n  In Philadelphia, we toured an empowerment zone and shared ideas on \nhow to rebuild our troubled inner cities. The section of north \nPhiladelphia we visited is a model for the concept that restoring \nneighborhoods means creating incentives for businesses to locate in \nurban areas. The Federal Government has made a difference, local \nofficials told us, but the incentive is tax relief for these areas to \nattract businesses and jobs.\n  In Knoxville, 300 concerned citizens packed the auditorium at West \nHigh School for a town meeting. They cheered our progress on a balanced \nbudget and called on us--and forcefully I might add--not to give up.\n  In Columbus, at a crime forum, we met with police, other law-\nenforcement officials, and victims of crime who shared how Washington \ncan play an important role in making local neighborhoods safer.\n  Rain, sleet, snow, and even a blizzard warning could not stop a crowd \nfrom attending my town meeting in Minneapolis. We had a frank and, I \nbelieve, lively discussion covering a tremendous range of issues and \nthe audience enthusiastically applauded our efforts to shrink the size \nand scope of government and return power to the States.\n  Employees at the Emerson Electric Co. in St. Louis sat down with us \nto talk about a balanced budget and just what it would mean for \nthemselves and their families. It was heartening to hear their words of \nsupport, especially since our budget is specifically targeted at \nimproving their lives, and the lives of every hard-working, taxpaying, \nmiddle-class American family.\n  In Tulsa, we met with small business owners--the men and women who \ncreate the jobs on Main Street--for a roundtable discussion organized \nby the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce.\n  Again, they thanked the Members of the 104th Congress for taking such \na strong lead in bringing job providers relief from the stranglehold of \nFederal regulations and mandates.\n  Our whirlwind tour ended in Cheyenne, with a final opportunity to \nhear from the voters at a town hall meeting at the Cheyenne Civic \nCenter.\n  At each stop, the people thanked us for taking our message directly \nto them and bypassing the curtain of misinformation draped over the \nissues by the congressional Democratic leadership, the White House, and \ntoo often, the media. They repeatedly shared their frustrations at \nhearing only one side of the budget debate.\n  And at each stop, they asked ``why can't you reach a compromise with \nthe President on a balanced budget?''\n  The President's latest budget plan--the first plan of his that \nactually balances in 7 years--is similar to the four other budget plans \nhe sent to Capitol Hill in the last year which, by the way, got no \nvotes in the House and Senate. Throughout these weeks and weeks of \nbudget negotiations, he has given up very little while Republicans have \nmoved dramatically to help spur an agreement.\n  The President's budget cuts around the edges, but does not reform a \nthing. And I think we can say in one word the President's budget is a \nsham.\n  It does not reverse the kind of wild overspending that will continue \nto drag this Nation deeper into debt.\n  Spending remains unchecked under his latest plan, and $1 out of every \n$6 the President claims in deficit reduction comes not from cuts in \nspending, but from raising new revenue, new taxes.\n  It does not save Medicare and provide the choices for seniors our \nplan offers. Under the Clinton plan, Medicare remains a relic from \n1960's that no longer works in the 1990's.\n  His budget does not reform Medicaid, either. We say let the States \nrun Medicaid, and they will do a better job. The President's plan says, \nagain, Washington has all the answers.\n  He does not offer meaningful tax relief. His tax cuts amount to only \ntoken tax relief, and with $66 billion in new taxes, the President's \nbudget does nothing to reduce the tax liability of the country. His \nversion of the $500-per-child tax credit is slowly phased in and then \neliminated in 2002, and applies only to children 12 years old and \nyounger.\n  He does not make fundamental changes in welfare to control spending.\n  In fact, his welfare proposals spend $20 billion more than the \nbipartisan welfare bill passed by Congress. The President does not \n``end welfare as we know it,'' he extends welfare as we know it.\n  In reality, the President's budget plan is just a Band-Aid on a wound \nthat is demanding emergency surgery. Yank off the Band-Aid after 7 \nyears and the wound will not be healed, it will have festered and \ngrown.\n  Mr. President, it will do no good to balance the budget in 2002 if it \nall unravels in 2003. And without a solid framework to work from, that \nis precisely where we would be heading under the President's version of \na balanced budget.\n  That is how the freshman class answered the question each time we \nwere asked why we have not been able to reach a budget compromise. We \nwill not compromise our principles. No budget is better than a bad \nbudget.\n  The President is right when he says the debate over the Federal \nbudget is no longer just about dollars. It is about dollars and about \nsomething far more important: the future direction of this Nation, and \nwhich governing philosophy ought to lead us there.\n  The President says maybe we should wait until the next election and \nlet the people decide what direction they want their Government to \ntake. But the taxpayers we met with in Knoxville, and Philadelphia, and \nMinneapolis, and Tulsa last week told us that is the change they \nthought they voted for in November 1994, when they turned this \nGovernment around by electing a new majority in Congress.\n  You know, President Clinton is going to come here to the Capitol \ntonight to deliver what will undoubtedly be a passionate speech on the \nState of the Union.\n  As we all know, he can be an impressive speaker. He will speak \nfervently and forcefully and, with any luck, he will wrap up in time \nfor Sunday's Super Bowl kickoff.\n  I hope that what we hear tonight is a message of leadership, an \nacknowledgement of the awesome responsibility with which a President is \nentrusted, and a willingness to put aside a narrow political agenda in \norder to do what is best for the American people.\n  Only great leadership will lead this Nation toward the great days \nthat await us.\n  What I am afraid we will get instead is a campaign event--the great \nkick-off to Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.\n  Judging by the folks we met around the country last week, he may have \na tougher go of it than he thinks in the weeks and months ahead because \nat every stop on our freshman tour, Americans offered us their full \nsupport.\n  ``Do not back down,'' ``Hold the line,'' they said. ``Get the budget \nbalanced, but do it right.'' A lot of people told us they would be \nwilling to wait a year for a responsible budget agreement, if that is \nwhat it takes.\n  Maybe then, they said, somebody a little more serious about balancing \nthe budget will be occupying the Oval Office.\n  And so the revolution of 1994 continues, Mr. President. \n  \n[[Page S297]]\n\n  That is the strong message my freshman colleagues and I bring with us \nback to Washington.

Mr. President, I rise to follow my friend, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, in noting what I thought was useful, and that was the \ntour of freshman Senators throughout the country, actually, starting \nhere in Washington, on through the Midwest, and ending up in Cheyenne, \nWY.\n  It seemed to me to be a very useful kind of an activity. Our theme \nwas ``Promises Made, Promises Kept.'' I think it was appropriate that 9 \nof the 11 new freshmen in this body participated. We made 10 stops in 9 \nStates to talk about this kind of commitment to the things that had \nbrought us to the Senate in 1994. I think we all agreed in general that \nthere was a message in 1994, and that message basically was the Federal \nGovernment is too big and costs too much and we need to change the \nregulatory restrictions on the opportunities in this country.\n  That has been the effort of this freshman class, and to a large \nextent this body during that year. We have felt some kinship in that we \nhave come here together, we did share this commitment, and we were \ncommitted to change. We had just come from an election where, I think, \nthat message perhaps permeates a bit more than those who have been here \nbefore, perhaps.\n  There has been a great deal of success, I think, in that message. We \nhave not accomplished specifically all the things that we would like to \nbut the major change has been the turn of the debate. I think most \nanyone who has watched the Congress over the last 25 years would have \nto say that the conversation has basically been centered around those \nprograms that have been in place for 25 years. They largely came in the \nLyndon Johnson Great Society time, and each year most of the time has \nbeen spent saying, ``How much more money do we put into the program? If \nit has not worked as well as it should, we will put more money in.''\n  Now that debate has changed somewhat. The debate has change markedly. \nWe are talking for the first time in 25 years about a balanced budget. \nWe are talking for the first time in 25 years about how you spend less \nrather than more. That is a significant change in the framing of the \ndebate in this country, a significant change in the direction that this \nCongress would take, and hopefully that this country would take.\n  We have talked about things like reducing spending as opposed to \ncontinuing to add more to the deficit, to add more to a $5 trillion \ndebt. We talked about a balanced budget. We have not had a balanced \nbudget in almost 30 years. This is the first time that a balanced \nbudget has been presented to the President of the United States. \nUnfortunately, he saw fit to veto it.\n\n  We have talked about entitlement changes. Most anybody who looks at \nour financial situation fairly has to see that we have to do something \nabout entitlements. You cannot change the direction of spending by \nsimply talking about those things that are discretionary. Two-thirds of \nthe spending is in entitlements. You have to change that. Of course it \nis difficult. But we have set about to do that. We have talked about \nwelfare reform, to make welfare the kind of program that most everyone \nbelieves it ought to be, where you help people who need help, but help \nthem get back into the system, back into the workplace.\n  Middle-income tax reform--instead of the largest tax increase in the \nhistory, which is what we had 2 years ago, we are talking about middle-\nincome tax relief. Also line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform.\n  That is what has happened. We are very pleased about that and we took \nthat message to the country. In addition to that message, I think we \ntook some facts. We sort of evolved into politics by posturing and to a \nsituation of policy by perception rather than facts. It is ironic. We \nhave the ability to present facts to the whole world in a second. Fifty \nyears ago it was months after something was done here before people \neven knew about it. Now we have this great opportunity, but \nunfortunately we are doing governing by advertising, doing governing by \nspinning.\n  We talk about gutting Medicare. Nobody in this place is interested in \ngutting Medicare. In fact, when you look of course at the numbers, why, \nobviously, it is not. That is what we talked about.\n  We talked about fundamental change. We heard a great deal of positive \nresponse to that. People who are aware of the benefits that come from \nbalancing the budget, the fact that we can lower interest rates, reduce \nthe cost of mortgages, and reduce the cost of loans to send your kids \nto school, and we can talk about being responsible for going into a new \ncentury without continuing to add costs to the debt for our kids to \npay.\n  I want to say that I think this trip was very useful and I am pleased \nthat my colleagues were willing to take their time to go. I am \nparticularly pleased they went to Cheyenne, WY. We had the largest town \nmeeting we have ever had there. Not everyone is in agreement how to do \nit, but the preponderance of people say we need to be responsible. We \nneed to look to the future. One little guy in the audience had a \ncomputer. We talked about $5 trillion debt, he divided it by the number \nof people and announced we each owe $17,000, and we were dazzled a \nlittle by the technology, but the answer is right, we do.\n\n  Mr. President, what we need here is leadership. We need to provide \nfor the direction of this country. We do not need obstructionism. We do \nnot need insistence on the status quo. This is a great country with a \ngreat future. We have the best opportunity that we have ever had to \nstrengthen that future and make it a land of responsibility and the \nland of opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S297-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nconcern about our being out of session for the next considerable period \nof time in the context of the gridlock and breakdown over the \nnegotiations of the budget. It is my hope that the negotiators will \ncontinue the budget negotiations because of the importance of reaching \na resolution on those subjects, and that we will not have a recurrence \nof the shutdown of Government, as we have had twice in the course of \nthe past several weeks, or that there will not be a resort to the debt \nceiling issue as an instrument of, candidly speaking, political \nblackmail--which I think will be unsuccessful. If we are not able to \nresolve the budget disagreements, that we will at least crystallize the \nissue and make that the election issue in 1996.\n\n  I made this point back on November 14, on the second day of the first \ngovernmental shutdown. It seemed to me from the start that this was bad \npolicy. From the reaction of the American people, that view was \nconfirmed. That is simply not the way to run the Government of the \nUnited States.\n  I think the budget negotiators, however, have worked hard and there \nhas been considerable progress made. I have taken a look, in reviewing \nthe issues, and believe that the negotiators with more work can come to \na conclusion. The central point is to have a balanced budget--a matter \nof enormous importance.\n  There has been an agreement in principle by the Republican-controlled \nCongress and Republican-controlled White--almost a Freudian slip, to \nmake the Republicans control the White House as well. We have a divided \n\n\n[[Page S298]]\nGovernment, but at least there has been agreement on that principle. \nThere is a substantial question as to whether the balanced budget \nproposal offered by the administration meets the ``fair'' criterion, \nsince so much of it is deferred until the years 2001 and 2002. But I \nthink there is ample room for negotiation, in order to have a realistic \nagreement made in those terms.\n  I spoke on this matter to some extent yesterday and wish to amplify \nit today. One set of figures which bear repeating are the statistics on \nthe narrowing of the gap between the parties on major issues such as \nMedicare, where the rate of increase is reduced in the conference \nreport passed by the Republican-controlled Congress. Note it is not a \ncut but rather a reduction of the rate of increase by $270 billion, \nwhich has since been reduced to $168 billion. The administration first \nagreed to $102 billion and now recommends reducing the rate of increase \nby $124 billion. So there is a gap now remaining of $44 billion, \nconsiderably closer than what had been initially in the range of $168 \nbillion.\n  Similarly, on Medicare, the original position of the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress was $133 billion, since reduced to $85 billion with \nthe administration at $59 billion on a reduction on the rate of \nincrease. So that gap is narrowing.\n  Similarly, on the tax cut, the House figures are in the range of $350 \nbillion and were reduced to $245 billion in the conference report. That \nhas since been reduced further to $203 billion, while the \nadministration proposes $130 billion.\n  I have taken a close look at a number of the structural points in \ndisagreement, while working with others in the House and Senate, to try \nto report out a bill on the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, \nHealth, Human Services and Education, a subcommittee which I chair. I \nhave had extensive negotiations with Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, Richard Riley, Secretary of Education, and Robert \nReich, Secretary of Labor and find that the principal issues arise in \nthe Departments of Education and Health and Human Services.\n  As I have taken a look at the various issues, it seems to me that \nmiddle ground can be reached. If you take a look at the medical savings \naccount, which is a controversial item, or the Medicare opt-out \nposition as to HMO's back and forth, or the Medicare beneficiary part B \npayments, or the issue of balance billing by doctors, or the concern \nwhich has been expressed over the regulation of doctors' fees--all of \nthose matters--if you take the congressional position as opposed to the \nadministration position, you find there is middle ground available.\n  If you look at the Medicaid issue, in addition to the figures \nnarrowing, the structural matters also are subject to compromise.\n  If you take a look at welfare, there again, compromise is possible. \nWhere the welfare reform bill passed by the Senate with overwhelming \nnumbers, some 87 Senators voting in favor of the measure, there was a \ngreat deal of reliance on the block grants. There is an area for \ncompromise on providing the bulk of welfare related programs through \nblock grants but certain specific programs should remain with standards \nestablished by the Federal Government. I think the statement made by \nthe very distinguished Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith, is \nworth repeating, when she distinguished between the issues of the \nprinciple of compromise as opposed to the compromise of principle. We \nare not talking about freedom of speech or freedom of religion or first \namendment issues. We are talking about dollars and cents. And we are, \nreally, very, very close together.\n  So it is my hope that the negotiators will continue, because I think \nagreement is within reach, and when we are talking about the central \nprinciple of a balanced budget, that is something that we ought not \ngive up on. We ought to continue to work to try to narrow the gap, and \nI hope that we will continue to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S297-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S298-S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN SPENDING LIMITS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, January 29, which is next Monday, will be \nthe 20th anniversary of the decision of Buckley v. Valeo. I had \nintended to comment on January 29, the anniversary date of that \ndecision which established as a principle of constitutional law that \nany individual could spend as much of his or her money in a campaign as \nhe or she chose. That issue was a matter of substantial consternation \nto me when the decision was handed down and, I think, remains a major \nimpediment on public policy in the United States on the way we run our \nelection campaigns, where, realistically viewed, any seat is up for \nsale.\n  There have been many, many examples of multimillion-dollar \nexpenditures in this body, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and in State Government, and now we are witnessing one \nfor the Presidency of the United States.\n  The fact of life is, if you advertise enough on television, if you \nsell candidacies like you sell soap, the sky is the limit. Even the \nWhite House of the United States of America, the Office of the \nPresident, may be, in fact, up for sale if someone is willing to start \noff by announcing a willingness to spend $25 million. If you have $400 \nmillion, that is not an enormous sum; you have $375 million left. \nSomebody might be able to get along on that. You might spend $50 \nmillion or even $75 million to promote a candidacy, both to articulate \na positive view and then, perhaps even more effectively, to articulate \na negative view.\n  This is a subject I have been concerned about for a long time because \nI filed for the U.S. Senate back in 1975 announcing my candidacy for \nthe U.S. Senate on November 17, 1975, in the first election cycle where \nthe 1974 election law was in effect. At that time the spending \nlimitation applied to what an individual could spend, and, for a State \nthe size of Pennsylvania, it was $35,000. I decided to run for the \noffice of U.S. Senate against a very distinguished American who later \nbecame a U.S. Senator, John Heinz. After my election in 1980, he and I \nformed a very close working partnership and very close friendship. I \nhave only the best things to say about Senator Heinz.\n  But, in the middle of that campaign, on January 29, 1976, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States decided Buckley v. Valeo and said a \ncandidate can spend any amount of money. My later colleague was in a \nposition to do so and did just that. That made an indelible impression \nupon me, so much so that when the decision came down on January 29, I \npetitioned for leave to intervene as amicus and filed a set of legal \nappeals, all of which were denied.\n  But it seemed to me since that time, as I have watched enormous \nexpenditures in campaign financing by individuals, that simply was \nunsound constitutional law and certainly unsound public policy. There \nis nothing in the Constitution, in my legal judgement, which guarantees \nfreedom of speech on any reasonable, realistic, logical constitutional \ninterpretation which says you ought to be able to spend as much money \nthat you have to win an elective office. I think it is high time for \nthe Congress of the United States and the 50 States to reexamine that \nin a constitutional amendment, which is currently pending.\n  Senator Hollings has proposed the amendment for many Congresses, and \nI have joined with him and sometimes I have proposed individual \nconstitutional amendments. But as we approach the 20th anniversary of \nBuckley v. Valeo, we ought to take a very serious look at it. And we \nmay have a striking impetus for change in that law by the Presidential \ncampaign which is currently underway. So, in advance of the 29th, I \nurge my colleagues to take a very close look at this issue which I \nthink has very serious implications for the electoral process in \nAmerica.\n  I thank the Chair. It is now 3:40. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. SPECTER. And I do suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\n\n                         STATUTORY DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it would be just 16 years since I came \nto the Senate floor to speak to a large new idea in our politics which \nseemed to me was then taking shape and which, as I do believe, has \nsince become a central fact of American government. This was the idea \non the part of those who legitimately, from their perspective, felt \nthat the U.S. Government had become too large, too interfering, too \ndominant in the affairs of the State and local governments, and in \ngeneral moving in a direction that this group did not desire.\n  They spoke to the futility of seeking to dismantle the great edifice \nof Government that had been growing, not truly since the New Deal, but \nsince the beginning of the century with the administrations of Theodore \nRoosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and thereafter, of course, President \nFranklin Roosevelt, President Johnson, President Nixon --a growth in \nGovernment that had never been fully accepted by all parts of the \nelectorate, nor need it have been, and now was attaining very \nconsiderable opposition.\n  The effort to reverse this direction by repealing this statute and \namending that and reducing this program and such was not so much \ncountervailing as beyond the capacities of the legislature. Indeed, the \nGovernment had attained to a size and complexity that dismantling even \na small part of it was a huge enterprise. So the reasoning of this new \nschool was that this would never succeed.\n  What would indeed succeed, it was argued, was to deprive the National \nGovernment of revenue. By systematically reducing revenues through tax \ncuts, there would come a time when there was simply not the available \nresources to maintain the level of outlay that was then taking place.\n  This had many informed and sophisticated iterations, if you like, but \nthe whole idea was put in one compact phrase that appeared in the first \nyear of the administration of President Reagan. And it was in usage in \nthe White House, as we understood. It was ``starve the beast.''\n  At that time, 1980, the debt of the Federal Government was about $900 \nbillion, a sizable enough sum but in no way an unmanageable one. Debt \nhad risen during the two world wars and had been brought back down. \nSome debt occurred in the 1930's, nothing spectacular; revenues were \nwell within the range of obligations, and the Government was moving \nforward.\n  Two things then happened. Government outlays began to grow very \nrapidly as several entitlement programs took hold. Medicare is but the \nmost important example. A good indicator, also, however, is Medicaid. \nMedicaid, which is a Federal entitlement to persons with very limited \nresources. Those Medicaid costs doubled in the 8 years of the \nadministration of President Reagan, doubled again in the 4 years of the \nadministration of President Bush. If you project this trend, as we have \ndone, and put them in the form of a geometric progression, you find \nthat the costs of Medicaid would double on the 29th of December of this \nyear. So those outlays began to go up rapidly.\n  Then in 1981, there was a large tax reduction, and revenues ceased to \ngrow. The income tax brackets were indexed so that there was not an \ninflationary increase in revenues that had previously been the case \nduring the 1970's.\n  Mr. President, we passed five tax cuts, and indeed the level of \ninflation in 1980 was such that the Office of Management and Budget \nanticipated a surplus even with the tax reductions.\n  The 1982 recession brought that inflation down. The tax cut took \nhold. And so we were on a path simultaneously of increased outlays and \nreduced revenues, very much that which those who advocated this \nparticular approach had anticipated.\n  What they had not anticipated was that President Reagan, who very \nmuch wanted a tax reduction, did not want programs reduced in any large \namount and certainly in no very few particulars. Mr. David Stockman, \nPresident Reagan's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \nhis memoirs, ``The Triumph of Politics,'' records the options he would \npresent the President. There was a program, it costs this much, it \nshould be abolished, it should be left alone, it should be reduced a \nlittle, and the President, in the kind of generous nature we know he \nhas--happily--cut it a little, perhaps, but nothing large was done. \nInstead, debt in enormous amount was incurred.\n  We went from a debt of about $900 billion to a debt of almost $5 \ntrillion in a very short time, and debt service began to crowd out \nother activities of the Federal Government. While there had been very \nlittle articulation of this theory--``starve the beast''--the practice \nhas gone forward with extraordinary, almost inexorable, relentless \nthoroughness. We are now in this 16th or 17th year since I first spoke \non the matter, and the situation approaches crisis.\n  The crisis that we come to is the working out of the theory, if you \nmight, the debt having attained to its present level, the decision is \nbeing talked about of not extending the debt any further, with the \nconsequence not that we would reduce the size of the American \nGovernment--a legitimate strategic objective I did not necessarily \nshare; I do not disavow it in every respect nor does anybody in this \nChamber. The idea today would be not to extend the debt ceiling and let \nthe U.S. Government default on its obligations for the first time in \nour history.\n  I was remarking, Mr. President, to the Democratic caucus at noon \ntoday that in 1814, the British invaded Washington, burnt the White \nHouse, burnt this Capitol Building, the part just the other side of the \ndoor here, the original building. They did not burn the Marine \nCommandant's house, because they were staying there, but they overtook \nthe Capitol completely. The President fled, the Congress fled, and the \nNation seemed in the most dire possible circumstances: Our Capitol had \nbeen seized. Yet the service on the national debt continued to be paid. \nI think it probably was the case it was most paid overseas and in \nspecie out of various subtreasuries.\n  In that degree of crisis in a newly formed nation, not fully even \nformed perhaps, we never defaulted. We never defaulted during the Civil \nWar. The question did not arise in the great wars in the 20th century. \nBut here, in a moment of peace, we may be about to do this. The \nconsequences would be immeasurable. From the very height of its \nposition in the world and in the history of the world, the United \nStates would become a nation in default, a nation whose currency is in \nquestion, whose debt has, in effect, been repudiated.\n  We may not think of it this way. We may not imagine others thinking \nof it this way. It could happen, Mr. President, and if we do not do \nsomething in the next days, it very possibly will happen. The \nunimaginable, the unthinkable will happen.\n  We have reached the debt ceiling of $4.9 trillion. Either we raise \nthe debt ceiling or we undermine the foundations of American democracy \nand the American economy and who knows what in the world at large.\n  I might recede and say, Mr. President, during the last Congress, I \nthen had the honor to be chairman of the Committee on Finance. We \nraised the debt ceiling twice, not out of any unconcern for the \ndeficit, but out of the realistic appreciation of what we could do.\n  In August 1993, we passed in this body a deficit reduction package of \n$500 billion. It was signed. It brought about the largest reduction in \nthe deficit in history. Interest rates declined--a fiscal dividend--or \nas described by Secretary Rubin described, a reduction in the deficit \npremium on interest rates.\n  We did that, and we reduced the deficit. At the same time, we had to \nincrease the debt ceiling. Twice we did that, leaving it at $4.9 \ntrillion. This last November 9, I came to the floor and offered an \namendment to increase the debt ceiling just a very small amount to \n$4,967,000,000,000, enough to get us through, as I hoped, until there \nwas a Budget Reconciliation Act agreed to. And knowing what we would \nhave to have in the way of additional debt expenditure in the course of \nthe next 2 years, we could then pass a proper 2-year debt ceiling \nincreased to perhaps $5,500,000,000,000.\n  That measure--offered, as I say, on November 9--failed by a vote of \n47 to 49, a very close margin. Two votes would have put us over into \nthe present moment, but not to a true resolution of a 2-year prospect.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of that, the debt ceiling was soon \nreached, and \n\n[[Page S300]]\nthe Secretary of the Treasury was reduced to borrowing moneys in ways \nthat were entirely lawful but not really anticipated as a more than \ntemporary steps to avoid a debt crisis. He had to deal with the fact \nthat the Federal Government was without a budget. I say, it is no \naccident that this was the 11th time since 1981 that the Federal \nGovernment has been without a budget and without resources.\n  Within 1 year of my having observed this strategy here on the Senate \nfloor, it was in effect. They were short-term events. They were \nreferred to as monument closings: The Government would close down for a \nday and some national facilities would not be available but with no \nreal interruption of the Government itself.\n  This time, we have had the longest shut down ever. It is not perhaps \nnoticed, but we almost shut down the Federal courts, the third branch \nof Government, indispensable to governing but of itself the least \ndangerous branch, as one of the ``Federalist Papers'' referred to it.\n  It depends entirely on the Congress and the Executive to provide \nthese choices. It had none. It was at the point where it would not have \nhad money to pay criminal and civil jurors or security guards. The \nprospect of the Federal courts closing was upon us, and we did finally \nact, but only almost reluctantly, not as if performing a duty, but \ndealing with an irritating necessity.\n  Now, here we are again. Yesterday, the Secretary of the Treasury told \nus in the most explicit terms that he has reached the end of measures \nthat he can legally take, that he is willing to take, or legally can \ntake, the two being coterminous. He has said that he has three final \nmeasures. He will suspend the reinvestment of approximately $3.9 \nbillion in Treasury securities held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund. \nThat is the total amount of dollars in that fund. If we were to use the \nGerman mark and Japanese yen also, the dollar would be subject to the \nmost extraordinary turbulence in world markets. The Secretary also said \nthat the Federal Financing Bank will exchange $9 billion in assets in \nits portfolio, primarily, I believe, from the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, with which the distinguished Presiding Officer is very \nfamiliar, and several other Government activities, which he can do. The \nexchange of assets will permit the Treasury to obtain $9 billion in \ncash.\n  Finally, he has the ability to extend the 12-month debt issuance \nsuspension period. That, I have to say, is what we are in, a debt \nissuance suspension period, from 12 months to 14 months. This will \npermit the Treasury to obtain an additional $6.4 billion in cash by \ntemporarily using interest-bearing assets of the civil service \nretirement fund. And that is it. Nothing more.\n  These actions would raise $19.3 billion. They will take the U.S. \nGovernment through until February 29 or March 1. At that point, sir, \nthe U.S. Government will default on its obligations--something that \ncould not have been imagined in the world 20 years ago. We are facing \nit, but we are not facing up to it. I had hoped that I might offer a \nmeasure to increase the debt ceiling, a clean simple increase, on \ntomorrow, or on Thursday, but I understand we may not be in session. On \nFriday, I will try to do this, but it is not clear whether it will be \npossible with the continuing resolution that keeps the Government open \nfor certain purposes and the rest of the fiscal year. Then I am told we \nwill not be back until February 26. That is 3 days before default.\n  I would hope something would concentrate our minds. This measure \nwould simply allow the Federal Government to meet its obligations while \nthe negotiations about the budget continue between the Congress and the \nadministration. There is room for agreement in those negotiations. The \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania was on the floor just \nnow talking about the areas where no principle is involved. It is just \na question of at what rate Medicare outlays grow. They are growing at \nsay 9 percent, and another party says 8 percent, and another party says \n7 percent. They are only discussions of increments where if there is a \nwill, there is surely a way to agreement.\n  Maybe there is no will to reach final agreement on some issues that \nare thought to be of principle. Very well, let us have a national \nelection. We are going to do that. The Republican Party caucuses \nbegin--I guess, caucuses for both parties will begin in Iowa and then \nprimaries in New Hampshire, and off we go. It is an extended period. \nThere are days when you can wish this were Canada and if we had to have \na national election we could do it in 2 weeks' time, and people would \nknow what the issues are and vote and settle them for the parties \ninvolved, and the Parliament would resume.\n  We have a Constitution and we will abide by it. It provides for \nquadrennial elections and we will have them. It is all very well if we \ndo not create a catastrophic crisis or undergo a catastrophic failure \nin the interval. We have to increase the debt ceiling. Secretary Rubin, \nan honorable man, the able Secretary of the Treasury, has done what he \ncan do under law. He is acting as his predecessors did in the Reagan \nadministration and in the Bush administration. But he can do no more \nthan the law allows. He will do no more than the law allows. And the \nworld watches.\n  I would say, if I could direct my views principally to the Congress, \nreach some agreement with the President and agree on what you can agree \nto, let the rest be decided in the Presidential election, and let the \nGovernment go forward.\n  I would also speak to the President in this matter. The President has \na responsibility that goes far beyond electoral politics. He is \nrequired under the Constitution--and I sometimes think this is the only \nthing in article II that he is required to do. It says, ``He shall take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed.''\n  Certainly, those laws extend to preserving the full faith and credit \nof the United States. If, in some measure, agreement with the Congress \nwould permit the debt ceiling to be extended and the solvency of the \nU.S. Government, the value of U.S. currency, the worth of the American \ncredit and faith in our word, if in some measure this requires giving \nmore in the way of negotiations than otherwise might be the case, I \nwould say, sir, he has that responsibility, just as the Congress has an \nequivalent responsibility. This is something that transcends the issue \nof which party will have a majority in the next Congress or what kind \nof majority, which party will have the White House and under what \ncircumstances.\n  These are temporary measures. They come and they go. This comes with \nregularity. What happens in November--2 years from that there will be \nanother set of congressional elections, and 4 years another \nPresidential election.\n  There will never be a moment after a default on the debt like the two \ncenturies preceding. This will scar our national existence. We will be \nremembered in history for this--not for what we did to the Medicare \ntrust funds, not for what we did to the Tax Code or this entitlement or \nthat discretionary program. This is what will mark our time--mark our \ntime in history.\n  We will not be forgiven nor would we deserve to be if, in a feckless, \nshortsighted, irritated, calculating, what-do-the-overnight-polls-say \nmode, we bring about an irreversible disaster to the American Nation.\n  That is the option before us. We do not need to. We clearly are of \nthe view that we should not. On November 9, a mere two votes separated \nthe decision to extend the debt ceiling. We know that. We know we have \nto do it. To fail to do it, we fail in our first obligations as Members \nof the Congress. The President, too, must understand he has an \nobligation to help see that this does not come about.\n  We can do it, Mr. President. It will require 20 minutes in either \nbody. If it takes all day, we take all day. There is no argument \nagainst this measure. If there is one Member of the Senate who wishes \nto stand up and say I think it would be a good thing if the U.S. \nGovernment defaulted on its debt, such that every Treasury bond in \nevery investment portfolio, every retirement trust becomes, suddenly, a \npiece of paper not backed by the full faith and credit of the United \nStates, if we want that, if we want the yen to become the world reserve \ncurrency, if we want our inflation to double, if we want our \nunemployment to suddenly soar, or see our national growth collapse, it \nis all within our power, and it will not simply be a negative act, it \nwill have been \n\n[[Page S301]]\nan affirmative choice because we know what the consequences will be.\n  I cannot think we will do this. If there is any Member of the Senate \nwho thinks we ought, he or she is welcome to come to the floor. There \nwill be none. We know what to do, I hope in a bipartisan spirit as we \nhave done in the past. This is something that the Nation needs, and no \nparty would wish to deny. I hope we do this, Mr. President. I dare not \nthink of the consequences if we do not.\n  I see my friend, the distinguished member of the Finance Committee on \nthe floor. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S298-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S301-S302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes as a \nmember of the Senate Agriculture Committee, not as a colleague of my \ncolleague from New York as a member of the Finance Committee, and I \nwant to discuss the 1995 farm bill, which obviously is not going to be \na 1995 bill. It will be a 1996 farm bill if and when we ever get one \npassed.\n  It is January 23, 1996, but the farm bill that should have been in \nplace by early fall, 1995, is still unresolved. So all across the \ncountry farmers are buying their seed, meeting with their bankers, \nmaking plans to cultivate and grow crop, all without knowing what the \nnext farm program will be.\n  When I say it should have been done by early fall, I want to make \nclear to my colleagues that the reason for this is that when you do \nfall tillage, preparing the fields for the seed of the next spring, you \nneed to make those decisions at harvest time of the crop that grew in \n1995.\n  In a very real sense of the word for people who are planting crops in \nthe Southern States of our great country, those are important \nagriculture regions, as well, they are only 2 or 3 weeks away from \nplanting. In my State, it is going to be 2 months until we reach that \npoint.\n  Everybody ought to understand that it is not the day you go to the \nfield that you decide on certain things related to the 1996 crop. You \nneed to know that months ahead of time. One of those factors--maybe \nfarmers would rather not have this be a factor--but one of those \nfactors is, what is the Government program toward agriculture? Probably \nin each of the last, except for 1 or 2 years out of the last 20 years, \nthere has not been any slowness on the part of the Congress in this \nregard. Farmers have known well in advance what the Government's \nposition was on agriculture and their decisions could wisely and timely \nbe made in preparation for the next year's crop.\n  Now here we are, January 23, 1996, and we still do not let the \nfarmers of America know what the Government's program is toward \nagriculture.\n  In the last few weeks, Mr. President, there has been a lot of finger \npointing as to who was responsible for this situation. Some Members of \nthe other side of the aisle would have you believe that Congress failed \nin its responsibilities to act on the farm bill last year. They would \nhave you believe that Congress held no hearings, had no floor debate, \nand passed no farm bill.\n  Mr. President, not only do I come to the floor to urge quick \nresolution of the lack of a farm bill, but I think that we should also \nset the record straight. Basically it means taking the politics out of \nthis debate. It is time to leave the ideology to the side. It is time \nto get down to the very important practical aspect that in the upper \nMidwest where my State of Iowa is, within 2 months of farmers going to \nthe field, and right now in the Southern States of the United States \nthey are probably 2 weeks from that point. It is time to put our \nconstituents and our farmers above political posturing in Washington \nand enact a farm bill into law.\n  Contrary to the rhetoric coming from our Democratic colleagues in \nthis body, in this Chamber, and also through the media, particularly my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle, this Congress did act on \nthe commodity provisions of the farm bill. Last year the Senate \nAgriculture Committee held at least 15 hearings, heard testimony from \nover 150 witnesses. Then in October the Senate debated and passed the \ncommodity provisions of the farm bill as part of the Balanced Budget \nAct.\n  While I am talking about the Balanced Budget Act, and farmers are \nasking about the farm provisions that were in it, I also take advantage \nof the opportunity to say to the farmers of the United States, there \nare probably more important provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1995 than the commodity provisions that they ought to be aware of that \nare going to benefit agriculture to a greater extent than even the \ncommodity provisions.\n  That would be, first of all, balancing the budget, reducing interest \nrates 1.5 to 2 percentage points a year. Multiply that times a $160 \nbillion debt in agriculture and that adds up to real money in the \npockets of farmers of America, just from balancing the budget.\n  Two other provisions very helpful to getting young people into \nagriculture, passing land and operations on from one generation to \nanother generation of farmers, are the capital gains tax reduction and \nincreasing the exemption, the estate tax exemption, and also having a \nspecial exemption, which was in this bill, when small businesses and \nfarms are passed on to people within the family, an exemption of $1 \nmillion. This is what it is going to take, in rural America, to get \nyoung people into agriculture.\n  But I want to repeat that even though there were all these other good \nthings for agriculture in the Balanced Budget Act, we did have the \ncommodity provisions of the 1995 farm bill in that act. The Senate did \ndebate and did pass a farm bill in 1995. Not only was there debate on \nthe floor of the Senate at that time, but there were at least five \namendments relating to the farm bill that were offered, debated, and \nvoted on by the Senate.\n  These amendments included a very comprehensive farm bill alternative, \na proposal put forward by our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. That specific alternative was rejected by the Senate by a \nbipartisan vote of 68 to 31.\n  So, what happened to the farm bill that we passed last year? As you \nknow, it passed both Houses of Congress and was sent to the President \nfor his signature. Unfortunately, the farm bill, as well as all these \nother good provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, was vetoed by \nthe President. That is the reason why, on January 24, 1996, we are \nstill discussing a 1995 farm bill.\n  Let us start this year with a clean slate by setting the record \nstraight. The Republican Congress debated, voted on and passed a farm \nbill in 1995. Now maybe we can get beyond the politics of this issue \nand do what is best for our farmers. The farmers of this country \ndeserve to know what the farm program will be this year and they need \nto know as soon as possible. The time for delay is over. The farmers \nalso need to know what both sides want in a new farm bill.\n  The farm bill passed by the Republican majority in 1995 represents \nthe most significant reform in farm legislation in the last 60 years. \nUnder this provision, farmers will no longer have their planting \ndecisions dictated by the politicians and the bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC. The reality of the budget crisis in Washington dictates \nthat farmers must--and it is what farmers want to do--earn more of \ntheir income from the marketplace as opposed to the Federal Treasury.\n  If that is the case--and that is the environment we are in, the \nbudget realities as well as the realities of the foreign trade \nenvironment, the freeing up of foreign trade--if this is the case, \nthen, the farmers are going to get less support from the Federal \nTreasury. The shackles of Government regulation and the red tape that \nis inherent therein must be removed so that U.S. farmers have a fair \nchance to compete with our foreign competitors.\n  The farm provisions contained in the Balanced Budget Act do this. \nThey remove the planting restrictions imposed on the farmers. They \nremove the Federal Government's authority to require that productive \nfarmland be removed from production. In short, they send a very clear \nsignal to the rest of the world that the U.S. farmer will compete for \nevery sale in every marketplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was not aware of a time restriction. \nCould I ask for 5 additional minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n  \n[[Page S302]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now, what has the other side had to offer as an \nalternative to the Republican plan? Most often, although not totally, \nwe hear about a 1-year extension of the current program. To me, this \nidea has several problems. An extension of the current program ignores \nthe reforms that have been made and that farmers have now come to \nexpect. The farmers in my State want, they expect, and they deserve the \nregulatory relief provided by the Republican farm bill provisions. \nFurthermore, an extension would literally deprive rural America of \nbillions of dollars. First, a 1-year extension would require farmers to \npay back money they have already received as advance deficiency \npayments. Many of the farmers in Iowa had very poor crops this year due \nto heavy rain during the planting season. Particularly that is true of \nsouthern Iowa, northern Missouri, and western central Illinois. Yet by \na 1-year extension, people are suggesting that they would force these \nfarmers to write checks to the Treasury to pay back their advance \ndeficiency payment. It is estimated that these provisions would cost \nfarmers more than $2.1 billion nationwide and, in my State of Iowa, \n$217 million.\n  Second, any delay in passing a new farm bill could have a devastating \neffect on future farm programs. This is due to the Congressional Budget \nOffice's baseline revision that continually shows that Congress will \nhave less money to spend on farm programs in the future. When CBO \nrevised its baseline in November, agriculture lost $7.8 billion from \nthat baseline. This is $7.8 billion that we could have spent under the \nbaseline if the President would have signed the farm bill enacted in \nOctober but now is lost, due to delay.\n  If we pass a 1-year extension, the House Agriculture Committee \nestimates that agriculture could lose an additional $6 billion--an \nadditional $6 billion. So, it is time to be very candid with our \nconstituents. An extension will take billions of dollars out of that \nbaseline, or, another way of saying it, out of the pockets of the \nfamily farmers, and, at the same time, out of rural America. To this \nSenator, these numbers make a mere extension of the current program an \nunacceptable alternative. And, when the truth is known to the farmers \nand to our constituents, I think they will find it equally \nunacceptable.\n  I think it is interesting that the same Senators who have accused the \nRepublican Congress of gutting rural America are willing to deprive \nthese areas of billions of dollars by putting off the passing of a farm \nbill for another year, through a 1-year extension.\n  Mr. President, the conclusion is very clear to this Senator. The \nSenate should pass the farm bill provisions contained in the Balanced \nBudget Act once again. We should do this as soon as possible, \npreferably this week on the continuing resolution. The farmers, the \nbankers, and the rest of rural America need the certainty as to what \nthe next farm program will be.\n  It is high time that we put ideology aside and enact a new farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be stated by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 210) to commend the Cornhuskers of \n     the University of Nebraska at Lincoln for winning both the \n     1994 and 1995 National Collegiate Athletic Association \n     Football championships back-to-back.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate one of the top \ncollege football programs in history--the Nebraska Cornhuskers. The \nHuskers have once again clinched a national championship earning back-\nto-back titles in 1994 and 1995. Nebraska won two consecutive \nchampionships also in 1970 and 1971. This year's repeat was made \nspecial by the fact that this is only the second time ever in college \nfootball history that a team was a consensus, undisputed champ in the \nmajor polls 2 years in a row. The last time this occurred was in the \n1950's.\n  The Huskers decisively defeated the Florida Gators 62-24 in the \nFiesta Bowl on January 2. This victory not only brought with it the \nnational championship, but a perfect 25-0 record for the past two \nseasons, a 36th victory for the Huskers in the last three seasons and \nthe worst defeat of a number 1 versus number 2 in a championship game. \nAs for the 36 victories, the Huskers are the only team to win that many \ngames in 3 years time. Nebraska was 36-1 overall and the 1 loss came \ndown to a last-second field goal attempt. That field goal was the \ndifference between a repeat and a threepeat of the national title. The \nHuskers defeated the Miami Hurricanes in Miami 24-17 last year for the \nchampionship.\n  The Huskers this year managed to play nearly everyone on the roster \nin many of the games and crush opponents by averaging 52.4 offensive \npoints per game. Also when matched against Top 10 opponents this \nseason--Florida, Colorado, Kansas, Kansas State--the Huskers smacked \neach by an average of 49-18.\n  The Nebraska program has risen above all others on the field. The \nHuskers have the record for the most straight bowl game appearances at \n27. Between 1970 and now, they have finished 19 times in the Top 10 and \n4 of those were at number 1. Additionally, in this the final year of \nthe Big Eight, the Huskers have dominated with the most Big Eight \nconference championships at 20. The Huskers were victorious in the Big \nEight consecutively for the last 5 years. The Huskers likewise hold the \nrecord for overall conference championships--Big Six, Big Seven, Big \nEight--at 41.\n  As it is clear that the Huskers have been winners on the field, they \nhave been winners off the field as well. Coach Osborne, the coach with \nthe highest winning percentage in college football, wrote ``More Than \nWinning,'' a book which describes his philosophy. There is certainly \nmore than winning and Coach Osborne, who holds a doctorate in \neducational psychology, tries to teach each of his players how to be \nwinners in the bigger game of life. For example, the University of \nNebraska has had the most Academic-All-Americans on its teams at 132 \nplayers. The next closest college has 82. The football program itself \nis number 1 with a total of first team Academic-All-Americans at 49. \nThe next closest college has 35.\n  I am very pleased with the Huskers for the success that they have had \nover the years and another repeat of the national championship. While \nthe 1971 match-up between Nebraska and Oklahoma has often been called \nthe game of the century, the run the Huskers have made in the last \nthree seasons, 1993, 1994, and 1995, deserves the caption--``the Team \nof the Century.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is only the second time in the history of \nthe volleyball championship tournament that a team east of California \nhas won the title.\n  The Huskers had a spectacular season led by their great coach Terry \nPettit. Coach Pettit has been with the Huskers for 18 years and has \nbecome a key part of their success. The season was also boosted by the \nhelp of Allison Weston who was named cowinner of the national Player of \nthe Year Award. And finally, the team was raised to a level above all \nothers on the court by a team of national championship-winning players.\n  The Huskers have played for the title previously in the 1980's, so \nbeing in the limelight of college volleyball is nothing new for them. \nWhat it is, however, is a feat only few have attained outside of the \nPacific rim. The only other team was the Texas Longhorns.\n  The Huskers were incredible in a 3-1 title match versus the Texas \nLonghorns.\n  The volleyball program should be acclaimed for another great record \nas well and that is the success in the classroom. The University of \nNebraska has 132 Academic-All-Americans, the most of any college \nsports, and 16 of them are on the volleyball team. Playing like \nchampions and being champions in the classroom are two incredible \naccomplishments.\n  I am quite pleased and very impressed by the success of the Nebraska \nHuskers and look forward to continued excellence by our great \nvolleyball program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few moments I will propound a \nunanimous consent request that I know the minority will want to be on \nthe floor to respond to.\n  While they are coming, let me speak for a few moments to the dilemma \nwe find ourselves in here in the Congress, having passed a Budget \nReconciliation Act, and in that budget reconciliation having a \nsubstantial portion of new farm policy that is known as the \nAgricultural Reconciliation Act of 1995. Of course that went to the \nPresident and, as we know, was vetoed.\n  The problem has been spoken to by the Senator from Nebraska, the \nSenator from North Dakota, the Senator from Iowa already this \nafternoon, with clearly differing points of view as to how that was \nhandled. But what is clear, in my State of Idaho, is that farmers and \ntheir bankers are now sitting down to determine which acres will go \ninto potatoes or sugar beets or barley or wheat or alfalfa crops this \ncoming season. That means that Idaho farmers are putting together their \nfarm plans and determining their financial structure for the coming \nyear. They prefer to do that in the presence of U.S. farm policy.\n  Of course, we know that on September 30 of this past year, the farm \nbill has expired. As a result of that, the Secretary of Agriculture is \nnow at least looking at the possibility of our farm policy reverting to \nthe Agriculture Act of 1949. All of us know that simply cannot be \nallowed to happen. The stalemate that has resulted from the budget \nconsiderations that we are now in simply has not produced farm policy \nas should be expected by American agriculture.\n  I serve on the Senate Agricultural Committee. Chairman Dick Lugar and \nI and all Members of that committee now for over 10 months have been \nengaged in looking at and crafting farm policy on a title-by-title \nbasis. But because of the necessary savings that we needed to acquire \nin fiscal 1996 as a result of the balanced budget process that this \nCongress is now in, the Budget Reconciliation Act handled a substantial \nportion of new farm policy. Whether you call it ``Freedom to Farm'' or \nwhether you call it the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1995, all of \nus know that there were clear and substantial changes made. We had held \nextensive hearings with American agriculture and all segments of the \ncommodity interest of agriculture to craft that farm policy. We had \ngone to conference with the House, the Senate and the House differing \nsubstantially on approaches toward this, but all of us coming together \nto agree on a policy, finally, that made its way into the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995. Since that time, American agriculture has had an \nopportunity to review it, and I must say that the reviews have been \nfavorable.\n\n  Early on, farmers scratched their heads and said, ``How will this \nwork,'' only to recognize the kind of new flexibility that we offer in \nfarm policy which says to American agriculture, no longer will you have \nto farm to the program. You can now start farming to the marketplace, \nand you can begin to adjust your cropping patterns to move toward the \nmarket.\n  Farmers cannot wait now for this President. Farmers need to know what \nwe are going to do. It is clearly time that we speak to that issue.\n  This past summer and fall, as I have mentioned, the Congress, the \nSenate and the House alike, have attempted to craft new farm policy \nresulting in an approach that brings us to a balanced budget. Somehow \nthere appears to be a message on this floor this afternoon that \nAmerican agriculture is not interested in a balanced budget. \n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is not what we heard this year. We heard from \nevery commodity group that they were willing to do their fair share in \nmoving us toward that balanced budget, and in so recognizing, they \nwould get greater flexibility in the marketplace to move their cropping \nprograms toward the market with the kind of flexibility and planning, \ninstead of being stuck, if you will, or found in lockstep to farm \npolicy, afraid to lose and therefore afraid of stepping outside that.\n  We have provided a safety net, and that marketing loan will provide \nthat. The loan will allow farmers a reasonable time period to market \ntheir crops. These loans will be stabilized in the market cycle and \ncontinue to protect consumers as well as the producer. It will avoid \nthe kind of unnecessary market gyrations.\n  In crafting these sound programs, the Senate and the House committees \nworked hard and worked long, together, to solve this issue and to bring \nus to balance in a very diverse segment of America's economy. And that \nis American agriculture.\n  In my State of Idaho, in Florida, in Louisiana, in Colorado, in \nMontana, and in the Dakotas, sugar, sugar beet and cane raising remains \na very important commodity crop. Inside the legislation that was vetoed \nby the President was, again, a new compromise, a new program, a \nreduction in the program. Listening to the consumer's side, we made the \nkind of changes that bring us to the marketplace in a variety of these \nareas, that allow the producer to say, ``I am farming now to the market \nand not to the farm.''\n  Planning flexibility, as I have already mentioned, could clearly be \njeopardized. Traditional nonprogram crops like fruits and vegetables, \nin my State of Idaho, potatoes, could be thrown in jeopardy if we do \nnot deal with this program and deal with it now.\n  When we saw in the Freedom to Farm Act limited flexibility, it was \nthe Senate that spoke up and said we want flexibility so farmers can \nmove to the marketplace in lieu of what we want to solve with a \nbalanced budget. At the same time, we want to make sure that we protect \na variety of these program crops.\n  Here we are, not at the 11th hour, not at the 12th hour, but well \nbeyond that, into 1996, with a farm bill that expired on September 30, \n1995, with a policy that was cautiously and carefully crafted between \nboth the House and the Senate, put in the Budget Reconciliation Act, \nsent to the President, and the President vetoed it. Now, the Secretary \nof Agriculture--and I appreciate the Secretary's problem--is terribly \nfrustrated by a need to conduct farm policy at the same time no law is \nin place as a result of that Presidential veto.\n  So I come to the floor tonight in behalf of our Speaker, Leader Dole, \nmyself, Chairman Lugar, Chairman Cochran, Senator Grassley, and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S303-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2491\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that Title I, \nthe Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1995, of H.R. 2491, the 7-year \nBalanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995, as vetoed by the President, \nbe introduced as a freestanding bill; that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that the bill be advanced to the third reading \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, and I will \nobject.\n  I would like to comment on the offering by the Senator from Idaho \nunder the reservation, which, as I indicated, will result in an \nobjection to this request.\n  The Senator from Idaho proposes that we strip from the budget \nreconciliation bill the cobbled version of the Freedom to Farm Act and \nbring it to the floor as a separate bill and deem it passed with this \naction. That is, in my judgment, not a good way to legislate farm \npolicy. It follows last year's circumstances, rather than doing what \nhas traditionally been done with 5-year farm bills. Instead of the \ndevelopment of a bipartisan approach in the Agriculture Committees of \nthe House and Senate, and a markup in which there was bipartisan \nparticipation, there was a partisan writing of a farm proposal. It was \nbrought to the committee with this statement, ``Here is the proposal. \nWe can have a few votes if you want, but we are all going to vote the \nsame way. This is what we are reporting out.'' That is what was done \nlast year. This tends, in my judgment, to follow in the same steps.\n  I am not ascribing any improper motives. The Senator has every right \nto do this, and I understand the purpose of it. But I am constrained to \nobject, and I intend to offer a unanimous consent request on my time.\n  Mr. President, at this point I object to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the Chair puts the consideration, I \nwould like to explain to the Senate that this would allow the Senate to \nonce again pass the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1995, thereby \ngiving the House their opportunity to once again enact the farm bill. \nFarmers of this country, as I have already explained, need this \nlegislation now. The President has vetoed it. It is very clear he has \nvetoed this policy.\n  I certainly do not agree with my colleague that this has been cobbled \nup. We have been 5 months in the making of this legislation, in \ncreating these difference. I think we are moving toward planting in the \nSouthern parts of our country. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, \nfarmers are now sitting down with their bankers to put the farm policy \ntogether, or their farming programs together, for the year. And we \ncertainly need legislation at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S304-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S304-S305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1523\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, and I shall explain the request.\n  I introduced earlier today a bill that is now deemed S. 1523 which \nprovides for a 1-year extension of the current farm program. The bill \nprovides for enormous planting flexibility for farmers who operate \nunder this program to allow them to plant what they want on base acres \nand not having the Government tell them what to plant, when to plant it \nor where to plant it. So there is substantial flexibility. And third, \nit would provide for the forgiveness of the advanced deficiency payment \nfor those farmers that suffered crop losses last year.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of this because I agree with the Senator from Idaho that \nfarmers deserve an answer. They deserve certainty. They deserve to know \nunder what farm program will they be planting in just a matter of weeks \nin some parts of the country as they begin their spring's work.\n  I do not believe this is necessarily the first choice. It is not \nnecessarily the best choice. But the piece of legislation that the \nPresident vetoed was a budget reconciliation bill which included a farm \nbill that I described as a cobbled product. The President vetoed a \nreconciliation bill which took with it a bad farm bill.\n  Now, why did that occur? Because this is the first time in history \nthat rather than debate a 5-year farm bill on its own merits in this \nChamber and the House, the majority party decided to stick the farm \nbill in the reconciliation bill which by last July people knew was \ngoing to be vetoed.\n  Now, that does not talk about the merits of the farm bill itself. The \nmerits of this farm bill would be to say, ``Disconnect the price \nsupport programs from need. If market prices are high, ignore that. \nStill give the farmers the payment. And if after 7 years market prices \nare low, ignore that. There will be no farm program.''\n  I do not think and did not think this was a good approach. I believe \nthe President thinks it is not a good approach for those who care about \nhaving a network of family farms in our country in the long term. That \nis why we did not support this approach.\n  It should never have been put in the reconciliation bill in the first \nplace. It was never done previously. Doing so produced the jeopardy \nthat now exists for farmers in January of 1996 in not knowing what the \nfarm program will be for spring planting. \n\n[[Page S305]]\n\n  Mr. President, for purposes of trying to provide some certainty, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nS. 1523, a bill I introduced earlier today providing for a 1-year \nextension of the current farm programs for increased planting \nflexibility and providing for the forgiveness of the advanced \ndeficiency payment for those who suffered crop loss; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will object. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think the Senator and I speak to the same \nconcern, but there is one thing that has gone on this year that it is \nimportant the record reflect--the very extensive hearings, well over 6 \nmonths of hearings now on every title of the farm bill. But because we \nwere in a uniquely different situation, and that is we had to deal with \nthe cost and the cost impacts of farm policy, we brought those \nprovisions of what would be a new farm bill to the floor in the budget \nreconciliation to gain those kinds of savings, to gain the $15 billion \nin savings that was necessary.\n  What the Senator proposes in this extension under the current law \nwould also wreak some peril. There is no question about it. Farmers are \nbeing required to repay nearly $2 billion in 1995 advanced deficiency \npayments, and I think only in the freedom to farm package do we resolve \nthat issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My unanimous consent request specifically includes, as my \nbill does, the forgiveness of the advanced deficiency payment.\n  Yes, it does. On page 3.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Obviously, the Senator does not have page 3 for me. He has \na message that is less than legible, and I would like to see the full \nimpact of this.\n  I must advise the Senator and my friend here that this is not a way \nto pass substantive legislation. We are dealing with an entire farm \npackage here and it is critically necessary.\n  I do object. And I do object by the nature of the way this has been \npresented.\n  What I am offering and what has been objected to, Mr. President, is a \nfull and complete package that has already been debated on the floor, \nwell disseminated and understood by American agriculture, and I think \nlargely accepted in their recognition of needing to participate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S304-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S305-S306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. In light of the objections, and that which has just \ntranspired, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a bill I now send to the desk which would \nsuspend further implementation of the Permanent Agricultural Law of \n1949, that the bill be read for a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  I now send that legislation to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator \nDole, Senator Lugar, and Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object. The procedure the Senator \nfrom Idaho has just used was one he described about 2 minutes ago as a \nprocedure that is unworthy on the floor of the Senate. That is bringing \na bill that has had no hearings and which I have not received. So I do \nnot quite understand the consistency here. But, nonetheless, repealing \nthe underlying farm legislation, the Permanent Farm Act of 1949 makes \nno sense under any conditions given the circumstance we are in now.\n  We find ourselves in late January with no farm policy except an \nunderlying permanent law. The reason I assume that some want to get rid \nof the permanent law--and they would get rid of the permanent law in \nthe Freedom to Farm Act--is because they believe in the long term there \nought not be a farm program, there ought not be a safety net for family \nfarmers.\n  That is the reason this provision existed in the Freedom to Farm Act. \nIt is one of the reasons I opposed the Freedom to Farm Act. I think \nthere ought to be a farm program to provide some basic safety net for a \nfamily out there that is struggling with a few acres. Farm families are \ntrying to make a living with twin risks: one, planting a seed that you \ndo not know whether it will grow, and, second, if it grows you do not \nknow whether you will get a price. Those risks are impossible for \nfamily farmers to overcome in circumstances where international grain \nprices dip and stay down.\n  The proposal being offered is a recipe for deciding we do not need \nfamily farms, what we need are agrifactories. So I cannot support that. \nI am here because I care about family farms, care about their future, \nand want them to have a decent opportunity to succeed.\n  I do not impugn the motives of anyone, and especially the Senator \nfrom Idaho. I am sure he wants the same thing for family farmers but \nprobably finds a different way to achieve that. But I cannot support \nanyone who believes we ought not be left with some basic safety net for \nfarm families out there who are struggling against those twin risks. So \nI am constrained to object to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the Chair rules, let me explain why \nI presented this legislation. It is detailed in the sense of the titles \nof the law of 1949 that it would repeal. Obviously, in hearing from the \nSecretary of Agriculture, he, by the action of his own President in \nvetoing the Budget Reconciliation Act that laid farm policy out in it, \nis in a tremendous quandary at this moment. He has to implement a very \ncumbersome and costly law, the provisions of the 1949 Agricultural \nAdjustment Act. It does not fit modern-day agriculture.\n  I am sure the Senator from North Dakota and I are extremely concerned \nabout family farms. We have worked together on that issue on the \nAgriculture Committee of the Senate in an effort to resolve those \nproblems. I do not impugn his intention nor do I believe he impugns \nmine. But clearly we need policy. Policy has been created. Policy has \nbeen passed by this Congress. And policy has been vetoed by this \nPresident, the very kind of policy that would have created the \ncertainty, that would have avoided the kind of frustrations that the \nSenator and I are involved in right now.\n  So by action here tonight I have attempted to say that which has been \nworked on should be freestanding legislation, that we ought to have a \nright to vote up or down on it, and that I hope then that the President \nwould sign it. It certainly offers the kind of budgetary savings that \nhe has offered in the cuts in discretionary spending and at the same \ntime it allows the flexibility to avoid the downsizing of purely a \nbudget-driven farm policy.\n  It allows the flexibility of a market-driven farm policy that \nprotects American agriculture, that certainly protects the family farm, \nbut also recognizes that they too are businesses that have to compete \nlike everybody else in the small business sector of our society. It \ndoes provide a safety net, but it does set together a plan, a 7-year \nplan that allows them to create and move into the market away from \nsimply farming to the program.\n  If there is one thing I heard from Idaho agriculture and that I heard \nfrom Midwestern agriculture, it is ``Give us the flexibility so we \ndon't find ourselves totally constrained to a farm program that may not \nbe all that profitable.''\n  I laughed a bit this afternoon when there were my colleagues coming \nto the floor talking about the freedom to farm as a welfare program. \nWhen we talk about welfare, one of the phrases that has always gotten \nused is that we provide a safety net to the recipient. Yet the record \nshows that the words ``safety net'' were oftentimes used by my \ncolleagues as they decried the idea of a welfare program.\n  Offering stability, offering baseline, and at the same time offering \nmovement into the market is not welfare. And nobody that is a producer \nand a hard worker out there that I know in my State that is a farmer or \nrancher is going to argue they are a recipient of a \n\n[[Page S306]]\nwelfare program, whether it be the Freedom to Farm Act or whether it be \ncurrent policy.\n  Mr. President, we need action. This President needs to act. He needs \nto come to the table to work with us on a balanced budget and in so \ndoing to be able to craft and move or resolve the issue that we are \ncurrently involved in that has brought real stalemate to the \nagricultural communities of our country.\n  That is why I propounded these two very important unanimous consent \nrequests this afternoon, to see if it would not move our President off \ncenter and allow flexibility, both for the Senate and for our \nSecretary, to get on with the business of telling American agriculture \nwhat they can expect in the coming crop year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President. Actually the words ``safety net'' came \nfrom President Ronald Reagan who described a series of programs that \nrepresented the safety net, an important one of which is Social \nSecurity. I do not expect anyone here would make the case that Social \nSecurity is welfare or that Ronald Reagan meant that Social Security \nwas welfare. That is a program workers pay into and at some point get \nsome returns when they reach retirement.\n  So to use the words ``safety net,'' using the term of President \nReagan, was to refer to the opportunity to try to provide some help for \npeople who need some help through a series of programs, some of which \nmight be welfare but many of which were not, including Social Security \nwhich is not a welfare program and the farm program which was never a \nwelfare program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S305-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXTENDING THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would propose one additional unanimous-\nconsent request and am constrained, I guess, not to offer the third. I \nfelt that as long as we were offering unanimous consent requests, the \nmost logical-unanimous consent request is to come here and say, well, \nlet us at least now understand that Friday we have a CR that needs \nextension or we will have a shutdown.\n  The shutdown, it seems to me, is an example of what we have been \nthrough a couple of times, of poking taxpayers in the eye by saying, \n``You pay for a couple hundred thousand people that will be prevented \nfrom coming to work, and we insist you pay for them,'' and then dangle \nFederal workers in front of this debate and say, ``By the way, you're \nthe pawns we're going to use.''\n  If we have not been cured of Government shutdowns and the chaos that \ncomes by using CR's as some kind of a line in the sand here where \neverybody else pays but nobody else suffers, if we have not cured \nourselves of that apparently there is no cure for what ails us.\n  My urge is to offer a CR that says, let us extend the CR that expires \non Friday at a minimum of 2 weeks, but I shall not do that. I will not \ndo that in deference to the leadership. I think if one were to do this \nsort of thing, one would want to notify the leadership.\n  So my urge is to want to do this, and maybe sometime I will, as long \nas someone else comes out wanting to offer unanimous-consent requests. \nBut I will not do that in deference to the leadership today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S306-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S306-S308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will offer one additional unanimous-consent request. It \ndoes deal specifically with something that I know the Senator from \nIdaho cares about because he raised it a few minutes ago. He was \nconcerned I did not include it in my legislation. That is some \nforgiveness of the advanced crops deficiency payments for 1995.\n  My legislation on page 3, which I introduced earlier today, and is at \nthe desk, provides for the forgiveness of certain advanced deficiency \npayments for those crop producers who suffered a loss.\n  The Senator from Idaho raised that. I know he cares about it and I \ncare about it. If we cannot pass the entire bill, let us at least pass \nthat entire provision that both of us care about and both of us think \nshould be passed. The forgiveness of the advanced deficiency payments \nis critically important to a lot of family farm producers out there. We \ndo not need a large debate about that. Let us go ahead and do this.\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of a bill to provide for forgiveness of 1995 advance crop \ndeficiency payments, as I described, and that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have to object this evening. Maybe this \nis the kind of legislation that we could include in the CR this coming \nFriday. I think the Senator from North Dakota and I both know well that \nwe are going to have to deal with a continuing resolution come Friday; \nthat we are not going to shut the Government down anymore; that the \nPresident does not want to shut the Government down anymore.\n  At least out of all of this budget discussion that has gone on for \nthe last good number of weeks, both the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch have come to that conclusion, and I agree that that \nis the proper conclusion.\n  The Senator brings up an important point, that is why I brought it \nup, because it was not in his original unanimous consent, and I had \nhoped that we be thorough in dealing with this issue. I am glad the \nSenator has brought it up. It is a question of great concern. It is a \nrepayment of nearly $2 billion of advance deficiency payments.\n  I hope that we can resolve this issue, but it is not a separate issue \nto be resolved tonight. I think the Senator has brought it to the floor \nwith just intention, and because he has raised the issue to the level \nof visibility that he does tonight, I hope that maybe that is something \nwe will consider as we deal with final resolution toward the end of the \nweek of a continuing resolution, but I do object at this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know it is technical, but I did include \nthat in my first unanimous-consent request. It was something I \nmentioned in connection with three provisions in the UC that I offered. \nBut I observe, this is not a rider that needs a horse. This is a \nprovision that does not need to wait for Friday. It does not need to \nwait for next July. It does not need to wait for something else that is \nmoving. It can be done any time.\n  The reason I offer it is, I would like to see an extension of the \ncurrent farm bill for a year with the provisions I suggested. If that \nis not possible, I would like to see us decide to tell farmers what is \npossible. It ought to be possible for us to deal with the forgiveness \nof advance deficiency payments. It does not, as I said, need something \nelse coming along to jump on. This is not a cargo looking for a train. \nThis is an idea we ought to advance.\n  I encourage us, if we cannot do it tonight, let us do it tomorrow. If \nwe cannot do it tomorrow, let us do it the next day.\n  The one thing I suggest to the Senator from Idaho, when we talk about \ncontinuing appropriations and shutdowns--I am delighted there will not \nbe any more shutdowns, and I pray there will not be, because I do not \nthink it serves anyone's interest. Nobody wins. The way we are able to \navoid that is the way we are able to convince everybody in this Capitol \nBuilding on all sides that they cannot use this as leverage any longer; \nthey cannot threaten someone over a CR--``If you don't have this, we \nwon't enact a CR''--and that is what results in a shutdown.\n  Let me say, I understand the objection. I expected the objection. My \nhope is that perhaps tomorrow--I do not know if anybody will be doing \nunanimous-consent requests tomorrow, but if we do, I have a number of \ngood ideas. This is one of them, and I would like this idea to sort of \nlead the parade here. We should do the things that both of us would \nagree on, that both of us think are important for our farmers, that \nboth of us believe would represent good policy. If that is the case, \nlet both of us do it together, either now or tomorrow morning.\n  I guess since there is an objection now, maybe we can talk about it \nagain tomorrow. Again, I understand exactly what has happened. This, \none way or another, needs to get resolved.\n  The Senator from Nebraska was on the floor, the Senator from Iowa, \nthe \n\n[[Page S307]]\nSenator from Idaho, my colleague from North Dakota. All of us have said \nexactly the same thing. We have said it with fingers pointing in \ndifferent directions, I guess. That is a habit I hope we get over this \nmonth and maybe the rest of the year, not talking so much about what \nhappened but what should happen, what must happen, what must we do to \nmake this a better country.\n  We all described one common goal today, and that is, we ought to \nprovide an answer to rural America. The Senator from Idaho probably has \nhad the same experience I have. I went to a farm show, and I was \ntalking to a lot of farmers. I was talking to a fellow who sells Ford \npickup trucks. He was talking to me. He said, ``You know, I need to \nfind out from you, when on Earth are you going to pass a farm bill?''\n  I said, ``Why are you so interested in that? Do you have crop acreage \nout there?''\n  He said, ``Oh, no, I don't have crops. What I have are farm \ncustomers. I have farm customers who were going to buy a pickup who now \nsay, `I am not going to be able to make this purchase until I find out \nwhat the circumstances are going to be for the farm bill.' ''\n  You need to understand it is not just farmers. It is agribusiness. It \nis people who sell vehicles and supplies. Everybody out there is facing \nthe same kind of problems as a result of this uncertainty.\n  So my hope is that the expression by all of us in the last few hours \nmight result in some common good here. If we can get together and talk \nabout this, we can probably find a key to unlock this and move ahead \nand give farmers the answer they deserve.\n  We only do this once every 5 years. It is pretty hard to foul this \nup. But, in my judgment, a mistake was made when it was decided to \npiggyback it on something else that was moving along. That is to \npiggyback it on reconciliation. We have never done that before. I do \nnot think it is the right thing to do.\n  What is past is past. The question now is: How do we extract from \nthis and decide to do this the right way?\n  The interesting thing, I say to the Senator from Idaho, is we have \ntwo leaders in this Senate who come from farm country. Senator Dole, of \ncourse, is from a big grain-producing State, and Senator Daschle has \nrepresented farmers many years from the State of South Dakota.\n  We have two leaders who know a lot about agriculture. Both of them \nknow a great deal about these issues. I know both of them have tried--\nin fact, Senator Daschle is a cosponsor of the legislation I just \ndiscussed and introduced today--to provide some answers.\n  My hope is all of us can get together and start figuring out a way to \nbridge this gap and solve this problem. I hope perhaps the Senator and \nI could talk again in the next day or so and see if we can just \nincrementally address these issues. Maybe the first increment is the \nadvance deficiency payment.\n  So, with that, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Exon as a \ncosponsor to the legislation that I introduced today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota and I \nprobably agree more than we disagree on agricultural policy, and I \nthink both he and I recognize the importance of our concerns this \nafternoon and what we have tried to say from the Senate to the leaders \nof the Senate and to the President.\n  The President cannot be allowed to only have rhetoric on this issue. \nHe must show action. He has to come forward, and he has not yet come \nforward with a farm plan.\n  Clearly, this morning at the White House, with the discussion among \nour agricultural leaders, our Senate and House leaders and the \nSecretary, in all fairness but with no criticism, this administration \nis without a plan as we speak. That simply has to change if we are to \nwork out our differences on farm policy.\n  Budget reconciliation, Mr. President, over the years has taken a \nvariety of forms, and it takes those forms as the budget requires it \nto. Those provisions of the farm bill or farm policy that are in budget \nreconciliation are those that drive budgets--conservation, farm credit, \nsome of those that are not there. We are not through with those. We \nwill ultimately package a farm bill this year, and I think the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and I both recognize that for it to be freestanding \non this floor, a very large part of it has to be bipartisan, and we \nwill work at every effort to solve that.\n  The work that we did earlier this year that found its way into budget \nreconciliation did get a lot of support. It is not to say that it did \nnot get support. The American Farm Bureau supported it, the National \nCorn Growers Association supported it, the National Grain Trade Council \nsupported it. I noticed the North Dakota Grain Growers Association lent \ntheir support to it, the Iowa Cattlemen, the Iowa Corn Growers. \nObviously, my colleague mentioned the majority leader. Well, Kansas was \nright in there offering the support to it from the Kansas Association \nof Wheat Growers and bankers and feed and grain associations and Kansas \nFertilizer and Chemical Association. It is a bill that offers broad-\nbased support to American agriculture, and I think it is important that \nthe Record show that.\n  There are disagreements, and there are differences. My colleague from \nNorth Dakota and I are tremendously concerned about what has happened \nin discretionary spending over the last good number of years, to see \nthat direct payments to American agricultural producers from 1986 to \ntoday has been reduced in real dollars about 60 percent. The problem we \nhave now is trying to balance all of that out.\n\n  Ironically enough, when we gained majority here in the U.S. Congress, \nwe knew that to get the kind of budget control we had to have, we could \nno longer go to the discretionary side, as my colleagues party has gone \nfor one too many year, and we had to go to entitlements. Even though we \nbrought agricultural spending down, there is no question that that \nhappened with policy change. We are gridlocked here today over \nentitlement battles. If we are still going to get the budget savings \nand leave entitlements untouched, I am afraid that my colleague from \nNorth Dakota and I are going to be locked together in a battle to \nprotect agriculture.\n  This administration still wants to take much too much out of \ndiscretionary spending and free up or allow relatively untouched a \nvariety of the entitlement areas. What we tried to offer was some \nbalance. There is disagreement at this time, and I hope we can arrive \nat a balanced budget. The President has finally agreed to 7 years and \nCBO. But there is a lot of difference out there still.\n  The one thing I think my colleague and I agree on this evening is the \nimmediacy of the situation with American agriculture. We are not going \nto see another shutdown. Programs are going to be funded. But how long \nwill they be funded, and how far into the next cropping season? The \nsignals we send now and in the next few months are going to be ever so \nimportant, as American agriculture begins to farm and puts together its \nbudgets and farm programs, buys the new pickup, if you will, looks at \nthe new combine, puts the budget together for the fertilizer, seed \ngrain, corn, and all of that. That is what it is all about. I hope that \nby the weekend, possibly, we can have resolved this issue. Maybe it \nwill come with a CR on Friday, maybe it will not. But I certainly hope \nthat all parties involved will engage and get it resolved so that we \ncan send a critical message to agriculture in this country, which they \nare now asking for.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho and I have, long \nago, worn out our welcome. But I did just want to add a point about the \nadministration. The Senator from Idaho said gingerly that this \nadministration had no farm plan, was not active or engaged in the farm \nbill debate. I do not want that to pass. We have an Agriculture \nSecretary, former Congressman Dan Glickman, who comes from Kansas, who \nwas confirmed with unanimous support. He knows agriculture and had \nserved on the House Agriculture Committee. He knows it very well. He is \na strong advocate for family \n\n[[Page S308]]\nfarmers, as is the President. In fact, because I was part of the budget \nnegotiations, Senator Exon and I were involved in many of the \nnegotiations, some at the White House.\n  I have seen the President's reaction weighing in on the agriculture \nissues. He very much wants there to be a safety net or a farm program \nthat helps family-size farms in this country. He hired and appointed an \nAgriculture Secretary who believes that very strongly. I do not want \nthe moment to go and let someone listening say, ``Well, gee, they said \nnobody down at the White House cares.'' Secretary Glickman, I think, is \na terrific Secretary of Agriculture, selected by this President, \nrepresenting this President, to try to get a better farm program. \nHopefully, all of us can work together. There will be no solution to \nthe problem without Secretary Glickman and President Clinton's active \ninvolvement. The meeting this morning, I think, was called by Secretary \nGlickman. They are active, engaged, and involved, and they want to \nsolve this problem.\n  I hope, along with the Senator from Idaho, that by the end of this \nweek we will have advanced by this discussion today the interest of \nproviding some answers to family farmers in this country, but \nespecially providing the right answers for the long-term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S306-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S308-S309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TWO HEROES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk just briefly about \ntwo Americans I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues--two \nheroes of mine.\n  I have never met these men. I talked to one them on the phone the \nother day, a fellow named Robert Naegele. Mr. Naegele started a company \ncalled Rollerblade, which some of you may know about. It is the largest \nin-line skate company in America. I learned about Mr. Naegele and his \ncompany in an article I read in the Minneapolis Star Tribune when I was \ntravelling through Minneapolis the other day by plane.\n  Robert Naegele sold his company 2 months ago. He apparently made an \nenormous amount of money. He started the company from scratch, ran it, \nturned it into a $250 million business and then sold it recently. Then, \nabout a week before Christmas, 280 employees of this company began to \nget letters in the mail from Mr. Naegele and his wife, Ellis. It turns \nout that he decided to give the people who had worked for his company--\nthe people who worked in the factories and made the skates and made him \na very wealthy man--a Christmas bonus equal to $160 a month for every \nmonth these folks had worked for the company.\n  For some of them who had been there the entire 10 years he owned the \ncompany, it meant more than $25,000. But he wasn't done. He and his \nwife had prepaid the income taxes on the bonuses so when these folks \nopened up their check, totally unexpected, from someone who no longer \nowned the company, they got a check that was tax free.\n  What this man was saying to them was: You mattered. You people who \nworked in the plant and factories and helped make this product, you are \nthe ones who made me successful. You made me some money, and I want to \nshare it with you. What a remarkable story. What a hero!\n  This guy is out of step with the CEOs in our country who now say the \nway to the future is to downsize, lay off and cut the ground out from \nunder the feet of people who have worked for a company for 20 years. \nMr. Naegele, on the other hand, says to his workers, who are weeping \nwith joy about his unexpected benevolence: ``You matter to me. You made \na difference. You made this company successful, and I want to share it \nwith you.''\n  What a remarkable man! It seems to me if more CEOs in this country \nwould understand what Mr. Naegele understands, this country would be a \nbetter place. Our companies could be better able to compete. You would \nhave more loyalty and more job security for people who have spent 10 \nand 20 years investing their time in a company.\n  The day after I read the article about Mr. Naegele, I read a similar \none. It was about a fellow whose company began to burn down on December \n11 in a small town in Massachusetts. The man's name was Aaron \nFeuerstein. He was about to go to his 70th birthday party--a surprise \nparty that was being thrown for him--when he learned that a boiler had \nexploded at his textile mill setting off a fire. It injured 27 people \nand destroyed three of the factory's century-old buildings. His plant \nemploys 2,400 people in an economically depressed area.\n  The people who watched the mill burn felt that they were going to \nlose their jobs and lose their futures. When Feuerstein arrived to \nassess the damage to a business his grandfather had started 90 years \nago, he kept himself from crying by thinking back to the passage from \nKing Lear in which Lear promises not to weep even though his heart \nwould ``break into a hundred thousand flaws.'' Mr. Feuerstein said, ``I \nwas telling myself I have to be creative.'' And 3 days after the fire, \nhe had a plan.\n  According to the Time magazine article:\n\n       On the night of Dec. 14, more than 1,000 employees gathered \n     in the gym of Central Catholic High School to learn the fate \n     of their jobs and of the cities of Methuen and Lawrence. \n     Feuerstein entered the gym from the back, and as he shook the \n     snow off his coat, the murmurs turned to cheers. The factory \n     owner, who had already given out $275 Christmas bonuses, and \n     pledged to rebuild, walked to the podium. ``I will get right \n     to my announcement,'' he said. ``For the next 30 days--and it \n     might be more--all our employees will be paid their full \n     salaries. But over and above the money, the most important \n     thing Malden Mills can do for our workers is to get you back \n     to work. By Jan. 2, we will restart operations, and within 90 \n     days we will be fully operational.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       True to his word, Feuerstein has continued to pay his \n     employees in full, at a cost of some $1.5 million a week and \n     at an average of $12.50 an hour--already one of the highest \n     textile rates in the world. And even better than his word, \n     Malden Mills was up and running last week at 80% of its \n     Polartec capacity, thanks to round-the-clock salvage work and \n     the purchase of 15 new machines. ``I haven't really done \n     anything,'' says Feuerstein. ``I don't deserve credit. \n     Corporate America has made it so that when you behave the way \n     I did, it's abnormal.''\n\n  I just want to say again that I think Robert Naegele and Aaron \nFeuerstein are heroes. I think they both recognize what a lot of people \nin this country have forgotten. A company is its workers. Yes, it is \nits investors, it is its innovators, it is its scientists, and it is \nalso its workers. Workers matter, and these heroes have done what more \nAmerican business leaders should do. Too many American businesses now \nsay to those workers, ``You are like a wrench. We use you, and we get \nrid of you when we choose to.''\n  What Mr. Naegele and Mr. Feuerstein are saying is that workers are \ntheir business. The workers determined whether their businesses were \nsuccessful. And both of them have committed themselves to their \nworkers. And I say to Mr. Naegele and Mr. Feuerstein that they are \nAmerican heroes to me, and I wish there were more employers like them \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the two \narticles I mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune]\n\n    It Was a Surprisingly Green Christmas for Rollerblade Employees\n\n                            (By Dee DePass)\n\n       Two weeks ago Rollerblade employee Ann Reader, six months \n     pregnant with her third child, called her husband, Tim, from \n     work sobbing. He immediately thought the worst, she said.\n       But it was good news for Reader and all of Rollerblade's \n     280 employees. Former Rollerblade co-owner Robert Naegele and \n     his wife, Ellis, played Santa over the holidays, giving each \n     of Rollerblade's employees thousands of dollars in tax-free \n     money, figured at about $160 for each month of service with \n     the company. Sources familiar with the giveaway estimated the \n     combined gifts to be $1.5 million.\n       Reader, team programs manager, has worked there for more \n     than 6 years--making \n\n[[Page S309]]\n     her check worth more than $11,000. None of the employees contacted \n     would confirm the amount of their checks.\n       ``It made me cry,'' said Reader in a shaky voice. ``I think \n     it was so generous of them. It was an amazing gesture.''\n       Rollerblade spokesperson Deborah Autrey said, ``It was a \n     complete surprise that came out of the blue. People were \n     laughing and crying and hugging. I have never seen people in \n     such a stupor.''\n       Autrey has worked at Rollerblade for four years. More than \n     half of the employees are warehouse workers with most \n     receiving hourly wages.\n       Naegele, who was chairman during the phenomenal growth of \n     the 15-year old firm, could not be reached for comment. Two \n     months ago he sold his 50 percent share of Rollerblade to \n     Nordica Inc. of Italy for an undisclosed amount. He bought 50 \n     percent of the in-line skate company in 1985, when sales were \n     only $500,000. Sales in 1994 were $265 million.\n       In Christmas cards to employees, Naegele wrote that he had \n     reaped great rewards from his Rollerblade investment because \n     of the employees' hard work and that he wanted to show his \n     thanks, Autrey said. Enclosed in the cards were the gift \n     checks, on which the Naegeles paid federal taxes.\n       ``That way the employees did not get hit with a double \n     whammy. It is a tax-free gift,'' said Autrey.\n       The checks were mailed to employees' homes the week before \n     Christmas. The first arrived on Dec. 21 to an employee who \n     was home on maternity leave. From there word spread among the \n     workers, and later that day it was confirmed by the company's \n     chief executive, John Hetterick, who had only found out the \n     day before.\n       When the good news reached Matt Majka, 33, the director of \n     product marketing, he immediately phoned his wife, Kym, and \n     asked her to open the mail. When she did, Majka heard sobs. \n     He has been with the company for 11 years, making his check \n     worth an estimated $21,120.\n       ``It was very moving,'' he said.\n       ``It was very heartfelt for us. We were extremely shocked \n     and extremely grateful for his generosity. . . . All the \n     words he talked about for so many years--about teamwork and \n     that we are a family--he put his words into action.''\n       Majka and his wife have a 4-month-old baby and a 2-year-old \n     son, and the Naegeles' gift went to start a college fund for \n     them, he said. The couple also had a new IBM computer under \n     the Christmas tree.\n       Reader said she bought bikes for her two children (and a \n     bike baby carrier for the newest family member) and she plans \n     to put some of the money away in savings.\n       Majka marveled at what the gift meant to scores of his co-\n     workers. ``There are some people who have worked in our \n     warehouse and have been here for a long time,'' he said. \n     ``For some people, they have received a very substantial \n     check, maybe half of their year's salary. It's pretty \n     amazing.'' At least two employees have been there for all of \n     the company's 15 years.\n       ``I happened to talk to Bob [Naegele] later that night,'' \n     Majka said. ``I told him, `You can't imagine the impact you \n     have had on everyone.' He bellowed and said, `That is just \n     what I wanted to hear.' He said, `This is not mine. It is a \n     gift I had to share.' ''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [From Time Magazine, Jan. 8, 1996]\n\n                          The Glow From A Fire\n\n                            (By Steve Wulf)\n\n       Methuen, Massachusetts, is a small city not unlike the \n     Bedford Falls of It's a Wonderful Life. Over the years, the \n     working-class town on the border of New Hampshire and \n     Massachusetts has come to rely on the good heart of one man. \n     While Aaron Feuerstein may not look much like Jimmy Stewart, \n     he is the protagonist of a Christmas story every bit as \n     warming as the Frank Capra movie--or the Polartec fabric made \n     at his Malden Mills.\n       On the night of Dec. 11, just as Feuerstein was being \n     thrown a surprise 70th birthday party, a boiler at Malden \n     Mills exploded, setting off a fire that injured 27 people and \n     destroyed three of the factory's century-old buildings. \n     Because Malden Mills employs 2,400 people in an economically \n     depressed area, the news was as devastating as the fire, \n     according to Paul Coorey, the president of Local 311 of the \n     Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. ``I \n     was standing there seeing the mill burn with my son, who also \n     works there, and he looked at me and said, `Dad, we just lost \n     our jobs.' Years of our lives seemed gone.''\n       When Feuerstein arrived to assess the damage to a business \n     his grandfather had started 90 years ago, he kept himself \n     from crying by thinking back to the passage from King Lear in \n     which Lear promises not to weep even though his heart would \n     ``break into a hundred thousand flaws.'' ``I was telling \n     myself I have to be creative,'' Feuerstein later told the New \n     York Times. ``Maybe there's some way to get out of it.'' \n     Feuerstein, who reads from both his beloved Shakespeare and \n     the Talmud almost every night, has never been one to run \n     away. When many other textile manufacturers in New England \n     fled to the South and to foreign countries, Malden Mills \n     stayed put. When a reliance on fake fur bankrupted the \n     company for a brief period in the early '80s, Feuerstein \n     sought out alternatives.\n       What brought Malden Mills out of bankruptcy was its \n     research and development team, which came up with a \n     revolutionary fabric that was extremely warm, extremely \n     light, quick to dry and easy to dye. Polartec is also \n     ecologically correct because it is made from recycled plastic \n     bottles. Clothing made with Polartec or a fraternal brand \n     name, Synchilla, is sold by such major outdoors clothiers as \n     L.L. Bean, Patagonia, Eastern Mountain Sports and Eddie \n     Bauer, and it accounts for half of Malden's $400 million-plus \n     in 1995 sales.\n       Even though the stock of a rival textile manufacturer in \n     Tennessee, the Dyersburg Corp., rose sharply the day after \n     the fire, L.L. Bean and many of Malden's other customers \n     pledged their support. Another apparel company, Dakotah, sent \n     Feuerstein a $30,000 check. The Bank of Boston sent $50,000, \n     the union $100,000, the Chamber of Commerce in the \n     surrounding Merrimack Valley $150,000. ``The money is not for \n     Malden Mills,'' says Feuerstein, ``It is for the Malden Mills \n     employees. It makes me feel wonderful. I have hundreds of \n     letters at home from ordinary people, beautiful letters with \n     dollar bills, $10 bills.''\n       The money was nothing to the workers compared to what \n     Feuerstein gave them three days later. On the night of Dec. \n     14, more than 1,000 employees gathered in the gym of Central \n     Catholic High School to learn the fate of their jobs and of \n     the cities of Methuen and Lawrence. Feuerstein entered the \n     gym from the back, and as he shook the snow off his coat, the \n     murmurs turned to cheers. The factory owner, who had already \n     given out $275 Christmas bonuses and pledged to rebuild, \n     walked to the podium. ``I will get right to my \n     announcement,'' he said. ``For the next 30 days--and it might \n     be more--all our employees will be paid their full salaries. \n     But over and above the money, the most important thing Malden \n     Mills can do for our workers is to get you back to work. By \n     Jan. 2, we will restart operations, and within 90 days we \n     will be fully operational.'' What followed, after a moment of \n     awe, was a scene of hugging and cheering that would have \n     trumped the cinematic celebration for Wonderful Life's George \n     Bailey.\n       True to his word, Feuerstein has continued to pay his \n     employees in full, at a cost of some $1.5 million a week and \n     at an average of $12.50 an hour--already one of the highest \n     textile wages in the world.

Thank you. America is very proud of you.\n  My duty tonight is to report on the State of the Union, not the state \nof our government but of our American community, and to set forth our \nresponsibilities--in the words of our Founders--to ``form a more \nperfect union.''\n  The State of the Union is strong.\n  Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades. We have \nthe lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.\n  We have created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million of them in \nbasic industries like construction and automobiles. America is selling \nmore cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970's, and for 3 \nyears in a row, we have \n\n[[Page S310]]\nhad a record number of new businesses started.\n  Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing new hope for \npeace. And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring \nour fundamental values. The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp \nrolls, the poverty rate, and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. And \nas they go down, prospects for America's future go up.\n  We live in an Age of Possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from \nfarm to factory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and \nglobal competition.\n  These changes have opened vast new opportunities, but they also \npresent stiff challenges. While more Americans are living better lives, \ntoo many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up. And \nthey are concerned about the security of their families.\n  We must answer three fundamental questions: How do we make the \nAmerican dream of opportunity a reality for all who are willing to work \nfor it? How do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into \nthe future? And how do we meet these challenges together, as one \nAmerica?\n  We know Big Government does not have all the answers. There is not a \nprogram for every problem. We know we need a smaller, less bureaucratic \ngovernment in Washington--one that lives within its means.\n  The era of Big Government is over. But we cannot go back to the time \nwhen our citizens were left to fend for themselves. Instead, we must go \nforward as one America--one nation working together, to meet the \nchallenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not \nopposing virtues--we must have both.\n  I believe our new, smaller government must work in an old-fashioned \nAmerican way--together with all our citizens, through state and local \ngovernments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable, and civic \nassociations.\n  Our goal must be: to enable all our people to make the most of their \nown lives with stronger families, more educational opportunity, \neconomic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment, a safer world.\n  To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves; we \nmust expect more of each other; and we must face our challenges \ntogether.\n  Our responsibility here begins with balancing the budget in a way \nthat is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan agreement \nthat permanent deficit spending must come to an end.\n  I compliment the Republicans for the energy and determination they \nhave brought to this task. And I thank the Democrats for passing the \nlargest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, which has already \ncut the deficit nearly in half in just 3 years.\n  Since then, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit \nreduction: lower interest rates have made it easier for business to \ncreate new jobs, and have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car \npayments, and credit card rates to ordinary citizens. Now it is time to \nfinish the job. Though differences remain among us, the combined total \nof the proposed savings common to both plans is more than enough, using \nnumbers from your Congressional Budget Office, to balance the budget in \n7 years and to provide a modest tax cut. These cuts are real; they will \nrequire sacrifice from everyone.\n  But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our \nparents, our children, and our future by endangering Medicare, \nMedicaid, education or the environment, or by raising taxes on the \nhardest pressed working families.\n  I am willing to work to resolve our remaining differences. I am ready \nto meet tomorrow. But I ask you at least to enact these savings so we \ncan give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower \ninterest rates, and a brighter future.\n  We must make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.\n  Now it is time to look to the challenges of today and tomorrow. Our \nNation was built on challenges, not promises. When we work together to \nmeet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect union: our \nindividual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.\n  Tonight, I want to speak about the challenges we face as a people.\n  Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen \nAmerican families.\n  Families are the foundation of American life. If we have stronger \nfamilies, we will have a stronger nation.\n  Strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our \nchildren. It is hard to be a parent today; but it is even harder to be \na child. All of us--our parents, our media, our schools, our teachers, \nour communities, our churches, our businesses, and government--have a \nresponsibility to help children make it.\n  To the media: I say you should create movies, CD's and television \nshows you would want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy. I \ncall on Congress to pass the requirement for a ``V'' chip in TV sets, \nso parents can screen out programs which they believe are inappropriate \nfor their younger children. When parents control what their children \nsee, that's not censorship. That's enabling parents to assume more \nresponsibility for their children. And I urge them to do it. The ``V'' \nchip requirement is part of the telecommunications bill now pending. It \nhas bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now.\n  To make the ``V'' chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry do \nwhat movies have done, to identify your programming in ways that help \nparents protect their children.\n  I invite the leaders of major media corporations and the \nentertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work \nwith us on concrete ways to improve what our children see on \ntelevision. I am ready to work with you.\n  I say to those who make and market cigarettes. Every year, a million \nchildren take up smoking; 300,000 of them will have their lives \nshortened as a result. My administration has taken steps to stop the \nmassive marketing campaign that appeals to our children. We are saying: \nMarket your products to adults, if you wish--but draw the line on \nchildren.\n  I say to those on welfare: For too long, our welfare system has \nundermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them. \nCongress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform.\n  We agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest \npossible child support enforcement. But we must also provide child care \nso that mothers can go to work without worrying about their children. \nSo I challenge Congress: Send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that \nwill really move people from welfare to work and do right by our \nchildren, and I will sign it.\n  But passing a law is only the first step. The next step is to make it \nwork. I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this \nopportunity for independence. And I challenge American business to give \nthem a chance to move from welfare to work. I applaud the work of \nreligious groups that care for the poor.\n  More than anyone else, they know the difficulty of this task, and \nthey are in a position to help. Every one of us should join with them.\n  To strengthen the family, we must do everything we can to keep the \nteen pregnancy rate going down. It is still too high: Tonight I am \npleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding \nto that challenge by forming an organization that will support grass \nroots community efforts in a national campaign against teen pregnancy. \nAnd I challenge every American to join them.\n  I call on American men and women to respect one another. We must end \nthe deadly scourge of domestic violence. I challenge America's families \nto stay together.\n  In particular, I challenge fathers to love and care for their \nchildren. If your family has separated, you must pay your child \nsupport. We are doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we are \ngoing to do move. But let's all admit: A check will never be a \nsubstitute for a father's love and guidance, and only you can make the \ndecision to help raise your children--no matter who you are, it is your \nmost basic human duty.\n  Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational \nopportunities we need for a new century.\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\n  Every classroom in America must be connected to the information \nsuperhighway, with computers, good software, and well-trained teachers. \nWe are working with the telecommunications industry, educators and \nparents to connect 20 percent of the classrooms in California by this \nspring, and every classroom and library in America by the year 2000. I \nask Congress to support our education technology initiative to make \nthis national partnership successful.\n  Every diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, \nschool, and State to adopt national standards of excellence, measure \nwhether schools are meeting those standards, cut redtape so that \nschools have more flexibility for grassroots reform, and hold them \naccountable for results. That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is all \nabout.\n  I challenge every State to give all parents the right to choose which \npublic school their children attend, and let teachers form new schools \nwith a charter they can keep only if they do a good job.\n  I challenge all schools to teach character education: good values, \nand good citizenship. And if it means teenagers will stop killing each \nother over designer jackets, then public schools should be able to \nrequire school uniforms.\n  I challenge parents to be their children's first teachers. Turn off \nthe TV. See that the homework gets done. Visit your children's \nclassroom.\n  Today, higher education is more important than ever before. We have \ncreated a new student loan program that has made it easier to borrow \nand repay loans; and dramatically cut the student loan default rate. \nThrough AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 \nstudents will earn college money by serving in their local communities. \nThese initiatives are right for America; we should keep them going.\n  And we should open the doors to college even wider. I challenge \nCongress to expand work study and help one million young Americans work \ntheir way through college by the year 2000; to provide a $1,000 merit \nscholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school; to \nexpand Pell grant scholarships for deserving students; and to make up \nto $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible.\n  Our third challenge is to help every American achieve economic \nsecurity.\n  People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new \neconomy--education and training for a lifetime, more support for \nfamilies raising children, retirement security, and access to health \ncare.\n  More and more Americans are finding that the education of their \nchildhood simply does not last a lifetime.\n  I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping job training \nprograms into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or \nunderemployed workers to use for community college tuition or other \ntraining. Pass this GI bill for America's workers.\n  More and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress \nsets the minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a \n40-year low in purchasing power. Four dollars and twenty-five cents an \nhour is not a living wage. But millions of Americans and their children \nare trying to live on it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.\n  In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working \nfamilies, to make sure no parents who worked full time would have to \nraise their children in poverty. This expanded earned income tax credit \nis now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000. \nThe budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement, and \nraised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people. We must not do that.\n  We need a tax credit for working families with children. That's one \nthing most of us in this Chamber can agree on. And it should be part of \nany final budget agreement.\n  I challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide \npensions for your employees, and I challenge Congress to pass a \nproposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business, \nthat would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish \ntheir own pension plans.\n  We should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with \nbipartisan support, we protected the pensions of 8 million working \npeople and stabilized the pensions of 32 million more. Congress should \nnot now let companies endanger their worker's pension funds. I vetoed \nsuch a proposal last year, and I would veto it again.\n  Finally, if working families are going to succeed in the new economy, \nthey must be able to buy health insurance policies that they don't lose \nwhen they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over \nthe past 2 years, over one million Americans in working families lost \ntheir health insurance. We must do more to make health care available \nto every American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan \nbill before you that requires insurance companies to stop dropping \npeople when they switch jobs, and stop denying coverage for pre-\nexisting conditions.\n  And we must preserve the basic protections Medicare and Medicaid \ngive, not just to the poor, but to people in working families, \nincluding children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, and \nsenior citizens in nursing homes. In the past 3 years we have saved $15 \nbillion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse. We can save much \nmore. But we cannot abandon our fundamental obligations to the people \nwho need Medicare and Medicaid. America cannot become stronger if they \nbecome weaker.\n  The GI bill for workers, tax relief for education and child-rearing, \npension availability and protection, access to health care, \npreservation of Medicare and Medicaid, these things--along with the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993--will help responsible \nhard-working American families to make the most of their own lives.\n  But, employers and employees must do their part as well, as they are \nin so many of our finest companies, working together, puttting long-\nterm prosperity ahead of short-term gains.\n  As workers increase their hours and their productivity, employers \nshould make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits \nof the good years as well as the burdens of the bad ones. When \ncompanies and workers work as a team, they do better. And so does \nAmerica.\n  Our fourth great challenge is to take back our streets from crime, \ngangs, and drugs.\n  At last, we have begun to find the way to reduce crime--forming \ncommunity partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and \nto prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing, has begun \nto work. Violent crime is coming down all across America.\n  In New York City, murders are down 25 percent, in St. Louis 18 \npercent, in Seattle 32 percent. But we still have a long way to go \nbefore our streets are safe and our people are free of fear.\n  The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community \npolicing. It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of \nall sizes. We are already a third of the way there. I challenge the \nCongress to finish the job. Let's stick with a strategy that's working, \nand keep the crime rate coming down.\n  Community policing also requires bonds of trust between our citizens \nand our police. So I ask all Americans to respect and support our \npolice. And to our police, I say: Our children need you as role models \nand heroes. Don't let them down.\n  The Brady bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal \nrecords from buying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds \nof assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge \nCongress to keep those laws on the books.\n  Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way \nwe took on the mob. I am directing the FBI and other investigative \nagencies to target gangs that involve juveniles in violent crime and to \nseek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like \nadults.\n  And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: \nCriminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of \ndecent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit crimes \nand peddle drugs should be: One strike and you're out.\n  I challenge every State to match Federal policy: to assure that \nserious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\n  More police and punishment are important, but not enough. We must \nkeep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention \nstrategies not dictated by Washington, but developed in communities. I \nchallenge all communities and adults to give these children futures to \nsay yes to. And I challenge Congress not to abandon the crime bill's \nsupport of these grassroots efforts.\n  Finally, to reduce crime and violence, we must reduce the drug \nproblem. The challenge begins at home, with parents talking to their \nchildren openly and firmly. It embraces our churches, youth groups, and \nour schools.\n  I challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools. \nPeople like DARE officers are making an impression on grade school \nchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time \ncomes.\n  Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into \nAmerica. For the last 2 years, one man in particular has been on the \nfront lines of that effort. And tonight I am nominating a hero of the \nPersian Gulf and the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Military's Southern \nCommand, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, as America's new drug czar.\n  General McCaffrey has earned three purple hearts and two silver stars \nfighting for America. Tonight I ask that he lead our Nation's battle \nagainst drugs at home and abroad.\n  To succeed, he needs a force larger than he has ever commanded. He \nneeds all of us. Every one of us will have a role to play on this team. \nThank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one \nmore time.\n  Our fifth challenge is to leave our environment safe and clean for \nthe next generation.\n  Because of a generation of bipartisan effort, we have cleaner air and \nwater. Lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent, and \ntoxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead. Now it \nis a thriving resource.\n  But 10 million children under 12 still live within 4 miles of a toxic \nwaste dump. A third of us breathe air which endangers our health. And \nin too many communities, water is not safe to drink. We still have much \nto do.\n  Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 \npercent. That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our \nair, more pesticides in our food.\n  Lobbyists for the polluters have been allowed to write their own \nloopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety \nof our children. And some in this Congress want to make taxpayers pick \nup the tab for toxic waste and let polluters off the hook.\n  I challenge Congress to reverse those priorities. I say the polluters \nshould pay. We can expand the economy without hurting the environment. \nIn fact we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning it up.\n  We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative \nin protecting the environment and make it easier for them to do so. To \nbusinesses, we are saying: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient \nway than government regulations require to meet tough pollution \nstandards, then do it--as long as you do it right.\n  To communities, we say: we must strengthen community right-to-know \nlaws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you must use \nthe information to work with business to cut pollution. People do have \na right to know that their air and water are safe.\n  Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight \nfor freedom and peace.\n  Because of American leadership, more people than ever before live \nfree and at peace, and Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and \nsecurity. We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. To \nSenator Bob Dole, and all the others in this Chamber and throughout our \ncountry who fought in World War II and all the conflicts since, I \nsalute your service.\n  All over the world, people still look to us. And trust us to help \nthem seek the blessings of peace and freedom.\n  But as the cold war fades, voices of isolation say America should \nretreat from its responsibilities. I say they are wrong. The threats we \nAmericans face respect no nation's borders: terrorism, the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic \nand religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental \ndegradation. If we fail to address these threats today, we will suffer \nthe consequences of our neglect tomorrow.\n  We can't be everywhere. We can't do everything. But where our \ninterests and our values are at stake--and where we can make a \ndifference--America must lead.\n  We must not be isolationist or the world's policeman. But we can be \nthe world's best peacemaker. By keeping our military strong, by using \ndiplomacy where we can, and force where we must, by working with others \nto share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a \ndifference for people here and around the world.\n  For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no \nRussian missiles pointed at America's children. North Korea has now \nfrozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti, the dictators \nare gone, democracy has a new day, and the flow of desperate refugees \nto our shores has subsided.\n  Through tougher trade deals for America, over 80 of them, we have \nopened markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing \nfaster than imports and creating American jobs.\n  We stood with those taking risks for peace, in Northern Ireland, \nwhere Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents that \nviolence must never return, and in the Middle East, where Arabs and \nJews, who once seemed destined to fight forever, now share knowledge, \nresources, and dreams.\n  And, we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal \nprisoners, the mass graves, the campaigns of rape and torture, endless \nlines of refugees, the threat of a spreading war--all these horrors \nhave now given way to the hope of peace. Now our troops and a strong \nNATO, together with its new partners from Central Europe and elsewhere, \nare helping that peace to take hold.\n  Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American \npeople. But important challenges remain. The START II treaty with \nRussia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent; I urge \nthe Senate to ratify it--now.\n  We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban treaty--this year. We can outlaw poison \ngas forever, if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention--\nthis year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized \ncriminals at home and abroad, if Congress passes the anti-terrorism \nlegislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing--now.\n  We can help more people move from hatred to hope, if Congress gives \nus the means to remain the world's leader for peace.\n  The six challenges I have discussed thus far are for all Americans. \nBut our seventh challenge is America's challenge to us here tonight: to \nreinvent our Government and make our democracy work for them.\n  Last year, this Congress applied to itself the laws that it applies \nto everyone else, banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. It forced \nlobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are \ntrying to pass or kill. I applaud you for that.\n  Now I challenge Congress to go further: curb special interest \ninfluence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign \nfinance reform bill in a generation.\n  Show the American people we can limit spending and that we can open \nthe airwaves to all candidates.\n  And I appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the \nAmerican people.\n  We are working hard to create a government that works better and \ncosts less. Thanks to the work of Vice-President Gore, we are \neliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations and \nshifting more decision making out of Washington back to States and \nlocal communities.\n  As we move into an era of balanced budgets and smaller government, we \nmust work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own \nlives.\n  We are helping America's communities, not with bureaucracy, but with \nopportunity. Through our successful \n\n[[Page S313]]\nempowerment zones and community development banks, we are helping \npeople find jobs and start businesses. And with tax incentives for \ncompanies that clean up abandoned industrial property, bringing jobs \nback to the places that desperately need them.\n  But there are some areas that the Federal Government must address \ndirectly and strongly. One of these is the problem of illegal \nimmigration. After years and years of neglect, this administration has \ntaken a strong stand to stiffen protection on our borders.\n  We are increasing border controls by 50 percent, we are increasing \ninspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I \nannounce I will sign an executive order to deny Federal contracts to \nbusinesses that hire illegal immigrants.\n  Let me be clear: we are still a nation of immigrants; we honor all \nthose immigrants who are working hard to become new citizens. But we \nare also a nation of laws.\n  I want to say a special word to those who work for our Federal \nGovernment. Today, the Federal workforce is 200,000 employees smaller \nthan the day I took office. The Federal Government is the smallest it \nhas been in 30 years, and it is getting smaller every day. Most of my \nfellow Americans probably didn't know that, and there's a good reason. \nThe remaining Federal workforce is composed of Americans who are \nworking harder and working smarter to make sure that the quality of our \nservices does not decline.\n  Take Richard Dean. He is a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who has worked \nfor Social Security for 22 years. Last year he was hard at work in the \nFederal building in Oklahoma City when the terrorist blast killed 169 \npeople and brought the rubble down around him.\n  He re-entered the building four times and saved lives of three women. \nHe is here with us this evening. I want to recognize Richard and \napplaud both his public service and his extraordinary heroism.\n  But Richard's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was \nforced out of his office when the Government shut down.\n  And the second time the Government shut down, he continued helping \nSocial Security recipients, but he was working without pay.\n  On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, I challenge all of you in \nthis Chamber: never--ever--shut the Federal Government down again.\n\n  And on behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their \nSocial Security payments at the beginning of March, I challenge \nCongress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States, to \nhonor the obligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years, to \nrise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the \ndebt limit. Show them that America keeps its word.\n  I have asked a lot of America this evening. But I am confident. When \nAmericans work together in their homes, their schools, their churches, \ntheir civic groups or at work, they can meet any challenge.\n  I say again: The era of Big Government is over. But we can't go back \nto the era of fending for yourself. We must go forward, to the era of \nworking together, as a community, as a team, as one America, with all \nof us reaching across the lines that divide us, rejecting division, \ndiscrimination and rancor, to find common ground. We must work \ntogether.\n  I want you to meet two people tonight who do that. Lucius Wright is a \nteacher in the Jackson, MS public school system, a Vietnam veteran. He \nhas created groups that help inner city children turn away from gangs \nand build futures they can believe in.\n  Sgt. Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City. Like \nRichard Dean, she helped pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and \ndeal with that awful tragedy. She reminds us that, in their response to \nthat atrocity, the people of Oklahoma City lifted us all with their \nbasic sense of decency and community.\n  Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rogers are special Americans. I have the \nhonor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several \nthousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its \nlong journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics \nin Atlanta this summer--not because they are star athletes, but because \nthey are star citizens--community heroes meeting America's challenges--\nour real champions.\n  Now each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own \nlives. But none of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve \nour destiny together, one hand, one generation, one American connecting \nto another.\n  There have always been things we could do together--dreams we could \nmake real--which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have \nforged our identity, our very union, from every point of view and every \npoint on the planet. But we are bound by a faith more powerful than any \ndoctrines that divide us--by our belief in progress, our love of \nliberty, and our relentless search for common ground. America has \nalways sought and always risen to the challenge.\n  Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go \nforward from here? Who would say that this Age of Possibility is not \nfor all Americans?\n  America is--and always has been--a great and good country. But the \nbest is yet to come. If we all do our part.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S309-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 4:12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1606.

A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Ruth and Billy \nGraham.\n\n\n        THE BILLY AND RUTH GRAHAM CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL AWARD ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have a bill that Senator Faircloth and I \nare joining to offer. It is sponsored by many other Senators. It is at \nthe desk.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not \nsure I understood what the Senator from North Carolina said. Was the \nSenator calling up a bill?\n  Mr. HELMS. This is a bill to authorize a congressional gold medal to \nBilly Graham and Ruth Graham, his wife of 52 years.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the Senator calling a bill up for debate and \nconsideration?\n  Mr. HELMS. No, sir, it is to be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before I begin, several Senators have \nalready asked to be identified as cosponsors of this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch; the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Simpson; the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner; the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski; the Senator from Texas, \nMrs. Hutchison; the Senator from Kansas, Mrs. Kassebaum; and Senator \nAbraham; and Senator Specter of Pennsylvania be added as cosponsors, \nand I ask that the bill be held at the desk until the close of business \ntoday for Senators to add their names as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Faircloth and I are genuinely \nhonored to offer this legislation to award a congressional gold medal \nto two wonderful North Carolinians, Dr. Billy Graham and his remarkable \nwife of 52 years, Ruth Graham. I have known them for years. Billy \nGraham was born not far from where I was born, and I have known him \nvery, very well since the early 1950's, when I attended his very first \ncrusade right here at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC.\n  When the bill is signed into law, Congress will be paying tribute to \na deserving couple who have spent their lives exemplifying the miracle \nof America--faith in God, morality, charity, and family.\n  Most Senators have met the Grahams; many are personal friends, as are \nSenator Faircloth and I. Billy and Ruth are marvelous servants of the \nLord. Anybody even vaguely familiar with the Grahams' witness will \nagree that Billy's and Ruth's relationships with God, their love for \neach other and their family, and their deep-seated compassion for \nhumanity are unsurpassed. This is the genuine spirituality that has led \nliterally millions of Americans, and millions of others around the \nworld, to grasp the meaning and hope of salvation.\n  The incredible millions who have heard the message of salvation \nthrough Billy Graham's evangelistic campaigns are testimony to his \ndevout magnetism. For the past half century, more than 100 million \npeople in 180 countries have personally heard Billy Graham's thrilling \nmessages in person when they attended his rallies. Others have \nworshipped with him by television. An estimated total of more than 2 \nbillion people have worshipped with Billy Graham on television. \nCountless others have sought spiritual help and counsel through his \nbooks, magazines, newspaper editorials, radio broadcasts, and the Billy \nGraham Training Center at Black Mountain, NC.\n\n  The Grahams have responded to the physical needs of people around the \nworld through a legacy inherited from Ruth Graham's father, the \ndistinguished Dr. L. Nelson Bell, who was a missionary to China. Dr. \nBell and his family served as medical missionaries to China for nearly \n25 years before returning to the Memorial Mission Hospital in \nAsheville, NC.\n  Today, the Grahams continue Dr. Nelson Bell's legacy through the \nministry of the Ruth and Billy Graham Children's Health Center where \nthe children of western North Carolina and the surrounding area receive \nspecial medical care that was unavailable before the advent of the \nGraham Children's Health Center. Moreover, the Grahams, through their \nvarious ministries, have extended their love and their caring by \nextending their loving and helping hands to the victims of disasters, \nthe medical needy, and the disadvantaged.\n  Mr. President, it is fitting and proper, I think, for the U.S. \nCongress to honor Billy and Ruth Graham, who if anybody ever has, they \nhave earned not only the respect of the Congress, they have earned the \nkeys to the kingdom.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today Senator Helms and I will \nintroduce legislation that will authorize the Congress to present a \ngold medal to Ruth and Billy Graham in honor of their contributions to \nmankind.\n  The striking of the medal will have no cost to the taxpayer. Most \nimportantly, all of this effort will benefit children in southern \nAppalachia and internationally.\n  Ruth and Billy Graham stand as shining examples of faith, family, \nmorality, and charity. These two great North Carolinians are truly \nservants of the Lord and His work has been further accomplished through \ntheir lifelong efforts.\n  Dr. Graham's crusades have reached 100 million people in person and \nover 2 billion worldwide on television. He is America's most respected \nand admired evangelist. His newspaper columns and books reach legions \nof people in need of spiritual counseling. And, his loving marriage of \n52 years to Ruth Graham is a touching personal achievement.\n  The Ruth and Billy Graham Children's Center, located at Memorial \nMission Hospital in Asheville, NC, is testimony to the difference they \nhave made in lives of others. The center's goal is to improve the \nhealth and well-being of children and to become a new resource for \nending the pain and suffering of children.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to quickly act on this honor for Dr. \nGraham and his wife. The prayers of many deserving children could be \nanswered by this touching tribute to Ruth and Billy Graham.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE:\n  S. 1521. A bill to establish the Nicodemus National Historic Site in \nKansas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n            the nicodemus national historic site act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, time, it is said, is the savior and nemesis \nof history. The savior because it is the very passage of time that \ncreates history. The nemesis because that same passage of time \nobliterates history. Today, in Nicodemus, KS, a community is waging a \nlosing battle against time. To bolster them in that fight, I am \nintroducing legislation that would establish Nicodemus, KS, as a \nnational historic site.\n  Kansas is not the first place that comes to mind when people think of \nthe Civil War and reconstruction, but we Kansans know that Kansas is to \nthe Civil War what Sarajevo was to World War I. Border ruffians, the \nsack of Lawrence, John Brown, and the Pottawatomie massacre are as \nfamiliar to Kansas schoolchildren as Fort Sumter and Gettysburg. The \nguerrilla war that rent bleeding Kansas was the opening skirmish in the \narmed conflict between abolitionist and slaveholder that ended at \nAppomattox.\n  Even less well known is that out of that bitter struggle emerged a \nperiod of hope for the newly emancipated. During the 1870's, Kansas was \nthe scene of a great migration of southern blacks seeking their fortune \nin what some African-American leaders described as \n\n[[Page S315]]\nthe promised land. One of the most important settlements founded during \nthat time was Nicodemus. From sod burrows carved out of the prairie by \nthe original colonists, Nicodemus flourished into a leading center of \nblack culture and society through the turn of the century.\n  Today, a cluster of five buildings is all that remains of that once \nvibrant community. National historic landmark status has not halted the \ngradual decay of this monument to the struggle of African-Americans for \nfreedom and equality. In fact, in its report entitled ``Nicodemus, \nKansas Special Resource Study,'' the National Park Service indicated \nthat ``[i]f Nicodemus is not protected and preserved by a public or \nprivate entity, it seems inevitable that the historic structures will \ncontinue to deteriorate and eventually be razed.'' It was that finding \nthat prompted my legislation granting the town of Nicodemus, KS, \nnational historic site status.\n  It is my hope that colleagues will join me in working to save this \nunique piece of American history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend agricultural programs through 1996, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                            farm legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, farmers, farm suppliers, farm credit \nagencies, and bankers are waiting. They need to know what the farm \nprogram will be in 1996. Every day that they wait for that answer is \nanother day in which they cannot plan or prepare for planting the 1996 \ncrops.\n  They are waiting for Congress to act, because the farm bill that was \nsupposed to be debated and adopted in 1995 has not been debated nor \nadopted.\n  Congress has a responsibility to farmers to tell them what kind of \nfarm program they will be operating under this spring. Farmers should \nnot be the victims of the failure of Congress to enact a 5-year farm \nprogram. It was not their fault that a farm bill didn't get enacted on \na timely basis.\n  We are rapidly running out of time. I would prefer a full 5-year farm \nbill that provides some fundamental reform to our current farm \npolicies. I believe in providing a solid safety net for our Nation's \nfamily farmers, and making preservation and enhancement of our Nation's \nfamily farm system as the primary goal of our Nation's farm policy.\n  But we have not had a real opportunity to debate a multiyear farm \nbill. Nor have we had full and open hearings and committee meetings in \nwhich our Nation's farmers could effectively participate in the shaping \nof a farm bill. That should have been done last year, but it wasn't.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to provide a 1-year extension of \nthe farm bill. I am pleased Senators Daschle and Conrad have joined as \ncosponsors. This is not a perfect solution--but I hope it will get the \nball rolling. Farmers deserve an answer about what the farm bill will \nbe.\n  This bill extends our current farm law, including the Food for \nProgress program, conservation programs, and commodity programs for the \n1996 crop year.\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n  In addition, it provides the full flexibility that our producers have \nrequested for permitted crops. The need for flexibility has been a \ncommon feature in almost all of the farm legislation that has been \nintroduced and discussed this past year.\n  There is no reason why we shouldn't provide that flexibility this \ncrop year, especially in recognition of the higher market prices that \nwe are currently experiencing. This will allow producers to respond to \nthe market signals, while maintaining the loan programs and the basic \nsafety net available to them.\n  It also provides for forgiveness of advanced deficiency payments \nrelated to disaster and prevented planting situations. We need to \nrecognize that the improved market prices do little for those producers \nwho had short crops as a result of cropping problems this past year.\n  My purpose in introducing the bill today is simply to provide a \nvehicle for Congress to move rapidly to respond to the needs of farmers \nas they finalize their planning for this crop year.\n  I believe a 1-year extension should provide adequate time for \nCongress to get the farm bill job done. The delay in farm legislation \nhas already been long enough. We should not delay it further.\n  If, instead of extending the current farm bill, we can on an \nexpedited basis, debate and pass a new 5-year farm bill, then I'm all \nfor it. But we shouldn't delay any longer. One way or another we should \ngive farmers some certainty about the future farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I listened with interest to my colleague from Iowa. He \nis someone for whom I have substantial respect. The Senator from Iowa \nand I, in fact, are co-chairing one of the few bipartisan groups that \nexist in the Congress, and I am delighted to be doing that. I think he \nhas a vast reservoir of knowledge on agriculture, and I have great \nrespect for him.\n  I must say I disagree with some of what he just said. I disagree with \nthe characterization of part of this debate. In fact I have sought the \nfloor today for the specific purpose of introducing an extension for 1 \nyear of the current farm bill. I will do that following this \ndiscussion.\n  I would extend the current farm bill for 1 year and make some \nmodifications to it so that we would provide substantial planting \nflexibility. This is one of the features that the Senator from Iowa \nmentioned in the other legislation that was considered last year. I \nthink there should be substantial flexibility with respect to any farm \nprogram, including the current farm program if it is extended for a \nyear.\n  We need to give farmers the opportunity to decide what to plant, \nwhere to plant, and when to plant on base acres. My proposal to extend \nthe current farm bill for 1 year would provide substantial additional \nflexibility in planting decisions for family farmers.\n  I would also propose that we provide a forgiveness for the advanced \ndeficiency payments for those farmers that suffered crop losses. That \nis also in the legislation that I offer.\n  The reason I offer this legislation today is not because I think it \nis necessarily the best choice nor it is my first choice for farm \nlegislation. I hope to get the ball rolling here in the Congress to do \nsomething that gives farmers some certainty.\n  It is now the end of January 1996. A 5-year farm bill should have \nbeen agreed to last year. The Senator from Iowa mentioned, and he is \nabsolutely correct, that the Congress had some hearings, and so on, and \npassed a bill. But Congress passing a bill with a majority of the votes \nin the House and the Senate is just a series of steps on a long \nstairway by which legislation becomes law.\n  That farm legislation was put in the budget reconciliation bill that \neverybody by last July knew was going to be vetoed. So the exercise to \nput their farm bill, called the Freedom to Farm Act, in the budget \nreconciliation bill that everybody knew was going to be vetoed puts us \nin a position in January of not having farm legislation today.\n  Again, I respect the notion that it is ``his side'' and ``your side'' \nand ``our side'' and ``he said'' and ``she said.'' But the fact is, \nregardless of what happened last year, we end up in January in a \nsituation in which farmers do not know under what conditions they will \nplant this year. The people who are selling farm machinery do not know \nthe circumstances under which farmers will plant. All the other folks \nwho are concerned about our rural economy do not know what the farm \nbill will be.\n  One way or another, it seems to me the Congress, Republicans and \nDemocrats, need to provide an answer. What is going to happen this year \nwhen farmers go in the field? Under what conditions will they be \nplanting a crop? What will be the support prices?\n  It probably does not matter much to the very largest operators. It \ncertainly does not matter to the largest agrifactories in America. It \ndoes not matter to corporate farms, the big ones. But it does matter a \nlot to a man and wife on a family farm out there who are trying to \nraise a family and who have a very thin financial statement and who, if \nthey come into a year of low market prices, have no price supports. It \nis not simply a matter of inconvenience. For them it is bankruptcy. It \nmatters to them.\n  It does not matter to the big operators. They can get by. They can \nget by a year or two or three. It is the family farmer out there \nstruggling from year to year, just one bad crop away from losing their \nfarm. That is who is deeply concerned with this matter.\n  Now, what should we do? Well, I'll tell you my first choice. My first \nchoice is for all of us to get together and come up with the best \npossible series of ideas that all of us have.\n  There should not be anyone in this Chamber who in a meeting between \nall of us would not agree that farmers ought to have much more \nflexibility in planting decisions than they now have. All of us agree \non that. So that is one step. Let us agree on that.\n  There are a number of other steps that we could agree on that would \nrepresent the elements of a new farm plan. But I will tell you one area \nwhere we will not agree. That is an area where we say that what we want \nto do is to build a stairway to Heaven. And, Heaven is described as a \ncircumstance where after 7 years there is no safety net for family \nfarms. That stairway to Heaven is not going to happen. It is a \ndefinition of Heaven I do not accept.\n  If you pull the rug out from under family farmers after 7 years there \nis no heavenly rescue. There is no real safety net. I am sorry but the \nfact is I wish to see yard lights in rural America. The only way family \nfarm operators will be able to make it is if we have a real safety net \nwhen bad years come and international prices drop down and stay down. \nThe only way we will retain a network of family farmers in this country \nis if we have that safety net.\n  Some say it does not matter who farms. If it really does not matter \nwho farms, then the agrifactories will farm America from California to \nMaine. Then we will see what the price of food is. But it does matter \nfor a whole series of social and economic reasons that we retain a \nnetwork of family farms in this country's future.\n  How we do that? Well, we do that by writing a farm program. Have we \nhad a very good farm program in the past? No, I do not think so. It is \nnot the kind of farm program I would have written. But we are required \nto write a new 5-year farm plan.\n  The farm plan that was offered last year was put into the budget \nreconciliation bill. Incidentally, that is the first time this has ever \nhappened. I think the Senator would concur with that. We have not \npreviously taken a farm bill and said, ``Oh, by the way, let's dump it \ninto a reconciliation bill and let it travel along on that train.''\n  That has never happened before. We have always done a farm bill in a \nseparate debate, and then we moved it to the President and he signed it \nand we had farm legislation. But last year was different. It was put in \na bill that everybody by June or July knew was going to be vetoed, and \nso it was vetoed, and we end up now at the end of January without a \nfarm plan.\n  My first choice would be for all of us to get together and hammer out \nsome compromise and say let us get the best of all ideas here and \nconstruct a farm plan that really does work for family farms.\n  If we cannot do that, in my judgment, why mess around at all? Our \ngoal should be to try to help family farmers make a decent living when \ninternational grain prices collapse and stay down. if we cannot help \nthem in those circumstances, I say get rid of the whole thing. \n\n[[Page S317]]\n\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture was developed and started under \nAbraham Lincoln with nine employees--nine. Well, it has grown to be a \nbehemoth organization, as all of us know, involved in the lives of \nfarmers in some positive ways and in other ways in a negative way.\n  If we cannot construct new farm legislation that tries to provide a \nsafety net for family-sized farms, get rid of it all. Shut down USDA. \nGet rid of the Secretary. Get rid of all the apparatus. Get rid of the \nprogram. I am not interested in developing a set of golden arches for \nthe largest agrifactories in this country. They hold no interest for \nme. They are big enough to manage on their own. They can have their own \ncelebrations when they make a profit. They can compete on their own in \nthe international marketplace.\n  It is mom and pop out there on the family farm that cannot make it \nwhen international prices drop and stay down. They are the ones who \nlose their dream. All of us have had those calls. I had one not too \nlong ago from a woman who was, with her husband, losing their farm. She \nbegan crying on the phone and saying that for 19 years they have tried \nto make a go of this farm. She said, ``We do not go places on the \nweekend. We do not go out on Saturday night. Our kids wear hand-me-\ndowns.''\n  She said, ``We are not people who spend money just for the sake of \nspending money. We save every dime we can.''\n  ``But,'' she said, ``the fact is we are going to lose our farm, and \nit has been our dream. It is the only thing we have done since we got \nout of high school.''\n  We have all heard those stories from people who are not just losing \ntheir farm, but they are losing their dream. The question now for all \nof us, it seems to me is what can we do? What can we do to help? What \ncan we do to provide a safety net that works for family-sized farmers?\n  My first choice would be for us to find a range of agreement and pass \na new 5-year bill that makes some sense. We would have to do that \nquickly, within a matter of weeks. I am certainly willing to engage in \nthat process and would like to engage in that process. If we cannot do \nthat, my second choice is to extend the current bill 1 year, provide \nsubstantial added flexibility and provide forgiveness of advanced \ndeficiency payments for those who suffered losses. That would give us \ntime. Then farmers could go into the fields to plant knowing under what \nconditions they are planting and knowing the kind of farm program they \nwill have. This would give us time to wrestle again on a new approach \nof how do we construct a 5-year plan that will really work?\n  So I intend to offer today, for myself and a couple of colleagues, an \nextension of 1 year with some modifications, including substantial \nflexibility, and forgiveness of the repayment of advance deficiency \npayments under certain conditions.\n  Is it the best approach? No, not necessarily. Do we need to provide \nsome answers to farmers? You bet your life. It is not just farmers. It \nis everybody out there trying to do business. This Congress needs to \ntake action and take action soon.\n  I hear people say, ``Well, it is so and so's fault. It is somebody \nelse's fault.'' That is not my interest. I am not interested in whose \nfault it is at this point.\n  My interest is how do we solve this problem in the next couple of \nweeks. I think that is what I heard the Senator from Iowa say as well. \nLet us figure out a way to do it for the farmers who live in Iowa and \nthe farmers who live in North Dakota. For the family operators who are \ntrying to make a living, let us figure out a way that we can answer \nthis problem. We are required to do that.\n  It is not satisfactory to say, ``Well, we passed a bill. That is the \nend of our obligation.'' If the bill got vetoed, it is not law. And \nthat is what happened.\n  We do not have a farm bill. We must, it seems to me, struggle now to \nfind a way to create one or to extend the current program in a way that \nwill be helpful to family farms in our country.\n  It is interesting, people ask me from time to time, ``What is a \nfamily farmer? You always talk about family farms. What is a family \nfarmer?'' I always say, ``I don't know what the specific definition of \na family farmer is.'' They asked Michelangelo how he sculpted \n``David.'' ``I took a big piece of marble and chipped away everything \nthat was not David.''\n  I suppose if we just chipped away everything that we thought was not \na family farm, we could come up with a core definition that we could \nprobably all reasonably agree to on what a family farm is. But we do \nnot have enough money for a farm bill to provide unlimited price \nsupports all the way up the range of production. So let us define a \nfamily farm in terms of what we can afford to do to provide a \nreasonable safety net under a certain increment of production. That is \nwhat we attempted to do when we offered something called the Family \nFarm Security Act, and I think it made a lot of sense.\n  Some will say, ``Well, that did not pass the Congress.'' That is \ntrue; it did not. There are often times when good ideas are not \nsuccessful the first time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Farm Security Act is an approach that does say we are \ngoing to retool this farm program so that we are focusing on the people \nwe want to help, the family-sized farm. It would provide a targeted \nmarketing loan with the highest support price for the first increment \nof production. That is exactly what we ought to do, in my judgment. We \nwere not successful in this past year in doing that. Somewhere in the \ncontext of reaching an agreement and in reaching a compromise, I hope \nsome elements of that approach will be considered again.\n  But, most of all, those of us who come from rural States--Republicans \nand Democrats, the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from North Dakota, \nand others,--I think all of us have a responsibility now in the next \ncouple of weeks to urgently press for the Congress and the President to \nanswer the question for family farmers. When they start that tractor up \nand pull that plow out to begin spring's work in not too many weeks, \nunder what farm program will they be plowing and seeding and \nharvesting?\n  It is pretty frustrating for people whose economic lives are on the \nline to see all of this rancor and all of this wrangling going on in \nthe Congress when all they want are simple answers.\n  Tonight the President is going to give his State of the Union \nAddress. Someone asked me today, a press person asked me, what do I \nthink the President will say or should say? I said one of the things I \nhope he addresses, and I think he probably will, is this past year of \n1995 when we have seen some of the most truculent, difficult debate \nresulting in policies that just defy all common sense, of shutdowns and \nthreatened defaults and gridlock. I hope the message from everyone who \nwill speak tonight, the President, who gives the State of the Union \nAddress, and Democrats and Republicans who react to that address, will \nbe it is time to have a New Year's resolution that all of us stop \nshouting and start listening. It is time we decide no one sent us here \nto advance the economic or political interests of the political party \nwe belong to. They sent us here to advance the interests of this \ncountry.\n  This is a wonderful country with boundless opportunity and whose best \ndays are still ahead of us, if we in this Congress can decide to do \nthings that are positive for this country. That means a little less \nfeuding and a lot more cooperation. I hope that is part of the speech \ntonight. I hope it will be. I hope the reaction to that is positive.\n  Part of that reaction, in my judgment, could be a reaction, even on \nagriculture and, yes, even on the farm bill, to decide what separates \nus is a lot less important than what unites us. What unites us in every \nState that we represent as farm legislators are families out there \nstruggling against the odds to plant a seed that they do not know will \ngrow into a crop. If they do get the seed to grow, they do not know \nwhat the price will be or if there will be a price to cover their \ncosts.\n  Those twin risks are economic risks that can literally kill the dream \nof family farmers, and literally does kill that dream in tens of \nthousands of cases every single year. That is what we need to care \nabout. That is the root and genesis of this debate about farm policy.\n  I know a lot of people do not think much about it and do not care \nmuch about farm policy. They think milk \n\n[[Page S318]]\ncomes from Safeway and butter comes from a carton and pasta comes \ninside cellophane. But it does come from cows and it comes from a wheat \nfield and it comes from seeds and sweat. It comes from farmers \nbreathing the diesel fumes as they plant and harvest.\n  This is a lot more important than just theory. This is an economic \nimperative in rural America that is important to many of us. I hope we \ncan find reason to cooperate. I hope, as my colleagues will look at \nthis piece of legislation, they will consider it. If not the extension \nof the current program, then let us consider something else that we can \nagree on that will advance the economic interests of farmers.\n  I do not share the notion that this in any way jeopardizes anybody's \nbaseline. If it did, I would not be offering it. I am talking about the \nbudget baseline, which my colleague will probably speak more about.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nattention and for staying. Again, I look forward to the cooperation \nthat we have had on many rural issues. I hope we can cooperate on this \nissue as the weeks unfold.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the President. I thank my colleague from North \nDakota for his excellent presentation on why it is critically important \nthat we have a farm bill and that we have a set of rules that our \nfarmers know will be in place as they enter into the next crop year.\n  Let me say that I believe the Senator from North Dakota has \nintroduced something, that while not perfect, is something we are going \nto have to do in terms of extending the current farm bill so that \nfarmers at least know what the rules of the road are going to be for \nthis next crop year. There has been an absolute failure by this \nCongress to pass farm legislation that could become law.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that my colleague has introduced would \ndramatically increase the flexibility that farmers have and \ndramatically improve the competitive position of American farmers. I \nthink that is in everyone's interest.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa is correct when he says that we need to \nknow what farmers can expect. Farmers are right now sitting around \ntheir kitchen tables trying to figure out what their strategy for this \nnext year should be, and much is at stake. Their families' livelihoods \nare at stake. What money the family is going to have for the next year \nis at stake. Whether or not that farm family is going to be able to \nmeet their bills is at stake. The health of rural economies is at \nstake. What happens on the Main Streets of every city and town in the \nheartland of America is at stake.\n  The economic health of an industry that, along with airplanes, is the \nbiggest producer of a trade surplus for America is at stake. An \nindustry that is one of America's very biggest is at stake. Our \ncompetitive position in the world is at stake.\n  There is a lot riding on this debate and this discussion. The Senator \nfrom Iowa is right: We need a plan. Let me say what we do not need is \nthe plan that the Republican Party has advanced in both the House and \nthe Senate. The Republican proposal was for deep and Draconian cuts in \nfarm programs that would dramatically reduce farm income. That has been \ntheir plan. Repeatedly Republicans have called for phasing out farm \nprograms, for eliminating that support mechanism that has been the \ngenius of American farm policy.\n  Mr. President, I believe that represents unilateral disarmament when \nwe are in the midst of a fierce trade fight with other countries who \nrecognize the importance of maintaining their competitive position in \nagriculture. The last thing we would do in a military confrontation is \nto engage in unilateral disarmament. Why we would ever do it in a trade \nfight is beyond me.\n  Make no mistake, we are in a trade fight in agriculture. Europe, \nwhich is our biggest competition, is spending three to four times as \nmuch as we are spending to support their agricultural producers.\n  Let me repeat that. Europe, our chief competitors, are spending three \nto four times as much as we are spending supporting their producers. \nWhy? Because they understand the critical importance of agriculture to \nthe economic health of their countries, and they do not intend to lose \nthis trade battle. They intend to fight it. They intend to win it, and \nthey think the United States is going to cave in. They think the United \nStates is ready to roll over. They think the United States is ready to \nthrow in the towel.\n\n  I have spent hours and hours with the chief trade negotiators for the \nEuropeans, and they have done everything but draw me a picture of what \ntheir long-term strategy is. They believe the United States is losing \nits resolve to fight for agricultural markets, and they are going to \nwin them the old-fashioned way. They are going to go out and buy them, \nand that is precisely what is happening. We would be fools to allow \nthem to win this battle and see tens of thousands of jobs leave this \ncountry because we are not willing to fight.\n  Mr. President, let us recall what has happened with respect to farm \npolicy this year. On the House side, they had a proposal they called \n``Freedom to Farm.'' Most of us would consider it ``Freedom from \nFarming,'' because if that thing was ever put in place, there would be \na whole lot of farmers forced off the land in very short order. It is \nnot ``Freedom to Farm,'' it is ``Freedom from Farming.'' Others have \ncalled it ``Welcome to Welfare,'' because what it did was to say that \nno matter what prices are, farmers would get a payment from the Federal \nGovernment for the next 7 years, and then we would wash our hands of \nfarm producers in this country.\n  That proposal was so radical, it suggested we eliminate the \nunderlying authority passed in 1938 and 1949 to even have farm \nlegislation. That is how radical and how extreme the proposal was on \nthe House side. They could not even get that proposal through the House \nAgriculture Committee, although it was authored by and offered by the \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee. They could not even get it \nthrough the relevant committee on the House side. Mr. President, that \nis how flawed that proposal was.\n  On the Senate side, they authored legislation that went through the \nSenate Agriculture Committee on a straight party-line vote after very \nlittle debate and very little discussion. Frankly, our colleagues on \nthe other side did not want much debate, did not want much discussion, \nbecause they knew that policy was an invitation to liquidation. It \nwould have cut farm support 60 percent in real terms in the seventh \nyear of that proposal. I can just say, for my State, that would have \nrepresented an unmitigated disaster.\n  Interestingly enough, in the Senate, they did not even offer the \nHouse ``Freedom to Farm'' proposal for a vote. They did not even offer \nit for a vote, because they knew it would not enjoy much in the way of \nsupport, even in the Senate Agriculture Committee. So, then what \nhappened, they came out on the floor and they stuck the farm \nlegislation in the reconciliation bill.\n  What does that mean, ``reconciliation''? It is confusing to people. \nThat is where all of the programs are put together in order to meet the \nbudget resolution requirements, and you do not have a separate \ndiscussion and debate on the bill itself. It is wrapped into a piece of \nlegislation that contains many other issues.\n  They did that because they knew they could not pass their farm \nlegislation on its own. Typically, the way we have handled farm \nlegislation is to have a separate bill and a debate and a discussion on \nthat bill and a vote on that bill. They did not want to do it that way. \nThey wanted to wrap it in another package and vote on an entire \npackage, with agriculture being just a small part of it, because they \ndid not want people to be paying very much attention to what that farm \npolicy represented, that was contained in that legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, that reconciliation bill was vetoed by the President \nof the United States. There were many reasons for his veto. There were \nmany elements of that legislation, apart from farm legislation, that \ncalled for a veto. But part of the reason he vetoed it was the farm \nproposals, which the President saw as radical and extreme and as going \ntoo far and of putting the United \n\n[[Page S319]]\nStates at risk of losing the significant advantages it has had in \ncompeting for world agriculture markets.\n  The President of the United States was called on by farmers all \nacross this country to veto that reconciliation bill, and veto it he \ndid. I am proud the President did veto that bill, for reasons other \nthan the farm legislation, but the farm legislation alone would have \nbeen enough for me.\n  I joined those farmers in asking the President to veto that bill. It \nwas terrible policy. It represented unilateral disarmament in this \nworld trade battle, a battle for markets that are critically important \nto the economic future of this country. It is not just the economic \nfuture of America that was at stake, not just our trade situation that \nwas at stake. It was the lives of literally thousands of American \nfarmers at stake.\n  Very often when I go home to North Dakota, I go to farm families and \nsit around the kitchen table and talk about the future of agriculture \npolicy and what it means to that family. Over and over this year, farm \nfamilies have told me, if the policy that is being voted on in \nWashington, that which was offered by our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, ever became law, they would be finished, they would be \nout, they would be forced off the land.\n  I think the best estimate in my State is that we would lose a third \nof the farmers if that bill ever became law. That is not in the \ninterest of family farmers. That is not in the interest of the economic \nhealth of my State. More broadly, I do not think it is in the economic \ninterest of the country.\n  So I urge my colleagues to closely consider the course my colleague \nfrom North Dakota has proposed. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this summary action would not conflict \nwith the goals of the two Senators from North Dakota who have just \nspoken, but is to point out where we are.\n  If, in fact, we have a year extension of the present farm bill, a \ncouple things for certain will happen. First, immediately farmers will \nhave to pay out of their cash flow last year's advance deficiency \npayment, because grain prices are higher now, at a time when some \nfarmers did not get any crops and do not have that capability. If you \nhave a 1-year extension, as opposed to the Freedom to Farm Act, money \nthat would have gone from the Federal Treasury to the farm economy \nabsolutely will not go.\n  So I do not quite understand why people on the other side of the \naisle say that the ``Freedom to Farm'' agriculture bill is a sure, \ncertain way to kill off the family farmers when their 1-year extension \nputs no money into agriculture whatsoever and the Freedom to Farm Act \nwould.\n  What we get with the Freedom to Farm Act is certainty. We know in the \nbill that the President vetoed, albeit less money than has been spent \non agriculture over a long period of time, we know the certainty of \n$43.5 billion in agriculture programs over the next 7 years. That is $6 \nbillion to $7 billion for 1996 that would go into agriculture that \nunder the Democratic proposal that we have been talking about here in \nthe last hour would not be going to agriculture.\n  That $6 to $7 billion next year, because of moving toward the \nmarketplace for income from agriculture, will gradually decline \nprobably to $4 billion in the year 2002. But we know right now in the \nbill that the President vetoed that there would be $43.5 billion going \ninto agriculture. We know that it would be under contract to the \nindividual farmers, and because of that contractual obligation, the \nsame as the annual payment that goes for the Conservation Reserve \nProgram being honored by subsequent budget decisions made by Congress, \nwill not be changed. That $43.5 billion is a sure thing.\n  Would my colleagues who promote a simple 1-year extension of the \nexisting farm bill say that that 1-year extension brings certainty to \nagriculture? They are proposing something good for agriculture as \nopposed to what we Republicans propose of $43.5 billion for certain to \ngo into agriculture? That is what the President of the United States \nvetoed.\n  The other thing is, as we delay making decisions for agriculture with \na 1-year extension, we are going to be delaying it until 1997. If you \nhave a 2-year extension, you are going to be delaying it to 1998. The \nway the Congressional Budget Office scores anything in the budget, and \nas you apply that to agriculture, we could be losing baseline \nflexibility to do something for agriculture in the near future. We have \nalready lost $8 billion just because the President vetoed the farm \nbill. It is proposed by the House Agriculture Committee that if we have \na 1-year extension, we could lose another $6 billion from the baseline.\n\n  Now, for people on the other side of the aisle that want a 1-year \nextension of the farm bill, how can you say that you are helping \nagriculture if you are gradually chipping away at the baseline, the \nfiscal baseline for agriculture in our budget? You say you are a friend \nof agriculture, and you want to do that? That would not sell in my \nState to the very same farmers that my friends from North Dakota say \nthat they talked to in the coffee shops.\n  The other is a simple extension of the 1995 farm bill for 1 or 2 \nyears, which denies the reality of the international trade situation, \nthe environment of the new GATT agreement, which this Congress approved \na year ago. The GATT agreement is freeing up trade in agriculture and \nother commodities so that we are going to have a much more free-trading \nenvironment and an agriculture that tends to take more in 1999, 2000, \n2001, 2002 than in the early years of the GATT agreement. But we are \nmoving to a point where, by freeing up trade in agriculture, farmers \nare going to be able to get more money from the marketplace and less \nfrom the Federal Treasury. Where I come from, that is what the farmers \nwant. They want to be able to compete. They know that with our \nefficiency in agriculture, we can compete, we will compete, and the \nprovisions of the Freedom to Farm Act, besides nailing down $43.5 \nbillion from this transition from a Government-regulated agriculture to \na free market agriculture, where we can compete in the world market, it \nalso has the flexibility for the farmers to plant according to the \nmarketplace, not according to the political decisions made here in \nWashington. That means that they are going to be able to plant the \nnumber of acres of corn or soybeans--those are the two prominent crops \nin my State--that fit the marketplace, the realities of the \nmarketplace, not decisions that are made in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture downtown by bureaucrats, who are removed from the realities \nof the marketplace that end up having farmers plant according to the \nhistorical bases that there are for corn and other crops on their \nrespective farms.\n  What a way to make a decision in agriculture. Is that better than the \nmarket planting decision that can respond to the marketplace, a \nplanting decision that fits into the reality of the freeing up of \ninternational trade, where our farmers can compete very well with any \nforeign competition?\n  The first thing is the $43.5 billion. The second is flexibility to \nplant according to the marketplace. The third point is that we will no \nlonger be setting aside our productive capacity that we have and \nletting acres of rich farmland lay idle from year to year. We are going \nto allow every acre to be planted so that we send a signal to all of \nour competitors around the world that we know there is a growing world \ndemand for exports out there. We are going to compete in that, and we \nare going to produce to maximum to fill the demand of the marketplace. \nWe are going to do that in a way that is not going to encourage any of \nthe farmers of any of the countries of the world where productivity is \nnot quite as good as ours to plow up their marginal farmlands and put \nit into productivity because they know we are taking some of our land \nout of production.\n  If there is anything about the freedom to farm proposal, it is the \nabsolute certainty that is there. If there is anything about a 1- or 2-\nyear extension of the present farm bill, it is the uncertainty over the \nperiod of transition to the free market and the new GATT environment in \ntrade. Second, it is going to take, for certain, money from the farmers \nof America at the very same time that some of our colleagues are \npleading the financial plight of those very same farmers. \n\n[[Page S320]]\n\n\n  So I think common sense dictates giving the farmers as much certainty \nas you can. They get that with freedom to farm. And it is absolutely \nnot a part of a 1-year extension of the present farm bill.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, would you advise me of the present status of \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am a Senator who has been close to \nagriculture for a long time. I want to speak with regard to the remarks \nmade preceding my statement by my farm State colleague from the State \nof North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and likewise, my farm State Senator \nnext door, Chuck Grassley, who both are Senators I have worked with for \na long time on farm policy.\n  I think we have an awful lot to do in this particular area. The most \nsignificant concern that I have in this regard, Mr. President, is the \nfact that here we are dilly-dallying on a farm program, and the farmers \nacross the United States of America are justifiably concerned. Many in \nthe South are beginning to plant now. The grain crop farmers in \nNebraska and the rest of the major grain-producing States are now \npreparing to plant. They are trying to work out their financial needs \nwith their bankers. They are totally at a loss and do not know what we \nare going to do.\n  I suggest that never before in history have we been so late in \ndeciding what a farm program is going to be in the year that the crop \nis going to be planted. That has to stop. I do not know how to end this \nimpasse that we have but the impasse must be broken for the good of the \nfood producers of the United States of America.\n  I happen to feel that probably the best way to resolve this matter in \nan expeditious fashion, if we could reach an agreement between the two \nleaders in the Senate to bring up a freestanding farm bill with some \nkind of restrained debate, something to move things along and then have \nan up-or-down vote. That would be one way to solve the problem and let \nthe Senate work its will. Whether that is possible or not I do not know \nat this juncture, but I know that is one of the suggestions that are \nbeing mulled over.\n  The initiative by the Senator from North Dakota today to essentially \nextend the present farm program for 1 year is not the best of all \nworlds but it is a whole lot better than no action whatever.\n  I must say that I have studied with great interest the so-called \nFreedom to Farm Act and I understand that the sponsors of that measure \nover on the House side, as the House has the penchant for these days is \nto say, ``Do it our way or we will not do it at all.'' That is not the \nway which you handle farm policy or the way we should handle the \nbudget. Certainly, we have 435 Members of the House of Representatives \nand 100 of us here in the U.S. Senate. We have an obligation to work \nour will, using the procedures that are in place in both bodies, and we \ncannot have some people, one, two, or three individuals, say ``Doing it \nmy way is the only way, and I will not do anything unless you do it my \nway.''\n  It is not the way to get things done or accomplish anything in a body \nwhere you have 435 over there and 100 of us over here, 535 all strongly \nwilled individuals with their own ideas. I suppose it would be self-\nserving to say, Mr. President, that maybe I should say 534 because the \nChair and everybody in the Senate knows this Senator from Nebraska is \nnot a strong-willed individual. I set myself apart from all of the \nother Members.\n  With that facetious statement, I come back to the core issue here, \nand that is we have got to move. I cannot support the so-called Freedom \nto Farm Act in its present form. Certainly, the Freedom to Farm Act \neliminates a great deal of the red tape. It gives the farmers what I \nlike to see them have and what they want. That is to make decisions on \ntheir own about where they plant and how they plant it.\n  That concept is also basically included in a measure that was \nintroduced by the minority leader, Senator Daschle, another farm State \nsenator, myself, and my colleague, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and \nothers, known as the Democratic farm bill. It also incorporates all of \nthose good features of allowing more flexibility on the part of the \nindividual farmer, eliminates a lot of the redtape but does not go as \nfar into what I think is making the farm program a welfare program, as \nI am very fearful the Freedom to Farm Act would eventually encounter.\n  Let me cite an example, and I will ask at the appropriate time that \nthe facts be printed in the Record. As a farm State Senator who \nrecognizes that our prediction of many of our farmers today, especially \nthose with limited acres on which they farm, continue to be in dire \nstraits, I also cite today the fact that the cattle-producing industry \nis in deep, deep trouble today. While the Farm Act today or any of the \nFarm Acts we are talking about is not going to provide any relief \nbasically for the cattle producer, they are part of the important food \nchain. I simply cite this as a fact. They are in deep, deep trouble \ntoday because of the steady decline in the cattle at all levels.\n  Coming back to the Freedom to Farm Act, I think that the main \ncriticism I have of that act--and once the farmers of the United States \nfully understand it, I think that they would come out resoundingly \nagainst it because in essence it would turn the farm program into a \nwelfare program which is something that they do not want. To say that, \nMr. President, and having said that I am a farm State Senator, have \nfought for good farm programs for a long, long time, I recognize they \ncost some money but I also recognize that the American public today \nspend less of their disposable income for food of any industrialized \nnation in the world. Food is a bargain primarily because of the good \nwork, the production ability and the genius production of our family \nfarmers going to make good food, clean food at more than affordable \nprices.\n\n  However, if we decouple completely the farm program from the \nmarketplace we are marching down a road that I think farmers and the \nfood industry eventually would come to recognize is a big mistake.\n  The welfare provisions in the so-called Freedom to Farm Act we all \nshould know about, and I cite a typical example which is very accurate. \nUnder the Freedom to Farm Act, which is a step down to phasing out the \nprogram in total in 7 years, as I understand it, we will take a typical \nfarm and talk about typical farm, typical numbers. The facts of the \nmatter are that as I indicated, the livestock industry, the beef \nindustry in particular, the pork industry as well, are in deep, deep \nproblems these days. If you go along with the Freedom to Farm Act, that \nwill not be necessarily true of the row crop producers.\n  I cite, for example, if the Freedom to Farm Act became a reality and \nif we took, Mr. President, a 500-acre corn farm which is not a \nparticularly big farm, not particularly little farm, but use that as an \nexample, and if that individual farmer planted his 500 acres to corn, \nunder the Freedom to Farm Act, and if that 500-acre farm produces 120-\nbushel yield, and if the price for corn were, for example, $3.10 a \nbushel, 500 acres, 120-bushel yield, and a cash price of $3.10, you \nmultiply 500 by 120 bushels and come up with 60,000 bushels. And 60,000 \nbushels at $3.10 cash price produces $186,000 gross cash income. Not \nnet, but gross cash income. In addition to that figure under the \nFreedom to Farm Act that same farmer would get from the Government, he \nwould be paid, sent a check by the Government over and above the \n$186,000 gross for 1996 using 60,000 bushels, he gets a 27-cent \npayment. That is $16,200 in 1996 that typical farm would receive over \nand above the $186,000 gross. In 1997, that goes up to 37 cents a \nbushel for $22,200, which I think could be described as a welfare \npayment. In 1998, it goes up to 40 cents a bushel or a $24,000 welfare \npayment.\n  I simply say that the example that I have used at the cash price of \n$3.10 for corn producing for the farm that I have outlined, $186,000 in \ngross cash income, on top of that the individual farmer would receive \nbasically for doing nothing, or to put it another way, the 500-acre \nfarmer with the ability to produce corn, assume that farmer planted \nnothing, he did not do anything, he just sat \n\n[[Page S321]]\nand watched television all day long. Well, he would not get the \n$186,000 but still under that kind of a scenario that farmer who \nplanted nothing and did nothing would receive $16,200 from the Federal \nGovernment in 1996, $22,200 welfare-type payment in 1997, and $24,000 \nin a welfare-type payment in 1998.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the figures I have just \nreferenced be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say that when you look at these kind of facts, I \nthink one would have to conclude that any time you are going to have a \nwelfare payment on top of what I have just outlined here at $3.10 a \nbushel--I would add that even if corn went up to $5 a bushel or $8 a \nbushel, which I suspect it will not, but even if it should--under the \nFreedom to Farm Act, that typical farmer that I just outlined would \nstill receive the $16,000 to $22,000 or $24,000 depending on which year \nand so on down the road, on top of whatever he got from the \nmarketplace. Therefore, there are dangers, because I happen to feel \nthat when this information comes out, and with the stringent budget \nterms we are working under now, it would not be long before somebody \nwould come up and say we are not going to do that anymore. Then some of \nthe farmers who signed on to this program as some kind of a cash \nwindfall would be hurt.\n  We have to have a farm program that gives the farmers some relief \nfrom what the situation is now with regard to the payback that they \nhave to make for their advanced deficiency payments. But I think we can \nget together and work out a reasonable proposal and not one that is \nembodied in what is generally called the Freedom to Farm Act.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            Freedom to Farm\n\n       500 acre corn farm.\n       120 bushel yield.\n       $3.10 cash price.\n       500 acres times 120 bushels equals 60,000 bushels.\n       60,000 bushels times $3.10 cash price equals $186,000 gross \n     cash income.\n       Plus Government Payment (whether they plant or not).\n       1996--60,000 bushels times $.27 payment equals $16,200 \n     welfare payment.\n       1997--60,000 bushels times $.37 payment equals $22,200 \n     welfare payment.\n       1997--60,000 bushels times $.40 payment equals $24,000 \n     welfare payment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S314-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the names of the Senator from Maine \n[Ms. Snowe] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 969, a bill to require that health plans provide \ncoverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother and child following \nthe birth of the child, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1039\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1039, a bill \nto require Congress to specify the source of authority under the United \nStates Constitution for the enactment of laws, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1317\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1317, a bill to repeal the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to enact the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act of 1995, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1364\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kempthorne, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1364, a bill to \nreauthorize and amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the names of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Conrad], the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], and the \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] were added as cosponsors of S. \n1419, a bill to impose sanctions against Nigeria.\n\n\n                                S. 1439\n\n  At the request of Mr. Glenn, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1439, a bill to require \nthe consideration of certain criteria in decisions to relocate \nprofessional sports teams, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1480\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Pell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1480, a bill to \nprovide for the comparable treatment of Federal employees and Members \nof Congress and the President during a period in which there is a \nFederal Government shutdown.\n\n\n                                S. 1519\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns], the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], the Senator \nfrom Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], and the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 1519, a bill to prohibit United States \nvoluntary and assessed contributions to the United Nations if the \nUnited Nations imposes any tax or fee on United States persons or \ncontinues to develop or promote proposals for such taxes or fees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S321-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 210--TO COMMEND THE CORNHUSKERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF \n                                NEBRASKA\n\n  Mr. EXON (for himself and Mr. Kerrey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

This report \nmeets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget \nfor 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough January 10, 1996. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $9.5 billion in budget authority and by $13.3 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $43 million below the revenue floor in 1996 \nand $0.7 billion below the revenue floor over the 5 years 1996-2000. \nThe current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the \nmaximum deficit amount is $258.9 billion, $13.3 billion above the \nmaximum deficit amount for 1996 of $245.6 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated December 19, 1995, Congress cleared and \nthe President signed the ICC Termination Act, Public Law 104-88; the \nSmithsonian Institution Commemorative Coin Act, Public Law 104-96; and \nfurther continuing appropriations, Public Law 104-94. These actions \nchanged the current level of budget authority and outlays.\n  This is my first report for the second session of the 104th Congress.\n  The report follows:\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1996.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, Pete Du Pont, former Member of the \nHouse and former Governor of Delaware, chairs the National Center for \nPolicy Analysis. Recently he had an op-ed piece in the Washington Times \nabout giving prisoners skills and giving them a chance to work which I \nask to be printed in full in the Record.\n  I don't know how this gets worked out, but there really is a need to \nface this problem. And it is a need that should be worked out with \nlabor unions and people who are trying to protect other workers.\n  We hear a great deal about slave labor in China producing things. I \nremember a conversation I had with the late Chief Justice Warren Burger \nin which he said there is another aspect of this. First of all, China \nhas nowhere near the numbers of people in prison that we have in \nprison. But while they are in prison they are required to work and \nproduce things, and it reduces the recidivism rate.\n  Obviously, the restrictions on freedom in China have something to do \nwith the lower prison rate, but many nations with a great deal of \nfreedom have a tiny fraction of our incarceration rate.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the Pete Du Pont article. There are no \nsimple answers but the answer we have now is simplistic and wrong.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        Rules Inhibit Retraining\n\n       Most people would agree that if prisoners learned a skill \n     while they were in jail they could more easily get a job when \n     they got out, and that an ex-prisoner with a job is less \n     likely to commit another crime. Since nearly one-half of \n     people released from prison return to prison within three \n     years, job skills could mean a significant decline in the \n     crime rate.\n       The problem is that most productive prison work--other than \n     food or laundry work within the prison itself--is against the \n     law.\n       In 1936, Congress banned convict labor on federal contracts \n     exceeding $10,000 in value. In 1940, the Ashurst-Sumners Act \n     made it a federal crime to transport convict-made goods in \n     interstate commerce. And many state legislatures have enacted \n     laws to prohibit the sale of convict-made goods within their \n     borders. States like New York compromised and adopted the \n     ``state-use'' system, which permitted convicts to manufacture \n     goods for sale to governmental agencies \n\n[[Page S323]]\n     only, which provides a very limited market for the fruits of convict \n     labor.\n       These statutes were a form of protectionism--to protect \n     providers of goods and services in the free market from \n     having to compete with convict labor. Small businesses and \n     labor unions view such competition as unfair, and have \n     successfully prevented relaxation of the statutes. When \n     Congress tried to change the laws in 1979, the best it could \n     do was allow prisoner work if they are paid the prevailing \n     wage, labor union officials approve, local labor is \n     unaffected, and no local unemployment is produced. These \n     criteria are nearly impossible to meet, so a mere 1,660 \n     prisoners, out of 1 million, were working under these waivers \n     in 1994.\n       It was not always this way. In the last century, prisons \n     earned a major part of their daily cost by leasing convict \n     labor to private employers. In 1885, three-fourths of prison \n     inmates were involved in productive labor, the majority \n     working for private employers under contract and leasing \n     arrangements.\n       By the 1930s only 44 percent worked, and nearly all worked \n     for state industries rather than for private employers. A \n     1990 Census found that only 11 percent of prisoners worked in \n     prison manufacturing or farming, down from 16 percent in \n     1984. If part-time work in laundry and food services is \n     included, only about half of prisoners work.\n       Many prisoners are eager to work, if only to relieve the \n     tedium of prison life. But more important is that the work is \n     good for society in the long run because it reduces crime. A \n     1983-87 Federal Post-Release Employment Project study \n     confirmed that employed prisoners do better than others \n     without jobs. Prisoners who work have fewer disciplinary \n     problems in prison and lower rates of rearrest; they are more \n     likely to get a full-time job; more likely to quit their job \n     in favor of a better-paying job; and less likely to have \n     their supervision revoked for a parole violation or new \n     crime. In the words of Thomas Townsend, president of the \n     Corrections Industry Association, ``It's a matter of public \n     safety; inmates who have worked in prison, and gained new \n     skills have a significantly better chance of not returning to \n     crime and prison.''\n       The only disadvantages of more work opportunities for \n     prisoners are the feared competitive effects on local labor \n     markets. But the government's first responsibility is to \n     citizens, not to narrow interest groups. New production \n     benefits all Americans. It raises the demand for their \n     services and creates new goods for purchase. Competition is \n     the strength of our economic system, not a wrong to be \n     righted, so our policies should be breaking down, not \n     erecting, barriers to work--especially when the work will \n     make the streets safer for the rest of us.\n       Allowing prisoners to work makes sense. Begin by repealing \n     state and federal limitations on inmate pay. Let responsible \n     private businesses competitively bid for the use of prison \n     labor. Let prisons ``profit'' from accepting these contracts. \n     Provide monetary incentives to prisons and their wardens for \n     leading their institutions to self-sufficiency.\n       It won't be easy for the private-sector bidders, because \n     prison labor is not easy to use. Difficulties include \n     security problems, lack of skills and good work habits, \n     remote prison locations, and poor worker productivity. At \n     least at the beginning, the market value of prisoner labor \n     will be very low and the quality of their work poor. But both \n     will improve as skills improve.\n       Across the country a million prisoners are serving time in \n     jail. Each month, 40,000 of them are released under mandatory \n     supervision, on parole, or at the conclusion of their \n     sentences. Our streets would be safer and the crime rate \n     lower if these men had a skill, a job, and the beginning of a \n     future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S322-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REV. WAYNE SMITH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rev. Wayne B. \nSmith, a man who has served his church, and central Kentucky, for more \nthan 40 years. Reverend Smith is retiring as senior minister of \nSouthland Christian Church in Lexington, which has the area's largest \nProtestant congregation.\n  Reverend Smith was 27 years old when he became Southland's founding \npastor in 1956. Forty years later he is the only senior minister the \nchurch has had and is now one of the most well-known ministers in \ncentral Kentucky. Southland Christian has flourished under Reverend \nSmith, who has a congregation of more than 3,800 plus 50,000 on TV and \nradio. Known for his sense of humor, Reverend Smith is often referred \nto as ``the Bob Hope of the ministry.''\n  Reverend Smith has been named 1 of the 13 most influential people in \nLexington. He served two terms as president of the Lexington \nMinisterial Association and is a past president of the North American \nChristian Convention. He is also the charter president of the Lexington \nBluegrass Breakfast Lions Club.\n  Many of Reverend Smith's friends and colleagues have praised him for \nhis humility and his many acts of kindness. Upon his announcement of \nretirement to the congregation, one Southland member said, ``It won't \nbe the same. He is one of those people who you don't replace. There \nwere several people, including me, who had tears in their eyes.''\n  At a farewell ceremony for Reverend Smith, which attracted a crowd of \napproximately 7,000, his friends gave testimonial after testimonial \npraising him for being a great servant of the Lord. In his resignation \nletter, Smith addressed his congregation saying, ``You have been a \nwonderful flock; but also * * * my friends. We have never, for even a \nmoment, felt unloved.''\n  Reverend Smith and his wife Marjorie have two daughters and five \ngrandchildren. Although he is retiring, Reverend Smith won't be able to \nrest for long as his future plans include speaking engagements and \nrevival meetings across the country.\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay special tribute to Rev. Wayne B. \nSmith for his dedicated service to his church, his family, and his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S323-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S323-S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING AARON FEUERSTEIN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, after the devastation of a mill fire \nin Methuen, MA, threatened the community and 2,400 workers who depended \non it, Aaron Feuerstein could have turned his back on his employees and \nclosed the factory or moved it out of State. But he chose to stay. He \nchose to help, and to give something back to those who worked for him. \nHe offered to pay everyone, and he even gave his employees their \nChristmas bonuses, will pay their health care premiums for 90 days, and \nis working to open the factory again as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, Aaron Feuerstein's extraordinary generosity during \nthis holiday season has moved Massachusetts and the Nation, and made \nall of us believe again in the power of community and the real spirit \nof America. What he has done to help so many families will never be \nforgotten, and I know that my colleagues in the Senate join me in \ncongratulating him for setting an example of loyalty, leadership, and \ncompassion which is too often lacking in contemporary American society.\n  He has shown us what true success in business is all about, and what \nour economy is all about. It's about helping people and families to \nprosper and to grow together--build together and work together toward a \ncommon goal.\n  The news reports of the reactions of Aaron's workers to his \ngenerosity are heartwarming; and the warm response of his loyal \nemployees is a tribute to him and should be the greatest holiday gift \nanyone could receive.\n  Mr. President, Aaron Feuerstein has earned a special place in our \nhearts, and has set a new standard for American corporate leadership.\n  I have joined with the distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Massachusetts congressional delegation in \npledging to do what we can, at the Federal level, to help this factory \nand community recover from this catastrophic fire, and I know that my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join me in congratulating Aaron for \nshowing America that loyalty is an essential ingredient not only in \nbusiness but in the life of a community.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a recent editorial from the Boston Globe by \nDavid Nyhan about the generosity of Aaron Feuerstein be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                     The Mensch Who Saved Christmas\n\n                            (By David Nyhan)\n\n       Were it not for the 45-mile-an-hour winds ripping out of \n     the Northwest, the sparks that they carried and the \n     destruction they wrought, Aaron Feuerstein today would be \n     just another rich guy who owned a one-time factory, in a \n     country full of the same.\n       But the fire that destroyed New England's largest textile \n     operation Monday has turned this 70-year-old businessman into \n     a folk hero. If a slim, determined, devoutly-Jewish textile \n     manufacturer can be Santa Claus, then Feuerstein is, to 2,400 \n     workers whose jobs were jeopardized by the fire.\n       The flames, so intense and widespread that the smoke plume \n     appeared in garish color on TV weathermen's radar maps, \n     presented Feuerstein with a stark choice: Should he rebuild, \n     or take the insurance money and bag it?\n       Aaron Feuerstein is keeping the paychecks coming, as best \n     he can, for as long as possible, while he rushes to rebuild, \n     and restore the jobs a whole valley-full of families depend \n     upon.\n       Everybody got paid this week. Everybody got their Christmas \n     bonus. Everybody will get paid at least another month. And \n     Feuerstein will see what he can do after \n\n[[Page S324]]\n     that. But the greatest news of all is that he will rebuild the factory.\n       The man has a biblical approach to the complexities of \n     late-20th-century economics, capsulated by a Jewish precept:\n       ``When all is moral chaos, this is the time for you to be a \n     mensch.''\n       In Yiddish, a mensch is someone who does the right thing. \n     The Aaron Feuerstein thing. The chaos was not moral but \n     physical in the conflagration that began with an explosion \n     and soon engulfed the four-building Malden Mills complex in \n     Methuen, injuring two dozen workers, a half-dozen firemen and \n     threatening nearby houses along the Merrimack River site.\n       The destruction was near-absolute. It is still inexplicable \n     how no one perished in a fast-moving firestorm that lit up \n     the sky. This was one of New England's handful of \n     manufacturing success stories, a plant that emerged from \n     bankruptcy 14 years ago. The company manufactures a trademark \n     fabric, Polartec fleece, used extensively in outdoor clothing \n     and sportswear by outfits such as L. L. Bean and Patagonia.\n       The company was founded by Feuerstein's grandfather in \n     1907, and its history over the century has traced the rise, \n     fall and rise again of textile manufacturing in New England \n     mill towns.\n       Most of the textile makers fled south, leaving hundreds of \n     red brick mausoleums lining the rocky riverbeds that provided \n     the waterpower to turn lathes and looms before electricity \n     came in. The unions that wrested higher wages from flinty \n     Yankee employers were left behind by the companies that went \n     to the Carolinas and elsewhere, to be closer to cotton and \n     farther from unions.\n       The Feuerstein family stuck it out while many others left, \n     taking their jobs and their profits with them. The current \n     boss is one textile magnate who wins high praise from the \n     union officials who deal with him.\n       ``He's a man of his word,'' says Paul Coorey, president of \n     Local 311 of the Union of Needleworkers, Industrial and \n     Textile Employees. ``He's extremely compassionate for \n     people.'' The union's New England chief, Ronald Alman, said: \n     ``He believes in the process of collective bargaining and he \n     believes that if you pay people a fair amount of money, and \n     give them good benefits to take care of their families, they \n     will produce for you.''\n       If there is an award somewhere for a Compassionate \n     Capitalist, this man should qualify, hands-down. Because he \n     is standing up for decent jobs for working people at a time \n     when the vast bulk of America's employer class is chopping, \n     slimming, hollowing-out the payroll.\n       Job loss is the story of America at the end of the century. \n     Wall Street is going like gangbusters, but out on the \n     prairie, and in the old mill towns, and in smalltown America, \n     the story is not of how big your broker's bonus is this \n     Christmas but of how hard it is to keep working.\n       The day after the fire, Bank of Boston announced it will \n     buy BayBanks, a mega-merger of financial titans that will \n     result in the elimination of 2,000 jobs. Polaroid, another \n     big New England employer, announced it would pare its payroll \n     by up to 2,000 jobs. Across the country, millions of jobs \n     have been eliminated in the rush to lighten the corporate \n     sled by tossing overboard anyone who could be considered \n     excess baggage by a Harvard MBA with a calculator for a \n     heart.\n       Aaron Feuerstein, who went from Boston Latin High School \n     and New York's Yeshiva University right into the mill his \n     father owned, sees things differently: The help is part of \n     the enterprise, not just a cost center to be cut.\n       ``They've been with me for a long time. We've been good to \n     each other, and there's a deep realization of that, that is \n     not always expressed, except at times of sorrow.''\n       And it is noble sentiments like those, coming at a time \n     when they are most needed, that turns times of sorrow into \n     occasions of triumph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S323-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S324-S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VICTIMS RESTITUTION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

BOYER\n\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, in the early part of December, the \nNation lost one of the finest public officials it has ever had, Ernest \nL. Boyer, who was a commissioner of education under President Carter \nand head of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\n  I have had the opportunity of working with him on a number of issues. \nHe was a genuinely fine human being and an unusually competent and \ndedicated public servant.\n  Those of us who worked with him know that in addition to everything \nelse, he was simply ``a nice guy.''\n  His loss is a huge loss to the Nation.\n  I was pleased with the editorial comment of the Washington Post which \nI ask to be printed in full in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                            Ernest L. Boyer\n\n       The progress of ``education reform'' is always hard to \n     track: Where are all these ``reforms'' going, and how can we \n     tell when they get there? One of the few voices that helped \n     answer the latter question was that of Ernest L. Boyer, who \n     died last week. Mr. Boyer, head of the Carnegie Foundation \n     for the Advancement of Teaching, had been commissioner of \n     education under President Carter and before that the \n     president of the State University of New York. He was once \n     introduced to a Washington gathering as ``a man who has never \n     had an unpublished thought.''\n       But Mr. Boyer's real contribution, in a debate that tends \n     to be by turns faddish and cacophonous, was not just to be \n     widely heard but to cling tenaciously over the years to a few \n     simple principles. One was that the high school diploma \n     should mean something: Schools, school systems and state \n     legislatures should cease giving graduation credit for \n     shopping-mall-style electives or ``business math'' and insist \n     on solid fare such as four years of English, two of algebra, \n     history in place of ``social studies.''\n       That insistence prevailed in enough places and has been in \n     effect long enough to have produced results, as high schools \n     report toughened standards and a few colleges say students \n     are better prepared. Another strongly held Boyer view was \n     that early childhood education and nutrition made a dramatic \n     difference in children's futures; yet another, that the large \n     schools so popular in the 1960s and 1970s were bad for \n     students who, especially in urban systems and at the critical \n     junior high school level, were suffering already from a lack \n     of adult attention in their lives. ``Too often when students \n     `drop out,' '' he wrote, ``nobody has ever noticed they had \n     `dropped in.' ''\n       These ideas, neither complicated nor trendy, can be all the \n     harder to focus public attention on for their lack of drama. \n     But they need to be stated, and stated over and over as the \n     wave of ``education reform'' launched by the 1983 report \n     called ``A National At Risk'' gets increasingly diffuse and \n     degenerates into political quarreling. More than anything \n     else, education--real education that gets somewhere--implies \n     long and low-key effort, sustained attention to the child at \n     hand. Mr. Boyer was such an educator, whose patience and \n     consistency carried as much influence as the quality of the \n     ideas he put forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S326-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CARMEN AND VINCENT AITRO\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two \nexemplary citizens from the State of Connecticut, Carmen and Vincent \nAitro. These two men, twin brothers, have worked tirelessly to help \ntheir community and to improve the lives of Connecticut's youths. The \nAitro brothers have a long-standing history of dedication to the New \nHaven area community-service organizations.\n  Carmen and Vincent Aitro have used sports to instill positive values \nand principles into the young people they involve. They have directed \nor coached numerous teams and athletic organizations in sports, \nincluding baseball, basketball, and softball. Many of their teams \nexcelled on the field, winning numerous league and State championships. \nThe young people coached by the twins have received invaluable \nbenefits, not just in terms of athletic skills, but also, more \nimportantly, skills and attitudes that will aid and guide them \nthroughout their lives.\n  The Aitro brothers have already been recognized by their community. \nThey have served on the board of directors of many organizations, among \nwhich are the Walter Camp Football Foundation, the New Haven Boys and \nGirls Club Board of Managers, and the Commissioner of the New Haven \nHousing Authority. The honors Carmen and Vincent have accrued are \nnumerous, but include The Dante Club Old Timers Award, the Andy Papero \nBronco League Man of the Year, the Boys Club Alumni Gold Ring Award, \nand the Walter Camp Award.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I believe that these two outstanding \nindividuals should be commended for their many years of service and \ndedication. These are two men who truly made a difference through their \naccomplishments, and their nature of generosity and selflessness will \nlong be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S326-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S326-S327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARTHUR M.

Wood, \nJr., who will be awarded the Institute of Human Relations Award on \nFebruary 20, 1996 by the southwest Florida chapter of the American \nJewish Committee. The award is given annually to a member of the \ncommunity who best exemplifies what the institute stands for--building \nmutual respect and understanding among America's diverse population \ngroups.\n  Arthur M. Wood, Jr. was born in Chicago on October 11, 1950. After \ngrowing up in northern Illinois and southern California, he graduated \nfrom Princeton University with a B.A. degree in \n\n[[Page S327]]\nEnglish in 1972. In 1975, he received his master's degree from \nNorthwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management with a \nconcentration in finance, marketing, and organizational behavior.\n  Art was appointed president of Northern Trust Bank in 1987. Since \nthat time he and his wife Peggy, a former vice president of J. Walter \nThompson Co., helped raise millions of dollars for philanthropies in \nthe Sarasota area.\n  Art's continuous involvement in the community has included \nphilanthropies and civic causes of all sizes and scope. He chairs the \nVan Wezel Foundation and is a former treasurer. He is chairman of New \nCollege Foundation; and a member of the Asolo Center's board of \ndirectors. He is past chairman of the Sarasota Memorial Hospital \nCentury Foundation and the past president of the United Way of \nSarasota. He is chairman of the Out-of-Door Academy and a former board \nmember of Florida West Coast Symphony, the Salvation Army, and the \nEducation Foundation. He was chairman of the 1990-91 United Way \nCampaign and has served on the advisory boards of Sarasota Ballet and \nGirl's Inc. He also cochaired the 1991 French Film Festival with his \nwife Peggy.\n  In addition to his individual efforts, he has participated in and \nsupported Peggy in her many charitable endeavors, which include, but \nare not limited to, the following: chair of the 1995 New College \nAuction, chair of the 1994 Circus Gala at Ringling Museum, chair of the \n1994 Sarasota Opera's Youth Festival, chair of the 1992 Memorial \nHospital Cartoon Classic, chair of the 1991 New College Library \nAssociation Mistletoe Ball, chair of the 1990 Family Counseling \nCenter's benefit, and chair of the 1989 Orchid Ball.\n  Mr. President, as you can see Art has not limited his benevolence to \nspecific organizations, instead his influence is felt across the entire \nSarasota community. He has done more charitable work in 10 years than \nmost of us could hope to do in a lifetime. The great State of Florida \nis a better place because of Art Wood's commitment to his community. \nMr. President, I will conclude by commending the southwest Florida \nchapter of the American Jewish Committee, especially the committee's \npresident Robert Rosenthal and director Harriet Abraham, for their \ndedication in recognizing this year's recipient of the 1996 Human \nRelations Award, Arthur M.

Mr. President, never has the noble spirit of \nvoluntarism been more important than it is today. And nowhere in the \nNation is the spirit of self-reliance and gritty determination a more \nintegral part of life than it is in New England. Voluntarism and self-\nreliance came together in 1896, when the citizens of Enfield, CT, \nformed the volunteer Enfield Fire Department, and they are alive and \nwell in the department's service today. And so it is my pleasure to \noffer my commendation to the brave men and women of the Enfied \nVolunteer Fire Department who have served and protected Enfield for 100 \nyears.\n  At a time when our society is seeking real role models for our \nchildren, we can with confidence point to our Nation's volunteer \nfirefighters as true heroes. The galant members of the Enfield \nVolunteer Fire Department, both past and present, have selflessly \ndevoted themselves, day in and day out, to saving the lives and \nlivelihoods of their neighbors. Without these dedicated individuals, \nthe community of Enfield would be at a tremendous loss.\n  No matter what is required of them, Enfield's volunteer firefighters \nstand ready to help. Whether responding to an emergency, or preventing \nemergencies from happening in the first place, all the department's \nactivities are executed with the highest caliber of professionalism. \nIndeed, the firefighters make a difference every day, conducting safety \nlessons in schools and throughout the community to teach kids and \nothers about fire prevention.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of the Enfield Fire Department have \nfaithfully served and protected Enfield, contributing tens of thousands \nof hours, for a century. Those who served yesterday, serve today, and \nwill serve tomorrow, are truly a tribute to the State of Connecticut. I \nam proud of the work done by these fine citizens, and as they celebrate \ntheir centennial, wish them another hundred years of valiant \nduty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S327-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S327-S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DRUG LEGALIZATION\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times ran \na piece noting that the lead story in the next issue of the National \nReview is going to call for the legalization of drugs. The rationale \nfor this argument is that the war on drugs has failed and that the only \nsolution is to declare defeat and turn the asylum over to the inmates.\n  I am not sure just what information the folks at the National Review \nare using, but the facts are flawed and the argument is dumb and \nirresponsible.\n  Mr. Buckley, the author of the piece, is safe in making such \narguments because he personally does not plan to use drugs. No one of \nhis immediate acquaintance is likely to start using dangerous drugs. \nAnd I doubt that he will encourage any teenage members of his family to \nuse drugs. So the consequences of his advocacy will not be felt \npersonally. Instead, the burden of his ideas will be borne by countless \nfamilies whose kids--the most at-risk population--will fall victim to \nthe consequences of drug abuse. The costs will also be borne by the \npublic purse, as we have to treat the walking wounded.\n  Although there is no public support for the idea of legalization, and \nnone in the Congress, some of our culture elite--left and right--keep \nraising the idea as if it had some intellectual merit. Nothing could be \nfarther from the truth. I am therefore submitting for the Record a \nlonger statement on the common mistakes made in the legalization \nargument that I hope will help in closing this latest chapter in \nfoolishness.\n  The statement follows:\n\n          Statement by Charles E. Grassley: Drug Legalization\n\n       I have been increasingly concerned about the tendency in \n     some quarters to promote the legalization of drugs in this \n     country. If there is any idea that is essentially without \n     merit and without public support, it is that this country \n     should entertain seriously the notion that dangerous drugs \n     should be legalized and made widely available. Drug \n     legalization is truly an invitation to the Mad Hatter's Tea \n     Party.\n       Unfortunately, many in the media and in our cultural elite, \n     who have a disproportionate access to public communication \n     and opinion outlets, have once again started to advocate some \n     form of legalization. While this advocacy is not likely to \n     lead to a major change in public policy, it can and does have \n     an adverse influence on thinking about the dangers of drug. \n     It sends a mixed message about the dangers of use that is \n     particularly harmful when it touches our young people.\n       As Bill Bennett and Joe Califano noted recently, drugs are \n     illegal because they are dangerous, they are not dangerous \n     because they are illegal. Legalization advocates, however, \n     deploy a variety of arguments on behalf of their position \n     that ignore this essential fact. They all too often resort to \n     scare tactics, misrepresent reality, or skip over \n     inconvenient facts. I think that it is important to set the \n     record straight.\n       There are a number of misconceptions about our efforts to \n     deal with the drug problem. It is important to understand \n     these and the common arguments used to promote them in order \n     to arrive at a reasoned and reasonable understanding of what \n     the drug problem is about. One of the first points to note is \n     that our last drug epidemic--during the 1960s, 1970s, and \n     early 1980s--was the result of arguments made by some that \n     drugs were really not a problem and that everyone would feel \n     better, live better, and prosper from the self-administration \n     of dangerous drugs.\n       The claim, made with considerable fervor, was that drugs \n     were liberating and that only a repressive society would \n     prevent people from achieving their true potential. By the \n     late 1980s, we finally came to realize just what a cruel \n     hoax, a big lie, these claims were. We are still trying to \n     cope with an addict population from that ear, a period that \n     has left us with a legacy of lives blasted by drug use, a \n     cost that is borne by families and the public purse. We \n     cannot afford to ignore this lesson, to repeat a disaster \n     based on the enthusiasms of a few.\n     Mistake #1: Prohibition doesn't can't work. Efforts to keep \n         people from using drugs, like alcohol prohibition, only \n         encourages the idea of forbidden fruit, increases crime, \n         and will always fail.\n       The argument that prohibition doesn't work relies on a \n     collective amnesia about \n\n[[Page S328]]\n     this country's experience with alcohol prohibition between 1920 and \n     1934. In the first place, Prohibition did not make the use of \n     alcohol illegal, only its manufacture and sale over a certain \n     strength. It was, in effect, a control regime legalizing \n     personal use. This effort came at the end of a very long \n     history in this country of trying to reduce the consumption \n     of alcohol from dangerous heights. The modern parallel is \n     with the efforts to reduce tobacco use.\n       Second, Prohibition did not lead to a major increase in \n     violent crime, as is often claimed. The major increase, \n     particularly in violent crime in this country, came between \n     1900 and 1910, well before the prohibition movement. Violent \n     crime remained fairly stable or declined during Prohibition. \n     While it is true that crime rates decreased after Prohibition \n     this was not the result of ending Prohibition. Nor did \n     Prohibition create organized crime. Major organized crime \n     groups existed well before alcohol prohibition and they \n     prospered after it ended.\n       Third, major health problems, such as cirrhosis of the \n     liver and alcohol-related psychoses, declined sharply during \n     Prohibition. Alcohol consumption, even though it was not \n     illegal, also declined sharply. It increased in the years \n     following the repeal of Prohibition, as did the associated \n     health problems.\n       Fourth, it is important to remember also that alcohol, \n     unlike dangerous drugs, had wide social acceptance and a long \n     history of use. Alcohol can also be used by most people \n     without creating impairment, either temporary or long term. \n     Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin have no such long history of \n     popular public use or acceptance, and their use is solely for \n     the purpose of intoxication. In fact, the public has opposed \n     these substances once they learned how dangerous and \n     destructive they were. This is also true historically in this \n     country and internationally. No society today has a \n     legalization regime for dangerous drugs.\n       In addition, it is clear that control efforts, when \n     reinforced by serious law enforcement, prevention, and \n     education programs do deter use, especially among young \n     people. Our own recent experience illustrates how effective \n     we can be. After decades of increasing use in this country, \n     we reversed the trend of drug use when, beginning in the mid-\n     1980s, we decided to just say no and to get serious about \n     doing something. Overall drug use, apart from addicts, \n     declined by more than 50 percent; cocaine use by 70 percent. \n     Unfortunately, more recently, as we have moved away from \n     these serious programs we have seen a return to use in the \n     most at-risk population--teenagers.\n     Mistake #2: Legalization will mean less crime because the \n         profit motive is removed and we will lock fewer people up \n         when we make our drug laws more humane\n       First, most prisoners in state and Federal prisons are not \n     there for drug offenses as their first or major offense. Most \n     offenders are in jail for violent or repeat offenses. Of \n     these, despite the wildy exaggerated numbers often cited, \n     only 10 percent of Federal prisoners and 17 percent of state \n     inmates committed their crimes to obtain drugs. Indeed, \n     research shows that most career criminals came to drug use \n     after starting their criminal activities, not before. \n     Legalization will not greatly reduce the crime rate, \n     especially for violent crimes. Indeed, in so far as the \n     pharmacological effects of drugs, particularly cocaine and \n     other stimulants, exacerbate violent tendencies, legalization \n     will produce far greater violent crime rates as the number of \n     ``legal'' addicts soars.\n       Second, the vast majority of prisoners serving time from \n     drug offenses are not there for use but for trafficking--\n     individuals whose actions destroy lives and menace \n     neighborhoods.\n       Third, legalization will not end black markets for drugs, \n     unless we are prepared to legalize drug use for all ages down \n     to the age of 6 or 7. Only the most radical legalization \n     advocates want to see kids using drugs. But to leave any \n     population out of a legalization regime means leaving a black \n     market. Crime will not simply disappear nor will the \n     organizations that are currently trafficking in illegal \n     drugs.\n     Mistake #3: Legalization will mean a healthier climate in \n         which controlled drug use will provide quality control \n         and monitored use\n       This argument misses or misrepresents the issue. The issue \n     is not whether we make drugs, which are inherently dangerous \n     to use, more pure, but whether we permit their use at all. \n     Britain led the way in trying to treat dangerous drug use as \n     a therapeutic problem, regulating addicts through doctors' \n     care. This was not an open drug policy for anyone to use \n     drugs but a policy just for addicts. The result was a \n     disaster. It did not prevent the spread of drug abuse. It \n     only made doctors complicit in the act of promoting an \n     addiction for which they had no cure. In effect, it reversed \n     the normal doctor-patient relationship, putting doctors in \n     the position of making their patients worse off. As a result, \n     in Britain, addiction soared, addicts got worse not better, \n     and the black market flourished. Similar experiences have \n     visited similar efforts in other countries. Now, it seems \n     that Switzerland is experimenting with a variation of this \n     approach. The results are likely to be a similar disaster, \n     making the government and the medical community complicit in \n     spreading addiction.\n       It is also important to keep in mind, that dangerous drugs \n     are not synonymous with other controlled pharmaceuticals. The \n     latter are controlled but they also have a therapeutic \n     purpose. Dangerous drugs have no medical purpose. They are \n     addictive and destructive. To argue that these drugs should \n     be self-administered with the only control being over their \n     quality is to argue for a massive increase in the addict \n     population, adding an even greater burden to an over-taxed \n     health-care system. In effect, the legalization argument \n     requires society to endorse a self-destructive behavior and \n     then requires society to provide perpetual care to the \n     victims at public expense.\n     Mistake #4: Deterrence does not work\n       When you talk to former addicts or those who have given up \n     use, one of the most important reasons they give for their \n     decision to quit or seek treatment was the threat of criminal \n     prosecution, the difficulty of acquiring drugs, and the cost. \n     When drugs are perceived as expensive, dangerous and wrongful \n     to use, difficult to get, and involve a risk of criminal \n     prosecution, potential users forego use, and many current \n     users quit. This remains true even though most enforcement \n     efforts focus not on users but on violent offenders and drug \n     traffickers.\n       No program to prohibit drug use can be universally \n     effective. Although we have long-standing laws against child \n     abuse or murder or theft, these have not prevented any of \n     these acts completely. No one doubts their importance, \n     however, or the role they play in discouraging yet more of \n     these actions than if they were not prohibited.\n     Mistake #5: Legalizing drugs will remove the ``Forbidden \n         Fruit'' appeal of drugs, which leads most new users, \n         especially the young, into use\n       If this is a valid argument, then anything that society \n     prohibits for the general good would succumb to the same \n     argument. Forbidding child abuse encourages child abuse. \n     Prohibiting murder encourages it. This is the logic of the \n     argument. In fact, the reverse in the case. We educate \n     people's understanding of what is rightful or wrongful to do \n     by the laws that we declare and enforce. Even during \n     Prohibition, when use was legal, the simple message sent by \n     society that use was bad caused significant drops in use. \n     Whenever we have enforced our drug laws and backed these up \n     with education and prevention programs endorsed by our civic \n     and cultural leaders, we have seen use decline and young \n     people forego use. When we ignore this simple reality we see \n     kids returning to drug use.\n       Unless one contemplates making cocaine and heroin routinely \n     available to 12-18 year olds, something even few legalizers \n     argue, then legalization will not remove the so-called \n     ``Forbidden Fruit'' appeal. It will only add the idea that \n     society condones use while continuing to prohibit access to \n     the most at-risk population. Just the absence of a clear \n     message on drug use in the last few years has seen teens \n     returning to use in disturbing numbers. A legalization \n     message would have devastating results.\n     Mistake #6: Drug use is a purely personal choice. It is a \n         victimless crime. The state has no right to keep people \n         from using drugs\n       The idea that an individual who uses drugs does so in some \n     vacuum that affects no one else is another one of those \n     fictions that obscures the facts. In the first place, drug \n     users don't stay home. They go to work and play with the rest \n     of us. They use the highways, they drive the school buses and \n     trains, they fly the planes. They also encourage others to \n     use, thus spreading the problem.\n       People under the influence of dangerous drugs are more \n     prone to workplace accidents, are more likely to have highway \n     accidents, are more prone to use violence in public and \n     family disputes, and are at greater risk for health care than \n     are non-users. Addicts are far more likely to lose control \n     over their own lives, and are more in need of public \n     intervention. A considerable percentage, perhaps as many as \n     60 percent, of the homeless are drug and alcohol addicts. \n     Some 2 percent of live births in this country--over 100,000 \n     babies--are born addicted with life-long disabilities because \n     their mothers used. Conservative estimates of the yearly \n     social costs of drug addiction at current levels run around \n     $70 billion. These costs are borne by families and the public \n     purse. The number of users and consequently the number of \n     addicts would soar under a legalization regime, compounding \n     all the problems we currently have. There is no such thing as \n     a purely private use of drugs without consequences. There is \n     no known cure for addiction. A choice for legalization would \n     be a self-inflicted disaster.\n     Mistake #7: Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, and cause \n         far more harm than dangerous drugs, we should make \n         heroin, cocaine, etc., legal to be consistent. Doing so \n         would not increase the number of users significantly\n       Here is the legalization argument at its most outrageous. \n     What people are asked to accept is the idea that because we \n     have substances generally available that already cause major \n     harm--tobacco and alcohol--we should add dangerous drugs to \n     the occasions for woe for the sake of consistency. What the \n     argument says is that since we have one major problem we \n     should make it worse by adding another. Who are we kidding?\n       In order to rescue this logic from being completely \n     ludicrous, people are asked to believe a further assertion: \n     that under a legal regime there won't be an increase in \n     users. Really? Let's look at what we are being asked to \n     believe. We are going to make drugs cheaper and freely \n     available. We are going to \n\n[[Page S329]]\n     see them aggressively marketed by the producers. We are going to have \n     society condone the use of addictive substances. But, we are \n     not going to see a significant increase in use. Such is our \n     understanding of human nature?\n       We saw what happened with drug use in this country in the \n     1960s and 1970s when we allowed the de facto legalization of \n     drugs, condoning personal use and not enforcing our laws. \n     That partial legal environment caused a dramatic increase in \n     use. Can anyone doubt the effects if we condoned use \n     outright? We cannot afford this kind of logic.\n       These are by no means the only myths. Others hold that drug \n     laws are racist--which is another big lie, but even if true \n     it is hardly an argument for making drugs legal; that the \n     health consequences of personal use are exaggerated; or that \n     drug laws lead to locking up lot of innocent people. None of \n     these arguments can sustain serious attention or thought. Nor \n     is there any major public support for drug legalization. The \n     argument is pressed by only a few, some liberal, some \n     conservative. To make the argument requires, however, \n     suspension of judgment, a willingness to accept assertions \n     over facts, and a professional absence of mind that ignores \n     experience.\n       Unfortunately, while the argument for legalization has \n     little public support, it is a major agenda item of many of \n     our cultural elites. They have a disproportionate influence \n     on our public discourse, on our radios and television, in the \n     movies, in music and the arts. This means they have a \n     disproportionate influence on the most at-risk population for \n     drug users--our young people. By helping to obscure the \n     message of the dangers of drug use, by encouraging it as part \n     of a ``liberated'' life style, they contribute directly to \n     use. When our political leaders remain silent they aid and \n     abet this. The result in the 1960s made the point. Our recent \n     experience confirms it: When you replace ``Just Say No'' with \n     ``Just Say Nothing'' or ``I didn't inhale,'' you are opening \n     the door to trouble.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S327-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NO RIGHT WAY TO DO WRONG\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, someone called my attention to an \neditorial in the Omaha World-Herald on the subject of gambling. I hope \nbefore long we will authorize a Commission to look at what we should do \nabout this subject nationally. But the editorial in the Omaha World-\nHerald, which I ask to be printed in full in the Record, may be a cause \nfor some reflection.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, Nov. 19, 1995]\n\n                        No Right Way To Do Wrong\n\n       As we were musing recently about the inability of some \n     local officials to say no to the gambling industry, we \n     recalled what Howard Buffett, then a Douglas County \n     commissioner, said when the city-county keno issue came up \n     for a vote in 1991.\n       ``To me, it's clearly wrong,'' he said. ``I don't think \n     there's any right way to do what you think is wrong.'' \n     Buffett said government shouldn't condone a practice that \n     undermines the work ethic. He was the only county \n     commissioner to oppose the deal.\n       Regrettably, Buffett is no longer part of county \n     government. He resigned in 1992 and moved to Illinois to take \n     a new job.\n       Buffett didn't stop being concerned about gambling. In \n     Illinois, he helped campaign against the spread of riverboat \n     gambling. A friend in Massachusetts heard about his efforts \n     and asked him to write down his views on gambling and \n     government for use in a Massachusetts anti-gambling effort.\n       The views he set down were again on target.\n       America was built on hard work, commitment and honesty, he \n     said. Gambling reduces productivity and ``cannibalizes \n     existing industry.'' It spawns political corruption--the \n     bigger it gets, the more government cooperation it requires. \n     When profits drop, some governments have lowered the tax \n     rates the gambling industry pays, thus putting more pressure \n     on other taxpayers.\n       Gambling doesn't pay its own way. Taxpayers are stuck with \n     social problems. In Illinois, Buffett said, government must \n     spend $3 to $6 for public safety, regulation and other \n     gambling-related items for each $1 it receives in gambling \n     revenue.\n       Gambling deceives and misleads. Promoters deceptively \n     portray everyone as a winner in advertisements that ``help \n     wring billions of dollars from the most vulnerable \n     `customers' possible--the poor and the addicted.'' Teen-agers \n     bet up to $1 billion a year. An estimated 8 percent of the \n     nation's adolescents are problem gamblers.\n       ``The state,'' Buffet wrote, ``should not even allow \n     gambling, much less conduct it.''\n       He's right. His article contains a challenge for government \n     officials. Portraying government-sponsored gambling as a \n     lifelong investment, he asked: ``Is it an investment that you \n     will be proud to hand down to the next generation?''\n       With the exception of Mayor Daub, few officials of Omaha \n     and Douglas County have indicated that they have as clear a \n     view. They should think about Buffett's challenge. Will they \n     indeed be proud of what they are leaving their children and \n     grandchildren?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S329-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S329-S330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF ROE VERSUS WADE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, January 22, 1996, commemorated the \n23d anniversary of the Nation's landmark abortion rights decision Roe \nversus Wade. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe established \nconstitutionally based limits on the power of the Government to \nrestrict the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy.\n  The right to choose has never been under such fierce attack. In this \nCongress, the U.S. House of Representatives has waged an all-out attack \non a woman's right to choose. They have continuously voted to restrict \na woman's fundamental right to choose by:\n  Attempting to undermine the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical \nEducation [ACGME] revised requirements for residency training in \nobstetrics/gynecology with an anti-choice amendment. Currently, in \norder to address the acute shortage of abortion providers, the revised \npolicy requires OB/GYN programs to provide training in abortion \nprocedures. However, there is a conscience clause for individuals and \ninstitutions that have moral or religious objections to abortion. The \nanti-choice amendment would treat those institutions that qualify under \nthe exemption clause as though they were accredited for purposes of \nFederal reimbursements, even though they did not provide the training.\n  Giving States the option to refuse to provide Medicaid funding for \nabortions in cases or rape and incest.\n  Attempting to criminalize for the first time the performance of a \nspecific abortion procedure. This measure also passed in the Senate.\n  Rejecting an amendment by Representative Patricia Schroeder to allow \nmoney from the anticrime block grants to be used for protection at \nabortion clinics.\n  Rejecting an amendment by Representative Hoke to allow money from the \nanticrime block grants to be used for enhancing security in and around \nschools, religious institutions, medical or health facilities, housing \ncomplexes, shelters to other threatened facilities.\n  Adopting an amendment by Representative Chris Smith which codified \nthe Mexico City Policy, which prohibits U.S. funding of any public or \nprivate foreign entity that directly or indirectly performs abortions \nexcept in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is \nendangered.\n  Rejecting an amendment by Representative Rosa DeLauro which would \nstrike language in the Defense authorization bill prohibiting military \npersonnel and their dependents from obtaining abortions at overseas \nmilitary bases using their personal funds to pay for the procedure.\n  Rejecting a substitute amendment by Representative DeLauro to the \nDornan amendment to prohibit abortions at overseas military facilities \nunless the life of the woman is endangered and if the Government is \nreimbursed with private money for any costs associated with the \nabortion.\n  Rejecting an amendment by Representative Hoyer to delete a provision \nin the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill that would prohibit \nFederal employees or their families from receiving abortion services \nthrough their Federal health insurance policies except when the life of \nthe woman would be endangered. The Senate passed this measure but added \nan exception for the life of the mother and rape and incest.\n  Rejecting an amendment by Delegate Norton to strike from the \nCommerce, Justice, State appropriations bill provisions that prevent \nfunds from being used to perform abortions in the Federal prison system \nexcept in cases of rape or when the woman's life is endangered. The \nSenate passed this measure, which was vetoed by President Clinton and \nits future is uncertain.\n  Adopting an amendment by Representative Greenwood prohibiting funding \nunder title X for abortions or directed pregnancy counseling.\n  Pro-choice Senators have waged a vigorous effort as have grass-roots \nactivists, but we are outnumbered in too many votes in this anti-choice \nCongress.\n  Now H.R. 1833 is on the President's desk. It would make it a criminal \noffense to perform a rare abortion procedure used to protect women in \nlate term pregnancies. Doctors who have used this procedure have \ntestified these very rare abortions are undertaken \n\n[[Page S330]]\nonly in the most tragic of circumstances and that the procedure may be \nthe only alternative to save women's lives or to prevent serious, long \nterm health consequences.\n  President Clinton has indicated his intent to veto this bill, and I \nurge him to stand firm in his belief that to outlaw a procedure used by \nphysicians out of deep concern for both the mother and the fetus would \nbe wrong and a direct violation of Roe versus Wade, which held that a \nwoman's life and health must always be considered by any governmental \nentity which regulates abortion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/23/senate-section/article/S329-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1996\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
