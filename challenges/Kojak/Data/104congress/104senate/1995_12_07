Mr. President, I have asked my staff in California to \nbegin to monitor air traffic control failures. They have started with \nthe San Francisco Bay area, and I would like to make a report this \nmorning on what they have found in the last 5 months.\n  The San Francisco Bay area is essentially controlled out of Oakland \nwhere nearly 18 million square miles of airspace is under control by \nair traffic controllers. Next week I would like to make a report on Los \nAngeles.\n  I sent this in writing to the Secretary of Transportation. But I \nbelieve the findings of the last 5 months really deserve to be printed \nin the Congressional Record and deserve the attention of the U.S. \nSenate because I think air passengers are very much at risk today.\n  I am unconvinced that the situation is being looked at with the \nurgency it demands, and my great fear is that it is going to take a \nmajor human tragedy to really get the kind of attention the situation \nneeds.\n  This morning I want to urge the FAA to make the acquisition of new \nand reliable equipment its highest priority. In the past, the FAA has \nresisted incremental improvements in the Nation's air traffic control \nsystem in favor of huge changes that never materialize. This leaves \ncenters across the United States that are operated by mainframe \ncomputers and vacuum tubes that are over 25 years old. The irony here \nis that the air equipment, the planes in the air, are new. The system \nthat controls their safety is old and failing. Backup systems are being \nused more and more frequently, and in some cases the backup is no more \nreliable than the equipment it is replacing.\n  The following is a summary of incidents of equipment failure in the \nSan Francisco Bay area since August of this year.\n  Let me begin with August 8, 1995. The Bay TRACON system located at \nthe Oakland airport, controlling the entire bay area airspace at below \n15,000 feet, experienced partial radar failure for 3 to 5 minutes \nbefore reliable radar data was displayed on controller scopes.\n  The next day, August 9, 1995, the air traffic control center at \nOakland located in Fremont, covering 18.3 million miles of airspace, \nsuffered a total failure of radar, radio, and landline communications, \nincluding backup systems. Radar remained out for 34 minutes. Radios and \nlandlines were out for \n\n[[Page S 18118]]\n21 minutes. There were 295 airplanes airborne under Oakland's ARTCC's \ncontrol at the time of the outage.\n  A few weeks later, August 22, a power failure at Bay TRACON disabled \nOakland's radar system again. Backup radar provided only 85 percent \ncoverage and took 3 to 5 minutes to come on line.\n  And 3 days later, August 25, 1995, a dual sensor problem disabled Bay \nTRACON's Oakland radar system.\n  September 6, the controllers lose power to voice and computer data \nlines at Oakland ARTCC used to control and track aircraft over the \nPacific Ocean.\n  The next day, September 7, 1995, the main and backup power supply \nfails at Oakland ARTCC. Power is not restored in time to preserve the \ndata base in the oceanic computer known as ODAPS. Controllers rebuild \nthe data base manually when the computer power is returned. The \nshutdown lasted 4 hours.\n  A few days later, September 13, 1995, the Bay TRACON's Oakland radar \nfailed three times when a 26-year-old microwave link malfunctioned. The \nfirst failure lasted 32 minutes. The second failure lasted 81 minutes. \nAnd the third failure lasted for hours.\n  Two weeks later, September 25, 1995, an internal power failure at Bay \nTRACON disabled so-called noncritical systems and caused air-\nconditioners to go out. Controllers were exposed to 90-degree heat in \nthe control room, computers overheated and failed due to the extreme \ntemperature increase.\n  October 1, 1995, a power surge at Moffett Field caused a radar site \nto switch to engine generators. While repairs were being made the next \nday, the bay area was without a backup system for 7 hours.\n  October 27, 1995, during the morning inbound rush and foggy \nconditions, the Bay TRACON computer froze and caused controllers to \nperform automated functions manually.\n  November 3, 1995, faulty computer connections forced air traffic \ncontrollers in Fremont to track aircraft with a backup system for \nnearly 48 hours.\n  November 28, just a few days ago, airport surveillance radar at the \nOakland airport goes down for an hour.\n  Needless to say, it is a miracle that no collisions have occurred. \nThis is the fourth busiest airspace in the Nation. The situation and \nthe growing frequency of outages across the United States are simply \ndisasters waiting to happen.\n  These examples from the San Francisco Bay area are symptomatic of a \nnationwide problem. At a time when the private sector is building the \nmost advanced airplanes in the world, the FAA is still using equipment \nthat is over a quarter of a century old.\n  I realize that resources are an issue. Yet the airport and airways \ntrust fund which funds the FAA has an annual budget of $12 billion a \nyear. I cannot stress enough the importance of this money translating \ninto new equipment for air traffic control centers across the country. \nWe cannot continue to function with a system that often fails and \nleaves the safety of airline passengers in question.\n  These equipment outages, along with a recent Los Angeles Times report \nof equipment falling off old aircraft and very nearly landing on human \nbeings, has me very worried about public safety. What concerns me more \nthan these dangers, however, is the FAA's assessment that no lives are \nat risk.\n  Given the above list of outages along with reports of equipment \nnearly killing people as it falls from the sky, I find this extremely \ndifficult to believe. Some action must be taken.\n  It has been suggested that the FAA could operate more effectively if \nremoved from the Department of Transportation. I am not certain if that \nis the answer, but it is obvious to me that some dramatic improvements \nmust be made in order to ensure the safety of the flying public.\n  I would like to offer any necessary and appropriate assistance to \nfacilitate a change in the priorities of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. I look forward to working with my colleagues toward a \nsolution to this increasingly alarming situation.\n  Next week I hope to come before the Senate to discuss similar \nincidents at Los Angeles International Airport. I yield the floor.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we had asked last night for a period of a \nspecial order this morning to discuss the President's veto of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. Certainly I, and I think a good number of \nAmericans, Mr. President, watched yesterday as this President with \ngrand theater and style worked overtime to cover up the fact that he \nhas not produced a balanced budget and in fact cannot, given his \nagenda, produce a budget that will be in balance by the year 2002.\n  Instead, yesterday he accused Republicans of not recognizing the need \nfor education, of not recognizing the need to strengthen and save \nMedicare. And, of course, that simply is not true and the American \npublic knows it.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 that the President vetoed yesterday \nrecognizes the importance of education and does not cut student loans. \nIt recognizes the importance of a sound Medicare system to seniors and \nstrengthens Medicare into the year 2000, by spending nearly an \nadditional $2,000 per Medicare recipient in the year 2002, compared \nwith 1995. And certainly that is also true of Medicaid, which is \nreturned to the States for greater efficiencies and greater humanity as \nStates deal with applying Medicaid to the truly needy of our society.\n  Several of us have gathered this morning for the purpose of \ndiscussing the President's veto, the benefits of the budget that the \nPresident unfortunately vetoed, and the budget situation this Congress \nand our country finds itself in.\n  At this time I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18118-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18118-S18119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I think all of us are \nvery concerned about where we go from here, concerned about the \nPresident's veto of the first balanced budget proposal that could have \nsucceeded in 30 years. The President cannot continue to veto the will \nof the American people who list as their top priority balancing the \nbudget.\n  You say why, why is that a top priority? Not simply because it is \ngood government, not because it is financial and fiscal responsibility, \nbut because they understand, and Wyoming families understand, as do \nothers, that every day the Government fails to balance the budget, more \nmoney is taken from their families' futures.\n  Families are thinking down the road, fortunately. They care about the \nworld their children will inherit and the fact that we are ready to \nmove into a new century, and they ask themselves what kind of a \nGovernment will we pass on to our children and our grandchildren? Will \nit be the one with the credit card maxed out? That is where we are now.\n  So these families think about what is coming in the future. \nUnfortunately, the Clinton administration thinks about the next \nelection. Had the President come to the snubbing post and done the \nright thing, Wyoming families would have saved money. They would have \nsaved $2,404 per year--these figures were done up by the Heritage \nFoundation on a State-by-State basis--$2,400 per year on lower mortgage \npayments, over $300 a year due on State and local interest payments, \n$500 per year on lower interest payments for student loans. These are \nfor average families in Wyoming.\n\n  The State and local governments in Wyoming--we want to transfer some \nof that responsibility--would have saved $57 million over 7 years on \nlower interest rates brought about by balancing the budget.\n  So the issue of balancing the budget is the most critical one. We \nhave to balance the budget because of the impact it has on families and \nthe benefits that come from it. The deficit is robbing our families' \nbank accounts. It must be budgeted. And anything else is the wrong \nthing to do.\n  The Clinton administration has done less than the responsible thing. \nI think we have to start talking about that and not let them get by \nwith going to the media and saying, ``We're protecting \n\n[[Page S 18119]]\nthis and we're protecting that. We can't do this.'' We have to balance \nthe budget. And this administration has done what I think is the most \nselfish thing, and that is to play the political game at the expense of \nAmerican families.\n  The President has not done anything to bring about real change. In \n1993, we had the largest tax increase the world has ever known. But \nspending continued to go up, and we have not balanced the budget. He \nhas proposed two budgets this year, neither of them balanced. Neither \nof them got any votes in this Senate. He now proposes to bring up \nanother one today. We will see. But he is going to do it without CBO \nnumbers, without real numbers.\n\n  Now, people say, what is CBO? What is OMB? What is the difference? I \ncan tell you what the difference is. CBO is real numbers. You can \nbalance the budget, if you fool with the projections, without really \nbalancing the budget. Raise the projections out here 7 years from now \nwhen you are no longer President and it is painless to do it in the \nmeantime. It is also phony. We cannot do that.\n  We see this leadership in this administration trying to patch the \nwalls of a crumbling welfare state. Talking about the Great Society, we \nspent $5 trillion in these welfare programs and they have not worked. \nYou cannot expect different results if you continue to do the same \nthing. You need real welfare reform. We need to guard and protect \nMedicare. And we need to think about what kind of country we want as we \ngo into the 21st century. The balanced budget is the way to proceed.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of principles that need to be \nfollowed. First of all, if we are going to have a balanced budget, we \nhave to start with honest numbers. Certainly, you can argue about the \nprojections, but you have to start with real numbers and be willing to \nmake the changes that are necessary to make that balance. You have to \nreduce Washington spending, which is as important as balancing the \nbudget. You could balance it, I suppose, by raising taxes. But we need \nto bring down spending. We have to ensure Medicare solvency. We have to \nmake some changes to do that. We have to have real welfare reform. \nWelfare reform without results is not what we want. We have to change \nthat. We have to put some more power in the people in the States and \nmove government closer to the people, and we must do it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, President Clinton, with a \ngreat deal of fanfare and theatrics, vetoed the first balanced budget \nlegislation sent to any President in the last three decades. Think \nabout that a moment, Mr. President. The first balanced budget \nlegislation sent to any President in nearly three decades was vetoed \nyesterday by President Clinton.\n  What is the accumulated debt of this country? It is $4.9 trillion. \nThat occurred as a consequence of prevailing Democratic control of both \nthe House and Senate during those decades.\n  The veto was very well orchestrated, with the President deciding to \nuse the same pen that the late President Lyndon Johnson used to sign \nthe original Medicare legislation back in 1965. However, in what may be \na metaphor for this President, when he put pen to the paper, nothing \nhappened; the pen was out of ink, just as the President is out of ideas \nand just as Medicare is out of money.\n  Mr. President, the American public deserves better. Throughout the \nentire year, Republicans in Congress have worked night and day to \ndevelop and pass a real balanced budget along with family tax relief. \nThere were some Democrats who worked with us. And what has the \nPresident done this year? Absolutely nothing. He has spoken empty \nrhetoric about wanting to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, there is a difference between wanting and doing. \nPresident Clinton has submitted two budgets this year. The first one--\nthink about this--the first one did not receive a single vote, Democrat \nor Republican, when we voted on it in the Senate, not one single vote, \nbecause the President's first budget would have led us to unending \ndeficits and a sea of red ink for the indefinite future.\n  He came along and said his second budget would balance in 10 years. \nBut like everything else with this President, rhetoric and reality are \ninconsistent. It is what the polls say that motivates the actions down \nat the White House.\n  When the Congressional Budget Office scored the President's second \nbudget, they again found endless annual deficits--in excess of $200 \nbillion. Now the President says he is going to send us a third budget, \nand this one will be balanced in 7 years. I am a little cynical simply \nbecause I have been there before. I am from Missouri--maybe--when in \nreality I am from Alaska, but the same point is applicable. After two \nfalse starts, I wish to see something real.\n  I hope the President does send us a balanced budget, but I have had \nan opportunity this morning for a preview of what we anticipate is his \neffort, and it does not balance. It simply does not balance. So as a \nconsequence, I fear we are facing a third situation where the President \nhas sent us something that is totally unacceptable.\n  I hope that the President will be willing to recognize and give the \nAmerican family the relief they need from taxes. I hope he will give \nAmericans incentives to invest in our future and save. I hope that he \nwould give Americans an opportunity for hope--hope that Government can \nbe downsized, more efficient, more responsive. And I hope he will give \nAmerica the economic security that will come from allowing oil \nexploration to proceed in ANWR, which I note in his veto statement he \nrejected.\n  On that point, I would like to defer to his veto statement where he \nsuggests, under title V, the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to oil and gas threatens a unique, pristine ecosystem in hopes \nit will generate $1.3 billion in Federal revenues, revenues based on \nwishful thinking, and outdated analysis.\n  Mr. President, the wishful thinking is in the eyes of some of \nAmerica's environmental community that focuses on this as a cause for \nmembership and a cause of raising dollars at the expense of our \nnational energy security, and at the expense of our jobs and at the \nexpense of American technology.\n  Geologists have indicated that this area is the most likely area in \nNorth America where a major oil discovery could take place. And to \nsuggest the arguments that prevailed against Prudhoe Bay 20 years ago \nare now being applied to the opening up of ANWR are not realistic is \nreally selling American technology and ingenuity short. This could be \nthe largest single job producer in the United States for the remainder \nof the century. It could be the largest contributor, if you will, to an \nincrease in tax revenue for the Federal and State governments. The \nconsequence of the President's shortsightedness in dismissing this \nreally underestimates the capability of America's can-do spirit and \nadvanced technology.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say the American public today is \nfed up with this lack of leadership. The American public wants a \nbalanced budget \n\n[[Page S 18120]]\nthey can understand. They do not understand the dispute between the OMB \nand the CBO figures. They want a balanced budget that simply says the \nrevenue will equal the outflow. We got into this situation as a \nconsequence of spending more money than we generated in revenues, and \nthere is only one way to correct that: Either through increased \nrevenues or reduced spending.\n  We Republicans, I think, have delivered a responsible pledge. It is \nnow up to the President to transform his words into deeds. It is time \nfor the President to get serious, to send us his proposals for \nbalancing the budget with no phony numbers, no rosy scenarios. And it \nis time for the posturing to end and the serious business of balancing \nthe budget to begin.\n  I thank my colleagues and wish them a good day.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from \nMichigan, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a study \nby the Heritage Foundation called ``Balanced Budget Talking Points: The \n$500-Per-Child Tax Credit,'' which discusses what it would mean to a \ntypical middle-income family in this country to have the middle-class \nfamily tax credit that was in the Balanced Budget Act vetoed yesterday. \nIn having this printed in the Record, let me suggest that a family of \nfour spends on the average $3,986 a year in groceries, or about $332 a \nmonth. What the President did yesterday was take away from the average \nAmerican family 3 month's--3 month's--worth of grocery bills.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe $500-Per-Child Tax Credit Means One Month's Food and Mortgage for a \n                        Typical American Family\n\n   (By Scott A. Hodge, Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary \n                                Affairs)\n\n     ``If you take the $500 a year tax credit, and I figure, you \n         know, $5 for a bottle of wine, that is 100 bottles of \n         wine for a family.'' \\1\\--Congressman Jim McDermott (D-\n         WA)\n       Contrary to what elitists in Washington would have the \n     public believe, for most hard-working American families \n     raising children a $500 tax cut for each child is not an \n     insignificant amount of money. This is especially true as \n     many families no doubt are wondering how they will be able to \n     afford the $432 some surveys report each household expects to \n     spend this holiday season.\\2\\ Yet the families of 51 million \n     children, or over 28 million families in all, will be denied \n     relief from their financial worries by President Bill \n     Clinton's expected veto of Congress's seven year balanced \n     budget and tax cut plan, which had as its centerpiece a $500-\n     per-child tax credit. This tax cut would pump over $22 \n     billion per year into family budgets across the country so \n     that working parents can provide for their children in a way \n     no government program can.\n     \\1\\ Tax Provisions in the Contract With America Designed to \n     Strengthen the American Family, Hearings before the Committee \n     on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, January 17, \n     1995 p. 30.\n     \\2\\ Bureau of National Affairs, ``Conference Board, Arthur \n     Anderson Polls Put Moderately Upbeat Face on Holiday,'' \n     November 24, 1995.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As congressional Republicans negotiate with the White House \n     on a compromise plan to balance the budget by 2002 and \n     provide tax cuts, they should resist pressure to scale back \n     the $500-per-child tax credit as a price for cutting a deal. \n     Those who argue that Washington cannot ``afford'' such \n     generous tax cuts while the government is trying to balance \n     the budget are, in effect, arguing for higher spending. The \n     budget will not be balanced any faster if the amount of the \n     per-child credit is reduced below $500 or if the income for \n     which families are eligible is lowered from its current level \n     of $110,000 for joint filers.\\3\\ Any money not put back in \n     the checkbooks of working families with children through tax \n     cuts, is more money in the checkbook for politicians and \n     bureaucrats to spend while the budget is moving toward \n     balance.\n     \\3\\ For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 \n     the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above \n     the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at \n     $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two \n     credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at \n     $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to \n     phase out at $75,000 in income.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Congressional and White House negotiators should keep in \n     mind that for parents with two children, the $1,000 tax cut \n     they would receive under this plan could mean the difference \n     between paying the mortgage and not. Indeed, as the table \n     below shows, a $1,000 tax cut for the typical family with two \n     children is enough to pay one month's mortgage and grocery \n     bills, or 11 months worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 \n     months worth of clothing for the children. In other words, a \n     $1,000 tax cut is a significant amount of money for most \n     families' household budgets.\n\n WHAT THE $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT MEANS FOR A FAMILY WITH TWO CHILDREN\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                How many\n                                           Annual              months of\n                                         household             this item\n           Family budget item             cost for   Monthly     can be \n                                          a family     cost    purchased\n                                            of 4                  with  \n                                                                 $1,000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGroceries..............................     $3,986       $332        3.0\nMortgage payment (principal, interest,                                  \n and taxes)............................      7,972        664        1.5\nNatural gas............................        333         28       36.0\nElectricity............................      1,085         90       11.1\nTelephone..............................        803         67       14.9\nWater..................................        331         28       36.3\nChildren's clothing....................        612         51       19.6\nAuto payments..........................      3,325        277        3.6\nGasoline purchases.....................      1,397        116        8.6\nHealth insurance.......................        817         68       14.7\nMedical services.......................        749         62       16.0\nDrugs and medical supplies.............        366         31       32.8\nPersonal care products and services....        526         44       22.8\nEducational expenses...................        739         62       16.2\nLife and other personal insurance......        557         46       21.5\nPersonal services (babysitting, child                                   \n care, etc.)...........................        536         45      22.4 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource.--Heritage calculations, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics,    \n  Consumer Expenditure Survey, 1992-93.                                 \n\n       There are also sound policy reasons to cut taxes for \n     families with children:\n       Families with children are overtaxed.--In 1948, the average \n     American family with children paid only 3 percent of its \n     income to Uncle Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent.\n       Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is \n     equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.--The \n     average family now loses $10,060 per year of its income due \n     to the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family \n     income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on \n     the average family home. The $1,000 in tax relief the \n     congressional tax-cut plan would give to a family with two \n     children would help this family pay one month's mortgage \n     payment.\n       Millions of families stand to benefit.--The families of 51 \n     million American children, or 28 million taxpaying families, \n     are eligible for the $500-per-child tax cut.\n       Family tax relief helps families in every state.--The \n     typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in \n     families eligible for a $500 tax credit. Thus families in the \n     typical district would receive $54 million per year in tax \n     relief.\n       Congress' $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the \n     entire income tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for \n     8.7 million children.--These 3.5 million families will \n     receive over $2.2 billion per year in tax relief. Families \n     with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see \n     their entire income tax burden eliminated by a $500-per-child \n     tax credit, and families with three children earning up to \n     $26,000 also would have their income tax bill eliminated.\n       Most families are middle-class.--The $500 child credit plan \n     will direct 89 percent of all benefits to families with \n     adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 per year--middle-income \n     by any standard--and over 96 percent to families with incomes \n     below $100,000.\n       Cutting taxes for all families--regardless of income--is \n     fair.--Congress' plan will cut the income tax burden of a \n     family of four earning $30,000 per year by 51 percent and the \n     income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year by 30 \n     percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000 would \n     see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family \n     earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 \n     percent.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to echo the \ncomments made by my friend from Idaho and my friend from Alaska with \nrespect to the President's decision to veto our Balanced Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, I am new to the Senate. I was elected last year, but \nfor years I have followed the actions in Congress. I have observed the \nvarious people who came to Washington, including Presidents, and talked \nabout how important it was to balance the budget. In fact, the \nPresident himself promised to balance the budget when he was a \ncandidate in 1992. He promised to balance the budget in 5 years.\n  We have now gone 25 years without a balanced budget, 25 years of red \nink, 25 years in which the people who ran for office promising to get \nthe job done failed their fellow countrymen and constituents.\n  Over that period of time, a lot of finger pointing has gone on. Each \nside of the political arena has said, ``Well, it's the other side's \nfault.'' Yet during that time, no balanced budget was ever presented to \na President by a Congress, and, as I recall, no President has come to \nCongress with a balanced budget. Instead, all we've had is partisan \nrhetoric. \n\n[[Page S 18121]]\n\n  This Congress has been different, Mr. President. This Congress has, \nfor the first time during this period of red ink, actually acted on its \ncampaign commitments, actually had come to Washington mindful of the \nneeds of this country, and actually produced a balanced budget, not \njust a balanced budget resolution, not just a balanced budget \nconference report back in the spring and the summer, but a real \nbalanced budget act which was passed in the House, passed in the \nSenate, and then adopted as a conference report just a few days ago.\n  So this President became the first President, as my colleague from \nAlaska said, in years to actually have on his desk a balanced budget \nbill. It was an opportunity to do what he said he would do in his \ncampaign and what Presidents and Congresses have said they would do for \ndecades, to fulfill their commitment to put the Federal Government's \nfiscal house in order.\n  Unfortunately, the President chose to veto this legislation. He chose \nto veto the balanced budget. I hope that by his actions, the American \npublic now understands exactly why it has been so long since we have \nhad a balanced budget.\n  I would like to speak just for a minute about what the implications \nare of this veto for a balanced budget for my State of Michigan, \nbecause we have been studying the statistics, and it is a very unhappy \npicture.\n  Had the President signed the Balanced Budget Act, we would see in our \nState a dramatic change in the well-being of our families. Two things \nwould have happened that would be very good for the hard-working \nmiddle-class families of my State.\n  First, interest rates would begin to go down and go down \nsubstantially. And second, those families would be able to keep more of \nwhat they earned instead of sending tax dollars to Washington.\n  In terms of interest rates, Mr. President, we would be talking about \nan estimated $4,000 of savings annually on the mortgages paid by the \nfamilies in my State. I do not know one family in my State that would \nnot be able to put that $4,000 to good use for themselves and their \nchildren. We would be talking about something like $500 per year in \nsavings for people who are paying student loans, and we would be \ntalking about hundreds of dollars of savings for people who pay \ninterest on their auto loans, not just in my State, I might add, but \nacross the country.\n  For a State like Michigan which is so dependent on the sale of \nautomobiles, that is especially good news. So in that sense, the impact \non interest rates will have a rippling effect in my State which will \nundoubtedly mean fewer car sales and fewer jobs in the auto industry.\n  So for all of those reasons the people of Michigan are going to be \ndisappointed by the President's action. But they are also going to be \ndisappointed when they realize the President's veto also denied the \nfamilies in my State substantial tax reduction, tax reduction that \nwould have affected something in the vicinity of 1 million Michigan \ntaxpayers.\n  In particular, they are going to be disappointed because the \nprovisions we included in this legislation to provide a family tax \ncredit are not going to be forthcoming as so many families in our State \nhad hoped.\n  That $500 per child would mean that families in Michigan will spend \nmore on the necessities of their life for their kids. We talk here in \nthe Senate all the time about children and the need to help children. I \ncannot think of anything that would be more beneficial for the kids of \nour country than to provide $500 per child in the form of a tax credit \nso that their moms and dads can provide them with extra things they \nmight need in the year ahead. So for that reason, families in our \nState, I think, are going to be extraordinarily disappointed.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying the President says he will finally \ncome forward with a new budget plan. I hope this plan is different than \nthe previous ones. From what I gather this morning in the media, that \nis unlikely to be the case. He says he has a balanced budget, but if \nyou look at the portions already reported in the press, it is apparent \nhis new plan will not get us to a balanced budget.\n  Indeed, it is implausible it is a balanced budget plan, since it \nappears it will only reduce spending over the 7-year-period of time we \nare discussing by approximately 2 percent.\n  I do not think there is anybody in this country who thinks the $5 \ntrillion of debt we have run up and the hundreds of billions of dollars \nof annual deficits we have can be brought into balance simply by \nreducing total spending by 2 percent over 7 years. It simply does not \nadd up, Mr. President.\n  These are funny numbers, and if the numbers presented by the \nPresident today correspond to the ones he offered in the previous \nbudget, which received zero votes in the U.S. Senate, I think we all \nhave to say, Mr. President, it is once again time to go back to the \ndrawing board, time to go back and use real numbers, honest \nevaluations, and, hopefully, move in support of the Republican goal of \na balanced budget that is going to help American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been, for a few moments while the \nSenator from Michigan has been speaking, reading the wire story of the \nPresident's veto yesterday of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Let me \nquote from that some of the President's words. He said:\n\n       I have consistently said that if Congress sends me a budget \n     that violates our values, I will veto it.\n\n  I say to the President of the United States, I find that a very \ncurious statement, in view of the budget that we have sent to you and \nthat you have vetoed. How, possibly, could it be wrong, or how possibly \nwould it not be in your value system to want to leave as much money \nwith the average American family as is possible? That is exactly what \nthe Republican Congress has attempted to do in sending to you a \nBalanced Budget Act--to go directly at middle income America, to assure \nthat they have enough money in their pockets to be able to feed their \nchildren, to be able to buy a home and pay their mortgages, and do so \nin a way that families of 10 or 15 or 20 years ago were able to do, and \nprovide then for the future.\n  Mr. President, we all recognize the need to respond to the present, \nbut we are terribly frustrated that you have not had the wisdom to look \ninto the future, and to look into the future in a way that recognizes \nthat reducing debt in this country, that reducing the annual Federal \ndeficits and balancing the budget, that allowing the average American \nfamily to save, all mean a better future, mean that we truly are \nconcerned about a generation that would be saddled with a debt that \nthey had never had the opportunity to create, that the average child of \ntoday will look forward to an oppressive tax burden to pay off the \n$18,000 to $20,000 of their share of a Federal debt that a generation \nlong before them had decided to spend on one program or another.\n  Mr. President, the budget that you vetoed yesterday was just as much \nabout the future as it was about the present. The only problem is--and \nI can gain from your statement--that you are worried only about the \npresent, about the instant gratification of the present, and your value \nsystem has, in some way, no capacity for dealing with the future.\n  The Senator from Michigan spoke a few moments ago and related to us \nthe positive consequences of this budget on his State and the \nopportunities it created. Not for the very wealthy but for the average \nfamily of four, with a husband and wife, mother and father, working and \nbringing home $50,000 or $60,000 a year collectively, or less, and what \nthat means to them if they start putting that $500 tax credit away on \nan annual basis for their children's future.\n  We looked at my State of Idaho, where a dollar still goes a little \nways. If a young couple, a family, having that first child, starts \nimmediately to put that $500 tax credit away in savings and puts it \nthere for the child's future, what can that family buy for that child \nin the form of education in the coming years when that child is ready \nfor college? Well, they can pay for more than 8 full years of college \ntuition and fees in our State university system--on an average, nearly \n9 years, in today's dollars. By any calculation, that is a \n\n[[Page S 18122]]\nbachelor's degree, a master's degree, and even a doctorate. That is \nwhat that kind of savings offers. That is how the Balanced Budget Act--\nwhich the President vetoed yesterday--would have empowered Idaho's \nfamilies.\n  Even in the ivy league schools, this tax credit buys a year or a year \nand a half of schooling across this country. That is a tremendously \nsignificant value to the average American family who holds the dream \nthat their children are going to do better than they have done, and \nthey are going to help provide for that child.\n  In my largest metropolitan county of Idaho--and Idaho is not very \nmetropolitan--it is a large State with only about 1.3 million people in \nit--but in that metropolitan county of now over 300,000, Ada County, \nwhich includes Boise, there are over 50,900 children that would qualify \nfor the $500 child tax credit. What does that mean over this period of \ntime, from now through the year 2002, about putting spendable income \nback into that community? It puts back into that community $144 million \nworth of spendable income over the next 7 years. I will tell you, under \nanybody's estimation--but especially in the State of Idaho--that is a \nlot of money. That is a tremendous opportunity for that community to \ngrow, for those families to prosper, to buy a new home, to buy a car, \nand do all of the kinds of things that fulfill the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I am not quite sure what is in your value system, but \nI know that there is no future image, there is no vision for America's \ntomorrow, if you are willing to veto the balanced budget that we have \nsent to you. You have vetoed a balanced budget that not only deals with \ntoday's needs but, for the first time in the years that I have had the \nprivilege of serving Idaho in the U.S. Senate, it looks into the \nfuture.\n  For a few moments, let us talk about that future in some real ways, \nin a national perspective, about the kind of money in the average \nfamily's pocket that is offered through a balanced budget with tax \nrelief. We would see a decline in interest rates of well over two \npoints--and that is not some exaggeration by the Senator from Idaho, \nthat is according to national econometric modeling, which shows that if \nyou get the budget into balance, the economy of this country begins to \nrespond a great deal better. Why? Because the Federal Government is \ntaking less money out of it. And the average American family has more \nmoney to spend and that generates jobs, and that multiplies the kind of \neconomic activity that we always have seen in this country, which has, \nagain, produced more revenue for Government under stable taxing \nsituations.\n  For example, a decrease of 1.4 percent in the conventional mortgage \nrate--and we know it could decrease a good deal more than that--means \nthe relief of nearly $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage. The \nBalanced Budget Act says to the American family, You have greater \nbuying power. It says that an additional 104,000 new family homes would \nbe constructed and purchased in that 7-year period of reduced growth in \nFederal spending and a balanced budget. Under anybody's estimation, \nthat is big bucks for the economy. It benefits not just the family \npurchasing the home, but hundreds of thousands of workers--carpenters, \ncarpenters' helpers, masonry workers, and plumbers--that build the \nhomes for Americans that are going to be employed.\n  Mr. President, what is your vision for the future? Obviously, it is \nnot 104,000 new family homes. What about those men and women who work \nin the automobile industry of our country? It is estimated, by those \nsame studies from the Heritage Foundation, that over 600,000 additional \nautomobiles could be manufactured and purchased by the American family \nin this 7-year period. That is $10 billion worth of expenditures. I do \nnot know how you think, Mr. President, but I know how the folks of \nIdaho think. They want to keep ahold of their own money. They want the \nright to spend the money they earn. They do not believe that \ntransferring it to the Federal Government and giving the Federal \nGovernment the opportunity to spend it on something that the Federal \nGovernment would wish is the better way to manage it.\n  Well, those are some extremely valuable and important figures that \nare all tied up in this balanced budget that the President has now \nvetoed. So, Mr. President, while your budgeteers are coming to the Hill \non a regular basis now and are to bring with them your vision of a \nbalanced budget and your proposal that the House and the Senate and the \nWhite House will now sit down to try to work out the differences on, \nthere is one thing that is nonnegotiable and that is a 7-year balanced \nbudget. That is the kind of tax relief that truly builds incentives in \nthe economy to keep our economy going, to keep it prospering, to create \nnew jobs, and to allow the American working family more and more \nopportunity by being able to keep more of their hard-earned income.\n  A lot of people have criticized the idea of leaving the American \nfamily with more money. If we had, by our own studies, left the \nAmerican family the same kind of spending opportunities that they had \nin 1950 when the Government was taxing a great deal less of the gross \nincome of the average working family, I would tell you that it would \nnot be a $500 tax credit today, it would be well over triple that \namount. That is how much we have eroded the spending ability, the \nkeeping ability, the savings ability of the American family by \nprogressively taking away from them for what has been allegedly a \nbetter cause--more of their money to be spent by Government.\n  These are very important issues, Mr. President. There is more at \nstake here than just the pulling out of an old antique pen that started \nthe great welfare society of our country that has well run out of ink, \nand trying to find ink to veto an effort of reform that the American \npublic spoke to last November.\n  Mr. President, it is significant what has occurred in this country. \nIt is significant that the American people have spoken overwhelmingly \nin favor of balancing a Federal budget.\n  Back in 1982, when I served in the U.S. House of Representatives, I \nbecame one of those leaders pushing a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution. That was long before the debt was as big as it is today, \nor the deficit seemed to become a static deficit of around $200 billion \non an annualized basis.\n  Those were the years we really felt it was important to get the \nbudget under control. As we fought to do so, one thing began to happen: \nThe American people began to listen. They recognized, as they saw the \ndebt of this country grow and as they saw a Congress unwilling to \nwrestle with the real meaning of a debt and to bring Federal spending \nunder control, that somehow the American public was going to have to do \nit.\n  I think the citizens of this country truly believe that this is their \nGovernment. By the action of their vote, they will tell those of us who \nrepresent them in their Government how we should act.\n  That is exactly what I believe the American public did last November \nwhen they changed the 40-year-old Democratically-controlled House into \na House with a Republican majority and they put Republicans in a \nmajority here in the U.S. Senate. They said very, very clearly, ``Mr. \nPresident, Congress, balance the budget, and do so in a way that is \nmeaningful. Not the kind of games that have been played historically \nover the last three decades. We want you to show us for the first time \nthat you can and will balance the budget.''\n  And, Mr. President, that is exactly what the Republican Congress has \ndone. They sent to the President a balanced budget, and this President, \nlacking a vision and lacking an image for the future, vetoed it.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for such time as \nhe might consume.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator yielding to me. I think it is \nvery symbolic and appropriate, the pen that the President used to sign \nthe veto message yesterday was, indeed, the pen that had been used \nduring the Great Society days that started this shift in attitude in \nGovernment, so that Government has a greater responsibility for all of \nus, beginning back in the 1960's.\n  I think the fact that he is using that pen to veto the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995 is a very interesting occasion, because that is the \ndate that all of this started. \n\n[[Page S 18123]]\n\n  I remember it so well because I was serving at that time in the State \nlegislature in Oklahoma. We were so concerned at that time because the \nyear that I am thinking of our total debt was $200 billion. I remember \non a TV ad they were trying to impress upon the people of America how \nmuch money that was so they had $100 bills they were stacking up until \nit got to the height of the Empire State building. That is what our \ndebt was.\n  Of course, now that is what our annual deficit is, has been, and what \nour annual deficit would continue to be under any budget that the \nPresident has come forth with.\n  I am going to keep an open mind. I am hoping the President will come \nforth with something that will keep his commitment that he made during \nthe vote on the continuing resolution a couple weeks ago when he said \nthat he agreed to come up using real numbers, CBO numbers, with a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002.\n  And I agree with the Senator from Idaho that it is so incredibly \nsignificant that we do this and do this now. I have said several times \non the floor, I do not believe if we pass up this opportunity there \nwill be another opportunity in my lifetime to have a balanced budget or \nto seek a balanced budget so we can then start working on reducing the \ndebt that we have piled up in this country.\n  Again, I do not look at this as a fiscal issue. It should not be \nlooked at as a fiscal issue. And every time the liberals, holding on \nwith white knuckles to the past, to the 1960's, to the programs where \nGovernment has the responsibility--an entitlement--to take care of \npeople from the cradle to the grave, that Government cannot afford to \ndo it.\n\n  I look at it as a moral issue when I look at my three grandchildren \nand realize that statistically--and this can all be documented--if we \ndo not do something to change the course that we have set upon, that \nany child, including my three grandchildren, who is born in this \nparticular time, will have to spent 82 percent of his or her lifetime \nincome just to service and support Government.\n  This is morally wrong. For all those people, including the President, \ntrying to hold on to the past, we will win this. When the Senator from \nIdaho said, and I heard the Senator from Wyoming earlier say, this was \na mandate and the elections of 1994--it is clearly a mandate. All the \npostelection surveys show very clearly of all the mandates that came \nwith that election, that totally transformed the makeup of the House \nand the Senate, it was a mandate to balance the budget.\n  We are committed to doing that. We will do everything within our \nbeing to see that it happens.\n  Mr. President, I only have one comment on another subject because I \nthink it is critical that the Senators are all aware that there is \ngoing to be a vote prior to the 14th having to do with the President's \nprogram to deploy troops on the ground in Bosnia.\n  Yesterday at the Senate Armed Services Committee some very revealing \nthings occurred. We had Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili, the \ntwo top people representing the President and his programs to send \ntroops into Bosnia on the ground. They testified. During their \ntestimony, Secretary Perry was talking about all the peace that has \nexisted in the Tuzla area, that northeast sector of Bosnia; General \nShalikashvili was talking about how similar and what a fine job they \nhave done in the training of our troops in the very famous 6- by 12-\nmile box in Germany and how that so nearly equated to the actual \nenvironment in Bosnia.\n  When it came time to cross-examine, I asked General Shalikashvili, \n``Are you aware that the conditions in which you are training these \npeople do not even resemble the conditions in the northeast sector?''\n  He said, ``No.''\n  I said, ``Tell me when the last time you were there was.''\n  At that we discovered, Mr. President, that the man who is the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the architect of the program to \nsend Americans in on the ground in Bosnia, had never been to that part \nof Bosnia where he is proposing to send our troops.\n\n  When Secretary Perry talked about the peace that had been in effect \nthere I asked him a question. I said, ``I was in the Tuzla area. I wore \na shrapnel jacket. I wore a helmet. We could hear the automatic weapons \ngoing off. This is supposedly during a cease-fire. Where is this peace \nyou are talking about, and when is the last time you, Secretary Perry, \nwere in Bosnia?''\n  He said he had never been there, either.\n  For the first time I realized why there is such a disregard for the \nhostility of the area that we are talking about sending our troops in. \nIt is because they have not even been there.\n  I just want to serve notice and make sure that all Senators can be \nthinking about how they will vote on a very simple straight-up \nresolution that merely says we disapprove of the President's program to \nsend ground troops into Bosnia.\n  Of course that does not mean we are disapproving support of the \ntroops. We support our troops wherever they might be. I think we can \ncertainly perform air operations that would be of support to that \nexercise, without endangering the lives of our Americans.\n  Back on the budget, I am convinced that this is our last time in my \nlifetime that we will have to correct a problem that began in the \n1960's, that those individuals--the liberals here in this body and the \nother body and the President of the United States--are trying to hold \non to, as I said before, with white knuckles.\n  I commend the Senator from Idaho for all the efforts he has made and \nthe leadership he has shown in this effort.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted a document from the Heritage Foundation study of the impact of \na balanced budget in tax reductions on the average family.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean for Family \n                             College Costs\n\n                  (John S. Barry, Research Assistant)\n\n       Congress's balanced budget with tax relief legislation will \n     allow families with children to save more money for higher \n     education. A balanced budget with tax cuts also will lead to \n     lower interest rates which will benefit students by lowering \n     the cost of student loans. Both of these consequences of \n     balancing the budget over seven years with tax relief mean \n     more highly skilled Americans for future workforces. These \n     are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation \n     using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. \n     economy.\n       According to this statistical analysis, the Balanced Budget \n     Act developed by Congress would mean:\n       American families, over time, could save an additional \n     $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund college \n     education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax credit. \n     This would cover the full tuition costs at a typical public \n     university today.\n       An average student could save more than $414 over the life \n     of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest \n     rates.\n       Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim \n     econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget \n     plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer \n     & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting \n     firm.\\1\\ The Meyer model is used by many major public \n     agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council \n     of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\\2\\\n     \\1\\ William W. Beach and John S. Barry, ``What a Balanced \n     Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,'' \n     Heritage Foundation F.Y.I.No. 69, November 14, 1995.\n     \\2\\ Laurence H. Meyer & Associates long has earned top honors \n     for forecasting accuracy when compared against similar firms. \n     In 1993, it won the ``Blue Chip'' forecasting award for the \n     years 1989-1992. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates was \n     ineligible for the award in 1994, but again was rated the \n     most accurate forecasting firm in the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n        increased family savings from $500-per-child tax credit\n\n       The high cost of a college education prices many families \n     out of the higher education market or forces students and \n     parents to incur large amounts of debt to cover the costs of \n     college.\n       The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1995 would benefit more than 28 million \n     families raising some 51 million children and could allow \n     many families to save enough money to send their children to \n     college. A family that chooses to dedicate the entire $500-\n     per-child tax credit to savings for higher education would \n     accumulate about $14,066 in today's dollars over 18 years for \n     each child's education. Thus, a family with two children \n     would be able to save an additional $28,132 for college \n     expenses. In today's dollars, an additional $14,066 per child \n     in family savings for education amounts to: Five full years' \n     tuition and fees at an average public university; one full \n     year's tuition and fees at an average private university; or \n     more than the \n\n[[Page S 18124]]\n     difference between the four-year cost of an average public university \n     and the two-year cost of an average public community college.\n\n\n                   lower student loan interest rates\n\n       The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The \n     Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses \n     would face lower interest rates under the congressional \n     balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget \n     and tax policy. Lower interest rates also would benefit \n     students with student loans. A student beginning his or her \n     education in 1996 would face interest rates that averaged \n     half a percentage point below what is expected under current \n     law: a savings of $414 over the life of an average ten-year \n     student loan.\\3\\ More young Americans will be able to afford \n     a college education as a result of these savings. In \n     addition, some students who otherwise would have to defer \n     their education plans could enter college earlier, thus \n     increasing their lifetime earnings.\n     \\3\\ This is based on a student loan of $13,044, the average \n     cost of a public university, at an initial interest rate of \n     8.25 percent. The Heritage Foundation econometric analysis \n     assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in \n     the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains \n     from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of \n     monetary reserves. This assumption means a relatively smaller \n     decrease in interest rates. Thus, the 0.5 percent decrease \n     can be viewed as a conservative estimate of the potential \n     savings to a student from lower interest rates.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Alternatively, lower interest rates would allow students to \n     borrow more money for education at the same effective cost. \n     In essence, students would be able to purchase more education \n     for the same price. The additional $414 might be used for \n     such things as: One full year of books and supplies; two \n     additional courses at an average public university; or about \n     one-third the cost of a personal computer.\n\n\n                         technical assumptions\n\n       For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of \n     the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. \n     Beach and John S. Barry, ``What a Balanced Federal Budget \n     with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,'' Heritage \n     Foundation F.Y.I. No. 69, November 14, 1995.\n       For purposes of calculating the amount of savings from a \n     $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the money was \n     placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget \n     Resolution of 1995) earning a real rate of return of 5 \n     percent per year.\n       The initial rate of interest charged for a student loan was \n     assumed to be 8.25 percent. The 0.5 percent figure is an \n     average decrease below baseline for the life of a ten-year \n     student loan. This 0.5 percent decrease was projected in the \n     above-cited econometric simulation.\n\n   A FAMILY SAVING THE ENTIRE $500 PER CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR 18 YEARS COULD ACCUMULATE $14,066: PAYING FOR THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION AT AN AVERAGE PUBLIC  \n                                         UNIVERSITY OR MORE THAN A YEAR'S WORTH AT A TYPICAL PRIVATE UNIVERSITY                                         \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                             Years of savings                                          Years of savings \n                                         Public university     4 year cost   from the $500 tax     Private university    4 year cost   from the $500 tax\n                                                                              credit will buy                                           credit will buy \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.............................

That is a 7-percent annual increase.\n  Mr. President, tell the truth about the budget that you vetoed. What \nwe heard from you yesterday was not a vision of the future, but was \nlooking back into the spoiled American dream of big Government and big \ndebt that somehow you hung yourself to, that does not represent the \nkind of opportunity that the American family wants and deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to commend an \noutstanding South Dakota writer, Lawrence Brown of Buffalo, SD. \nLawrence is a South Dakotan who has put his appreciation for his State \ndown on paper. His book, ``Buffalo Commons Memoirs,'' brings to light \nlife on the upper plains and the reasons why life in America's \nheartland is so rewarding.\n  As I read ``Buffalo Commons Memoirs,'' I was reminded of my own \nexperience growing up on a farm in Humboldt, SD. As some of my \ncolleagues know, life on a farm is not always easy. Early mornings and \nlate nights during planting and harvest seasons come with the \nterritory. However, Lawrence Brown reminds us correctly that hard work \nbuilds character. Although Lawrence grew up on the farm at an earlier \ntime, I am pleased to note the same solid Midwestern work ethic has \nbeen passed on to today's young South Dakotans.\n  Mr. President, Lawrence writes in his chronicles that he chose to \nspend his life in a small city in western South Dakota. Lawrence, like \nso many South Dakotans, particularly new residents who have moved from \nother States, has realized that South Dakotans recognize the important \nthings in life--the values of family, friends and community. Mr. \nPresident, I am proud to represent people such as Lawrence Brown--\npeople who appreciate the things in life that matter most, and live \neach day to its very fullest. I would like to share an excerpt from \nLawrence Brown's book with my colleagues. I am confident that they, \ntoo, will enjoy Lawrence's entertaining work. I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a section from ``Buffalo Commons \nMemoirs.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Perhaps some grandkid some time may be interested in my \n     autobiography, but for a relatively obscure aggie, \n     sheepherder, rancher and plainsman the personal aspect of \n     this project is probably pointless. To validate the effort it \n     must portray some history and some custom and culture of this \n     corner of America.\n       A record of bits and pieces of history beyond scientific or \n     political data can give us an insight into where we have \n     been. And where we have been may give us some direction on \n     where we should go. It may even guide us on how to get there. \n     Beyond that, it could also tell us that our expectations are \n     too high and maybe we should be satisfied with what we have, \n     who we are, and where we are.\n       Hardly a personal visit or social call goes by but we have \n     gained something from the other's recent or distant past.\n       Most of our history lies out in area cemeteries never to be \n     retrieved or vouched for accuracy. If there is anything to a \n     psychic connection, it would have to be part of our memories \n     as they relate to people we once knew. Certainly, if we give \n     some thought to friends who have gone over that great divide, \n     a memory will come back of a shared conversation or \n     experience. There is nothing supernatural about that.\n       One problem that I run into is the experts of English and \n     Grammar. As I pass my stuff along for critique, I run into \n     those who either went to more school than I or paid more \n     attention while they were there. Good grammar is a wonderful \n     art and I admire people who can combine it with the delivery \n     of a message. But well-meaning people have corrected and \n     rephrased some of my stuff until the meaning was gone. Anyone \n     who has ever tried to read a government document has no doubt \n     discovered that literary correctness and the delivery of \n     information are not necessarily compatible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18125-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO OLIN BROOKS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Olin Brooks, \nwho is retiring this month from the Bankruptcy Administrator's Office. \nHe is the estate analyst in the Anniston Bankruptcy Administrator's \nOffice for the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Alabama.\n  Born in 1933, Olin attended Woodlawn High School in Birmingham. After \nhigh school, he served in the U.S. Air Force for 2 years. He later \nattended Auburn University, receiving his bachelor of science degree in \n1959 and his law degree from the Birmingham School of Law in 1970.\n  From 1959 until 1962, he worked for the State of Alabama Department \nof Revenue as a revenue representative. He worked for the Internal \nRevenue Service from 1962 through 1987, eventually moving into a \nmanagement and advisory position in the Bankruptcy Division of the IRS \nSpecial Procedures Office.\n  I am pleased to commend and congratulate Olin Brooks for his many \nyears of service to his State and Nation. I wish him all the best for a \nlong and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18125-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO FRANCES MARION GRANT BENNETT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary \nwoman, Frances Marion Grant Bennett. On November 17, 1995, Frances \npassed away leaving behind an incredible legacy of service and love.\n  Frances comes from and leaves behind a remarkable heritage. She was \nborn in Salt Lake City, UT, on September 23, 1899, and was the last \nsurviving child of the late Latter-day Saints Church President Heber J. \nGrant, and his wife Emily Wells Grant. She was also the wife of a U.S. \nSenator, Wallace F. Bennett, who served for 24 years in the U.S. \nSenate; and was the mother of five children, including Robert F. \nBennett, currently serving in the U.S. Senate. In addition, she was the \ngrandmother of 29, and the great-grandmother of 74. Her family members \nadore, praise, and love her with all of their hearts.\n  Frances was an accomplished musician. She was a gifted pianist and \nstudent. She received a bachelor's degree in music from the University \nof Utah, and studied at Radcliffe College. She taught music at the \nUniversity of Utah before her marriage to her husband.\n  Frances was a tireless worker. She served for many years on the \ngeneral board of the Primary Organization for the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. In this capacity she was able to \npositively influence thousands of children's lives through her \nkindness, words of wisdom, and love and affection. As a board member, \nFrances chaired the fundraising committee to build the Primary \nChildren's Hospital in Salt Lake City, now the finest children's \nhospital in the Intermountain West. The significance of her work in \nthis area can never be measured. Thousands of children each year from \nacross the United States are treated and helped at this Children's \nHospital. I am sure that there are many mothers and fathers, as well as \nlittle children, that would thank Frances for her undying efforts on \ntheir behalf.\n  In Washington, DC, Mrs. Bennett was a supportive and helpful partner \nto her husband during many years of public service. She served as \npresident of the Congressional Club, a group of congressional wives. \nShe wrote about many of her experiences in Washington, and with her \nfamily, in her autobiography, ``Glimpses of a Mormon Family.''\n  Mrs. Bennett's friends describe her as gracious, gentle, regal, and \nwarm. When you met her, her goodness was immediately apparent. She \ntreated people with great kindness and respect. She raised a wonderful \nfamily, and will be missed by all.\n  Mr. President, Utah was fortunate to have Frances Marion Grant \nBennett as a citizen.

Mr. President, I was deeply saddened last week when I \nlearned of the death of our beloved former chaplain, the Rev. Richard \nC. Halverson.\n  Reverend Halverson served as Chaplain of the Senate for 14 years, \nassuming this post on February 22, 1981. He \n\n[[Page S 18126]]\nretired on February 5, 1995. I regret that his retirement, the time he \nhad so looked forward to spending with his family and many friends, was \ncut so short.\n  But, the time and service he gave to the Senate will always be \nappreciated by those of us who benefited from his positive outlook and \nhis constant good humor. Rarely was Dr. Halverson seen by Senators, \nstaff, or support personnel without a smile and a ``God bless you.''\n  And, perhaps the one thing I admired most about Dr. Halverson was the \nfact that he served not only the institution of the Senate, but also \nSenators as individuals. He could see beyond policy debates, beyond \npartisan politics, beyond institutional glamour and mire. He could look \nbeyond our roles on this great international stage and help us carry \nthe burdens we felt as husbands or wives, parents, neighbors, or \nfriends.\n  Though ordained as clergy in the Presbyterian denomination, his \nministry reached out to us all. Catholic, Jew, Methodist, or Mormon, \nDr. Halverson helped us all to remember that our walk in faith was \ninfinitely more important than any legislative battle of the moment.\n  Like all Senators, I mourn the death of this man of God, but give \nthanks for the opportunity to have known him and to have served this \nbody with him. I join my colleagues in extending heartfelt sympathy to \nhis family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18125-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND THE LABOR, HHS, AND EDUCATION \n                     APPROPRIATIONS BILL--H.R. 2127\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Labor, HHS, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to update the Senate on \nthe status of the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill, H.R. \n2127, as it relates to the continuing resolution and the implications \nof the Senate's inaction on the bill for programs of the Department of \nLabor, HHS, and Education. In particular, I want to focus on the need \nto free up low-income energy assistance funds, which are so crucial at \nthis time of year, when winter descends upon cold water States.\n  As Senators know, the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1996 is still on the Calendar. Efforts to bring it up \nin the Senate have been met with a filibuster due to the ``striker \nreplacement'' provision and the abortion issue. I opposed the ``striker \nreplacement provision being added to the bill in committee, because of \nthe view that controversial legislative riders do not belong on an \nappropriation bill, but should be considered through the authorization \nprocess. In the case of the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations \nbill, the legislative riders included by the House have stalled action \non this important bill in the Senate, and indefinitely postponed \nfunding for education, health, job training, and social service \nprograms in this fiscal year.\n  While the continuing resolution will ensure that some funding will be \navailable for these programs, it is only on a short-term basis and at a \nminimal level. But, in some cases, the CR level effectively eliminates \nthe viability of the program. The LIHEAP Program is one such example. \nLIHEAP provides funds to States to help low-income households meet \ntheir fuel bills during the winter months when costs soar due to cold \nweather. A high percentage of the program's beneficiaries are elderly \nand disabled people who need help in paying their fuel bills.\n\n  Mr. President, it is already very cold in many parts of the Nation. \nOur reliance on continuing resolutions since October 1 has put LIHEAP \nfunds in jeopardy. Under the terms of the continuing resolution, $231 \nmillion has been made available to the States. This is far short of the \nnearly $600 million already requested by the States to get through the \nfirst quarter of the fiscal year. In previous years an average of 60 \npercent of the annual appropriation for LIHEAP has been allocated to \nthe States in the first quarter, and 90 percent by March 30.\n  Many States have begun receiving requests for assistance, and under \nnormal circumstances would begin distributing funds to participants at \nthis time. However, because of the present stalemate in the Senate on \nthe Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill, States have no idea \nhow to plan for this winter's program, and hundreds of thousands of \nlow-income families are left wondering how they will be able to meet \ntheir winter heating bills. Low-income households, as well as Governors \nand local officials across the country are waiting to learn whether, \nand how much, funding will be appropriated for this winter's LIHEAP \nProgram.\n  For low-income residents of cold-weather States like Pennsylvania, \nwinter can mean choosing between eating and heating. We must not let \nour budgetary stalemate in the Nation's Capitol unduly burden the poor \nand elderly with respect to such a basic need as heated homes and \napartments.\n  I have supported the previous continuing resolutions because they \nprovide critical short-term funding for Federal activities. But I want \nto make clear, it is time for the Senate to act on the Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. Let's stop the \nfilibuster, agree to bring up the bill, debate it, and let the Senate \nwork its will.\n  In the meantime, it is imperative that the harsh restrictions on \nfunding for LIHEAP be lifted. It is unfair to hold hostage essential \nassistance to the poor and elderly in cold weather States as Congress \ncontinues to deliberate on the budget.\n  Mr. President, winter's cold knows no political affiliation. The \nLIHEAP Program has had years of bipartisan support. Now is the time for \nall Senators to work together to ensure that our constituents in need \nare not denied heating assistance this winter.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18126-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18126-S18127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM K. SAHR, LEGAL CHAMPION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the legal profession in my home State of \nSouth Dakota has lost a great counsel. Bill Sahr, a long-time friend \nand supporter, passed away on Monday. I will miss him.\n  For many years, Bill headed the State Bar of South Dakota. In that \ncapacity, he epitomized the very best of the legal profession in our \nState. An indefatigable worker on behalf of the legal community, Bill \nalso served the people of our State and Nation with great distinction.\n  Bill's public service career began with a memorable tour of duty with \nthe U.S. Army during World War II. During the war, he was with the \ntroops at the Battle of the Bulge, later receiving four battle stars \nalong with his European Medal. Beginning his legal career in our \nState's capital, Pieree, Bill later served two terms as State's \nattorney from Hughes County. In 1962, Bill began walking the two blocks \nfrom the lovely historic home he shared with his wife Carla and their \nchildren to the State capitol, where he served two terms as a \nlegislator.\n  His legal background, coupled with his legislative experience, made \nBill a perfect candidate to head the State Bar of South Dakota. Bill \nplayed a major role in shaping and bringing into being South Dakota's \npresent-day legal system. It is hard to imagine anyone who had more \ninfluence on the legal system and the profession of law in our State \nthan Bill Sahr.\n  In addition to being a great professional, Bill Sahr was a great \nindividual. He had a quiet demeanor coupled with a keen intellect and \nsharp wit. You could count on his word. Bill's engaging smile made you \nwant to stay and listen to him while he worked his quiet, highly \neffective powers of persuasion upon you.\n  During his threescore and eleven years on this earth, Bill Sahr \naccomplished the work of several lifetimes for the profession he loved \nand the people of South Dakota. Bill Sahr--a legal legend of our \nState--will be truly missed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the obituary for Bill Sahr from the \nDecember 5, 1995, edition of the Sioux Falls Argus Leader be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Argus Leader, Dec. 5, 1995]\n\n             Sahr, 71, Worked Hard to Help Judicial System\n\n                         (By Denise D. Tucker)\n\n       Pierre.--With a quiet and unassuming manner, Bill Sahr \n     often stood in the shadows and rarely took credit for the \n     work that he did in shaping the South Dakota legal system.\n     \n[[Page S 18127]]\n\n       ``He had a hand or influence on every lawyer in the state \n     for 35 years,'' said Thomas Barnett, executive director of \n     the South Dakota Bar Association in Pierre.\n       Sahr, 71, who was serving as secretary-treasury of the \n     State Bar Association, died Monday, Dec. 4, 1995, at his \n     home, due to lung cancer.\n       ``He had a history of over 30 years in Bar leadership,'' \n     said Barnett. ``I was fortunate to work with him through most \n     of my career.''\n       During his career, Sahr, through the Bar Association, \n     established the nation's first prepaid continuing legal \n     education; he spearheaded legislative approval for passage of \n     funding for a new University of South Dakota Law School; and \n     worked for improvement of judicial compensation.\n       He also introduced the first bill for a state employee \n     retirement system. ``This was a biggie for the state,'' said \n     Sahr's son, Dan of Sioux Falls. ``Before that there was \n     nothing for state employees.''\n       Barnett said, ``He worked to serve the people of South \n     Dakota. He was instrumental in lobbying pieces that helped \n     everybody.''\n       Beresford attorney Robert ``Bob'' Frieberg acknowledged \n     Sahr's contribution to the state.\n       ``His influence shaped the Bar, judiciary and modern legal \n     system in South Dakota,'' he said. ``His was the biggest \n     influence of a single person.''\n       Frieberg said that Sahr was committed to improve the legal \n     system whenever he could.\n       Although he didn't know for sure, Frieberg believed that \n     Sahr had a sense that he had an obligation to leave the world \n     better than he found it.\n       ``He was just a neat guy,'' he said. ``One of a kind. I'm \n     gonna miss him.''\n       With a tear sliding down his face, Frieberg added, ``He was \n     a great friend.''\n       Sahr's legal career began in 1957, when he opened a law \n     practice in Pierre. He served for two terms as the Hughes \n     County States Attorney, from 1958 to 1962. He then served two \n     terms in the South Dakota House of Representatives, from 1962 \n     to 1967. He was elected in 1961 as secretary-treasurer of the \n     state Bar. He retired on July 31, 1989, from his position as \n     executive director of the Bar Association, after 28 years \n     with the organization.\n       William Karcher Sahr was born July 21, 1924, in Pierre. He \n     attended Pierre Public School and was graduated from Lake \n     Forest Academy, Lake Forest, Ill., in 1942.\n       He served in the Army from 1943 to 1946, during World War \n     II. He served in the Battle of the Bulge. He received the \n     European Medal with four Battle Stars.\n       In 1954, he graduated from Northwestern University in \n     Evanston, Ill., and from its law school in 1957.\n       He married Carla Aplan in 1953.\n       From 1973 to 1978, he was a member of the Pierre Board of \n     Education. He also served on the St. Mary's Hospital Law \n     Advisory Board, president of the Pierre Carnegie Library \n     Board for 19 years, and on the Pierre City Board of \n     Adjustment for 10 years.\n       He was a member of the Pierre Area Chamber of Commerce, \n     American Legion, VFW, the Elks Club, Sts. Peter and Paul \n     Catholic Church, the American Bar Association, the Jackrabbit \n     Bar Association, and the National Association of Bar \n     Executives.\n       He received a Recognition Award from the University of \n     South Dakota Law School in 1982, the Appreciation Award from \n     the South Dakota Trial Lawyers Association, and the McKusick \n     Award from the USD School of Law in 1987.\n       ``He was proud of this,'' Dan Sahr said, of his father \n     receiving the McKusick Award.\n       The award recognizes an outstanding member of the South \n     Dakota legal community for contributions to the profession.\n       In addition to his wife and son, survivors include four \n     other children: James, Los Angeles; Marguerite Moreland, \n     Littleton, Colo.; Elizabeth Squyer, Sioux Falls; and Robert, \n     Boulder, Colo.\n       Services, for Sahr, begin at 11 a.m. Thursday in Sts.

Mr. President, I strongly support Senate Joint Resolution \n31, which amends the Constitution to protect the flag of the United \nStates from those who would desecrate it.\n  The American flag is a national symbol of the values this country was \nfounded on. Many Americans have fought and died to defend these values \nand this country. It is an insult to these patriots, their relatives, \nand all other citizens who hold this country dear, to burn or desecrate \nthe symbol of our Nation and our freedom.\n  I certainly support the right of all citizens to freedom of speech, \nbut that right has never been absolute in our country. That is why \nthere are laws against libel, slander, perjury, and obscenity. \nSimilarly, our freedom of political expression is also limited. No one \ncan legally deface the Supreme Court building or the Washington \nMonument, no matter how much he or she might wish to protest a \nparticular government policy or law. The American flag, deserves \nspecial protection under the Constitution. It simply is not necessary \nto commit an act of violence against this flag to register protest \nagainst the Government. Passage of Senate Joint Resolution 31 will help \nensure our national symbol receives the respect and protection it \ndeserves.\n  Again, Mr. President, I offer my strong support for Senate Joint \nResolution 31 and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18127-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REV.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 1, 1995.)\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to proceed today with the \nconference report on the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations.\n  This legislation comes forward after a considerable amount of \nactivity and, obviously, some ups and downs on the road to passage. It \nis, however, I believe, an excellent piece of legislation in light of \nthe hand which has been dealt. Clearly, in an attempt to balance this \nbudget, we have had to make some significant reductions in this account \noverall in order to meet our goal of a balanced budget within 7 years. \nThe numbers which were assigned to us by the Budget Committee and then \nallocated to us by the Appropriations Committee put us to the test in \nthe area of trying to reach this goal. But I believe we have reached it \nin a very positive and responsible way.\n  The essential thrust of this bill is to make sure that we adequately \nfund the activities of our criminal justice system and to make sure \nthat we have \n\n[[Page S 18128]]\nadequate moneys and make available to the States adequate funds to \nundertake an aggressive posture relative to trying to control the \nspread of violence and crime in our Nation.\n  As a result, we have committed a significant increase in dollars to \nthe Department of Justice, approximately a 19.2-percent increase over \nthe 1995 level. That increase in funding in the Department of Justice \nhas come in the context of an overall reduction in funding for the bill \ngenerally of approximately $756 million.\n  Thus, in order to accomplish that, we obviously had to take some \nfunds from some of the other agencies. We have significantly reduced \nthe funding, for example, in the area of the Department of Commerce and \nin the area of the State Department. In making those decisions to \nreduce funds in those two areas, I believe we have done it in a very \nconstructive way. We have in the State Department, for example, fully \nfunded, to the best of our ability anyway, the activities of the \noperations of the State Department. We made sure that the salary cap \naccounts and the construction accounts and the day-to-day functions of \nthe State Department are funded in a manner which they feel they can \naccept.\n  We have not, on the other hand, made a major commitment to the U.N. \nfunding. We have funded the international organizations efforts and \npeacekeeping efforts, but we have kept the funding levels at a very \nlow, or at least conservative, number, because we feel that is an \nappropriate decision. From my standpoint, I would rather be fighting \ncrime in the United States and spending money on that than necessarily \nfunding international organizations and peacekeeping at the United \nNations.\n  In the area of the Commerce Department, we have also made some very \ndifficult decisions, but in the process, I think they are constructive \ndecisions. We have, for example, funded very aggressively NOAA, which \ndoes very strong, effective research in the area of protecting the \noceans, which are critical assets of not only our Nation but the world. \nAt the same time we have, however, cut the overall funding for the \nDepartment of Commerce by approximately 14 percent below what it was \nfunded at last year. So we have gone 14 percent below a freeze for the \nDepartment of Commerce. In order to accomplish that, we have had to \nreduce funding in a number of accounts, obviously, within the \nDepartment of Commerce. But I think the decisions for those reductions \nhave been thoughtful and appropriate.\n\n  Again, with the Small Business Administration, we have reduced the \nfunding of the Small Business Administration by a considerable amount. \nBut I believe we have given them still the capacity to go forward and \nparticipate in the process of funding initiatives to assist in the \ncreation of jobs effectively.\n  So, overall, this is a bill which accomplishes our major goals, the \nfirst goal being to live up to our obligations to balance the budget \nand, therefore, make the difficult decisions which require reducing of \nfunding and, in the area of the Department of Commerce, move toward \nbasically its elimination. At the same time that we are moving toward a \nbalanced budget, we have made a very strong and aggressive commitment \nto the Department of Justice and to crime fighting.\n  On that specific area, I think it is important to note that one of \nthe issues of the debate is the manner in which we pursue these crime-\nfighting initiatives. We have proposed in this bill that a large amount \nof the violent crime trust fund will be sent back to the States in the \nform of a block grant which will emphasize and encourage the use of \nthose funds for the addition of police officers on the streets but will \nnot require that those funds be used for the addition of police \nofficers on the streets.\n  This is a departure from what the administration position was or what \nthey desired. The administration, of course, has taken great pride in \nits proposal which created cops on the beat and their theory, and we \nrespect that. But we happen to feel that a much more logical way to \napproach this is to say to the local policing authority to get what \nthey need. Do you need police officers on the street, or do you need \nthe ability to communicate with your police officers on the beat, or do \nyou need the ability to make sure that your police officers on the beat \nhave adequate equipment in order to defend themselves?\n  We think it is much more appropriate to leave the decision as to \nwhether or not the funds should be used for the creation of additional \npolice on the street or whether it should be used in order to make the \npolice who are on the street more effective in their job up to the \nlocal law enforcement agencies who are on the front lines and who have \na much higher level of awareness of what is needed.\n  We also felt that the President's proposal had some fundamental \nflaws. The basic one was that the way it was structured most of the \ncommunities which would have added police officers would find that at \nthe end of 4 years they would have to have picked up the whole cost of \nthat police officer's salary. We think that in the end, rather than \nencouraging more police officers on the street, it would end up with \napproximately the same number of police officers on the street and that \nthe number that has been thrown out by the administration is an extreme \nexaggeration of the numbers of new officers who might actually end up \non the street, the number the administration talks about being \nsomewhere around 100,000, when in actuality the number they proposed \nwould have been somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 during the periods \nthe funds were available and, after the funds were terminated, in our \nopinion, would have been less.\n  In addition, we feel strongly in structuring the use of the violent \ncrime trust fund significant dollars should be put into one-time items \nso that we are not creating programmatic events which we become \nresponsible for at the end of the violent crime trust fund's period of \nexistence, and thus we have encouraged things like one-time items that \nwould encourage prison construction and activities such as that where \nwe think we can help out the States as they go forward with their \nattempts to improve their criminal justice systems but not end up \nsigning on to a program where we become liable for the States' \nresponsibilities as far as the eye can see.\n  In addition, we have strongly supported, for example, some of the \ninitiatives which have traditionally been built up under the criminal \njustice system and which we think are important such as the Violence \nAgainst Women Act which receives a sixfold increase over the 1995 \nfunding level and which we think is a very appropriate initiative.\n  This is a quick outline. As we move forward this afternoon in \ndiscussing this bill further, we will get into more specifics, but at \nthis time I would like to yield to my ranking member and colleague, \nwhose knowledge and history of this legislation far exceeds anything I \nwill ever obtain, and whose support and thoughtful advice and guidance \nI greatly appreciated during the process of putting this bill together, \nfor whom I always had a great deal of respect, having gotten to know \nhim when he was in New Hampshire on occasion a few years ago, but that \nrespect has only grown exponentially as a result of my having had a \nchance to work with him in this committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will yield to my colleague first I \nthink for his unanimous-consent request.\n\n  Has the unanimous-consent request already been made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I do not believe so.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the President aware of the unanimous consent relative \nto time limitations?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I believe it is 2 hours to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, 2 hours for this Senator on this side, 2 hours for \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], and 20 minutes for \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was apparently agreed to earlier. We are \noperating under that agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. In that case I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me thank the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. President, right to the point, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire is not just a quick study but a \n\n[[Page S 18129]]\nquick excellent study. A year ago, perhaps a little more, he was not on \nthe subcommittee involved in all of these hearings. The bill presently \npresented by the distinguished Senator and conference report was not \nworked upon by him until it got into conference, and yet within \nconference--I emphasized the quick study--the Senator from New \nHampshire approached it in a brilliant and thorough fashion--I might \nadd, in an almost Mansfield-like fashion. I remember the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Mansfield. When you asked him a question, he \nsaid, ``Yup'' and ``Nope.'' When I asked for things to try to get in \nthis bill, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire said, ``Nope.'' \nI learned that this outstanding Yankee is of a singular mind, and he \nknows how to make a decision, which is unusual in Washington.\n  I really respect and admire the way he has gone about this in a very, \nvery thorough fashion. I emphasize that because I am not in a position \non final vote to support the measure for various misgivings. I made \nthat clear. But in making that clear, I wish to make it equally clear \nthat we have been in a sort of cooperative manner trying to reconcile \ndifferences. That is the Government itself, the art of compromise. And \nrealistically, there are many things in the bill, in the conference \nreport that the distinguished chairman, Senator Gregg, perhaps would \nnot have included or some things that he wished had been included. That \nis the same with this particular Senator. We have the House side to \nsatisfy as well as the Senate side and we have worked diligently, at \nleast the distinguished chairman has worked diligently with staffs on \nboth sides and with this particular Senator, and I am grateful for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement before us provides $27.3 \nbillion for programs and agencies funded in the Commerce, Justice, \nState, and the judiciary appropriations bill. Of this amount, almost $4 \nbillion is for appropriations from the violent crime reduction trust \nfund. For regular discretionary appropriations this agreement provides \n$22.656 billion. This amount is $3.753 billion below the President's \nbudget request, and $759 million below the level available in fiscal \nyear 1995. I would note, however, that it represents an increase of \n$212 million above the level in the Senate-passed bill.\n  Before discussing the conference report, I would like to note that \nthis bill is being managed by our new subcommittee chairman, Senator \nJudd Gregg of New Hampshire. He took over this subcommittee in October \nfollowing Senate passage of H.R. 2076. So he was tasked with \nshepherding a bill through conference that he did not draft. I will \ntell you he is a quick study and he has mastered this bill as quickly \nas anyone I have ever seen. And, I think it is fair to say that this is \nthe most diverse and most complicated of the 13 appropriations bills. \nHe has impressed everyone associated with the bill and has done an \noutstanding job.\n  Mr. President, when I signed this conference report I wrote ``with \nreservations'' under my name. And, I will discuss these reservations, \nthese problems I have with this agreement shortly. But, I would like to \nfirst make a few comments about what I do support in this conference \nreport.\n\n\n                            law enforcement\n\n  First, it continues to bolster our law enforcement agencies and the \nFederal Judiciary. Justice Department programs are significantly \nincreased. Here are some examples:\n  U.S. attorneys are provided $926 million, an increase of $73 million \nover fiscal year 1995. That's an additional 450 U.S. attorney \npositions.\n  The Federal Bureau of Prisons receives $2.9 billion, an increase of \n$306 million over this year. This funding supports construction of new \nFederal prisons and additional operating funds to open prisons that are \ncoming on line. It provides funding to deal with quelling the unrest \nthat has recently occurred in our Federal prisons.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is provided $2.557 \nbillion, an increase of $487 million above the current year. And, \nwithin this account to ensure that funds go to where the Congress \nintends, we have earmarked appropriations that support the Border \nPatrol.\n  Finally, Judge Freeh and the FBI are provided $2.505 billion, an \nincrease of $224 million. The conferees have focused our efforts on \nrebuilding the FBI's infrastructure. So included are: funds to get the \nNCIC 2000 crime data base up and operating; $30 million for renovations \nto the FBI training academy at Quantico, VA; and $57 million for the \nfirst phase of a new FBI forensic facility to be located at Fort \nBelvoir, VA. We all saw the importance of DNA evidence and the \nimportance of validating such evidence beyond any doubt during the \nrecent Simpson-Goldman murder trial. The FBI laboratory needs to be \nmodernized and enhanced so Federal prosecutors and FBI evidence are not \nsuccessfully challenged as was the case in the O.J. trial.\n  Violence against women grants are funded at $175 million, the \nPresident's request. This is $149 million above this year and $50 \nmillion above the House bill.\n  For agencies other than Justice and the judiciary, it is really a \nquestion of bad news-good news. The bad news is that almost no other \nagency received appropriations above the current fiscal year. Getting \nup to a freeze was a major accomplishment. But the good news is that \nmost other agencies have survived at a funding level that enables them \nto continue to operate, albeit at a reduced level. Take the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, probably the most \npopular agency in this bill. NOAA is our Nation's principal \nenvironmental sciences agency. It is the agency that procures and \noperates our weather satellites and it is for the oceans what NASA is \nto space. In past years our CJS bill increase NOAA just as we have \nincreased Justice.\n  But in this agreement, NOAA is provided $1.853 billion--$59 million \nbelow a freeze, and $244 million less than the President's budget \nrequest. The good news is that it could have been worse. Thanks to \nefforts by Members like our distinguished chairman, Senator Hatfield, \nthis agreement provides NOAA with a level that is $79 million over what \nthe House crowd would have provided and only $13 million less than the \nSenate-passed bill.\n  So, like NOAA, many of these other agencies are not doing well, but \nthey are surviving. My colleagues need to be put on notice now, \nhowever, that there are going to be reductions in force, office \nclosures, and contract terminations. SBA is going to close offices and \nthere are going to be significant reductions in force in Commerce and \nin independent agencies. You cannot provide these levels of funding \nwithout such impacts.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that we can debate this bill quickly and \nget it down to the White House. President Clinton has stated that he \nwill veto it and I must concur with his position. There are several \nareas that are unacceptable to both the President and most Members on \nthis side of the aisle. I will briefly mention several.\n\n\n                            cops on the beat\n\n  First, this bill terminates the Cops on the Beat Program and the Drug \nCourt Program. It seeks to rewrite the 1994 crime bill and provide \nfunds instead to Governors and mayors for a block grant program. This \nisn't a money issue; the funds are available in a separate account \nunder the violent crime trust fund. So, what this is about is politics, \nand I might add pretty dumb politics at that.\n  I will put a more complete statement regarding the COPS Program in \nthe Record. But, let me summarize my position.\n  First, the COPS Program is focused and well managed. In just 2 years \nit has gotten 26 thousand additional police out on the streets across \nAmerica.\n  Second, the COPS Program has a component that is targeted to small, \nrural communities. It deals with sheriffs and small town police chiefs \ndirectly. Across South Carolina you can survey the most conservative, \nRepublican law enforcement officials and they will tell you that the \nCops on the Beat Program is the best thing the Federal Government has \never done.\n  Third, there is no education in the second kick of a mule. Sometimes \nI would appreciate it if Speaker Newt Gingrich and the House crowd \nrealized that experience and institutional memory are not necessarily \nbad. We already had a local law enforcement block grant in the Federal \nGovernment. It was called the Law Enforcement Assistance \nAdministration, or LEAA. I \n\n[[Page S 18130]]\nwas here when we created it and when we had to kill it because of \nwaste. Mayors were buying tanks and corporate jets. Jimmy Carter came \nup to Washington after seeing LEAA waste at the State level and said \n``kill this turkey.'' So for over $8 billion we got nothing to show for \nLEAA except we let Federal funds be wasted, while for $1.3 billion we \nalready have gotten 26,000 police through COPS.\n  Fourth, Bill Clinton is right. The war on crime is being fought \nprincipally at the local level and police are our foot soldiers, our \nmarines, sailors, and airmen. I've heard all this mumbo jumbo about \nlocal flexibility. The last time I checked, 10 out of 10 people who \ncall the police for help are calling for a police officer. There just \nisn't a better use of this crime bill trust fund than to hire more \npolice officers. I don't want to see this money raided by Governors and \nlocal elected officials, I want it to go directly to sheriffs and \npolice chiefs as is the case now.\n  Support for police always has been a solid, bipartisan value. I would \nurge my Republican colleagues not to become antipolice simply because \nPresident Clinton supports this program. you attacked the President in \nMarch 1993 because he proposed more money for community development \nblock grants, and for days we listened to you list every wasteful \nproject that could potentially be funded through block grants because \nof local flexibility. I urge you to get your staff to pull out the \nCongressional Record and to reread your own words. And I would urge you \nreread your statements regarding the crime bill. The distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, among others, talked about the \nimportance of getting 100,000 more cops.\n\n  The President will veto over the COPS Program alone. I support him. \nIt is my hope that this program and the Drug Court Program will be \nrestored during round two of this bill after the veto. I know Senator \nBiden will have more to say about this issue.\n\n\n                           commerce programs\n\n  Second, this conference agreement terminates the Commerce \nDepartment's Advanced Technology Program [ATP]. It does not even \nprovide funds for the Federal Government to make good on its prior year \ncommitments to industry under ATP cooperative agreements. When we \ncompleted the fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill, we provided $431 \nmillion for the ATP. In this bill there is no funding.\n  The ATP provides funds for cooperative agreements with industry to \nshare the risk, on a 50-50 share basis for high-risk, precompetitive \ntechnologies that have potential for significant economic growth. What \nwe are doing in this program is providing the necessary R that \nenables entrepreneurs and small companies to be able to take an R \nproject from concept to proof of principle. It is a fully competitive \nprogram and every award is made by peer review panels. Neither the \nPresident, the Secretary of Commerce, nor any Senator has the ability \nto influence which companies receive ATP awards. This program is run \nfully on the basis of merit.\n  Now, just meeting prior year commitments--that is to fund the Federal \nshare of awards made before this year, requires appropriations totaling \n$290 million. Again, I'm afraid this aspect of the conference report is \nabout politics and not substance. This is about the former Democratic \nParty Chairman David Wilhelm making a comment something to the effect \nthat ``California is the end all and be all of politics and Ron Brown \nhas the program.'' Yes, the fact is that many ATP awards do go to \nCalifornia companies, and Massachusetts companies and Pennsylvania \ncompanies. It shouldn't take a NIST PhD to realize that ATP awards are \ngoing to go predominantly to parts of the country that have \nconcentrations of high-technology industry.\n  This is exactly the type of program we should be funding if we are \ngoing to compete effectively in the trade war, now that the cold war is \nover. Our Republican colleagues have shown that they do support many \nFederal technology programs, including NASA aeronautics, high-\nperformance computing, and cooperative research and development \nagreements. They recognize that developing new precompetitive \ntechnologies is important to the long-term future of our country. This \nhas been the case in other appropriations bills. So why oppose what is \nclearly one of the best-run Federal technology programs, one that is \nnever porked, and one that already is leading to some major technical \nbreakthroughs? Republican support for technology programs generally \nmakes their decision regarding the ATP all the more regrettable and \nmistaken.\n  The President realizes the importance of ATP and that is exactly why \nthe absence of ATP funding is another reason for him to veto this \nconference report. Even if my Republican colleagues will not agree to \nfund new ATP grants, it would only seem fair that they fulfill past \nyears commitments made by the Federal Government.\n  Third, though this is not a veto issue, I strongly disagree with the \nconferees decision to terminate the U.S. Travel and Tourism \nAdministration [USTTA]. I argued against the House position and for the \nSenate position which reflected the amendment that Senators Bryan and \nBurns had made to the bill in September. Unfortunately, my colleagues \nin the conference did not see the issue as I do.\n  USTTA costs only $17 million a year and provides a lot of bang for \nthe buck. Almost every other country maintains a tourism promotion \nprogram, and so should we. I created USTTA. It is simply too \ninefficient having every State in this country running its own tourism \npromotion effort overseas. And, in Greg Farmer, we have the most \neffective director of USTTA that we have ever had.\n  Tourism is big business and should not be given short shrift. It \nemploys 6 million Americans and is the leading employer in 13 States. \nSouth Carolina is one of those States and we have almost 200,000 people \nemployed in some aspect of the industry. This year we expect over \n700,000 international visitors in my State.\n  I think this conference has made a big mistake.\n\n\n                             legal services\n\n  With respect to Legal Services, the conference agreement provides \n$278 million instead of $340 million as proposed by the Senate. I think \nSenator Pete Domenici deserves a lot of credit for having led the fight \nto save the Legal Services Corporation, when Senator Gramm proposed \nterminating the Corporation. And, Senator Domenici was in charge of our \nnegotiations with the House. I think he would be the first to say that \nwhen this bill goes to round two, Legal Services is an area we need to \nget more funding for.\n  Finally, I think it is obvious that the amounts provided for \ninternational organizations and U.N. peacekeeping are far below the \nlevel the President considers adequate. This is not a heartburn area \nfor me, for years I have criticized U.N. peacekeeping as ineffective. \nIt often seems in areas like Somalia and Bosnia, that United States \nforces are needed to rescue U.N. peacekeepers. The program just doesn't \nmake sense.\n  But, I think it is clear that international organizations and \npeacekeeping will need higher funding levels if the President is going \nto ultimately sign this bill.\n  In summary, I want to acknowledge the hard work of Chairman Gregg and \nMr. Rogers and their staffs. I especially want to recognize the \ncontributions of David Taylor, Scott Corwin, and Vas Alexopoulos, of \nthe majority staff.\n  This represents the first CJS conference reports that I cannot \nsupport. I hope that the chairman will realize that this is because of \ndecisions that were made by his leadership. Principally the termination \nof the Cops on the Beat Program and the ATP. I simply cannot support \nthose decisions.\n  It is my hope that this bill will be sent to the President \nexpeditiously. I fully expect that it will be vetoed. I believe that \nthis will be only the second time in history that a CJS appropriations \nbill has been vetoed.\n  Then hopefully we could get on with round two and providing a bill \nthat is acceptable to the President and one that can be enacted into \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, let me go to the Commerce Department itself because \nover on the House side, a colloquy was had yesterday, I guess, upon the \nenactment of this bill where statements were made with respect to \nabolishing the Department of Commerce.\n  There is a reference within the conference report itself on page 30, \nsection 206--where the language could be envisioned as preparatory to \nabolishing the \n\n[[Page S 18131]]\nDepartment--starting off with ``should legislation be enacted.'' That \nwas a compromise on the word ``should,'' because I did not want \nanything anticipatory. When first presented, it was ``when legislation \nis enacted.''\n  There has been no authorization for the dismantlement or abolition of \nthe department itself. Yes, three times on the House floor they have \nvoted for just exactly that--to the shock of this particular Senator--\nfor the simple reason that if you go to the Constitution itself, \narticle I, section 8, in enumerating the powers and authority and \nresponsibilities of the national Congress, article I, section 8, first \nsays that you can levy and collect taxes.\n  The second designated authority and responsibility would be to borrow \nmoney. Heavens above, we know how to do that around here. We are going \nto borrow $348 billion to keep the Government going while we are \ntalking about balanced budgets. That is sheerly out of the whole cloth.\n  The media have to be fast asleep on this particular point. I think it \nwas Thomas Jefferson who said that as between a free Government and a \nfree press, he would choose the latter. That is understandable because, \nyes, you can have a free Government that will not remain free long \nexcept with a free press. The free press owes the people, the body \npolitic, the duty to expose nonsense, particularly the nonsense that is \ngoing on here of a balanced budget. There is no plan in the headline in \nthe morning's paper to balance anybody's, particularly this \nGovernment's, budget.\n  If you look at the innards of the plan, you will find out that rather \nthan cutting spending, spending increases this year; and that the \nmeasure is $53 billion over last year. Starting off with the deficit, \nyou are going with increased spending each year and increased spending \nover the revenues each year, which adds $1.8 trillion to the national \ndebt. And yet the media, press and otherwise, fall into the lethargy of \nparroting what the pollster politicians parrot--that if you say it \nagain and again and again, buzzwords, buzz headlines, ``balance,'' \n``balance,'' that it will be balanced. But it is far from being \nbalanced, Mr. President. And so it is that, yes, duty No. 2 is to \nborrow money. And we respond generously.\n  Duty No. 3 in the Constitution is to regulate commerce. I point this \nout because you will not find that word ``agriculture'' or ``housing'' \nor ``education'' or ``energy'' in the U.S. Constitution. When the \ncontract crowd came to town, they were going to get rid of all of them, \nthe Department of Housing, the Department of Energy, the Department of \nEducation, right on through. End the Department of Commerce. The one on \nthe griddle now is the Department of Commerce. Why? Because the selfish \nbusiness leadership wants deregulation and more money, capital gains.\n  I have listened to their leadership again and again saying, well, \nunder the Congress we are concentrating or, namely, we do not want to \nbother the leadership unless we can get capital gains tax cuts.\n  We do not have any capital gains to cut, unless we can get \nderegulation. So we will not bother about the Department of Commerce \nbecause we do not think any Government in its right mind is going to do \naway with the front line of the struggle in the global competition for \neconomic strength and influence. That is what it has turned into with \nthe fall of the wall.\n  We have moved where the world could care less about the 7th Fleet and \nthe atom bomb. Money talks. Economic power, influences. We are finding \nthat out in our foreign policy. And the Department is charged, if you \nplease, along with the State Department, to be more or less the front \nline of defense now, rather than the Pentagon, to get into the matter \nof dumping cases, the International Trade Administration, the Bureau of \nExport Administration.\n  Everyone is talking about exports, exports. You can go right on down \nthe list of these important, particular measures in that global \ncompetition of patent and trademark. That is a matter of issue, all of \nthese trade measures, and the argument of using the OMB and CBO, the \ngross domestic product, that Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census of \nManufacturers. All this work is being done in a very casual fashion. \nBut they say get rid of it all.\n  We could go right on down with the Census Bureau, the National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology, the Economic Development \nAdministration, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. \nTourism and Travel Administration--all of that is under a very, very \naggressive and productive Secretary of Commerce.\n  I have been through some that have not been aggressive except to \ncollect money. Invariably the Secretary of Commerce has been appointed \nfrom time to time to dun the business leadership for the money to run \nfor reelection. On the contrary, this particular Secretary has been \ntraveling and working and moving and shaking, creating jobs, a historic \nfirst in my 29 years on the Commerce Committee.\n  I think that it was the former chairman of the Democratic Party who \nwas responding to the former Senator from Wyoming, Senator Wallop when \nhe pointed out that Secretary of Commerce Brown had been out in \nCalifornia. In his response, he said California was ``the end all, be \nall, of Presidential politics'' and that the Secretary of Commerce, Ron \nBrown, was going to run it. And that is how we ran right straight into \na wall with respect to everything about that department. And that is \nwhy it persists today in this particular measure as perhaps to be \nabolished. A horrendous thought. But politics prevails around this \ntown. And that is why it is there.\n  That makes me come right to the point of emphasizing the significance \nof the Department. I could do it by way of comparison. You can go right \nunder this particular bill and you will find a measure, Mr. President, \nthat never existed until the year before last, just a couple years here \nin over the 200-some-year history of this great Nation of ours. But we \nhave had a Department of Commerce, or commercial effort, let us say--\nTeddy Roosevelt started it at the turn of the century. But we have had \nthat designated responsibility and adhering and responding thereto. But \nhere now we have what we call the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. \nThat is $3,956,000,000. The Department of Commerce is $3,444,000,000. \nIf you abolish the entire Department on all these endeavors, you have \nnot saved what this Congress just year before last started out anew.\n  That is why everybody talks about ``cut spending, cut spending, cut \nspending.'' But they are increasing it. And we cannot get it through \nthe public mind. They run on ``cutting spending,'' but when they get \nhere they continue to spend more, and more than the whole Department, \nan endeavor that has been in since the Constitution.\n  But let me go right to NOAA, because I was at an occasion here this \npast weekend, and a former Secretary--I said, ``I understand that you \nsaid we ought to abolish the Department of Commerce.'' He said, ``Well, \nif we could blow up NOAA and get rid of it, that would do the job.'' \nThe poor gentleman does not understand at all the institution of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And since I was \nparticipatory in its institution, let me refer immediately to the \nStratton Commission report, ``Our Nation and the Sea.'' It has several \nvolumes.\n  The former Secretary stated that he had talked to an oil friend of \nhis, and the oil friend said that we could easily contract out for all \nthose things being done by NOAA. The truth of the matter is, the oil \nindustry was very, very much a participant. James A. Crutchfield was a \nprofessor of economics. We had Jacob Blaustein of the Standard Oil Co., \nwho served on this. We had not only in the Stratton Commission the \ndeans of schools of oceanography, but we had the industry itself, \nGeneral Electric. We had the Environmental Science Services \nAdministration. We had the Under Secretary of the Navy.\n  It was a most auspicious group for a 2-year study with the Stratton \nCommission report that said what we should do is organize the Sea Grant \nProgram, the Bureau of the Fisheries and bring all of these particular \nendeavors--the Weather Service and, more particularly, the \nEnvironmental Science Services Administration--bring those in under one \nparticular entity because 70 percent of the Earth's \n\n[[Page S 18132]]\nsurface is in the oceans. That is the beginning of weather, beginning \nof the environment, beginning of all the scientific studies, and what \nhave you.\n  While everybody was enthused about the space effort, more importantly \nwe should be orchestrating, organizing and emphasizing the oceans \neffort. We have been doing that for some 20 years before any NOAA in \nwhat we called the Environmental Science Services Administration in \nCommerce, the Uniform Coast and Geodetic Oceans Core at that particular \ntime.\n  All that was blended into a very good, aggressive endeavor that sort \nof withered on the vine. I saw it happen because a Senator from an \ninland State that never saw the ocean took over the Commerce Committee. \nHe did away with the Subcommittee of Oceans and Atmosphere that we had \nwithin the committee. And otherwise, at least financially, we have gone \ndownhill.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act took 3 years of hearings and has \nreally responded to the Stratton Commission report, such that by the \nyear 2000, we are going to have 85 percent of all Americans living \nwithin 50 miles of the oceans or the coast of the Great Lakes.\n  And we had to plan with respect to where the industry was going, \nwhere the recreational systems were going, where the power systems were \ngoing, where the fisheries were going, where the urban sprawl was \ngoing, and everything else, while at that particular time they had a \ngentleman, John Ehrlichman on President Nixon's staff, who was looking \nfor a land use measure and opposing, incidentally, this particular \ninstitution of NOAA because he wanted his land use.\n  The Attorney General and President Nixon got together with Dr. \nStratton, and by reorganization plan No. 4 in 1970, put forth a very \nresponsive and responsible entity in the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. We need a restudy, a return, so to speak, \nof the Stratton committee report and many of us in the ocean policy \nstudy believe that should be done.\n  But in restrictive budgets right now, we have sort of held back. You \ndo not blow up the endeavors of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration and thereby solve the problems, as they see them, of the \nDepartment of Commerce. You do not disassemble and assign Census over \nhere and some other Bureau officials back over here and break it up \nbecause somebody is trying to get rid of the Government. And if we \ncannot sell buildings--and I do not know the building in the contract \nthey were supposed to sell--they say we have to get rid of Departments. \nWe could not get rid of Education, we could not get rid of Housing but \nwe have to get rid of Commerce, they say.\n  On the Senate side, they did not even want to debate it. They put it \noff at the time because the so-called authorization was coming up. This \nSenator is ready to debate it at greater length when that measure \narises, but we do not treat casually a fundamental endeavor in the U.S. \nGovernment at this particular time.\n  I was going to emphasize some of the things with respect to Export \nAdministration and the Census Bureau. There is an ongoing effort to \nabolish the Economic Development Administration. That has been \nrecommended for about 15 years, and we have to withstand the onslaught \nthere, because it is a sort of ``but if'' endeavor that brings about \ndevelopment at the local level that economically has proven its worth. \nRepublicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle, oppose that.\n  I just want to say a word about the U.S. Travel and Tourism \nAdministration.\n  Before I get off of the Economic Development Administration, \nincidentally, we had the Defense Conversion Act which assigned some $90 \nmillion to the Economic Development Administration. I guess we will get \ninto the Economic Development Administration's responsibility relative \nto defense conversion when we talk about the Advanced Technology \nProgram and when we talk about other measures.\n  Let me say a word about the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. I \nnever will forget the campaign of 1960 when President Kennedy was \nnominated, and I happened to be, at that time, in conversation with the \nPresident-designate. He said, ``I'm going to appoint your friend, \nLuther Hodges, as part of the Cabinet.''\n  I said, ``Mr. President, look, Luther is not a politician politician, \nhe is a businessman politician.'' He had been president of Marshall \nFields in the textile division, the New York City Rotary Club and \notherwise. He had come down to South Carolina, led the South in \neconomic and industrial development, changing over from an agricultural \neconomy. And he said, ``Well, good, I will put him in as Secretary of \nCommerce.''\n  And thereafter Secretary of Commerce Hodges came and said, ``Well, \nyou got me this thing, what can I do?''\n  I said, ``Well, tourism is a fledgling industry now, but it is \nbeginning and going and growing and we really need national \ncoordination.'' There is not any question that the States themselves--\nsome of the bigger interests of what I am speaking of, Senators Bryan \nand Reid from Nevada, even Senator Pressler from South Dakota, the \nchairman of our committee. When they have a trade show in downtown \nCairo, there is no reason for 50 States to show them how to cook an \nAmerican barbecue. They all try. We wanted to coordinate that and, from \ntime to time, pick different ones and have a nationally coordinated \neffort and direction.\n  So it was and investment of $17 million. Secretary Hodges instituted \nthe U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. It now is worth $7 billion \nto the economy, is the largest industry in my State and in many, many \nother States, and ranks right at the top of all endeavors in the United \nStates. But to get symbols or trophies or get rid of something, they \njust pell-mell said, ``Let's get rid of the U.S. Travel and Tourism \nAdministration.'' It is a bad, bad mistake to try.\n  Otherwise, the Advanced Technology Program is easily explained with \nrespect to our competition in the global economy. Everyone should read \n``Blindside'' by Eamonn Fingleton on Japan and how it is operated by \nthe Ministry of Finance and all industry has the Government directing \nits research. We give a minimal kind of research and development tax \nwriteoff. It should be made permanent and greater, but, in any event, \nwe need a national effort to stay on top of the U.S. technological \nlead.\n  We do not prevail in national defense by manpower. The Chinese, the \nSoviets have always had more men than we have had, but we have always \nmaintained as a superpower by the superiority of our technology. The \nsame is going to be true in this, I just call it bluntly, trade war, \neconomic struggle for development the world round.\n  And so we--I say we, Senator Danforth and myself--really studied it \nto make sure it was not pork. It was not included in an appropriations \nbill where you cannot find it. On the contrary, the industry itself \nmust come with an application and 50 percent of the money in hand. \nThereupon, it is reviewed by the National Academy of Engineering and, \non peer review, the award is made, not by the Secretary of Commerce \npolitically or the White House over a telephone call by the President, \nbut on a competitive basis, on a peer-review basis and, therefore, it \nhas maintained its integrity.\n  I have really stonewalled efforts on the House side as chairman and \nnow as ranking member of this particular subcommittee that we were not \ngoing to write in any of those particular programs in our bills. We \nwere not going to have pork, and it was done extremely well.\n  There have been some 276 awards made. I remember when the textile \nindustry of my own State came and asked for support on a research \nendeavor, and I want to make this record so they will all look at it \nclosely. They came before the National Academy of Engineering and could \nnot qualify for the Advanced Technology Program, so they went over to \nthe Department of Energy, got money and they got a $350 million \nresearch endeavor at Livermore Laboratory out in California under the \nDepartment of Energy where it could not qualify in the Department of \nCommerce. I know that intimately because of the genesis of the program \nand my position on the particular committee.\n  So we have been very cautious. When you get rid of the Advanced \nTechnology Program, which I think would be one reason the White House \nhas indicated a veto, everyone should understand why. Very minimal \neffort, but \n\n[[Page S 18133]]\nvery, very important effort being made there.\n\n  Let me move, Mr. President, if you please, to the Cops on the Beat \nbecause I have not spoken at length, and the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, who has led the program itself, the \ninstitution of it, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, will be. \nHe has a couple of hours reserved. Members of his committee will be \nspeaking on that point. But, yes, I have an experience with respect to \nblock grants.\n  First, block grants are not authorized. Senator Gregg and I, when we \nmet, we did not have that much of a stonewalling on different programs \nbecause they were not authorized, but we have experienced it in other \nconferences. The House Members, adhering to their authorizing \ncommittees, say we agree with you, we want that done, it cannot be in \nthe conference report. It is not authorized. I have heard that for \nyears on end--for 18 years, as either ranking member or chairman of \nthis particular subcommittee on appropriations. This is not authorized. \nWhen it came up, the discussion on the Senate side for authorization, \nthey passed that over. They did not want to debate that one. It is not \nauthorized, not on the Judiciary Committee, and everything else. So \nhere, trying to write in, you could raise a point of order under the \nrules, but we are not trying to waste time.\n  We ought to be home for Christmas right now. Something is wrong with \nthis crowd. They do not understand life itself. They want to start \nmeetings at 6 o'clock. They must not have a home to go to. At 6 \no'clock, everybody else is home trying to get supper and go to bed and \nsee the children, or otherwise. But not this group. They think, for \nsome political reason, we ought to stay around and show that we are \nworking hard late at night. But we are not paying the bills or getting \nanything done. They have not authorized block grants with respect to \nthis one.\n  Now, they did under President Nixon. They called it the Law \nEnforcement Assistance Administration, or something, LEAA. We gave up \nthe block grants. And I will never forget when President Carter came to \ntown. He said, ``Kill this turkey.'' It was an embarrassment. They were \nputting tanks on the courthouse lawn in Hampton, VA. I do not know who \nwas going to attack the courthouse. They were buying airplanes to fly \nto New York to buy spring clothes for the Governor's wife, and they \nwere giving out consultants. It was a good little political pork pot, \nwhere you could get anybody as a consultant. There were consultants all \nover everything. We spent $8 billion and we got nothing. We have done \nthis.\n  There is no education in the second kick of a mule. There is no use \ntrying to go through this one because somebody put it in the contract. \nThe only reason it is in the contract is they are trying to get on top \nof the message that ``We Republicans are more for crime control than \nDemocrats are.'' The Democrats have the policemen on the beat program. \nThere is nothing wrong with that, but ``we want to put in our crime \nabout the contract.''\n  Nonsense. But that is what we have to go through with--it is not \nauthorized--and try to change the entire program around, where again, \nthe local law enforcement has to come with 25 percent of the money. And \nafter 3 years, they are going to have to take it over. We have 26,000 \ncops on the beat.\n  I have been in law enforcement. For 4 years, I was the chief law \nenforcement officer in my State. I know it intimately. I can tell you \nthat this is a wonderful endeavor that is working, nonpartisan-like. \nAll these law enforcement officers and entities all endorse these block \ngrants. But it is like delivering lettuce by way of a rabbit. By the \ntime the police chief sees where his money is, yes, he might buy an \nextra radio, or get a consultant, or he might never get talked to. He \nwill never see an additional officer on the beat. So we have done that. \nLet us not waste time and money on cops on the beat.\n  There is another endeavor I should emphasize in the opening \nstatement, and that is the Legal Services Administration, and that I \nhave had experience there. There have been those all the way back when \nit was first instituted, back years ago, when Legal Services--I will \nnever forget I had to work with Senator Javits of New York on this one, \nand we had to enumerate the duties of domestic cases, landlord cases, \nemployment cases, and otherwise, because we found that in going and \nsending money back to the Legal Services Corporation, they were hiring \nthe demonstrators to come up here on the Capitol steps and call the \nCongress a bunch of bums on account of Vietnam. So we thought it was \nnot quite smart to be financing our own opposition, and it certainly \nwas not the intent; it was to get money in the hands of poor folks, who \nshould get their day in court and could not because they did not have \nany money.\n  It was really started by the American Bar Association when our \nfriend, Justice Lewis Powell, was then a practicing attorney and \nPresident of the American Bar. In one endeavor to try to get rid of it, \nwe brought Justice Powell over, and they realized the authority and the \nthought and the responsibility of the endeavor that they more or less \nabandoned the idea of getting rid of Legal Services. But farmers do not \nlike the poor migrant worker--who may be cheated out of his money and \nwho has to move on and cannot take care of his family and everything \nelse--getting a lawyer. So the farm crowd--I know them, I have them in \nmy State--do not like that migrant worker. They can cheat him, run him \noff, do not give him housing, or anything else. He does not know \nanybody in your community or have any contacts there. Get rid of him. \nThey do not like it, so get rid of Legal Services. It is the same thing \nin these big cities, with landlord-tenant problems. They never fix the \npipes that freeze over, and they are trying to get water and everything \nelse in there, and heat for the children. Throw them out on the street \nand, surely, do not give them a lawyer.\n  Come on. We know there is opposition to Legal Services. But, \nfortunately, on the Republican side we have the leadership of the \nformer chairman of the subcommittee, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, and \nhe led the fight. I am sorry we did not get enough money. The chairman \nof our subcommittee tried, and I tried, but we could not get any more. \nIt is inadequate. We are looking at a veto on the second go-around. \nThis is going to be a subject for concern and perhaps increase, \nhopefully, because it is a tried and true program. We put the language \nin. I agreed with the former chairman, the Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm, that we should not use money to sue the State of New Hampshire.\n  I have watched these things every time you have these crowds that \ncome around and want to grab the poor people's money and bring a mass \naction and go to the Supreme Court, and the lawyers sit around and eat \nit all up. They have enough money, those charitable legal defense \nfunds, and everything else. Leave our Legal Services Corporation alone \nand do not sue the Governor or the legislature. That is for poor folks, \nnot rich folks sitting around in Washington with their think tanks.\n  Senator Gramm was correct, and I went along with him. I think that \nwhen we come on the second go-around, we are going to have to really \nbeef up the Legal Services Corporation. There is a tremendous need now \nin our country, and we should not be cutting it back or trying to \nabolish it.\n  Finally, I will soon terminate and try to retain my time for others. \nMr. President, we have the State Department that is the front line with \nthat Commerce Department. With the fall of the wall, we ought to be \nextending democracy, freedom, and human rights to the world around with \nour Department of State. They finally are falling in line on a business \nbasis.\n\n  You had the diplomats in years gone by where they were annoyed with \nAmerican industry and business trying to get business in a foreign \nland. Now, under Secretary Christopher and under Secretary Brown, they \nare working in tandem, because they have to if we are going to survive. \nThey are working in tandem, trying to open doors now by business \nleadership so they can compete.\n  We need these embassies around. They are trying to close down \nEdinburgh, Scotland. Bad mistake. They are trying to close down \nFlorence, Italy. The educational institutes of this land--they have \nsome 10,000 American students there. There are various \n\n[[Page S 18134]]\ncases and visa matters and everything else coming back. Close it down \nand run it through Rome, you will spend more money, sell the property \nand lose it.\n  So we have tried our best, yes, to close those that are not needed, \nopen up the new ones in the 14 Republics of the former Soviet Union, \nbut more than anything else, strengthen our consular service and cut \nout all the Departments of Government, keeping their endeavors upon the \nDepartment of State.\n  Specifically, there is no reason--go down to Caracas, Venezuela; they \nwant the FAA to have something go down there, and then the head of the \nFAA has a reason to go and travel to South America. The IRS would like \nto come in and they would like to have offices around in foreign lands, \nand then the hierarchy of IRS can get in a plane and they can travel \naround.\n  Now, we have the FBI, which I think is a mistake, because you have \nthe CIA, and the FBI is going to be arresting CIA agents. You watch it. \nWe have always tried to keep that division with respect to \nintelligence. With respect to law enforcement, do not ever put your law \nenforcement in another man's country. It is ineffective. It is a \nmistake. But they are now endeavoring to put FBI around there.\n  They ought to put them down on 14th Street in this city. We do not \nhave enough law enforcement. That is why we have the Cops-on-the-Beat \nProgram. We have enough crime in America, much less chasing it around \nin the various lands.\n  But they like to travel. When they do, the poor Ambassador is the \nlandlord, and he looks around and he has more and more and more people \nassigned to him and half of his budget is already gone; there is a \nhousekeeper in the embassy and he cannot get his work done.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can cut back on some of that that is going \naround. If we want to try and help the State Department, we ought to \nembellish their effort. We ought to acknowledge very genuinely, Senator \nGregg, the chairman, Mr. Rogers, and their staffs on the other side. It \ngoes without saying Scott Gudes on my side, I could not operate without \nhim, and we have David Taylor, Scott Corwin, Lula Edwards, and Vas \nAlexopolous on the majority staff. So we look forward to a very \ncompatible working together on this particular measure.\n  It has 128 entities in it. You have the special Trade Representative, \nyou have the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. They could really \nspend the day talking about what we have done, how we cut back on the \nmoney. We have cut back; it is far less. This is $1.5 billion less than \nwhat the President of the United States asked for. We have been in step \nwith the ``seam,'' so to speak, of the revolution with the cut in \nspending. The distinguished chairman and I both believe we should cut \nspending, but it should be done in the right places.\n  I could go right to the point of the International Trade Commission. \nWhy have a jury find the fault of a dumping violation and then have a \ndifferent jury find the actual sentence or injury? In fact, there are a \nbunch of sycophants that are fixes for ``yack-yack'' free trade. There \nis no such thing, but every time we find a dumping violation they can \nnever find an injury. We can save $43 million getting rid of that \ncrowd, let the same entity, namely, the International Trade \nAdministration--be like the jury in a case that finds the guilt also \ndecides the sentence. You do not waste time and have another \nbureaucracy reexamining.\n  There are many places that we can go along with the spirit of the \nrevolution in the Contract, but this is not one of them, where you want \nto abolish the Department of Commerce.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a statement of \nadministration policy on this particular bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  H.R. 2076--commerce, justice, and state, the judiciary, and related \n                 agencies appropriations bill, FY 1996\n\n       (Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Rogers (R), Kentucky; \n     Hatfield (R), Oregon; Gregg (R) New Hampshire)\n       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the \n     Administration's views on H.R. 2076, the Department of \n     Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1996, as approved by the \n     Conference Committee. Your consideration of the \n     Administration's views would be appreciated.\n       The Administration strongly opposes several aspects of the \n     Conference Report. For the reasons discussed more fully \n     below, the President would veto the bill if it were presented \n     to him in its current form.\n       The bill would provide insufficient funds to support the \n     important activities covered by this bill. It would undermine \n     our ability to fight the war on crime and to support \n     international organizations and peacekeeping activities; \n     decimate technology programs that are critical to building a \n     strong U.S. economy; and cripple our ability to provide legal \n     services for disadvantaged individuals.\n\n\n                        programs to fight crime\n\n       The bill would eliminate the COPS program and, instead, \n     fund a law enforcement block grant program that would allow \n     spending on anything from street lights to public works \n     projects. The American public has shown a clear desire for \n     additional police to work hand-in-hand with communities to \n     fight crime. The block grant approach would not guarantee a \n     single new officer. COPS is a proven success and should be \n     maintained as a separate discretionary program. The COPS \n     program has reinvented Federal grant making, putting grant \n     monies into the hands of local agencies on an expedited \n     basis. A block grant program cannot accomplish what the \n     current program has done.\n       The President would not sign any version of this \n     appropriations bill that does not fund the COPS program in \n     its authorized form.\n       Similarly, the bill fails to ensure funding for important \n     crime prevention activities, most notably so-called ``drug \n     courts,'' the Community Relations Service, and the \n     President's Crime Prevention Council. In addition, there are \n     reductions below the request for the President's immigration \n     initiative. The Administration urges the Congress to support \n     increased funding for these vital programs, as well as the \n     continuation of the Associate Attorney General's Office.\n       The prison grants ``Truth in Sentencing'' provisions of the \n     bill would disproportionately and unfairly benefit a small \n     number of States, deprive some States of any funds, and harm \n     many States--including some with very strong sentencing \n     policies. In addition, the provisions would generate delay in \n     the awards of much needed prison grant funds for all States.\n\n\n           technology programs of the department of commerce\n\n       The Administration urges the Congress to support the \n     technology programs of the Department of Commerce that work \n     to expand our economy, help Americans compete in the global \n     marketplace, and create high quality jobs. The conference \n     level would eliminate funding for the Advanced Technology \n     Program (ATP) and prohibit new awards, which is unacceptable \n     to the Administration. ATP is a highly competitive, cost-\n     shared program that fosters technology development, promotes \n     industrial alliances, and creates jobs. Eliminating ATP \n     funding would force wasteful cancellation of ongoing research \n     projects before they are complete. The ATP program was \n     created with bipartisan support, which it continues to \n     deserve.\n       The bill also would sharply reduce funding for the National \n     Information Infrastructure (NII) grants program. The NII \n     program assists hospitals, schools, libraries, and local \n     governments in procuring advanced communications equipment to \n     provide better health care, education, and local government \n     services. The conference level would eliminate funding for \n     the GLOBE program, which promotes knowledge of science and \n     the environment in our schools. The Administration is also \n     concerned about reductions below the request for the \n     Manufacturing Extension program.\n       The Administration is concerned with the funding levels \n     provided for the Technology Administration to fulfill the \n     U.S. Commitment for the U.S.-Israeli Science and Technology \n     Commission and to maintain valuable technology analysis and \n     advocacy work at a time of increasingly fierce global \n     competition. The Administration seeks additional funding for \n     economic and statistical analysis and for the Census Bureau. \n     In addition, we are concerned about the level of funding for \n     the Economic Development Administration Defense Conversion \n     program.\n\n\n                       legal services corporation\n\n       The Administration is greatly concerned with the conference \n     funding level for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), which \n     would cripple the ability of the Corporation to serve people \n     in need, and urges the Congress to restore funding for the \n     Corporation. \n\n[[Page S 18135]]\n     The Administration does not support the excessive restrictions on LSC \n     operations contained in language provisions in the Conference \n     Report. The restrictions imposed on the representation of \n     clients unduly limited their access to the justice system. An \n     allocation of $9 million for management and administration is \n     essential to permit Corporation management to meet its \n     statutory responsibilities, which include for the first time \n     the awarding of grants on a competitive basis.\n\n\n                         international programs\n\n       The Conference Report includes a 50-percent reduction to \n     Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities and a \n     24-percent reduction to Contributions to International \n     Organizations, which fund the treaty-obligated U.S. share of \n     activities of the United Nations, International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, NATO, and others. These activities support important \n     U.S. national security and foreign policy interests \n     including, among others, the Middle East (including Israel's \n     borders and Kuwait/Iraq), weapons nonproliferation and \n     safeguards activities, sanctions against international \n     renegade countries, promotion of an open international \n     trading framework, control of diseases such as Ebola viruses, \n     and promotion of human rights. These reductions would impair \n     the ability of the U.S. to carry out and safeguard important \n     U.S. interests around the world. Also, without restoration of \n     funding for these accounts, the Administration would be \n     severely hindered in the pursuit of much needed reforms at \n     the organizations.\n       In addition, other international affairs programs of the \n     Department of State, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, \n     and the United States Information Agency, are reduced to \n     levels that would hinder the execution of important national \n     security and foreign policy activities. Finally, the \n     Administration regrets the inclusion of extraneous language \n     in the bill related to the presence of U.S. Government \n     facilities in Vietnam.\n\n\n                              other issues\n\n       The Administration objects to section 103, which would \n     prohibit the use of funds in the act for performing \n     abortions, with certain exceptions.\n       In addition to the issues discussed above, the \n     Administration would like to work with the Congress to \n     address the other concerns that were outlined in the \n     conferees letter of November 6, 1995.\n       Clearly, this bill does not reflect the priorities of the \n     President or the values of the American people. The \n     Administration urges the Congress to send the President an \n     appropriations bill for these important priorities that truly \n     serves the American people.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I certainly appreciate being yielded to by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  Actually, I came to the floor at this moment to pay my respects to \nChairman Gregg, who is our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, \nfor his having brought the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations \nconference report to the floor. I know he enjoys working with our \ndistinguished friend from South Carolina who has been here 29 years and \nwho is still the junior Senator from North Carolina, but Fritz Hollings \nis a wonderful friend, as well.\n  Both Chairman Gregg and Chairman Gramm, who recently inherited the \nCJS issues, have done outstanding work in consulting and actively \ncooperating with the authorizers of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Now, Senator Gregg served on the Foreign Affairs Committee before \naccepting his current responsibilities on the Appropriations Committee. \nI have to say to him, we miss the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire on the Foreign Affairs Committee, but we are grateful, as a \nmember of the Senate Appropriations, he remains a strong and steadfast \nadvocate for the concern of the American people relating to foreign \npolicy.\n  While the CJS conference report does not contain everything that I \nwanted, it is consistent with the thrust of S. 908, the State \nDepartment reauthorization bill. A great many of us have worked hard to \ncraft the legislation to prepare the Department of State for the \nchallenges of the future.\n  I confess, from time to time, Mr. President, I have been discouraged \nthat the administration and many of our colleagues on the other side \nhave deliberately blocked every effort to permit the Senate even to \ndebate and vote on this important reorganization legislation.\n  I have been encouraged by recent events that we may finally see a \nSenate vote on a State Department authorization bill, perhaps as early \nas this evening or tomorrow.\n  We shall see about that. The actions of the CJS appropriators have \nbeen instrumental in causing the administration to recognize that the \nissue of reorganization and consolidation is not going to go away.\n  I am very appreciative of the actions of Senator Gregg and Senator \nHollings and others to stipulate that this appropriations conference \nreport waives authorization only until April 1, 1996. Now, this key \nprovision will require the administration and the Congress to act on an \nauthorization bill for 1996.\n  Without an authorization bill, the authority to spend appropriated \nfunds for the State Department and other related agencies will expire \non the first of April next year.\n  Now, as I mentioned earlier, the issue of reorganization and \nconsolidation of the foreign policy apparatus of the United States is \nnot going away. Every day that the administration refuses to plan for \nthe future, the State Department is going to pay a price for it.\n  I hope that we can move the authorization bill into conference to \nprovide the administration with the authority and the flexibility \nneeded for a successful restructuring of its operations. If President \nClinton does not find this legislation acceptable, he will provide the \nSenate with yet another opportunity to revisit the consolidation issue \non this appropriations bill.\n  In any event, it is my understanding that the administration opposes \nthis conference report because, first, it provides $223 million less \nfor international operations spending; second, it reduces the \nPresident's request for peacekeeping operations by $220 million; third, \nit cuts the State Department salaries and expenses spending by $50 \nmillion; and, fourth, the President does not like it because it reduces \nthe State Department's foreign building spending by $36 million, \nincluding a $60 million rescission. The fact is, this conference report \nrequires the administration to cut spending, and that is what the \nPresident does not like. That is what the whole argument has been about \nall along. I wish it could also force the President to reduce the size \nof the Federal bureaucracy, but we can work on that later.\n  However, as a practical matter, Senator Gregg's initiatives to reduce \nfunding levels in this bill will require the administration to \nrestructure its efforts so as to meet reduced funding levels. H.R. 2076 \nis approximately $500 million below the authorization levels of the \nSenate Foreign Relations bill. At a time when the Federal Government is \napproaching the $5 trillion Federal debt mark, the work of Senators, \nlike Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings and others, is most \nencouraging.\n  At my request, and I am so grateful to him, Senator Gregg included a \n4-year extension of the Au Pair Program. There is a similar provision \nin S. 908, the State Department reorganization bill. The Au Pair \nProgram expired on September 30, and that has caused great hardship \namong many working parents. Senator Gregg agreed to include the \nextension of the program in the appropriations bill, since Au Pair \nenjoys wide support.\n  So, in summation, I come here to thank the two managers of the bill. \nMy friend, Senator Gregg, has particularly been helpful, working with \nme. He has made some very wise and reasonable decisions in this bill. I \ncongratulate him. I congratulate Senator Hollings, and I urge our \ncolleagues to support the CJS conference report.\n  Mr. President, if I have time remaining, I yield it back and I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina for \nhis generous remarks. His assistance and guidance and thoughts on this \nbill were extraordinarily helpful to me. Obviously, coming to this bill \nat a late date, it was very nice to have the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee there to give me his thoughts and help us in \ncrafting the bill. I very much appreciate that.\n  At this point, I will suggest the absence of a quorum----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will withhold just a minute, the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, the chairman of our Foreign Relations Committee--\nlet me say publicly, which I have told colleagues along the line, the \ninitiative of our distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to blend in \n\n[[Page S 18136]]\nthe U.S. Agency for International Development Program, the U.S. \nInformation Agency, the Arms Control Disarmament Agency, and the other \nparticular programs that they have in the Department of State is, I \nthink, a salutary initiative on the chairman's part.\n  I have worked the budgets. Specifically, if they appointed me the \nUnder Secretary of State in charge in Africa, I could look over and \ncould designate the needs. At the present time, if I did, the AID \nDirector would say, ``Oh, no, this is where we are going to put it.'' \nAnd he has all the money.\n  We need a coordinated effort. We can save, really, millions with the \nparticular initiative. I happen to know, as he knows, five Secretaries \nof State have recommended this. I intend to support the distinguished \nchairman of our Foreign Relations Committee. I state that as having \nbeen at the financial end of these endeavors on appropriations for over \n25 years now.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the chairman as much time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have enjoyed working with both of these \nSenators--a little longer with Senator Hollings, because he and I have \nbeen around here longer. But the Senators from New Hampshire and South \nCarolina are remarkable Senators. And I appreciate your comments, \nSenator Hollings. I thank Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support passage \nof the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill as it has come from \nthe Appropriations Committee so that we can get it to the President. As \neveryone is well aware, the President has signaled that he will veto \nthis bill. We need to pass the bill and then begin the task of fixing \nany of the remaining problems contained in this legislation.\n  We are at a watershed moment in this Nation's history. We are \ndeciding whether or not we will have a balanced budget or whether we \nwill continue to plunge our Nation into debt and mortgage our \nchildren's futures. This bill represents one piece in the puzzle to \nachieving a balanced budget. While imperfect, this legislation \nnevertheless represents an honest effort to achieve a fiscally \nresponsible Federal budget.\n  Of course, there are programs that I would like to receive more \nmoney. I am sure there is not a single person sitting in this Congress \nwho would not want to spend more money on some particular program or \nissue. This bill, however, represents a compromise between our desires, \nand our true, fiscally responsible, law enforcement needs.\n  To my colleagues that voted for the balanced budget amendment, I \nwould ask them to vote for this bill. To my colleagues who voted \nagainst the amendment, but believed we needed a balanced budget and \ncould achieve such a budget, I tell them now is their hour. Now is the \ntime. This is an opportunity for them to prove that they can exercise \nthe discipline and restraint needed to achieve a balanced budget.\n  Even with the cuts necessary to achieve a balanced budget, I would \nnote that the Department of Justice receives a nearly 20-percent \nincrease over fiscal year 1995. The violent crime reduction trust fund, \nmoreover, will be increased by some $1.6 billion. While the conference \nbill does not provide federal law enforcement with as much money as I \nmight otherwise want it to, it nevertheless represents an enormous \ncommitment to fund core federal law enforcement programs.\n\n  For example, the conference report provides the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service with nearly $2.6 billion. This represents a \n23.5-percent increase over fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. The \nconference agreement provides funds for 800 new Border Patrol agents \nand 160 new support personnel.\n  If you look at this chart, the Department of Justice budget authority \nbetween 1990 and 1996, you can see that it is going up dramatically \nfrom around $8\\1/4\\ billion up to almost $16 billion. It has almost \ndoubled in the last 6 years. So we are spending an awful lot of money, \nand I think doing it in the right way.\n  The bill also increases, by some 1,400 positions, personnel dedicated \nto apprehending, locating, and deporting illegal aliens.\n  The FBI receives over $2.5 billion, a 9.8-percent increase over 1995 \nenacted levels. Additionally, construction funds are provided to \nrenovate the FBI Command Center, to modernize the FBI Training Academy \nfor use by Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers, and to \nbegin construction on a new FBI laboratory.\n  Similarly, the U.S. attorneys offices receive an over 8.5-percent \nincrease in funds compared to the 1995 enacted levels.\n  The DEA receives some $806 million, a 6.4-percent increase over last \nyear. This provides DEA with funds to improve its infrastructure and to \nbetter support investigative efforts.\n  In addition to these law enforcement expenditures, the bill also \nfully funds the Violence Against Women Act, legislation that I worked \non with Senator Biden to get passed last year. As most of my colleagues \nare aware, I have long opposed programs I believed were mere pork \nprojects. In fact, I led the battle against last year's crime bill \nbecause I felt that it had ballooned in terms of unjustified costs. The \nViolence Against Women Act, however, is an important program that \ndeserves to be fully funded. The act provides funds for: rape \nprevention education; battered women shelters; the investigation and \nprosecution of domestic violence and child abuse in rural areas; \ntreatment and counseling programs for victims; and grants for \ndeveloping community domestic violence and child abuse education \nprograms.\n\n  These programs are vitally important. Prosecutors and police officers \nmust become more sensitized to the problem of violence against women. \nWomen who are abused by their spouses must have a place to stay and \nmust have counseling available to repair their shattered lives. \nResources need to be channeled to stem the tide of violence directed \nagainst women.\n  According to Justice Department data, nearly a half-million women \nwere forcibly raped last year. Some studies estimate that the total \nnumber of rapes, including those not reported to authorities, may \nexceed 2 million.\n  Similarly, domestic violence strikes at the heart of the most \nimportant political unit in America--the family. The family should be a \nsafe harbor for those tossed about by the storms of life, not a place \nof abuse or degradation.\n  The act is one small, albeit vital, step toward addressing the \nproblem of family violence, and violence against women generally. A \nvote for this conference bill means a vote to combat violence against \nwomen.\n  The conference bill also contains legislation I introduced with \nthe distinguished majority leader to reform frivolous prison \nlitigation. This landmark legislation will help bring relief to a civil \njustice system overburdened by frivolous prisoner lawsuits. In 1994, \nover 39,000 lawsuits were filed by inmates in Federal courts, a \nstaggering 15-percent increase over the number filed the previous year. \nThe vast majority of these suits are completely without merit. Indeed, \nroughly 94.7 percent of these suits are dismissed before the pretrial \nphase, and only a scant 3.1 percent have enough merit to reach trial. \nIn my home State of Utah, 297 inmate suits were filed in Federal courts \nduring 1994, which accounted for 22 percent of all Federal civil cases \nfiled in Utah last year. The crushing burden of these frivolous suits \nis not only costly, but makes it difficult for courts to consider \nmeritorious claims.\n\n  Indeed, I do not want to prevent inmates from raising legitimate \nclaims. While the vast majority of these claims are specious, there are \ncases in which prisoners' basic civil rights are denied. \n\n[[Page S 18137]]\nContrary to the charges of some critics, however, this legislation will \nnot prevent those claims from being raised. The legislation will, \nhowever, go far in preventing inmates from abusing the Federal judicial \nsystem.\n  They will have to pay something to file these charges, and that stops \na lot of the frivolous cases right there. And there are other \nmechanisms that will make them think twice before they file frivolous \nlaw suits.\n  This legislation will also help restore balance to prison conditions \nlitigation and will ensure that Federal court orders are limited to \nremedying actual violations of prisoners' rights, not letting prisoners \nout of jail. It is time to lock the revolving prison door and to put \nthe key safely out of reach of overzealous Federal courts.\n  As of January 1994, 24 corrections agencies reported having court-\nmandated prison population caps. Nearly every day we hear of vicious \ncrimes committed by individuals who should have been locked up. Not all \nof these tragedies are the result of court-ordered population caps, of \ncourse, but such caps are a part of the problem. While prison \nconditions that actually violate the Constitution should not be allowed \nto persist, I believe that the courts have gone too far in micro-\nmanaging our Nation's prisons.\n  This bill also contains important changes to the Prison Grant \nProgram. The conference bill provides nearly $618 million in grants to \nStates to enable them to engage in the emergency buildup of prison \nspace and to encourage the States to adopt tough truth-in-sentencing \nlaws. In contrast, the President requested only some $500 million for \nprison grants.\n  The conference bill makes four key changes to the prison grants \nprovisions included in the 1994 crime bill:\n  First, it authorizes significantly more resources to assist the \nStates in implementing a much-needed emergency buildup in prison and \njail space.\n  Second, it removes onerous and unnecessary Federal strings that were \nattached to the 1994 grant program, and that would have eaten up a \nsignificant portion of the grant money provided.\n  Third, it ensures that the Federal money will be used to increase \navailable prison space, instead of permitting the funds to be used for \na variety of so-called alternative sanctions, which would have left the \nStates in the same dire need of prison space at the end of the grant \nprogram as they are now.\n  Finally, it includes meaningful incentives--not mandates--for the \nenactment of State truth-in-sentencing laws.\n  Prison crowding in many of our States has reached crisis proportions. \nThe average prison system in the United States is operating at 112 \npercent above its rated capacity. In 24 States, prisons are under \ncourt-ordered population caps. And, in 1993, an estimated 21,000 \ninmates in 18 States were released under so-called emergency release \nprograms to relieve crowding--the ``Corrections Yearbook,'' 1994. In \nother words, 21,000 criminals were returned to the streets not because \nthey were no longer a threat to law-abiding citizens, but merely \nbecause there was not enough room to keep them in prison.\n  The Federal Government, of course, cannot solve this crisis for the \nStates. But it can and should provide meaningful emergency assistance.\n  This bill also provides meaningful incentives for States to enact \ntruth-in-sentencing laws. At least 50 percent of the funds under this \nprogram are reserved for States that practice truth in sentencing. It \nis appropriate for the Federal Government to encourage the States, \nthrough the provision of extra funds, to adopt truth-in-sentencing laws \nthat honestly tell citizens--and warn criminals--what the penalty is \nfor breaking the law. This does not mean that the Federal Government \nshould dictate any particular sentencing system or sentence length. But \nit does mean that those States with criminal justice systems that mean \nwhat they say should be rewarded.\n  I would like to briefly dispel a misconception about this truth-in-\nsentencing provision. Some of my colleagues are concerned that this \nprovision will mandate that States adopt long sentences that they \ncannot afford to impose. This is simply not the case. The issue is not \nsentences of any particular length, rather, it is truth in sentencing. \nRecent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics demonstrate that as \nof 1991, State prison inmates serving sentences for violent offenses \nexpected to serve less than half of their sentences.\n  The data also show that the inmates' expectations were accurate--\nviolent prisoners released in 1994 served an average of only 46 percent \nof their sentences--``BJS Selected Findings, Violent Offenders in State \nPrison: Sentences and Time Served, July 25, 1995.'' Moreover, in 1991, \nthe Department of Justice reported that the average murderer was \nsentenced to 20.5 years, but served only 7.7 years; the average rapist \nwas sentenced to 13.3 years, but served only 4.6 years; and the average \nrobber was sentenced to 9.9 years, but served only 3.3 years. This is \noutrageous.\n  Continued public confidence in our criminal justice system requires \nthat sentences mean what they say. A 20-year sentence should not mean \nrelease in 7 years, once a person has committed a murder and been \nconvicted of it. This legislation will provide the States with grant \nincentives to ensure that violent criminals serve the sentences \nimposed.\n  Furthermore, Federal incentives work. A recent report from the \nNational Institute of Corrections stated that of the 29 States that \nconsidered truth-in-sentencing legislation in the 1995 legislative \nsession, 60 percent reported that Federal incentives were a significant \nfactor, and 20 percent reported that these incentives were the main or \nonly factor.\n  Thus, even under last year's weaker truth-in-sentencing provisions, \nprogress is being made. However, this bill is necessary to protect \nthose gains and ensure that they continue. Under last year's bill, \nStates may qualify for truth-in-sentencing funds by enacting laws \nproviding for truth in sentencing only for second-time violent \noffenses.\n  Even more astonishing, States that do nothing to change their laws \ncould end up with a chunk of the truth-in-sentencing grants by simply \nwaiting for the funds to revert to the general grant fund, as the last \nyear's bill provides. Keeping faith with the States that have made \nlegitimate strides in their area requires that we eliminate these \npotentially unfair loopholes.\n  It is also vital, however, that we provide allowances for differences \namong state correctional policies, and not penalize States that \npractice indeterminate sentencing, yet do an admirable job of keeping \nviolent criminals off the streets. My home State of Utah, for example, \nemploys a release guideline system that allows the board of pardons to \nkeep the worst criminals off the streets longer than would be possible \nin many determinate sentencing systems. This amendment accommodates \nsuccessful indeterminate sentencing States.\n  Finally, I would like to address the law enforcement block grant \nproposal. While I do not fully support the language of the current \nproposal, I nevertheless believe we should pass the conference report \nand fix the problems after the President returns it to us. This \nproposal improves, at least in certain respects, the administration's \nso-called COPS Program. I understand that the President prefers the \nCOPS Program, but I believe that a block grant program better supports \nthe local communities law enforcement needs.\n  To begin with, this program moves us away from the Washington-knows-\nbest philosophy. The proposal returns responsibility to frontline local \nlaw enforcement officials. If, for example, a community believes \ncommunity-oriented policing works best in its jurisdiction, it can hire \npolice officers and structure a community policing program. If, \nhowever, the community needs bullet proof vests or communications \nequipment, it can buy that equipment with these funds.\n  A serious problem with the so-called COPS Program is that the award \nis entirely discretionary. It lacks a solid formula and instead depends \nupon the good graces of Washington bureaucrats to distribute the money.\n  The conference report, however, establishes a formula to distribute \nthe money on a fair, consistent basis. Communities will no longer have \nto wonder whether or not they are going to receive a grant.\n\n[[Page S 18138]]\n\n  This proposal also contains a lower matching requirement than the \nPresident's program. Therefore, poorer communities can hire more police \nwith less of a financial strain on the community. By lowering the \nmatch, we do not penalize poorer cities that cannot afford it. This is \nwhat the American people want--assistance in handcuffing criminals not \nhandcuffing communities.\n  Critics complain that a block grant will lead to the abuses of the \nold LEAA Program of years past. I would note, however, that LEAA did \nfar more good than harm. And many of the LEAA grants occurred before \nthe professionalization of the Nation's police forces. I do not believe \nthat the excesses that occurred under the LEAA would occur under the \nproposed legislation. Indeed, I think that the Byrne grants stand as a \ntestament to the ability of local communities to wisely look after \ntheir own best interests.\n  While this conference report is imperfect, I encourage my colleagues \nto support it and permit us to fix any remaining difficulties after the \nPresident has vetoed it. In closing, I would just like to thank Senator \nGregg for his work on the report. He has consistently sought out the \nviews of the Judiciary Committee and has attempted to incorporate our \nviews into the final product. I look forward to working with Senator \nGregg.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield--5, 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would appreciate it if the Senator will yield 10. I \nprobably will use less.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues, I wish to express my profound \ndisappointment that the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration funding \nis not included in this bill.\n  I know that my friend and the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Hollings, proudly and rightly proclaims himself as \none of the founding fathers of this very important function. We are \ntalking about something that in the current year is funded at a modest \nlevel of $16 million. It is a program which has enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport. I wish to emphasize that. When we came to the floor earlier \nthis year to amend the Senate version to continue it for a 1-year \ntransition, a 1-year transition of $12 million in funding, we had the \nsupport of Senators McConnell, Hollings, Murkowski, Inouye, Thurmond, \nDaschle, and many others.\n  So the point I wish to make to my colleagues is that this is not an \nissue which had as a cutting or defining edge any sense of \npartisanship. We had broad bipartisan support.\n  Why do I think this is such an important function? First of all, \ntourism is either the No. 1 or No. 2 or number No. 3 industry in every \nState in America. It generates $417 billion annually and is recognized \nas being, with the possible exception of the health care industry, the \nlargest employer in America.\n  In the context of our difficulty with the international trading \naccounts, where the United States suffers from an enormous trade \nimbalance, when all of those individual categories are added together, \nit is a shining example of where we enjoy a trade surplus, net trade \nsurplus, of some $22 billion.\n  So this is an agency that is worth every penny that is expended. \nPutting this in the context of what is happening in the world today, \nout of the 175 major countries in the world, we will be the only one \nwithout some type of a national tourism office. The timing of this, it \nseems to me, is particularly bad. We are talking about jobs, travel \ntourism provides 6.2 million direct jobs, and is growing at twice the \nrate of job growth in the national average.\n  So this generates economic growth here at home, jobs, $417 billion in \nthe economy. In terms of the international trade, we have a net surplus \nof $22 billion. And all we sought to accomplish in this bipartisan \namendment was to keep the agency funded for one more year, one more \nyear, at a level of $12 million.\n  What the conference report did, it seems to me, is absolutely \nindefensible, both in terms of philosophy as well as pragmatism. It \nwill cost us under the provisions of this conference report, to \nterminate this agency immediately, $8 million. We get nothing for that \n$8 million. It simply represents severance pay to existing employees \nand the various costs that are incurred in terminating existing \ncontracts. I mean, in is like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n  This makes no sense at all, Mr. President. And I know the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair from my neighboring State knows how \nimportant tourism is to his own State. We share a common interest in \none of nature's great wonders in the Southwest, the Grand Canyon.\n  International tourism is driven to a large extent in our part of the \nworld because of the interest and desire in seeing this great wonder of \nnature. We spend less than Malaysia, Tunisia, countries that are not \nordinarily identified as states that are in the vanguard of promoting \ntourism.\n  So I must say that I think we miss a tremendous opportunity here. We \njust had a very, very successful White House conference on tourism. \nBipartisan in every sense. It is the first time in the years that I \nhave been involved in the tourism movement. And I was very much \ninvolved, as the Governor of Nevada, in putting together, in our State, \na strategy at the State level to develop a comprehensive approach to \ntourism that compliments what is done with the local visitor and \nrecreation authorities, particularly in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, \nwhere the two most active authorities exist, putting together that \npartnership which made it possible for us to generate the largest \ngrowth of tourism that has occurred in the history of Nevada.\n  So I must say that I am extraordinarily disappointed in this. It is \nbipartisan in every sense. We ought to, it seems to me, in the interest \nof making some sense, see if we cannot at least keep this agency one \nmore transitional year.\n  In that sense I certainly would invite comment from either the floor \nmanager or the minority floor manager here in terms of, do we have any \nchance, my colleagues, of getting this funding, as the President \nindicated he is going to veto the bill so it will come around again.\n  I certainly would pledge to work with the distinguished floor manager \nfrom New Hampshire, my long-time friend, the former chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee and one who actually presided at the birth. \nThis ought not to be an issue that divides us, Mr. President, on \npartisan grounds because it has broad bipartisan support. The Governors \nsupport it. The private sector is most energized, and as I say, this \nWhite House tourism conference was the first time in years I have been \ninvolved where we actually brought in every segment of the tourism \nindustry, focusing on a strategy of how we can increase our \ninternational travel.\n  I would certainly invite comments from my friend, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, Mr. President, \nlet me first acknowledge the leadership of the chairman of our tourism \ncaucus. As he has indicated, he has correlated a most wonderful \ncoordinated effort on both sides of the aisle and more or less some on \nthe House side.\n  But I say to the Senator, in responding--I must say that the House \nconferees were pretty adamant. The Senator had the cooperation of our \ndistinguished chairman. The Senator had the cooperation of this \nparticular Senator. And we continue to do our very best. But I can tell \nthe Senator, they were pretty intransigent on the House side.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am not unmindful of the difficulties that occur in \ntrying to reconcile differences between the two bodies.\n  I say to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the floor \nmanager, the Senator from New Hampshire, I pledge to work with him as \nwell to--this is not a partisan issue. And I would certainly, if he has \nany thoughts in terms of how I could be helpful, those of us who have \nspent a good bit of time in trying to work out a reasonable compromise, \nreorganizing that the agency is going to be terminated at the end of \nthe next fiscal year under the proposal that we advanced as a \ncompromise measure, I certainly would be happy to be guided by his \nsuggestion in terms of how we might approach our \n\n[[Page S 18139]]\ncolleagues in the House who are perhaps less informed about what this \nmeans to all of us.\n\n  Whether we are from the West, the Northeast, the South, wherever, \nclearly we have an industry which is growing enormously. We are going \nto have 661 million people that will be traveling throughout the world \nby the turn of the century. And America is the travel bargain of the \nworld. I certainly would be happy to yield to my friend from New \nHampshire and take any suggestions that he might have in terms of how \none might work with him and our Senate colleagues who understand how \nimportant this is.\n  Mr. GREGG. I certainly appreciate the Senator from Nevada's interest \nin this, and his understanding of the importance that tourism plays in \nthe economy, obviously of his great State, but many of our States, \ntourism being the largest employer in the State of New Hampshire.\n  However, I think the concerns that the House raised had some \ncredibility. They were concerned about the fact that this agency, \nalthough on a theoretical downward glidepath toward being eliminated, \nmay actually have a certain Phoenix-like quality to it, as a result of \nthe conference may actually be coming back to us with the request for \nfunding which would be in the multiple millions of dollars, \napproximately $50 million as a joint venture exercise.\n  So I think they decided that rather than go through the gnashing of \nteeth and trauma of fighting this battle a year from now, to fight it \nnow and terminate the agency. They were very insistent in their \nposition. I suspect that it will be difficult, depending on how this \nbill comes back, to change that position.\n  But I am certainly happy to sit with the Senator and work with him on \nany ideas that he might have. I think the real concern here is that we \nbe on a glidepath to termination and that we not be on a glidepath that \nis sort of a touch and go.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate my friend's comments. If I might respond and \nengage him in a constructive colloquy. The $50 million that the Senator \nmade reference to is $50 million of private-sector capital. As I am \nsure the Senator from New Hampshire is aware, at the White House \nconference one of the reasons that was part of the compromise--which \nwas accepted by the Senate--that was crafted in the fashion in which it \nwas was that we recognized that the agency would terminate at the end \nof this fiscal year under the proposal the Senate embraced. Therefore, \nduring this transitional year the industry would have to come up with \nthis $50 million.\n  I say to the Senator--I know he knows this; perhaps our House \ncolleagues have not followed as closely; again, I would certainly be \ndelighted to work with him--that $50 million is not an attempt to come \nin sideways or in the back door to get $50 million Federal dollars. I \ncan represent to the Senator from New Hampshire that, if we can get \nthis compromise in a future conference report, because the President \nindicated he is going to veto this, that I will represent to him it \nwill be my intention to oppose any attempt to extend the agency beyond \nthat year, based upon a representation that we made on the floor.\n  So I am not part of any effort, I can assure my colleague, to just \nkeep it alive this year and then argue, ``Well, look, we need to keep \nit alive another year.'' This is $12 million. This is it. And this is \nthe transitional year for the industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself time.\n  The Senator from Nevada has expressed a good case in the context of \n``we are going to terminate this agency; is it $12 million or $2 \nmillion we need to do that.'' The concern the House raised, I think, is \na legitimate concern.\n  I want to give a very distinct clarification on this. As I understood \nthe small business conference report, they wanted to follow, or \nsuggested they follow, the Canadian system where the private sector \ndoes put in $50 million, but the Government puts in a matching amount, \nand that there is, if not stated, at least an implication we are going \nto end up with a joint program involving the Federal Government or a \nrequest for a joint program involving the Federal Government once the \nprivate sector has raised the $50 million. I think that is the concern. \nThat type of contingent, potential liability should be nipped now \nrather than get into the fight at a later date.\n  We will certainly rejoin this issue when we get the bill back, and I \nappreciate the Senator's thoughts.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for the purpose of a single \nquestion?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me say, clearly the decision that we deal with is, \nwhat do we do during this critical year? I understand the concern that \nmay be addressed as to, will there be a request next year or the year \nthereafter? I put my own credibility on the line and tell the Senator \nthat, to his House colleagues and to our House colleagues who may have \nthat concern, this is not a guise to come back next year or the year \nthereafter. This, I think, is a very practical way to deal with the \nsituation, which we all acknowledge that the Agency is going to be \nterminated after the end of the year, as a practical matter. For $12 \nmillion, we get the benefit of a functioning Agency; for $8 million, we \nget no benefit at all and simply pay folks to terminate contracts and \nfor severance pay.\n  To the extent I want to be helpful, I assure the Senator I want to \nwork with him and encourage him to use his own legendary persuasive \nskills as a former chief executive of his own State. I have some \nsympathy and understanding of how effective the Senator can be. Our \ndistinguished friend from South Carolina also served as a chief \nexecutive of his State. So, together, we can work on this. We are only \ntalking about $12 million. I think we may be able to get that back in.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Nevada. \nProbably the best way we can get that money is to get the entire \nCongress out of here for Christmas.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is \nroughly 1 hour 40 minutes under my control. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use up to \nthat point.\n  I rise today in opposition to the Department of Justice \nappropriations in this conference report and an attempt by my \nRepublican colleagues to rewrite the anticrime legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  In my view, it is a lousy idea to rewrite crime policy on an \nappropriations bill, wiping out major programs the Senate created only \nlast year after 6 years of extended debate and replacing it with new \nprograms without review or debate and doing it all on an appropriations \nbill. It is unnecessary, in my view, and it is completely contrary to \nhow the Senate has traditionally worked.\n  I assume--and I see the distinguished chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee is here--I assume it is because you cannot get the votes \nstraight up and down to change the law through the authorizing process, \nbecause I have not seen anybody come here to the floor and say they do \nnot want 100,000 cops. I have not seen anybody come to the floor and \nsay they do not want the prison money the way it is allocated. The \nargument goes on. But it is kind of doing it in a way that obviates \nthat kind of debate, discussion and votes on individual items within \nthe crime bill.\n  We all know that the Republicans have wanted to change the crime \nbill, and they have wanted to change it since it was passed, I assume \nin part because it has a Democratic label on it. I have not heard many \nother compelling reasons why it is a bad idea. But they say it is in \ntheir Contract With America to change the crime bill. I do \n\n[[Page S 18140]]\nnot know anywhere under the Contract With America the American people \nsaid they do not want 100,000 more cops. I do not know of any police \nunder the Contract With America who say they do not want to build any \nmore prisons or who say they want to go back to the old LEAA days where \ncops could buy Dick Tracy watches, and small municipalities could buy \narmored personnel carriers, and you could spend money on public \ndefenders instead of on a cop, which you can do now the way the \nAppropriations Committee has rewritten this legislation.\n  I do not recall anybody who ran as a Republican on the Contract With \nAmerica campaigning on those issues. The fact is that Senator Dole and \nSenator Hatch at least had the good grace to straightforwardly \nintroduce a bill to change the 1994 crime law, and they have every \nright to try to do that. They introduced such a bill, but they have not \nchosen to act on it. No one has called up the crime bill.\n  Where is the crime bill? I have been hearing since the day that Mr. \nGingrich became Speaker and the Democrats lost control of the Senate \nthat one of the first items on the agenda was a Republican crime bill. \nWell, bring it on. Where is it? Where is the Republican crime bill? Let \nus debate it. But, no, the Republican crime bill is now in the \nappropriations bill, allowing everyone to go back home and say, no, I \ndid not eliminate the 100,000 cops; I did not eliminate the drug \ncourts; I did not do that; I did not change any of that. All I did was \nvote for an appropriations bill to give you more flexibility.\n  Translated, you do not get 100,000 cops. Translated, you do not get \nwhat is in the crime bill. Where is the Republican crime bill? Please \nbring it to the floor. I have been waiting to debate it. I can hardly \nwait. But it looks like I am going to wait until the next Congress, \nassuming I am here, which is not an assumption I am relying upon.\n  This is a blatant attempt to sidestep the usual process in this body \nand, I think, by stealth to try to get it both ways. This bill is, of \ncourse, dead. Dead. Dead. It is not going nowhere, to use the \nvernacular. It may have the votes to pass here. I hope that allows you \nall to say that you have fulfilled your contract with yourselves, but \nyou are sure not fulfilling a contract with the American people.\n  I hope you will feel good about that and then maybe, after you come \nback, after the President vetoes this, we will go through this again. \nLet us do it straight up, because I want you to stand up on the floor \nand say, I do not want 100,000 cops. Say it. We will debate it. Take it \nto the people.\n  Notwithstanding that we will be right back here doing this again in a \nfew days, I should like to list and then explain some of the major \nchanges this conference report proposes. First, as I have mentioned, it \nwould eliminate the 100,000 cops program that was established a year \nago in the crime law and maintained in the Senate appropriations bill. \nBecause we had this debate, remember. We did this over here through the \nappropriations process. And as they say in the southern part of my \nState, ``Y'all lost.''\n  But never fear; Gingrich is here. So you headed to the other side, \nand you caved in in conference and now are back here, I assume in part, \nto be able to go home and say, ``We didn't cut the 100,000 cops \nprogram.''\n  We have already funded more than 25,000 new police officers across \nthe country in this first year alone, and I challenge any of you to go \nhome and hold a press conference and say you did not want those cops to \ncome to your State--25,000. ``Moses'' Heston, better known as Charlton \nHeston, ran ads, was on an ad for months when we were debating this \ncrime bill saying there was not even enough money in here for 20,000 \ncops. We already have 5,000 more than ``Moses'' thought would be in the \nbill, with 75,000 more to come--unless this became law.\n  There are 25,000 that police departments across the Nation have \nalready put in place, and police departments across the Nation have \nalready applied for more than $0.5 billion in fiscal year 1996 to fund \nan additional 9,000 new cops, and these pending applications are now \nthreatened by this conference report. In its place is a law enforcement \nblock grant, the old LEAA Program, which is written so broadly that the \nmoney could be sent back to the States, could be spent on everything \nfrom prosecutors to probation officers, from traffic lights to parking \nmeters, and not a single new cop. The block grant, this block grant \nthat is in the bill now has never been authorized by the Senate.\n\n  Let me explain why, when I wrote this bill in the first place, now \nthe crime law, I insisted it go for cops. Because the way it works now \nis that in order to get a new cop at home the Federal Government will \nput up roughly $75,000 if the mayor, the county executive, or whomever \nputs up the rest. But it requires the mayor, the county executive, the \nGovernor to step up to the ball, stop mouthing to their constituents \nthey want more cops; they just cannot do it. But under this \nlegislation, they will get the money and they will not buy the cop \nbecause when they buy the cop, they have to make a commitment they are \ngoing to keep that cop for 5 years and they are going to \nstraightforwardly tell the voters, their constituents, that is what \nthey are spending the money for. It is going to be a lot easier for \nthem when they do the budget now to say, I can make it look like we are \nmaking progress here; we will not hire any new cops. We will pay for \nthose traffic lights we were going to buy out of our city taxes with \nFederal dollars.\n  I used to be a county councilman. That is what we did with the old \nLEAA money. We did not hire any more cops. What we did, we fired cops. \nWe fired cops; we fired firemen; we fired law enforcement people who we \nwere paying for with county funds and we rehired them with the Fed \nmoney.\n  I see some of the staff on both sides are smiling. That is what we \ndid, and that is what will happen again. Because then we would say--I \nwill never forget sitting in a county council meeting. The chairman of \nour council was a very distinguished man, his name was C.W. Buck. I \nmean that sincerely. He was a very distinguished Republican. His father \nhad been the Governor of the State of Delaware. I turned to Mr. Buck, \nsaying, ``Mr. Chairman, how much will this cost us?'' He looked at me \nand said, ``It will not cost anything.'' I said, ``Why?'' He said, ``It \nis Federal money. We don't have to put up a cent.''\n  So in New Castle County, DE, and Wilmington, DE, we laid off cops, \nthen hired them back with Federal money. What was the net effect? Not \none ounce of additional public safety, guaranteed. Not one new cop. \nBut, boy, it is real appealing when you are the county executive and \nreal appealing when you are the Governor and real appealing when you \nare the mayor not to have to come up with any money, and then go tell \nyour constituents what you are doing for them.\n  Now, look, if Governors and mayors--if the reason you Republicans are \ndoing away with this program is in the name of helping localities so \nthey do not have to put up their money to get a cop, great. Under the \nexisting legislation, they did not have to ask for a cent. There is no \nrequirement that says, Athens, GA, must send in a request for more \ncops. Athens, GA, or Berlin, NH, they say, ``We don't want any more \ncops and we don't want any more Federal money.'' No problem. Send it to \nDelaware. We will pay.\n  So in the name of helping localities, letting them, from a ``block \ngrant''--that is a code word, folks. Block grant means ``we don't have \nto spend it for cops because cops cost us money. It costs us money.'' \nGovernors and mayors and county executives, they have their budget \npeople coming in saying, ``Look, Gov, look, Mr. County Executive, look, \nMadam Mayor, if you sign on to this, this means we have to, for the \nnext x number of years, put in our share of what this additional cop is \ngoing to cost us.''\n  It is like what you find in most States. I have never been to a State \nlegislative body--and I have been to a number and had the privilege of \nspeaking to a lot of them--but Democrat or Republican, where they did \nnot have, in the State legislature, debate that goes like this: ``You \nknow, violent crime is an overwhelming problem in the State of x, and \nwe must do more to fight crime. We're going to pass laws that increase \nthe penalty tenfold, and we are going to do this, and so on.''\n  They do pass all the penalty laws. And then somebody has the temerity \n\n\n[[Page S 18141]]\nto say, ``By the way, we don't have enough prisons to put these people \nin. We don't have the prisons. There's not the space.'' And then what \ndo those folks do? Do they go to you, the voters, and say, ``Well, you \nknow, we have got to raise your taxes to build more prisons''? Oh, no. \nThey tell you how tough they are, and then they let the folks out of \nprison.\n  That is why, by the way, nationwide, if you live in the State of \nPennsylvania, you live in the State of California, you live in the \nState of Texas, when you get sent to jail, you do not go to jail for \nthe time for which you are sent. You get 10 years for robbery? You \nserve on average 4.6 years. But guess what? In the Federal Government, \nyou get sentenced to 10 years, you go to jail for 10 years. Bingo.\n  You ever wonder why folks do not want to be tried in a Federal court \nand they prefer to be tried in a State court, even in tough hang-them \nStates like Texas and States like mine? Because they are not nearly as \ntough as the Federal Government, because we put our money where our \nmouth is. We have said, ``You do the crime, you do the time.'' It is \ncalled the Sentencing Commission. I authored it with several other \npeople back in the early 1980's. And we do not fool around.\n  The point I am making is one that is not popular to make, and I \nshould not make, I am sure my political folks are going to tell me, but \nit is the truth. We let the States off the hook, we let the cities off \nthe hook. They will not hire the cops, and that is what you all are \ndoing. That is what you Republicans are doing here. It is not going to \nenhance public safety one iota.\n  I want 100,000 new cops on the street. That is why I wrote the bill. \nWe have roughly 550,000 local police officers. When this crime bill is \nall over and we spend $30 billion, if you all have your way, we will \nhave 575,000 cops on the street, maybe. I want 650,000 cops on the \nstreet. We need more cops.\n  Again, you do not have to ask for a single cop, Governor; you do not \nhave to ask for a single cop, Madam Mayor; you do not have to ask for a \nsingle cop, County Executive. But if you ask, you have to kick in, and \nwe will give you $75,000 per cop on average. Pretty healthy commitment \nby the Federal Government.\n  Let me tell you what else this bill would do. This bill would \ncompletely eliminate or severely restrict other programs set up in the \n1994 crime law, like the Drug Court Program, the Rural Drug Enforcement \nGrant Program, the Law Enforcement Scholarship Program, the Scams \nProgram for fighting telemarketing fraud against senior citizens, that \nthe Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Hatch, authored and I coauthored. There are tried and \ntested programs that fight youth violence, for example, by putting \nboys' and girls' clubs in housing projects. Under the 1994 crime law, \nthese programs were targeted for separate funds in addition to the \nfunds for the 100,000 cops.\n  But under the conference report of the Appropriations Committee, a \nmayor would have only the amount of the block grant out of which all \nefforts would have to be funded. The result would be that proven crime-\nfighting programs that the Congress voted to support last year would be \neffectively eliminated.\n  I hear everybody talk, especially my good friend from Texas, Phil \nGramm, talk about being tough on crime. And I hear a lot of my folks \nout there--a lot of folks on your side of the aisle--talk about a lot \nof these liberal mayors. Well, guess what the liberal mayors are going \nto be able to do with your block grant? They are going to be able to \nput it all in programs if they want. They can go out and put it all in \nboys' clubs and girls' clubs if they want. They can put it all in \nprevention if they want, and not one new cop if they want.\n  Now, all of a sudden, I am amazed how trusting you are. I hear \nSenator Gramm and others talk about the liberal Conference of Mayors. \nWell, my Lord, you are a trusting bunch. You really are. You have seen \nthe light. I guess you are for straight prevention now. What do you \nthink the cities are going to do with this money? You and they are \ngoing to go out and hire cops? Oh, yeah, right. With their tight \nbudgets? So you folks on the Republican side, I am amazed, have become \nthe lily-livered liberals, what I am called over on this side. You all \nare the ones now changing the rules. You are changing the rules.\n  Now that this can be all spent for prevention, who are the tough \nguys? I hope you are not going to stand up and make any more of those \nspeeches about, ``Lock them up and throw the key away, and don't take \nmy mama's gun away,'' the ones we hear, you know, rolled out every 4 \nmonths or so.\n  Block grant means just that, it is a block grant: ``Here you go, Mr. \nMayor, do with it what you wish.''\n  You all ran ads, your national party ran ads last election of \nprisoners dancing in tutus. I thought it was really good. It was a \ngreat ad. It shows these prisoners dancing in pink tutus saying, \n``That's what the Democrats want to do.'' That is not what we did, but \nthat is what you are doing. Can you imagine where this money would go \nif Jerry Brown were still Governor?\n  And you talk about getting tough on crime? This is not tough on \ncrime, this is just dumb. This just does not make any sense. If we are \ngoing to legislate by fiat like this, then we might as well do away \nwith committee systems, with hearings, with subcommittee markups, with \nfull committee markups, with careful consideration of authorizing \nlegislation. We can simply do all our Senate business by appropriations \nbills, which is the way we are doing it these days.\n  I guess I am number--I do not know. I do not know what my number in \nseniority is. I think I am 16, 17, 15, something like that. In light of \nthe 99 decisions not to run again for office, if I get elected again, I \nmay even be higher.\n  I made the wrong pick. I came here to legislate. I should have gone \non the Appropriations Committee. I made a big tactical mistake here. \nHad I gone on the Appropriations Committee, I would be the No. 3 or 4 \nranking person on that committee. Why have a Judiciary Committee? Why \nhave a Commerce Committee? Why do this? They do not legislate any of \nthis.\n  I ask a rhetorical question: Why did my friends, Senator Dole and \nSenator Hatch, not bring their crime bill to the Judiciary Committee to \nbe acted on? Why did we not do that? I respectfully suggest it is \nbecause they did not have the votes to win. I respectfully suggest that \nin order to win, you would have to say, ``By the way, we don't want \n100,000 cops added by this crime bill; we don't want more prisons built \nin this crime bill the way we had; we want to change it.''\n  Any of you who doubt what I am saying, any of the press who is \nlistening to this, you go ask any chief of police in the United States \nof America, you go ask any superintendent of the State police in any \nState in America, you go ask the head of any county or city police \norganization, and you ask him or her whether or not they think they \nwill fare better with their budgets for their city, State or county \nwith a block grant that allows the legislature and the Governor to use \nit any way he wishes, or whether they will fare better with the \nproposal with 100,000 cops. You ask them.\n  When I wrote this legislation, Mr. President, I wrote it by first \ncalling in the six major police organizations and asking them, ``What \ndo you need most to deal with the crime problem in America? What do you \nneed the most?'' And they told me. So I wrote the bill with them in the \nroom.\n  They were the ones who said, point blank, ``If you don't require the \nGovernors, the mayors to come up with some of the money for only cops, \nwe won't get any new cops, because we're an expensive item. When we sit \ndown in the budget process in our town or our city, we have to say to \nthe mayor, `Mr. Mayor, if you hire this police officer, you are taking \non a salary of X amount and benefits of Y amount and you are making a \nlong-term commitment, and that is going to impinge on your budget not \nthis year but every year that that cop is around.' But when you don't \ndo it this way, Joe, what you do is you allow them to say they are \nfighting crime by putting lighting in parks. That is a one-shot \noperation and a utility bill. Putting up traffic lights, that is a one-\nshot operation. Hiring a probation officer,'' which I am all for \nhiring, which costs less money and allows the city or county or the \nState to reduce the rest of their State budget to do what they are \nalready doing. This is not revenue sharing, this is about cops. \n\n[[Page S 18142]]\n\n  Now, all that hyperbole about--I even heard one of our colleagues \nsaying when we passed the Biden crime bill, it is now the crime law, I \nheard my colleague say, ``All this means is we are just going to hire \n100,000 new social workers.'' I do not think there is anything wrong \nwith new social workers. We could stand 100,000 new social workers in \nAmerica. But this is about cops.\n  Under the crime law, you cannot use the money for that purpose. But \nmy crime-fighting Republican friends and the staff who helped them \nwrite this--I do not know if the staff realizes what a favor they have \ndone for their principals. They have now allowed them to hire 100,000 \nsocial workers. We should rename the bill: ``The social worker bill.'' \nYou can hire instead of 100,000 cops--there is not enough money left, \nyou can only hire 75,000 new social workers. You cannot do that under \nmy bill, under the crime law, and this is masquerading as fighting \ncrime.\n  I would like to briefly point out that another Republican plan in \nthis conference report is to drastically cut Federal law enforcement as \nwell. The conference report does the following: It cuts the FBI by $112 \nmillion below the President's request, so new FBI agents will not be \nhired; it cuts the Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA, $5 million below \nwhat the President has requested for drug enforcement officers in this \nNation; it cuts interagency drug enforcement by $15 million below 1995 \nand $19 million below what the President has requested; and it cuts \nFederal prosecutors by $13 million below the President's request. So \nmuch for your credentials of tough on crime.\n  I do not know why you are doing this. Maybe it is because you want to \ngive tax cuts to people making 250,000 bucks. But for my money, I want \na prosecutor. I want a new DEA agent. I want more FBI agents. You cut \nall of them, every one of those areas you cut below the President's \nrequest.\n  But as the saying goes, talk is cheap. Talk without commitment of \ndollars is meaningless. Republicans in the conference have failed to \nfund the President's request for Federal law enforcement despite all \nthe talk about being for law enforcement.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let us look at these cuts to Federal law enforcement. The \nconference report cuts $5 million from the $54 million boost requested \nfor the DEA by the President. Again, we hear a lot of talk about how we \nneed more to fight illegal drugs, and there is much finger-pointing \nabout that the administration should do more, and they should. But in \nthe end, it is the Congress that fails to fund the drug enforcement \nrequest of the President.\n  In yet another important area, let us review what has happened in \ninteragency drug enforcement. The organized crime and drug enforcement \ntask forces combine the efforts of the FBI, the DEA, U.S. attorneys, \nImmigration and Naturalization and the Marshal Service, Customs \nService, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Internal Revenue, all working \ntogether in 13 regional task forces to target and destroy major \nnarcotic trafficking organizations. And you need them all. The \nPresident requested $378 million for this program, but the Republican \nconference cut this amount by $19 million. This means that we will cut \nthe important drug-fighting capacity below the 1995 level. In other \nwords, you have all decided that the drug problem, I guess, is less \nworse this year than last year, notwithstanding all your speeches, with \nwhich I agree, that the problem is worse this year than it was last. \nBut you decided to cut it. You did not decide to say we should \nrestructure it or that the money is not being used wisely and we should \nredo it; you decided to keep the existing system and cut it.\n\n  Let me also point out that the Republican conference report cuts the \nPresident's request for U.S. attorneys, U.S. prosecutors. Our Federal \nprosecutors are the ones who prosecute all Federal crimes. You cut this \nby $13 million. The President requested an increase of $86 million to \nboost Federal prosecutors, but the conference report backed away from \nthis commitment. In short, the conference report cuts the President's \nrequest for Federal law enforcement. So our Federal effort against \ncrime and drugs will be fought by fewer FBI agents, fewer DEA agents, \nand fewer Federal prosecutors than requested. I assume that is because \nyou all think that there is less crime, that there is less of a drug \nproblem, and there is less of a need to prosecute.\n  If you believe that, this is fine, no problem. But somebody stand up \nand tell me that. Stand up and tell me that is the reason why you cut \nit back. If you tell me you cut it back for budgetary reasons, then I \nsay, fine, you have made your priority choice. You have chosen other \nthings to spend money on, or to cut taxes for, rather than on these. \nThat is a legitimate position to take. But do not get up and tell me \nhow you want to fight crime, how it has gotten so bad, how it is so \nterrible, how we want to move so rapidly on it, but, by the way, we can \nall do it with less money and effort. That does not work. That does not \nwork, I respectfully suggest. It may work politically, but not \npractically.\n  I would like to return to the merits of the 1994 crime law. The 1994 \ncrime law, in my view, and in the view of law enforcement officers \nacross the country, is working. The passage of the major $30 billion \nanticrime package last year capped a 6-year effort to launch a bold and \ncomprehensive and tough attack on violent crime in the roots of \nAmerican communities. As we pass the 1 year mark, it is already clear \nthat the major programs of the bill are working even beyond my \nexpectations. Consider the 100,000 cops program. If this had been a \ntypical grant program, the Federal Government would just now, at the \nend of the first fiscal year of funding, be preparing to issue its \nfirst awards. That is how it has worked in the six Presidential \nadministrations I have been here for. They would be just now doing it.\n  The better part of the year would have been consumed drafting \nregulations and preparing application forms before money could finally \nbe disbursed at the end of the year. The implementation of the 1994 \ncrime law stands in stark contrast to this typical scenario. Instead of \nrequiring burdensome applications that often fail to work and fill \nentire binders, a one-page application was developed by the Attorney \nGeneral. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to distribute the \nfunds, the money was awarded in batches beginning only weeks after the \npassage of the law. As a result, we find ourselves, at the end of the \nfirst year, with nearly all the fiscal year money out the door, with \nall of the funds having already been sent on their way to the States, \nand with more than 25,000 out of 100,000 new cops already funded in \nevery State in the Nation. In a word, the law is working.\n  In addition to the new police, the law's provisions combating \nviolence against women are also working. The first criminal has been \ntried and convicted under the new Federal violence against women \nstatute, resulting in a life sentence for Christopher J. Bailey, who \nkidnapped and beat his wife nearly to death. Otherwise, he would have \nonly gotten a couple years in jail. In addition, charges have already \nbeen filed in another case. Every State has received a grant to \nincrease the police, prosecutors, and the victim services to combat \nfamily violence. Rape shield laws have been extended to protect more \nvictims. Women no longer have to pay for medical examinations to prove \nthey are raped, which had been the practice up until now. The victims \nof rape are finally being treated like the victims of any other crime. \nThese long-overdue measures mean that women are now being protected, \ninstead of further victimized, by the criminal justice system.\n  Another major accomplishment of the 1994 crime law is the military-\nstyle boot camp prisons. Crime law dollars are already at work helping \n27 States plan and build and run military-style boot camps for \nnonviolent offenders. Boot camps allow States suffering from \novercrowding problems to move nonviolent prisoners into cheaper space. \nBoot camps cost about one-third the price, per bed, as a conventional \nprison, and thereby free up space for the most violent offenders in \nconventional prisons.\n  Yet, another effort that is already underway is the drug court \nprogram. But before I move to that, let me tell you what this prison \nprogram in the crime law would look like after it goes through this \nreincarnation, were the President not to veto this.\n  The prison program in the crime law we passed last year was designed \nto \n\n[[Page S 18143]]\nmeet two goals: First, to help States increase and then use to a \nmaximum advantage the supply of prison space they have available to \nthem. The second purpose was to encourage States to adopt the kind of \ntruth-in-sentencing system that has been instituted by the Federal \nGovernment, to which I referred about 15 minutes ago. Today, prison \nsystems in 34 States are under court order for overcrowding, and \nbecause there are not enough prison cells, many States are keeping \nviolent criminals behind bars for roughly only 46 percent of the time \nfor which they have been sentenced.\n  Worse yet, 30,000 offenders, who each year are convicted of a violent \ncrime, do not even see a single, solitary day in prison. That is, \n30,000 convicted in State court systems of a violent crime do not see a \nsingle day in prison because the States either do not have the money or \ndo not have the leadership or do not have the gumption to tell the \ntaxpayers that if they want these tough laws, they have to build more \nprisons.\n  The 1994 crime law is helping States respond to that problem with a \n$9.7 billion grant program. Under the 1994 crime law, States can use \nthe money to build and operate additional secure prison cells for \nviolent criminals or for boot camp prisons for nonviolent offenders, \nthereby freeing up secured prison space for violent offenders.\n  Let me tell you about these boot camps. Today, there are 160,000 \nyoung, nonviolent minor offenders who are behind bars in costly prison \ncells. That just does not make any sense. They are nonviolent, they are \nfirst offenders primarily, and they are behind bars at more than what \nit costs per year to send your kid to Harvard or Yale.\n  What this does, the crime law encourages States to take them out of \nthose systems if they choose, put them in boot camps where you string \nbarbed wire, you have the equivalent of Quonset huts. Make them engage \nin military-style activities to occupy them. It does not hurt marines \nor trainees. Surely, it will not hurt them at about one-third the cost.\n  I am encouraged that the Republicans' prison proposal permits States \nto use the funds for boot camps. That is an important change, I might \nadd, and I compliment them for that on the House bill. But the fact of \nthe matter is, it is a big change.\n  One of the key problems in the Republican prison plan is it permits \nStates only to build or expand prisons, leaving out the ability to \nspend the funds to operate the present system. The State of Florida, \nwhen we had this debate on the bill, had built new prisons. They are \nsitting there with not a prisoner in them because they do not have the \nmoney to operate the prisons. They needed them badly but did not have \nthe budget to operate them. This just does not make sense.\n  When the 1994 prison provisions were written we heard from several \nStates about these operating problems. A close look at the fine print \nin this bill reveals what I believe is one of the most troublesome \naspects. While $617 million is appropriated for prison grants in the \nconference report, the Republican conferees raided $200 million of that \nfund to fund prisons in just seven or eight States.\n  Let me explain that. The bill directly funds $300 million to \nreimburse States for the cost of housing criminal aliens in State \nprisons. That was a provision included in the 1994 crime law. I support \nthat goal.\n  On top of that $300 million in direct appropriations to reimburse \nStates for incarcerating criminal aliens, language was slipped into the \nbill so that an additional $200 million was shifted from general prison \ngrants for all States through the Criminal Alien Reimbursement Program. \nI assume that was a legacy of the Senator from Texas before he went to \nthe Finance Committee. So that means a few States are going to get the \nmoney.\n  I point out to my colleagues if you are not from Arizona, Florida, \nTexas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, California, or Michigan, funds \nthat should have gone to building prisons in your States have been \nstolen in this conference report. I think this is outrageous.\n  I support the need to reimburse States for these costs, but in the \n1994 crime law, we recognize that crime is plaguing all States, not \njust a few of the largest States in America.\n  I have a list here that I ask unanimous consent to have printed at \nthis point, entitled ``Conference Report Prison Funding--How Does Your \nState Do?''\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT PRISON FUNDING--HOW DOES YOUR STATE DO?

data compiled by National Institute of Corrections and Department of Justice.                    \n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me point out to you, if you are in \nAlaska you will get $1.495 million less; if you are in Colorado, you \nget $3.822 million less; in Delaware, you get $1.532 million less; in \nMaine, you get $1.050 million less; in Maryland, $8 million less; in \nMassachusetts, $8 million less; Missouri, $2 million less--I am \nrounding these numbers down--in Montana, $1 million less. I did not \nthink that was the deal.\n  There are more problems with what they did with prisons in this \nconference report. In the crime law, it permits all States to qualify \nfor one or both pots of the prison money. There are two pots of prison \nmoney. There is 50 percent for general grants that essentially all \nStates receive because there are no hard strings or conditions on these \ndollars, and 50 percent of the money is to go to States which meet the \ntruth-in-sentencing standards we set out.\n  The Republican conference also splits prison dollars into two pots, \nbut States are forced to choose either one or the other, even if they \nqualify for both. This is the second reason why so many States will get \nso many fewer prison dollars on a Republican conference report. It \nseems to me to be written by Speaker Gingrich to favor only the biggest \nStates.\n  There is a third problem that most Senators will be hearing about \nfrom the prison officials in their States. I know none of the Senators \nis likely to be listening to this. They are doing other things, \nincluding being in conferences and hearings themselves, but in addition \nto the Senators on the floor, warn your Senators and be prepared that \nif this becomes law, you will get a call, most of you, from your home \nState. You will have to answer them, ``Why did you cut the money for \nprisons in my State? Why did you do that?''\n  I strongly urge you to take a look at this little chart that I have \njust printed in the Record.\n  To illustrate the problem with these changes, conditions, let me \nreview the situation from my home State. First of all, truth-in-\nsentencing grants: The conference report changes both the standard and \nthe language so that despite the fact that Delaware, unlike all \n\n[[Page S 18144]]\nbut one other State in America, keeps its violent criminals behind bars \nfor 90 percent of the time for which they are sentenced--unlike \nPennsylvania or Maryland, my neighboring States, or New Jersey, it is \none of the highest rates in the Nation, according to the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics--because Delaware State law only refers to a 75 \npercent floor, Delaware is not eligible for truth-in-sentencing grants \nunder this little change.\n  Second, general grants: The conference changes the rules to require \nincreased time served by State prisoners since 1993. Well, Delaware's \ntruth-in-sentencing law came into effect in 1990. We have been doing \nthe right thing since 1990. But, no, it gets changed. Delaware cannot \nincrease the time served since 1993 since we already did it in 1990. \nYou cannot get above 100 percent. That is just one illustration how my \nState and many others are going to be out in the cold.\n  It is one illustration out of the conference report that cuts prison \ndollars for a State. I am sure there are other explanations where other \nStates will have their prison dollars slashed if this conference report \nwere to become law.\n  My staff has prepared this for me, and the title of the next section \nis ``Why Does Utah Do So Well?'' The conference report includes a \nspecial exception, one that appears to help Utah and perhaps a few \nother States, in the truth-in-sentencing prisons.\n  Section 20104, subsection (a), subsection (3) permits only those \nStates with indeterminate sentencing to meet the 85 percent truth-in-\nsentencing standard if they serve 85 percent of their time under the \nState's sentencing and release guidelines.\n  Translated, if you have indeterminate sentencing, you get the money. \nWell, far be it for me to criticize that. Some day I hope to be \nchairman of the committee again and I hope to take unfair advantage of \nthe process for my State. I am not criticizing, but I am complementing \nmy friend from Utah.\n  He does what a good chairman should do. He changed the law to benefit \nhis State at the expense of other States. I understand that. I would do \nthe same thing if I were in his position. It is legitimate. But I just \npoint out that Utah has indeterminate sentencing.\n  Second, the term ``sentencing and release guidelines'' has some \ncircular logic. The only way someone can get out of prison under an \nindeterminant sentencing law is either when they have served a maximum \nsentence or under some sort of release guideline. So this definition is \na self-fulfilling prophecy. Prisoners have to serve 100 percent of the \ntime they have to serve.\n  That is kind of fascinating, is it not? If it is indeterminate, you \nsay at the end of this, they served all the time they were supposed to \nserve so now they served 100 percent of their time so now you qualify \nfor that pot of money. I think it is really good. I mean, it is \nadmirable. If I become chairman of the Judiciary Committee again, \nassuming I get reelected, which is certainly an assumption, and \nassuming the Democrats take back this place, I want to hire one of the \nstaffers who gave this idea to Senator Hatch, because it is \nmagnificent.\n  The only States in the Union that really do not keep their folks in \nprison are the ones with indeterminate sentences, but they are the ones \nwho qualify to be the toughest because, by definition, you would have \nkept them in as long as they were supposed to be in because you never \nsaid how long they had to be in. So, then, all of a sudden, when you \nrelease them, they had been in all the time they were supposed to. That \nis brilliant, absolutely brilliant. But it does not have a darned thing \nto do with what was the intent of the law. This is a definition of a \nself-fulfilling prophecy.\n  The bottom line of all this is 34 States can expect to lose prison \nmoney under this conference report. Again, I have to admit, I admire \nthe ingenuity of my friends. I might add, though, it is easier to do \nthis--I wonder what would happen if we had to vote as if this were a \ncrime bill. If this were a crime bill, you would have to defend that. \nYou would have to defend it. You would have to stand up and say why \nthat is a good idea, and I would beat you. I would beat you even on \nyour side. I would even get Republicans to vote with me.\n  But you figured out a way to keep that from happening. You put it in \nan appropriations bill so we do not have to do that. We can avoid the \nmessy stuff of legislating. We can avoid the messy process of having to \nstand up and vote on this stuff. Do you remember how many votes we had \non prison funding when we had the crime bill up? It went on and on and \non.\n  The reason I point this out again--I mean this sincerely--is not to \ncriticize Senator Hatch. I think it is a great idea. I think if I were \nhe--I wish I had thought of it. But I want to tell you, the bottom line \nis 34 States are going to get less money. If we voted on that, from my \n23 years here, the calculus usually means 34 States beat the remainder. \nBut, I say to the ranking member of the committee, these guys did it \nwell. They did a good job. They really rode you. You did not have the \nvotes. I know you fought like the devil on this one, but they did it \nwell. This is really a masterful piece of work.\n  In the absence of my friend from South Carolina from the floor--I do \nnot want to get him in trouble, but he is the guy primarily responsible \nfor getting me elected, if anybody had helped me, in 1972. But I kind \nof have a growing resentment toward him. He did not tell me to get on \nthe Appropriations Committee when I got here. I thought you legislated \nhere. I thought the process was, you were to get on authorizing \ncommittees. If I wanted to change the criminal justice system, I \nthought I was supposed to get on the Judiciary Committee. I did that, \nand I became the senior Democrat on that committee--sometimes running \nit on the minority side, sometimes the majority side.\n  It took me all this time to figure it out, you steered me wrong, \nBoss. You did not send me the right way. I should have gone to \nappropriations, because anything I do in that committee--it took me 6 \nyears to put this bill together. We fought it and fought it and fought \nit and fought it, and when you came up with harebrained ideas like \nindeterminate sentencing qualifies, I was able to whip you straight up \nand down. But now I do not even get a chance to do that.\n  So, I am at some point going to offer an amendment saying that the \nU.S. Senate should meet as a Committee of the Whole, and we should call \nourselves the Appropriations Committee, and we all get a chance at \nthis. I would like to get in on this.\n  Russell Long, Senator Long, with whom I served for a long time--not \nnearly as long as the Senator from South Carolina did--used to use that \nexpression ``I ain't for no deal I'm not in on.'' It is obvious I am \nnot in on this deal anymore. I authored the bill, but I am out of it. I \ndo not even get to debate it in the usual form where you get to vote on \nit. If my friends are willing to have a freestanding amendment on this, \nwe could ask unanimous consent to waive the rules to allow a vote on \nthe prison funding piece. I would welcome that. In the interests of \nfairness, they might be willing to do that. What do you think? I know \nthe Senator from Massachusetts would support me in that effort, I \nexpect. Maybe we ought to do that. But I have a feeling we are not \ngoing to get to do that.\n  There is another effort that is already underway. That is that thing \ncalled the Drug Court Program. This is a long-overdue drug program to \ncrack down on--let me give you the numbers--600,000 drug-abusing \noffenders who are on our streets today, subject to no random drug \ntesting, no mandatory treatment, and no threat of punishment.\n  Let me translate that for you. Mr. President, 600,000 folks who were \narrested--actually there were about 1.4 million or 1.6 million arrested \nin America--1.4 million. And here is what happened. There are a total \nof 2.7 million State offenders who are on probation. There are 1.4 \nmillion drug offenders on probation. There are 800,000 of that 1.4 \nmillion who are being tested and treated. And there are 600,000 \nconvicted--convicted--convicted drug offenders; not arrested. These are \npeople who either pled guilty or have been convicted in a court of law, \nwho are on the street--no probation, no parole, no testing, no \ntreatment, ``no nothin','' as my Aunt Gerty used to say, ``no \nnothin'.''\n  So we came up with an idea. We actually got it from a Republican \njudge in Delaware, and Dade County, FL. It is \n\n[[Page S 18145]]\ncalled drug courts. Let me tell you what drug courts do. They capture \nthose 600,000 folks and they say, ``Here is the deal. You either--you \nare subject to random drug testing. If you have a job, you have to keep \na job. If you are in school, you have to stay in school. You have to \nshow up for intensive probation. And if you do not do any of those \nthings, you go to jail--probably one of the boot camps which we \nfunded.''\n  But my Republican friends--who I think are getting soft on crime, if \nnot soft in the head on this stuff--they decided we might as well let \nthose 600,000 folks wander the streets, every one of whom is an \naccident waiting to happen. Every one is an accident waiting to happen.\n  Before they put drug courts in Dade County, FL, the rearrest rate for \none-time drug offenders was 36 percent. After several years of these \ndrug courts, the rearrest rate is down to 3 percent. These work and \nthey work in my State.\n  But what is the wisdom here? It is better to be soft than tough? Let \nus do away with this program. The Justice Department has already funded \nefforts to help local officials plan 52 new drug courts, begin 5 new \ndrug courts and expand 8 other drug courts including one in my home \nState, that a Republican court, a Republican judge, a Republican \nattorney general have put together.\n  Despite this concrete record of success, the conference report would \neliminate the separately targeted $150 million Drug Court Program and \nrequire States to fund drug courts, if at all, out of the money that \ncould be spent on hiring cops on the beat. In real terms, this could \nmean about 85,000 drug-abusing offenders will not be subject to drug \ntesting and mandatory treatment.\n  The other provisions of the 1994 crime law that are not affected by \nthis bill are also proving to be very effective in combating crime, \nsuch as provisions against sexual offenders, death penalty provisions, \nthe Brady law, the criminal alien provisions.\n  The reason I say ``not affected,'' remember we had this debate \nbefore. My Republican friends decided what they were going to do is cut \nmoney for the violence against women legislation and do it by the \nappropriating process. Do it that way. Legislate it that way. And the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina came along and said--which he \nalways does, and I am grateful--``By the way, Joe, let me tell you what \nis coming.'' And through his leadership we sort of just stood up and \nsaid, ``Hey, look what they are doing.''\n  We didn't do anything special. They insisted they were going to make \nthe cut. We were going to debate it. We hung on, hung on, hung on, and \nthe very guy who suggested the cut--and I admire him, I truly do, \nSenator Gramm of Texas--he ended up introducing the amendment to \nrestore the money for the violence against women law. So it is not cut \nhere. I guess my Republican friends have heard the call that they had \nbetter not fool around with that piece of it.\n\n  The reason I am taking so much time today knowing that this is going \nnowhere anyway--it is going to be defeated--is this is my attempt to \nplay a small part in raising the same kind of call. The new call is OK. \nWe finally got the Republicans to not fool with the violence against \nwomen law. They are not going to. They will not have the nerve to try \nto cut that again. They will not have the nerve to try to cut it again.\n  But guess what, folks? They are now going after your cops. The answer \nis going to be, look, we are not cutting anything. The total dollars \nare cut, but we are not cutting anything. We are just telling the \nStates we are giving you a pot of money and you do with it what you \nwant. So if you want to hire the cops, you can hire the cops.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. KERRY. As a preface to a couple of questions, I'd like to thank \nthe Senator and ask to be completely associated with his comments--the \nextraordinary, astute, and accurate comments--that precede these \nquestions.\n  I also would preface it by saying that there is nobody in the Senate \nwho has worked harder to produce a real comprehensive, systemic \nresponse to crime than the Senator from Delaware.\n  But, is it not true--I ask the Senator having worked together with \nhim on this question of police officers and cops on our streets--that \ntoday we have, I believe, one-tenth the effective strength of police \nofficers in the streets that we had 30 years ago? Is that not true?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is true. If I can expand 60 seconds on the answer, I \nsay to my friend that 30 years ago for every crime committed, every \nfelony committed, there were three cops. Today for every three crimes \ncommitted there is one cop. There used to be three cops for every \nfelony committed. Now we have for every cop three felonies committed. \nOf the 20 largest States in the Nation, if you look at the last 10 \nyears, the increase in their police force is about 1 percent. Even \nthough the populations are growing, the crime wave is growing above \nthat. The 30-to-10 number the Senator suggests I cannot swear is the \nnumber, but it is close.\n  Mr. KERRY. From 1971 to 1990, in the midst of this increase in crime \nwave, and in the midst of the diminution in the number of police \nofficers, we increased the Federal spending on lawyers and public \ndefenders by 200 percent, and we increased prison spending by 156 \npercent. But we only increased the spending on police officers by 12 \npercent.\n  I ask the Senator, is it not true that the effort to put 100,000 \npolice directly into the streets of America--the least costly, the \nleast administratively overburdened manner--was a direct response from \npolice officers themselves, from police chiefs themselves, and from \nmayors all across this country who simply did not have the ability to \nrespond to this crime wave?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend that he is absolutely categorically \ncorrect. And there is one other piece of this. After years of hearings, \nextensive hearings on the issue of violent crime in America--I realize \nit does not mean much in the new process; you just do appropriations--\nbut after years of hearings, there are only a few things that we know \nabout crime. The Senator, as a former prosecutor, knows this better \nthan the Senator from Delaware. If there is a cop on one corner, and \nthere is not a cop on the other, it is much more likely that the crime \nwill be committed where the cop is not. I mean it sounds bizarre. We do \nnot know that much about criminal behavior except we know that where \nthere are cops and where there is light there is less crime--prevention \nof crime; let alone the arrest and prosecution, prevention of crime.\n  So the purpose of the 100,000 cops and the purpose for the request \nfrom the cops was that they are outmanned, they are outgunned, and they \nare outwitted because of all the array of technology, the new and the \ndifferent nature of crime in America. That is why we need more cops. \nThat is why they asked for them.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could further ask my friend a question, is it not \nalso true that while some communities may decide they do not need nor \nwant a cop, for that community that might make that decision, there are \nprobably 10 or 15 or 20 or 100 other ones in the country that could use \n2 or 3 or 4 cops but which cannot get them because even the 100,000 \ncops is not enough to do what we ought to be doing?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I answer my colleague by saying the following: Look at the \napplications that have come in. I will once again compliment the \nAttorney General. Find me a cop in your State or in the State of \nCalifornia, New Hampshire, or South Carolina representative of Senators \non the floor, or Colorado, who calls the process burdensome; the one-\npage application, No. 1. No. 2, of the applications every single month \nthere are more applications than there is money. They would probably be \nable to sustain 200,000 more cops. I am pulling that number out. I do \nnot know for a fact. I know there are more applications than there is \nmoney.\n  Since my time is running out, I only have 3 minutes left, I am told, \nmay I conclude rather than answer, on another question?\n  I would like to reiterate that in its breadth the 1984 crime law \nreflects the lessons that have been learned over the past decade as we \nstudied crime and law enforcement, and have worked on passing this law. \nAnd in its approach, \n\n[[Page S 18146]]\nas well as in its many specifics, the law was a result of bipartisan \nefforts. We should not retreat on this tough but smart crime package. \nIt already is hard at work preventing violent crime across the country. \nWe should not retreat on the 100,000 cops program that we insisted on \njust a few months ago.\n  Let me point out that the $30 billion crime trust fund that uses the \nsavings from cutting 272,000 Federal bureaucrats--160,000 have already \nleft--pays for every cop, for every prison cell, and for every shelter \nfor a battered woman and child. That is provided for in this crime bill \nwithout adding to the deficit or requiring 1 red cent additional in \ntaxes. That was the deal we made right here on the Senate floor 1 year \nago.\n  Now my Republican colleagues are trying to block out what we did, and \nback out of the deal by refusing to write the checks for next year's \nfunding of the crime law. The money is there in the trust fund.\n  I have tried today to outline my objections to the Republican retreat \nrepresented by this conference report on the key provisions of the \nanticrime law last year.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider very carefully whether this is \nthe right form, the right idea, to dismantle these vital parts of the \nalready successful and highly popular crime bill.\n  In the end I suspect that the merits will speak for themselves, and \nthe American people will decide whether it is a good idea to take this \ntrust fund money and spend it on 100,000 cops and the other programs \nhere, or reduce it and send it out in block grants. And $525 million in \napplications are out there as we speak. Already, as of November 16, the \nJustice Department has received applications for an additional 9,100 \ncops under the 100,000 cops program beyond the 26,000 that have already \nbeen granted.\n  This is concrete evidence that the 100,000 cops program is working, \nis necessary, is local, and is needed. The shift to a block grant is \nwrong for many reasons. The 9,100 additional police that are all ready \nto go and waiting for us only to finish this political debate, is the \nmost important reason why to shift the block grant is the wrong thing \nto do. Let us not try to change horses in midstream. This program is \nworking.\n  If my Republican friends need to be able to say they have a \nRepublican crime bill so that they can meet their contract pledge, let \nthem pass the antiterrorism bill that we passed. It is the Hatch-Biden \nbill. Let us call it the Hatch-Republican bill. Let that be your crime \nbill. You can go back to your Republican conservative friends and say, \n``You have a crime bill''--in order to meet a pledge that no one signed \non to to dismantle one of the few big Federal programs that is working, \nworking well, working without additional bureaucracy, and to do the \njob.\n  Let me say in final conclusion, if you doubt what I am saying, I \nchallenge you to go home and find out that for every new cop that this \nnew bill has in fact funded so far, just ask the police chief, or the \ncommissioner of police, for whom that cop works, to list the number of \ndollars that cop has made. Then go get the names of the people that \npolice officer has collared, has arrested--the criminal who he gets who \nnames the victims. And then you go ask those victims whether or not \nthis crime law made any sense.\n  This all comes down to the little tiny things, and the little tiny \nthings here are making sure there are fewer victims of crime, and that \nthose victims are in fact getting their day if court, and that they \nfind the bad guy. That is why we need more cops.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Department of Justice \nappropriations in this conference report and the attempt by my \nRepublican colleagues to rewrite anticrime legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n\n\n                         Procedural objections\n\n  It is, in my view, a terrible idea to rewrite crime policy--wiping \nout major programs the senate created only last year and replacing them \nwith new programs without review or debate--on an appropriations bill. \nIt is unnecessary and completely contrary to how the Senate has \ntraditionally worked.\n  We all know the Republicans want to change the crime law now at work. \nThey said so in their Contract With America. House Republicans passed a \nnew bill.\n  Here, Senators Dole and Hatch introduced their bill to change the \n1994 crime law. They have every right to try to do so.\n  But they have not chosen to do so. Their bill has never been acted on \nby the Senate, or even had one hearing. Instead, what we now have with \nthis conference report is an attempt to change the current law by \nlifting entire parts of the crime bill passed in the House and \nattaching them to this appropriations bill. That House crime bill has \nalready been rejected by the Senate when we amended the appropriations \nbill to restore the 100,000 cops on the beat program a couple of months \nago.\n  This blatant attempt to sidestep the usual deliberative process of \nthis body is, I believe, a terrible way to make law.\n  This bill is, of course, dead. It will be vetoed because, among other \nreasons, it eliminates the commitment the President and Congress made \nto the American people to get 100,000 cops on the beat. And it will \ncontinue to be vetoed until my Republican colleagues get the message \nthat there will be no new crime bill without the 100,000 cops on the \nbeat program. The Senate has already rejected this bill without the \n100,000 cops program and it should do so again.\n\n\n                 Overview of the problems with the bill\n\n  Notwithstanding that we'll be right back here doing this again in a \nfew days, I'd like to list and then explain some of the major changes \nthis conference report proposes.\n  First, as I've mentioned, it would eliminate the 100,000 cops program \nestablished 1 year ago in the crime law and maintained in the Senate \nappropriations bill.\n  The 100,000 cops on the beat program has already funded more than \n25,000 new police officers across the country in its first year alone. \nAnd police departments across the Nation have already applied for more \nthan one-half of a billion dollars in fiscal year 1996 to fund more \nthan 9,000 new police. These pending applications are now threatened by \nthis conference report.\n  In its place is a law enforcement block grant program that is written \nso broadly that the money could be spent on everything from prosecutors \nto probation officers to traffic lights or parking meters--and not a \nsingle new cop.\n  This block grant has never been authorized by the Senate.\n  Let's be clear on what is being done here. What this conference \nreport does is take a crime bill that has been passed only by the \nHouse, whose funds have been authorized only by the House, whose block \ngrant idea has already been rejected by the Senate, and incorporate it \ninto the appropriations bill so it is passed and funded--all in one \nfell swoop.\n  I will speak more about the 100,000 cops program in a minute, but let \nme note that, in addition, the bill would completely eliminate or \nseverely restrict other programs set up by the 1994 crime law--programs \nlike: the drug court system, the rural drug enforcement grant program, \nthe law enforcement scholarship program, the SCAMS Program fighting \ntelemarketing fraud against senior citizens, and tried and tested \nprograms that fight youth violence, for example, by putting boys and \ngirls clubs in housing projects.\n  Under the 1994 crime law, these programs were targeted for separate \nfunds in addition to the funds for the 100,000 cops program. But under \nthe conference report, mayors would have only the amount of the block \ngrant--out of which all efforts would have to be funded.\n  The result will be that proven crime-fighting programs that the \nCongress voted to support last year would be effectively eliminated, \nall without any consideration by the Judiciary Committee or the full \nSenate as to the wisdom of these changes. And all with the strong \nopposition of the Nation's law enforcement community.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to legislate by fiat like this, then \nwe might as well do away with committees, with hearings, with \nsubcommittee markups, with full committee markups, and with careful \nconsideration of authorizing legislation.\n  We could simply do all the Senate's business on appropriations bills.\n  I, for one, happen to believe that's a terrible way to proceed and I \nbelieve \n\n[[Page S 18147]]\nthat's reason enough to oppose this bill. The American people are not \nwell served when major policy changes are made under the time limits \nfacing us on these appropriations bills.\n  If the Republicans want to change the crime bill, they have the right \nto try--but let's do it the right way and then let's vote on it. Wiping \nout major pieces of the most significant anti-crime legislation ever \npassed by the Congress on an appropriations bill makes a mockery of our \nSenate process. The importance of the programs we are considering, not \nto mention the perception of our institution, demands better.\n  But, given that we are here, I will insist on a full opportunity to \ndebate with my colleagues the merits of last year's crime law programs \naffected by this bill.\n  Before I do that, I first want to briefly point out that another \nRepublican plan in this conference report is to drastically cut Federal \nlaw enforcement. This conference report cuts the FBI by $112 million \nbelow the President's request--so new FBI agents will not be hired; \ncuts the Drug Enforcement Agency by $5 million below the President's \nrequest; cuts interagency drug enforcement by $15 million below 1995 \nand $19 million below the President's request; and cuts Federal \nprosecutors by $13 million below the President's request.\n  Let me address these cuts to federal law enforcement. The president \nrequested an increase of $337 million for FBI agents and other FBI \nactivities--but the Republicans cut $112 million from that request.\n  We frequently hear claims in Congress of how much we support law \nenforcement.\n  But, as the saying goes, talk is cheap. Talk--without the commitment \nof dollars--is meaningless. The Republicans on the conference have \nfailed to fund the President's request for Federal law enforcement, \ndespite all the talk about being for law enforcement.\n  Let's look at these cuts to Federal law enforcement: the conference \nreport cuts $5 million from the $54 million boost requested for Drug \nEnforcement Agency agents by the President.\n  Again, we hear a lot of talk about how we need to do more to fight \nillegal drugs, and there is much finger-pointing about how the \nadministration should do more--but in the end it is the Congress that \nfails to fund the drug enforcement requested by the President.\n  In yet another important area, let's review what has happened in \ninter-agency drug enforcement. The organized crime and drug enforcement \ntask forces combine the efforts of the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, \nU.S. Attorneys, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Marshals' \nService, Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Internal Revenue \nService--all working together in 13 regional task forces to target and \ndestroy major narcotics trafficking organizations.\n  The President requested $378 million for this program--but the \nRepublican conference cut this amount by $19 million. This means that \nwe will cut this important drug-fighting capability below the 1995 \nlevel.\n  In other words, we are not talking about less of an increase--we are \ntalking about cutting a significant part of this program.\n  Let me also point out that the Republican conference report cuts the \nPresident's budget request for U.S. attorneys--our Federal \nprosecutors--by $13 million. The President requested an increase of $86 \nmillion to boost Federal prosecutors, but the conference report backed \naway from this commitment.\n  In short, this conference report cuts the President's request for \nFederal law enforcement. So our Federal effort against crime and drugs \nwill be fought by--fewer FBI agents; fewer DEA agents; and fewer \nFederal prosecutors.\n  What is one to conclude from the efforts of the Republicans to gut \nthe 100,000 cops on the beat program and severely reduce Federal law \nenforcement? Is it that tax cuts to a few are more important than \nprotecting the safety of average Americans?\n  Now I'd like to return to the merits of the 1994 crime law.\n\n\n                     The 1994 Crime Law is working\n\n  The passage of the major $30 billion anticrime package last year \ncapped a 6-year effort to launch a bold, comprehensive, and tough \nattack on violent crime and its roots in American communities.\n  And as we pass the 1-year mark, it is already clear that the major \nprograms of the bill are working even beyond expectation.\n  Consider the 100,000 cops program. If this had been a typical grant \nprogram, the Federal Government would just now--at the end of the first \nfiscal year of funding--be preparing to issue the first awards.\n  The better part of a year would have been consumed drafting \nregulations and preparing application forms before money could finally \nbe disbursed at the end of the year.\n  The implementation of the 1994 crime law stands in stark contrast to \nthat typical scenario. Instead of requiring burdensome applications \nthat often filled entire binders, one-page applications were developed. \nInstead of waiting until the end of the year to disburse the funds, the \nmoney was awarded in batches beginning only weeks after passage of the \nlaw.\n  As a result, we find ourselves at the end of the first year with \nnearly all the fiscal year's money out the door--all of the funds have \nalready on their way to the States--and with more than 25,000 out of \n100,000 cops already funded in every State in the Nation. In a word, \nthe law is working.\n  In addition to the new police, the law's provisions combating \nviolence against women are also working.\n  The first criminal has been tried and convicted under the new Federal \nviolence against women statute, resulting in a life sentence for \nChristopher J. Bailey, who kidnaped and beat his wife nearly to death.\n  In addition--charges have already been filed in another case.\n  Every State has received a grant to increase police, prosecutors, and \nvictim services to combat family violence.\n  Rape shield laws have been extended to protect more victims.\n  And women no longer have to pay for medical exams to prove they are \nraped--the victims of rape are finally being treated like the victims \nof any other crime.\n  These long overdue measures mean that women are now being protected--\ninstead of further victimized--by the criminal justice system.\n  Another major accomplishment under the 1994 crime law is the \nmilitary-style boot camp prisons: crime law dollars are already at work \nhelping 27 States plan, build, and run military-style boot camp prisons \nfor non-violent offenders.\n  Boot camp prisons allow States suffering from overcrowding problems \nto move non-violent prisoners into cheaper space--boot camps cost about \none-third the price per bed than conventional prisons--thereby freeing \nup space for most violent offenders.\n  Yet another effort that is already underway is the drug court \nprogram--a long overdue program to finally crack down on the 600,000 \ndrug-abusing offenders who are on our streets today, subject to no \nrandom drug testing, no mandatory treatment, and no threat of \npunishment.\n  The Justice Department has already funded efforts to help local \nofficials plan 52 new drug courts, begin 5 new drug courts, and to \nexpand 8 other drug court programs (including one in my home State of \nDelaware.)\n  Despite this concrete record of success, the conference report would \neliminate the separately targeted $150 million drug court program and \nrequire states to fund drug courts, if at all, out of the money that \ncould be spent on hiring cops on the beat. In real terms, this could \nmean that about 85,000 drug abusing offenders will not be subject to \ndrug testing and mandatory treatment.\n  Other provisions of the 1994 Crime Law that are not affected by this \nbill are also proving to be very effective in combating crime, such as \nthe provisions against sexual offenders, the death penalty provisions, \nthe Brady Law, and the criminal alien provisions.\n  So, Mr. President, last year's crime bill has achieved an \nextraordinary measure of success during its first year in operation.\n  Yet, despite all of these accomplishments under the 1994 Crime Law, \nthe anti-crime law is still under attack by the Republicans. Just as \nthe entire scheme of anti-crime initiatives is taking hold, they would \neliminate or dismantle many of the law's critical programs and reverse \nthe progress that is being made. \n\n[[Page S 18148]]\n\n  So while it is important to note the success we are having in \nimplementing the act, that is not enough.\n  We must also review at this point why the 1994 Crime Law represents \nthe right approach to reducing the problem of violent crime in this \ncountry and why Republican proposals would prematurely divert us off \nthe right track and unwisely point us in the wrong direction.\n\n\n                    The merits of the 1994 Crime Law\n\n  During the six-year period it took to enact this law, we undertook a \nmajor study and evaluation of the current system to pinpoint the \nweaknesses in anti-crime approaches. And for the first time, the \nFederal Government made a major commitment to help states and \nlocalities--where 95 percent of crime occurs and is prosecuted--redress \nthe greatest shortcomings of our system.\n  In the course of the crime study, six key shortcomings of our current \nsystem became evident:\n  1. Most importantly, we do not have enough police out on the streets \nand in our neighborhoods.\n  2. We do not have enough prison cells for violent offenders --so they \nend up serving, on average nationwide, only 46 percent of their \nsentences.\n  3. We have not come up with an effective response to criminals who \nabuse drugs.\n  4. We do not treat family violence as serious crime.\n  5. Our police are outgunned by criminals.\n  6. And our nation's troubled children--who are growing up in a world \nof illegal drugs, guns, crime and violence--don't have safe places to \ngo and lack positive activities to motivate them toward productive \nendeavors.\n  The comprehensive anti-crime bill passed by the congress last year \nwas designed to address each of these key shortcomings.\n  This law is now providing an unprecedented infusion of Federal \ndollars to states and localities--to help them attack crime both at the \nback end--with more money for law enforcement and prisons; and at the \nfront end--with more money for prevention programs that can help keep \nwould-be criminals off the road to ruin in the first place.\n\n  The Crime Law reflects the primary lesson learned over the last \ndecade as we studied crime and law enforcement--that all of the \nshortcomings in our system must be addressed together, that correcting \none without the others is futile--because crime offers no single, easy \nanswer.\n  I had hoped to spend this year watching over the smooth and speedy \nimplementation of the law, while turning my focus to those substantial \ncrime-related issues still before us--including a renewed fight against \nillegal drugs, and reform of our juvenile justice system as it \nstruggles to deal with violent young criminals the current system was \nnever designed to handle.\n  But instead of building upon the success the crime law already is \nhaving and moving forward to critical new challenges, the Congress of \nthe United States is in full retreat. The House has already dismantled \nthe crime law, and now the Senate will decide whether it will follow \nsuit.\n  This premature about-face after finally putting in place the most \ncomprehensive and carefully crafted set of anti-crime programs in our \nhistory is not only foolish but irresponsible.\n  We owe it to the American people to follow through with the measures \nwe promised them and which they demanded for the past several years.\n  Let me address the merits of these programs.\n\n\n                       The 100,000 police program\n\n  Let me turn first to the central provision of the new law--the \n100,000 cops on the beat program that I will fight with all my might to \npreserve.\n  I do not know a single responsible police leader, academic expert, or \npublic official who does not agree that putting more police officers on \nour streets and in our neighborhoods is the best way to fight crime.\n  Community policing enables police to fight crime on two fronts at \nonce--they are better positioned to respond and apprehend suspects when \ncrime occurs, but even more importantly, they are also better \npositioned to keep crime from occurring in the first place.\n  I've seen this work in my home State of Delaware, where community \npolicing in Wilmington takes the form of foot patrols aimed at breaking \nup the street-level drug dealing that had turned one Wilmington \nneighborhood into a crime zone.\n  These efforts successfully put a lid on drug activity, without \ndisplacing it to other parts of the city. In practice, community \npolicing takes many forms, but regardless of the needs of particular \ncommunities, the reports from the field are the same--it works.\n  The 1994 crime law targets $8.8 billion for states and localities to \ntrain and hire 100,000 new community police officers over 6 years.\n  Now, we all remember the criticism last year of the 100,000 police \nprogram. The cops program won't work, Republicans in Congress said. \nThey got Charlton Heston to say in national television ads that it \nwould never happen, that we would never see more than 20,000 cops.\n  Well ``Moses'' could not have been more wrong. We already have 25,000 \nnew local police officers on the streets of America--after only 1 year \nunder the new law. And because of the way we've set it up--with a match \nrequirement and spreading out the cost over a period of years--the \nmoney will continue to work, keeping these cops on the beat and \npreventing crime in our communities far into the future.\n  But that progress will come to a screeching halt if my Republicans \ncolleagues get their way.\n  They have proposed and incorporated into this conference report a new \nlaw enforcement block grant--which has loopholes so big that it would \npermit all the money to be spent without hiring a single new police \nofficer. Not one.\n  Read their proposal. Money is sent not to police but to mayors, and \nthe money may be used not only for cops but also for other types of law \nenforcement officers or for many other purposes or initiatives. \nMoreover, the money could be used for other vaguely defined purposes \nsuch as ``equipment, technology and other material.''\n  Let me repeat--under the Republican proposal the dollars can be \ndiverted to prosecutors, courts, or other law enforcement officials.\n  These may be worthy causes, but nothing in the Republican bill \nrequires that even $1 be used to hire a single new police officer--and \nthe one thing we know is that more community police officers means less \ncrime.\n  Look at the language of this bill. Not even one new cop is required. \nAll it says is that ``recipients are encouraged to use these funds to \nhire additional law enforcement officers.'' That's it. Encouraged.\n  Mr. President, American communities don't need our encouragement. \nThey need more police.\n  We should not encourage the States to keep the commitment this \nCongress made to the American people. We should keep our word.\n  What this conference report does is take money that has been \ndesignated for cops on the beat and allows it to be used for a whole \nhost of disparate purposes. That means only one thing for sure--the \nmoney will be wasted on things the Federal Government should not be \nfunding. The great benefit of the 1994 crime law was that it gave \nStates enough choice but also gave them enough direction. That \ndirection is what differentiated this crime law from the failed crime \nlaws of the past, yet that direction is precisely what this block grant \nthrows out the window.\n  That is the major flaw of the Republican block grant.\n  I believe that the single most important thing our communities need \nwhen it comes to fighting crime is more police, and the current law \nguarantees our money will be used for just that purpose.\n  We should not abandon it 1 year after enacting it. We must save the \n100,000 cops program to ensure that the money for police is used only \nfor police.\n\n\n                             Prison grants\n\n  The second major shortcoming in the current system is prison space, \nand the prison program in the crime law we passed last year was \ndesigned to meet two goals:\n  First, to help States increase--and then use to maximum advantage--\ntheir supply of prison space; and second, to encourage States to adopt \nthe kind of truth-in-sentencing system that has been instituted at the \nFederal level.\n  Today, prison systems in 34 States are under court order due to \novercrowding. \n\n[[Page S 18149]]\n\n  Because there are not enough prison cells, many States are keeping \nviolent criminals behind bars for only about half their sentences--46 \npercent is the nationwide average.\n  Worse yet, 30,000 offenders who, each year, are convicted of a \nviolent crime are not even sentenced to prison.\n  The 1994 crime law is helping States respond to this problem with a \n$9.7 billion grant program.\n  Under the 1994 law, States can use the money to build and operate \nadditional secure prison cells for violent criminals--or for boot camp \nprisons for non-violent offenders, thereby freeing up secure prison \nspaces for violent criminals.\n  Let me tell you about these boot camps. Today, 160,000 young, \nnonviolent, minor offenders are behind bars in costly prison cells. \nThat just does not make sense.\n  So the law encourages States to make the most efficient use of \nexisting prison cells--by putting violent offenders in the most \nexpensive cells, and housing nonviolent, minor offenders at one-third \nthe cost of conventional prison space in military-style boot camps.\n  I am encouraged that the Republicans' prison proposal permits States \nto use this funding for boot camp prisons--that is an important change \nfrom the house-passed appropriations bill.\n\n\n                Key problems with conference prison plan\n\n  One key problem with the Republican prison plan is that the plan \npermits States only to build or expand prisons--leaving out the ability \nto spend these funds to operate prisons.\n  This just does not make sense, when the 1994 prison provisions were \nwritten, we heard several States had already built prisons, but could \nnot open these prisons because of a lack of operating funds.\n  A close look at the fine print of this bill reveals what I believe is \none of its most troubling aspects. While $617 million is appropriated \nfor the prison grants in the conference report, the Republican \nconferees raided $200 million of that to fund prisons in just 7 or 8 \nStates.\n  Let me explain--the bill directly funds $300 million to reimburse \nStates for the costs of housing criminal aliens in State prisons. This \nwas a provision included in the 1994 crime law, and I support this \ngoal. But, on top of that $300 million in direct appropriations to \nreimburse States for incarcerating criminal aliens, language was \nslipped into the bill so that an additional $200 million was shifted \nfrom the general prison grants for all states to the criminal alien \nreimbursement program.\n  So I point out to my colleagues--if you are not from Arizona, \nFlorida, Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, California, or \nMichigan--funds that should have gone to building prisons in your State \nhave been stolen by this conference report.\n  This is outrageous, I support the need to reimburse States for these \ncosts, but the 1994 crime law recognized that crime is plaguing all \nstates not just a few of our Nation's largest border States.\n\n\n                      Fighting drug related crime\n\n  The third major shortcoming of our current system is the failure to \nlimit drug-related crime.\n  The new law provides money for specialized drug courts to target low-\nlevel drug offenders who are out on the streets breaking into cars and \nstealing to support their habits.\n  In most communities, these offenders are now largely ignored by our \nsystem. They do not go to prison and they are not required to comply \nwith drug testing or get treatment.\n  Most are simply sent right back out on the streets on largely \nunsupervised probation--and they go right back to the cycle of drug use \nand crime to support their drug use.\n  The heart of the problem is that, just like the prison populations, \nthe probation and parole populations have exploded. More than 3.5 \nmillion offenders--half of them drug addicts--are now living in their \ncommunities under the nominal supervision of courts or corrections \nofficers.\n  According to the Justice Department, of the roughly 1.4 million drug-\nabusing offenders on probation, only 800,000 are subject to some drug \ntesting or drug treatment. The remaining 600,000 drug-addicted \noffenders are on our Nation's streets each day, unsupervised, untested, \nwith no fear of punishment. They are accidents waiting to happen.\n  Many of these probationers are high-rate offenders. Hard-core addicts \nare estimated to commit up to 200 crimes a year to support their \nhabits.\n  As the number of probation officers has not kept pace with the growth \nin the probation population, probation caseloads now average 118 \noffenders.\n  In some areas, caseloads can exceed 200.\n  With so many offenders, officers are able to conduct only minimal \nsupervision at best--perhaps 15 minutes a week.\n  We know who these people are. Judges and probation officers have \ntheir names and addresses. So why do we ignore them?\n  Drug courts are designed to take these offenders and their crimes \nseriously--offenders face random drug testing and mandatory treatment. \nAnd, if they slip back into drugs--they go to jail.\n  Yet the Republican proposal totally eliminates drug courts. The bill \nwipes out all funding. We must preserve the necessary money to fund the \ndrug courts.\n\n\n                          Prevention programs\n\n  I turn now to an issue that has been the subject of more \nmisinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other \nin the crime debate--whether we should work to prevent crime before it \nhappens, instead of waiting until after the shots are fired, until \nafter our children become addicted to drugs, until after more \nAmericans' lives are ruined.\n  The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question unapolo-\ngetically.\n  In addition to fighting crime, the law made a commitment to \npreventing crime--a commitment supported by virtually every \ncriminologist, every legal scholar, every sociologist, every \npsychologist, every medical authority, and simple common sense.\n  Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence \nand crime requires an investment in the lives of our children--with \nsupport and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of \nthe streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives.\n  Prevention is also what cops want--what virtually everyone in law \nenforcement wants.\n  Every police officer I have talked to, every prosecutor, every prison \nwarden, every probation officer, says the same thing--we can't do it \nalone. And we can't do it all after the fact.\n  And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say \nthey want to give greater voice: Republican mayors Giuliani of New York \nand Riordan of Los Angeles say this: [B]y funding proven prevention \nprograms for young people, the crime bill offers hope--hope that in the \nfuture we can reduce the need for so many police officers and jails.\n  Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, IN: [I]t's \na lot less expensive to do things on the prevention side than on the \npolice side.\n  This unity among law enforcement was the force that drove the \nprevention programs into the 1994 crime law and into the appropriations \nbill as passed by the Senate just a few months ago. We need to give \nthese programs a chance. If after a few years the prevention programs \nin the anti-crime law do not work, I will be first in line to change \nit.\n  The 1994 crime law sets aside $5.4 billion to give States money--and \nflexibility--to implement many types of crime prevention programs that \nhave proven track records of success.\n  As part of that money, $30 million is allocated to fund crime \nprevention programs such as TRIAD and boys and girls clubs and other \nlocal initiatives.\n  The TRIAD programs are the joint efforts of sheriffs, police chiefs \nand senior citizens--practical cooperation that helps combat crime \nagainst our elderly citizens.\n  In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and \ngirls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place \nwith positive activities and positive role models.\n  A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects \nwith clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less \ndrug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects without \nclubs. \n\n[[Page S 18150]]\n\n  Other local prevention programs are having great success as well. For \nexample, in honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for \nneglect or abuse when children are born and then visit their homes \nregularly over several years to help parents learn to care for their \nchildren. In Houston, TX, a core of professionals provides one-on-one \ncounseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention \nservices to students at risk of dropping out.\n  Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the \nneed and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply.\n  And yet the Republicans have eliminated the separately targeted \nfunding for these programs and thrown them into the block grant--a move \nsome charge is cold-hearted and mean. But I say it's just plain dumb.\n  The prevention money in the crime law is an investment in our future \nthat we simply cannot afford not to make--not when we are spending $25 \nbillion to lock people up every year.\n  And there are issues here even more important than money, because the \ncommitment that we make today will define us as a nation tomorrow.\n  Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: they are the \nright place for people gone wrong.\n  On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the \nright track--that is a testament to hope.\n  We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging \ndisaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead-\nend of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life.\n  That's why we need to restore the separate funding for these \nprevention programs, in addition to the funding for the 100,000 cops \nprogram.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  In concluding, I want to reiterate that in its breadth, the 1994 \nanticrime law reflects the lessons learned over the last decade as we \nstudied crime and law enforcement and worked on passing this law.\n  And in its approach, as well as in many specifics, the law was the \nresult of bi-partisan efforts.\n  We should not retreat now on this tough but smart crime package that \nalready is hard at work in preventing violent crime across the country. \nAnd we should not retreat on the 100,000 cops program that we insisted \non just a few months ago.\n  Let me also point out that the $30 billion crime law trust fund that \nuses the savings from cutting 272,000 Federal bureaucrats (160,000 have \nalready left) pays for every cop, every prison cell, every shelter for \na battered woman and her children that is provided for in the crime \nlaw--without adding to the deficit or requiring new taxes.\n  That was the deal we made right here on the Senate floor 1 year ago. \nYet now my Republican colleagues are trying to back out on the deal by \nrefusing to write the checks for next year's funding of the crime law.\n  I have tried today to outline my objections to the Republicans \nretreat--in this conference report--on the key provisions of the \nanticrime law enacted last year.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider very carefully whether this is \nthe right forum and the right idea to dismantle these vital parts of \nthe already successful and highly popular crime law.\n  In the end, I suspect that the merits will speak for themselves and \nthe american people will decide whether it is a good idea to debilitate \nthe Crime Law just as it is showing clear signs of success.\n  This program is a very bad idea. I expect we are going to get to \ndebate this again. So in light of that, and in light of the fact I have \nno more time--I am sorry. My staff is now fired. They gave me a note \nsaying before I had 3 minutes, and now I see it is 30 minutes. But I \nwill yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n          Cops on the Beat/Community Oriented Policing Program\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this conference report proposes to \nterminate the successful Cops on the Beat or the Community Oriented \nPolicing [COPS] Program. This is one of the craziest things I've seen \nsince coming to the Senate. I had always thought that getting more \npolice on the streets was a rock solid conservative, and for that \nmatter, a bipartisan value. If there was one thing I thought we all \ncould agree on, it was our belief in local law enforcement.\n  This attack on this police program comes as something of a surprise \nto me. I've looked back at the debate on last year's crime bill, and \nwhat I saw was statement after statement by Republicans attacking the \nauthorization of crime prevention programs--not hiring police. As I \nrecall, the only major argument against the Cops on the Beat Program \nwas that some Republicans didn't think we could succeed in getting \n100,000 additional police out on the streets in America. Yet in \nstatement after statement, they said they supported more police.\n  Now, the tables have turned. The majority party is against police and \nthe Cops on the Beat Program because we are for it. That is absurd. \nAfter 29 years in the Senate, I have finally cracked the code--as they \nsay in the Pentagon. In the current Senate, if Democrats support a \nprogram, then the majority feels compelled to do the opposite. And they \nwill do the opposite even when they are cutting off their noses in \nspite of their faces, as in the case before us.\n  The lesson that I guess we as Democrats need to learn is that we \napparently must do the opposite of what we think is right. Then the \nRepublicans will do the right thing. So tomorrow, I guess I should call \nthe President of the United States to suggest that he come out with \nboth barrels blazing in a call to eliminate the Commerce Department. If \nhe did, I have no doubt that the majority leader, the very next day, or \none of the other Republican Presidential candidates would be holding a \npress conference attacking the President's position with an argument \nthat it would be ludicrous to disband the only Cabinet Department that \nserves as an advocate for American industry.\n\n\n                              Block grants\n\n  Mr. President, when I look at this bill, I think it is a little block \ngrant crazy. It kills the Cops on the Beat Program and says make it a \nblock grant.\n  I find this faddish obsession with block grants to be most \ninteresting. It was just a little over 2 years ago that President \nClinton submitted a $16 billion economic stimulus program. And I recall \nthat it was the casualty of the 103d Congress' first filibuster in \nwhich Republican Member after Member attacked it for including block \ngrants. Each speaker talked about the types of questionable projects \nthat could be allowable under block grants. They talked about pork-\nbarrel swimming pools, parking garages and canoeing facilities. Of \ncourse, none of those things was actually in the bill. But, the \nflexibility and discretion provided by block grants enabled Governors \nand mayors to fund such projects. And so, my Republican colleagues \nstood for days on the floor and attacked the allowable uses of block \ngrants. Predictably, there was a public outcry. In turn, they defeated \nthat bill, not for what was in it, but because of the basic concept of \nblock grants.\n  Now, here we are with the 1996 Justice appropriations bill and we \nhave a successful and effective program to hire and train tens of \nthousands of police officers and get them on the beat. And what is the \nopposition proposing? To kill the program and create a block grant that \nwill send checks for Governors. Unbelievable.\n\n\n                           Remember the LEAA?\n\n  Now, Mr. President, this block grant idea is deja vu. Those of us in \nthe Chamber that have been here awhile--those of us with an \ninstitutional memory--know that this notion of police block grants is \nnothing new. Back in the 1970's, we tried a block grant program for law \nenforcement and it was a miserable failure. Our experience with the Law \nEnforcement Assistance Administration, or LEAA, is worth reviewing.\n  LEAA was ``sooey pig.'' It was a boondoggle. It was all those things \nthat my Republican colleagues complained about in 1993. Communities \nacross the Nation used their LEAA block grant funds to buy tanks, cars \nfor mayors and even encyclopedias. LEAA funds were used to hire \nconsultants who produced numerous plans that only were shelved to rest \nin peace. The LEAA was the Beltway Bandit's best friend. It was the \nsame old story--Federal money was used to fund projects for which \nGovernors or city councils were unwilling to use locally-raised funds. \n\n[[Page S 18151]]\n\n  Quite simply, LEAA was a waste of taxpayer funds. By the time \nPresident Carter came to town, he had seen LEAA firsthand as a Governor \nin Georgia. And he knew of the program's Federal largesse and \nwastefulness. So he rightfully told Congress to kill the program.\n  A good summary of our experience with the LEAA is in the 1982 edition \nof the Congressional Quarterly:\n\n       Fourteen years after its creation, the Law Enforcement \n     Assistance Administration (LEAA) went quietly out of business \n     April 15, a demise ordered by Attorney General William French \n     Smith but preordained in the final years of the Carter \n     Administration.\n       In its somewhat troubled life, the grant agency dispensed \n     nearly $8 billion to local law enforcement agencies for \n     programs such as improved police equipment, shelters for \n     homeless youth and special local task forces to prosecute \n     ``career criminals.'' In recent years, however, LEAA was \n     criticized for requiring too much red tape in its grant \n     program and for wasting money on Dick Tracy-type gadgetry.\n\n\n                            Cops on the Beat\n\n  Mr. President, for $8 billion we got nothing from these LEAA block \ngrant programs. Compare that with the Cops on the Beat Program. We have \nspent $1.358 billion in 2 years. Already, we have gotten more than \n26,000 additional police officers funded to go on the beat in small \ntowns and cities throughout America.\n  I don't believe that I have ever seen a more effective program with \nless redtape. And if you want to hear about the success of this \nprogram, just talk with local sheriffs and police chiefs across the \ncountry.\n  In South Carolina, the COPS program has funded more than 255 extra \npolice to patrol communities. And it's working. Members of my staff \nhave traveled extensively across South Carolina to meet with local \npolice to find out about the program. As far as I know, there has not \nbeen a single negative comment about the program. In fact, most chiefs \nand sheriffs were extremely supportive of the program. Here are some \ntypical comments we got about the program:\n  ``This was the easiest Federal program I've ever seen,'' one chief \nsaid.\n  ``There is no way we could have hired an additional officer without \nthis grant,'' said another.\n  ``The application form--just one page--was so simple. There is no way \nit could have come from Washington.''\n  Finally, listen to what was said by the chief of police of Yemassee, \na small lowcountry town in Beaufort and Hampton counties that is a few \nmiles from Hilton Head Island. Administrators with the COPS program \ndealt directly with the Yemassee Police Department and expeditiously \nprovided funding. The department was able to hire one additional \nofficer, an ex-marine who recently left Parris Island. Jack Hagy, \nYemassee's chief, told my staff that it is the first time in his career \nthat the Federal Government ever did anything for Yemassee. The entire \ntown is enthused. In a small town like Yemassee, one extra police \nofficer has a tremendous impact.\n  Quite simply, in South Carolina towns like Yemassee, Abbeville, \nCalhoun Falls, McCormick, and Mullins, and in larger cities like \nCharleston, Greenville, and Columbia, the COPS program has made a \ndifference. Across the Nation, the successful addition of 26,000 more \nofficers in just 2 years shows that we have a winner with the COPS \nProgram. For once, Congress and the Administration got one right.\n  Let's take a look at why. The COPS program is focused. It has \nmeasurable goals. It is all teeth and no fat. It's administrative costs \nare less than 1 percent. Compare that to the block grant proposal, \nwhich has administrative costs at 2.5 percent. No other federal program \ncan match the COPS program's efficiency.\n  In fact, part of the COPS program is specifically targeted to help \nsmaller communities like Yemassee. This part, called COPS FAST, has no \nredtape. Instead, all that is required is a one-page application.\n  Also, the COPS program has accountability. It's no giveaway. It \nrequires a shared commitment and responsibility at the local level. \nPolice and sheriffs' departments have to make a local financial \ncommitment to be involved. They have to put up 25 percent in matching \nfunds to participate.\n  Furthermore, the COPS program has cut administrative overhead with a \ncustomer response center, personalized grant officers, and simplified \nprocedures. The Justice Department is getting out funds to small \ncommunities within two months of application. And there are no \nmiddlemen. The program is fully competitive and non-partisan.\n  Finally, the COPS program has been working with the Defense \nDepartment to initiate a ``Troops to Cops'' program to encourage the \nhiring of recently-separated members of the military, such as our \nfriend in Yemassee.\n\n\n                            The War on Crime\n\n  Mr. President, the conference report before us adds funds to hire \nthousands of additional Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, federal \nprison guards, INS inspectors and DEA agents. These are the people that \nmy sheriffs and police chiefs in South Carolina call ``the Feds.'' Now, \nmaybe we could use more Feds. But, if we think that only they will \nreally make a dent in the war on crime in America, we are fooling \nourselves.\n  That war is going on in every city and town across America. Crime \ngenerally is a local, not a federal, occurrence. What Americans fear \nmost today is violent crime in their communities --murder, rape and \nrobbery. Generally, those crimes are dealt with by local police, not \nthe Feds. This COPS program is the best and most effective weapon that \nhas been developed so far to assist state and local law enforcement \nofficers in combatting these crimes. Unlike block granting, the COPS \nprogram does it right.\n  Some have said that we in Washington shouldn't decide if local \ngovernments need more police. They claim that we should just give them \na check, or as this conference agreement proposes, give checks to \ngovernors and mayors so that they have the ``flexibility'' to allow \nthem to buy other things or establish prevention programs.\n  Well, Mr. President, the last time I checked, 10 out of 10 people who \ncall the police for help--are calling for a cop. They don't want to \nhear about a check or flexibility. They don't want to know about a tank \nor high-falooting, Dick Tracy gadgets. They want a police officer to \ncome to their assistance.\n  There is no higher need than putting foot soldiers out on the front \nlines to battle crime. If there are other law enforcement \ninfrastructure needs, there are enough other existing federal programs, \nsuch as the popular Byrne grant program, to meet those local needs.\n  Results speak for themselves. Some 26,000 police are out in local \ncommunities that weren't out there just two years ago. If we stick with \nthe COPS program, that number will be more than 40,000 in just another \nyear.\n  Maybe that's the problem. Maybe my Republican colleagues want so \ndesparately to kill the COPS program simply because it is so effective.\n  Mr. President, I have received numerous letters from police and law \nenforcement groups across this nation that are pleading that we restore \nfunding for the COPS program. Let me just quote from a few here:\n  The Fraternal Order of Police (President Gilbert Gallegos):\n\n       Since its inception in September 1994, the COPS program has \n     provided 26,000 state and local officers. These men and \n     women, and those who join them as the COPS program continues \n     to meet its goals, will play a vital role in the effort to \n     make our streets safe for law-abiding citizens. . .. On \n     behalf of the 270,000 rank and file officers who make up the \n     FOP, you have our thanks and support.\n\n  National Association of Police Organizations--Robert Scully, \nExecutive Director:\n\n       The National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) \n     representing over 185,000 rank and file police officers and \n     3,500 police associations . . . has been behind the COPS \n     program since day one. We oppose altering this successful \n     program to a block grant approach because we know that unless \n     the monies are given directly to law enforcement agencies to \n     hire more police officers, the funds will be diverted by \n     local bureaucrats with their own agendas. . . . (COPS) is the \n     single most effective crime program working to make our \n     streets safer and law enforcement sees no reason to change \n     it.\n\n  Police Executive Research Forum--Chuck Wexler, Executive Director:\n\n       Police Executive Research Forum members have spoken out \n     strongly against the proposed Senate block grant program \n     which, under this appropriations package, would replace the \n     COPS program. The replacement of the COPS program with block \n     grants would hinder PERF members' efforts to improve public \n     safety and address community problems. . . . this issue is of \n     ideal importance to \n\n[[Page S 18152]]\n     the law enforcement community and the entire nation, it is imperative \n     that you and your colleagues understand and consider our \n     concerns.\n\n  National Sheriffs' Association--Charles Meeks, Executive Director:\n\n       On behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, I am \n     writing in support of your amendment to the FY96 Commerce, \n     Justice, State Appropriations bill to continue the COPS \n     program. Because of the COPS program, over half of the \n     nation's sheriffs have hired over 1,300 deputies moving \n     toward increased law enforcement presence in our counties. \n     This program of police hiring, in conjunction with community \n     policing, will go a long way in helping to reduce crime in \n     our counties.\n\n  The Law Enforcement Steering Committee--James Rhinebarger, Chairman:\n\n       The elimination of the COPS program would hinder our \n     efforts and the progress made in community policing, and \n     would ultimately prove detrimental to the nation's public \n     safety. . . . This is an issue of vital importance to the law \n     enforcement community and the entire nation.\n\n\n                  An Attorney General Who's Been There\n\n  Mr. President, I have served with quite a few chief law enforcement \nofficers since I came here in 1966. There are a lot of impressive names \non that list--Ramsey Clark, Griffin Bell, John Mitchell, Elliot \nRichardson, Ben Civiletti, William French Smith, Dick Thornburgh, and \nBill Barr. But, I have to say that I have never seen a better Attorney \nGeneral than Janet Reno. She comes from local law enforcement and is \nfrom an area that has its share of crime, Dade County, FL.\n  With Attorney General Reno, what you see is what you get. She is a \nno-nonsense leader who understands accountability. She understands \nfirsthand what is needed to combat crime.\n  This Cops on the Beat Program is her program. During a speech last \nyear, she summed up why we need the COPS Program and why it is far and \naway the most important component to last year's crime bill. In \naddressing police groups in October of last year, she said:\n\n       The truth is, criminals do not stand in awe of a piece of \n     paper or a bill or an Act. They look at results. Violence in \n     this country does not magically recede because we have a \n     piece of paper that says it should. Violence in this country \n     recedes and is reduced because of efforts of officers on the \n     front lines making a difference in their community, . . . and \n     of officers getting the resources they need to do the job.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, at this point we cannot really change what the \nRepublican leadership has chosen to do to the COPS Program in this \nconference agreement. This agreement is in the nature of a substitute, \nand the COPS Program cannot be amended or voted upon separately. I, for \none, do not believe that we should be rewriting the 1994 crime bill in \nthis conference agreement.\n  As I stated earlier, this conference report is going to be vetoed. \nMake no mistake about that. It is my hope that we can move \nexpeditiously on to round two and develop a bill that can become law. \nAnd, as part of that process, I hope that my Republican colleagues will \nagree to restore funding for the Community Policing Program.\n  Far too many issues become partisan this year. This is the craziest \nsession of Congress that I have seen. Our support for police and \nsheriffs has always been bipartisan. Let's not change that. I hope that \nmy Republican colleagues will listen to their local law enforcement \nofficers, that they will support our men and women on the front lines, \nand that they will join me in supporting the Cops on the Beat Program \nwhen this Commerce, Justice and State bill comes back to the Senate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise to support this conference report \nand consider it a balanced approach in meeting the funding needs of the \nagencies and departments contained in the bill, and considering it \nwithin the context, of course, of the parameters of the budget \nresolution.\n  Senator Gregg has done an excellent job picking up on the difficult \ntask of bringing this bill through conference. I might just remind our \ncolleagues that Senator Gregg came into this picture sort of like a \nlittle after halftime in the game to start quarterbacking this \nparticular bill. I think he and his staff deserve a lot of credit for \nthe product that is before the Senate today.\n  I also want to compliment Senator Hollings for his dedication to this \nbill and its programs.\n  This has not been an easy year for any of us here on this committee \nor within the Senate, but I think it has been made easier by the fine \nleadership of this subcommittee. And I might comment at this time that \nSenator Hollings and his staff have served with distinction on this \nsubcommittee for almost a quarter of a century. His knowledge and \nexpertise was a critical factor in framing the bill and bringing it to \nthis point in the process.\n  As you remember, the budget resolution passed by both the House and \nSenate called for the elimination of the Department of Commerce. I \nvoted for the budget resolution and continue to support its goal of a \nbalanced budget. This conference report does not eliminate the \nDepartment of Commerce. It does cut funding Departmentwise by 14.5 \npercent. But it does nothing close to eliminating this Department.\n  I should like to sort of make a sidebar comment here, which is that \nit is a bit ironic that the Republican Party seems to be the leading \nproponent of abolishing the Department of Commerce, with its \nheadquarters being named the Herbert Hoover Department of Commerce \nBuilding, because probably the greatest Secretary of Commerce of all \ntime, the man who really built the Department, was Secretary Herbert \nHoover under the Harding-Coolidge administrations, and that Department \nnever had a stronger leader, nor did it ever have a more important \nfunction in our Government.\n  Having Senator Hollings in the Chamber at this time, having served \nwith Mr. Hoover on the Commission for reorganizing the executive branch \nof Government, I remind my colleagues, in the wisdom of his youth, \nSenator Hollings was a Republican, a young Republican, and a great \nadmirer of Mr. Hoover, as am I. And it is, as I say, a little ironic \nthat he helped, along with others of this body, to help create a name \nfor that Department, and there was only one name to ever consider, and \nthat was Herbert Hoover.\n\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, \nvoiced his frustration this morning about the pace of authorizing \nlegislation. This is a serious problem because the budget resolution, \nin our efforts to balance the budget, loses a lot of its teeth in the \nabsence of necessary authorizing legislation needed to enact the cuts \nin domestic discretionary spending contained in the resolution.\n  We are in a situation, Mr. President, as members of the \nAppropriations Committee, where we are getting ``Hail Columbia'' from \nall sides in this particular dilemma that we face in this Congress. \nThis has been the case for many years, because we do appropriate funds \nto hundreds of programs that lack authorization, expired or otherwise. \nWe appropriate funds to programs and departments the Senate has voted \nto eliminate.\n  As the President and the Congress continue to negotiate a road map to \na 7-year balanced budget, our trip must include stops through the \nauthorizing committees. The Appropriations Committee cannot shoulder \nthe whole burden in reshaping, redesigning and eliminating programs and \ndepartments without guidance from the relevant authorizing committees \nof jurisdiction.\n  This conference report includes critical funding for ongoing \nscientific research being conducted by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. While I would have preferred more funding \nfor the NOAA operations, research and facilities, I am pleased that the \nAgency is very close to a freeze, at the level provided in 1995.\n  For the Department of State, the operations accounts, including \nsalaries and expenses, have been funded at a level adequate to address \nthe many pressing demands of our Foreign Service officers. It may not \nmean for the programs we have committed to, and particularly \npeacekeeping activities, we are really underfunded.\n  The conference report provides $348.5 million for the Economic \nDevelopment Administration. This is a slight decrease from the 1995 \nlevel and would allow the EDA to continue their worthy efforts.\n  Also, on the issue of the Legal Services Corporation, I supported \nSenator \n\n[[Page S 18153]]\nDomenici and worked with him in conference to get the funding at a \nhigher level.\n  While we ended up at the House level of $278 million, this important \nissue deserves further consideration in the second round after the \nexpected veto of this bill.\n  Negotiations are ongoing with the administration on this bill. This \nmorning, we received a letter from the Office of Management and Budget \nwhich states that the President would veto this appropriations bill. I \nam hopeful that we can reach an accommodation with the administration \non this bill and the other six appropriations bills that remain.\n  Again, I thank Senators Gregg and Hollings and compliment the staff \nfor their hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished chairman \nof our committee. He and I have been in harness together since 1958 \nwhen he was elected the Governor of Oregon and I the Governor of South \nCarolina, and you get saddened when you see all your good friends \nannounce that they are leaving, and particularly this friend here \nbecause he has been absolutely fearless, has Senator Hatfield.\n  It has just been a thrill to watch him at the gubernatorial level and \nthen at the national level, a man of his own mind, absolutely ethical, \nof the highest integrity and most of all dedicated--I think I am \ndedicated to peace, but there is no doubt that some would say I would \nrather start a war than stop it --but no doubt about the Senator from \nOregon, he wants to stop all wars. And he has really made history in \nthat regard. That is why, as warlike and as contentious as I can be, I \nam trying to look with favor on the present proposition relative to \nBosnia.\n  But thanks should go to the distinguished chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee for his leadership. We had an awfully \ndifficult time getting the bill to Senator Gregg for his leadership. He \nsaved that bill two times when we were not going to have a bill. So I \nam particularly grateful for his overcomplimentary remarks about me.\n  Incidentally, I was at the time, in 1953 and 1954, a Democrat. I was \ntrying to start up as a Republican, but the late Senator Burnet Maybank \ngrabbed me and said, ``What's the matter with you, boy?'' I said, \n``Well, I wanted to run here for the legislature.'' He said, ``You've \ngot to run as a Democrat.'' I said, ``Yes, sir.''\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Easy composure.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That was easy composure. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand 20 minutes were reserved \nfor the Senator from Arkansas which have been yielded back, so I yield \n10 minutes of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I \nmay not use the entire time, but I would like to pick up where I left \noff in the questioning with the Senator from Delaware. There is not \nanybody in America who has not become so aware--I think ``overwhelmed'' \nis a better term--by the level of violence that seems to consume this \ncountry at this time.\n  I think it reached a new level of depravity with the story a few \nweeks ago when a woman was murdered and cut open so that her live fetus \ncould be taken out by animals who somehow had the notion that it was an \nacceptable way to give someone else a live child. We are raising \nsociopaths in this country at a rate that ought to alarm every \nAmerican. I think it does alarm them, and it somehow rings rhetorical \nalarm bells in Congress, but it just does not produce a response that \nis adequate.\n  I think most Americans know that. I think most Americans understand \nthat unless the 36 percent of children nationwide who are born out of \nwedlock, who have little prospect of anybody in their lives giving them \nsome values, unless the prospect of those kids gaining some sense of \nwhat this country and civil behavior is all about increases, we are \ngoing to see a lot worse in the next 10 or 15 years.\n  What astonishes me, Mr. President, is that every analysis by \ncompetent people, every criminologist, every researcher in the field of \nyouth violence, is telling us that this Nation is going to see a wave \nof criminal activity among our young unless we do something about it.\n  The response in this bill, notwithstanding good efforts by good \npeople to take a minimal number of resources and shift them around, is \njust inadequate. It is simply inadequate when we know that we have one-\ntenth the number of the police force we had 30 years ago--when people \nare scared to go out of their home at night--go to a part of town that \nthey know may not be safe at night--when people are worried whether or \nnot their car will be stolen when they go out.\n  The greatest single message and deterrent in taking back the streets \nfrom that fear and from that kind of thug dominance are police \nofficers. The Senator from Delaware said that 15 years ago--this is a \nfact we talked about many times--we had 3.5 police officers per violent \ncrime in America. Today we have anywhere from 3.5 to 4.6 violent crimes \nper police officer.\n  It is not rocket science to begin to understand the relationship \nbetween putting the police officer on the street and the ability to \ndeter crime. Most thugs do not go out and walk into a 7-11 or a gas \nstation when there is a cop standing 40 yards away or where there is \nsomeone that is on a regular patrol and they know the chances of being \napprehended are pretty good.\n  The problem in America is that over the last 10 or 15 years we have \nsent a message to people that the probability of being apprehended is \nnot so good. In fact, Mr. President, two out of five people who commit \nmurders in America will never cross the threshold of a police station, \nlet alone a courthouse. We have also learned that in community after \ncommunity after community where we have put police officers on the \nstreet in community policing, life has improved.\n  Just this past week the Attorney General visited Lowell, MA, where we \nmanaged to get a Federal grant to help create a community policing \nentity in a part of town that had seen pimps and prostitutes and drug \ngangs take over the streets. The moment the police came in, the pimps \nand prostitutes and drug gangs disappeared and the stores on that \nstreet came back to life and seniors began to say, ``We can come out of \nour house again and walk to the store.'' It is basic.\n  Here we have a bill that turns its back on the pleas of police \nofficers, on the pleas of local communities and suggests that somehow \nwe are going to be better off by creating a block grant where \ncommunities will now compete against all the other interests in the \ncommunity in law enforcement rather than going to the priority that we \nchose--which is putting police officers on the street.\n  I suppose block grants might be conceivable if you had the resources \nbeing dedicated in all the other areas so that you could make a \ndifference. But the fact is, we do not have those resources in the \nother areas, and we know it. The police should not have to compete \nagainst the computers, against the cruisers, against the equipment, \nagainst floodlights for a jail, that we need. If they do then we are \ngoing to go back to where we started from--that prompted us to \nguarantee that there are well equipped police officers on our streets.\n  Mr. President, about 11 percent of all our crimes in this country \noccur each year in our 85,000 public schools. It is estimated today \nthat 1 out of 20 students brings a gun to school at least once a month. \nWe understand that perhaps more than 200,000 students in America now \npack weapons along with their lunches because of their fear of violence \nin and on the way to school. According to the National School Safety \nCenter, nearly 3 million crimes are committed in, near, or around a \nschool campus every year. That is one crime almost every 6 seconds that \na school is in session.\n  So, Mr. President, this is not a smart approach to the problems of \nincreased criminal activity in this country. It is not enough. If this \nrepresents the best that we can do at a time when the country is in \ncrisis, then we ought to be forced to go back to the drawing board and \ndo better.\n  Mr. President, violence is an epidemic in America that knows no local \n\n\n[[Page S 18154]]\nor State boundaries. It is spilling over into thousands of communities \nacross America. In September, in Massachusetts, a young prosecutor, \nAssistant Attorney General Paul R. McLaughlin, was gunned down by a \nhooded youth in a display of a level of gang violence and immorality \nunprecedented in this country. It was a brutal assassination of a \npublic servant doing his job--the kind of violence we see in other \nnations, but not in America.\n  Against that backdrop, it is ironic that I have to come to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate to plead with some of my colleagues to keep cops on \nthe street--to plead for them to abandon ideology and their own \npolitical agenda and respond to do what is right, not what is \nexpedient.\n  I fear, Mr. President, that our head-long rush to balance the budget \nat any cost--even the cost of the life a young prosecutor--is \nirrational, irresponsible, shortsighted, and immoral.\n  Now, I know that perhaps nothing could have stopped this brutal \nmurder, but we have to ask ourselves today, what are our priorities. \nWhat kind of people are we if we chose the bottom line over the lives \nof public officials. If we rigidly hold to extremist dogma no matter \nwho gets hurt and who suffers.\n  Mr. President, let us bring this debate about Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations to where it belongs--with the will of people--the \nconcerns of thousands of local police officials who came to Washington \nto testify year after year for us to give them directly the tools they \nneed to fight crime on the streets.\n  And almost 8-years later we are here virtually thumbing our noses at \nthem and doing so in the same week that violence on the streets has \nreached a dangerous new level. The real issue before the Senate is not \nwhich formula we should adopt. Yes, there are real differences. The \nformula of the Republican bill allows much more discretion to State \nGovernors, as to how the money will be spent. Last year we required \nthat the money go directly to police departments, because we know the \nsorry history of police funding.\n  From 1971 to 1990, as the country was literally drowning in a tidal \nwave of crime, and still is, our Governors and mayors and \nlegislatures--indeed the entire political structure--engaged in a \npolicy of unilateral disarmament.\n  From 1971 to 1990, in the midst of this crime wave, we increased \nspending on lawyers and public defenders by over 200 percent. We \nincreased prison spending by 156 percent. We increased spending on \nState and local police by all of 12 percent.\n\n  So in last year's bill, we said, we are going to give control over \nthis money, this relative pittance of Federal funding, directly from \nthe Federal Government to the cops who need it. We said, ``We are going \nto require that the money be spent on police.''\n  Now the new majority wants to take all the Federal money, and give it \nback to Governors to control. Perhaps, this time, they will in fact \nspend it all on police, and do so wisely. This will be a real test, and \nwe will all be watching; not just those of us in the Senate, but the \nAmerican people, suffering the ravages of crime and violence, all over \nAmerica.\n  That suffering, its magnitude, the utter disgrace it represents for \nevery man and woman in this Chamber, that is the real issue before us.\n  It is estimated that crime has increased by more than 600 percent \nsince 1950.\n  Communities have been ravaged by indiscriminate acts of violence. \nSuch acts have been and are eating away at the core of our cities and \ntowns, and the impact on our schools has been devastating. I do not \nbelieve that there has been a rural, urban, or suburban school that has \nescaped its grasp.\n  Families have been destroyed, lawlessness has exploded, and many \nyoung people have watched first hand as their friends and relatives \nwere killed in front of them. Such killings have left an indelible \nimpact on the lives of these young people--an impression that will stay \nwith each of them forever.\n  Mr. President, the problems of crime and violence that we talk about \ntoday are not new, but have been at least 30 years in the making. \nDuring this time we have watched violence emerge as one of the leading \npublic health epidemics in the United States.\n  As the people of this Nation and the Congress prepare to do battle \nover whether and how to restructure our national health care system, \nlet us not forget two important facts.\n  First, the medical costs associated with gun violence in 1992 have \nbeen estimated at approximately $3 billion.\n  Second, average charges for a young gunshot patient in 1991 equaled \nthe cost of a year of tuition, room and board at a private college--\nabout $14,000.\n  Mr. President, crime and violence have reached into every part of our \ndaily lives and that of our children. No American, no matter what age, \nhas escaped its wrath and its impact on education has been so severe \nthat 10 percent or more of the Nation's largest school districts have \ninstalled metal detectors this year than last year. As shocking as this \nhas become, even more alarming is why so many schools have been forced \nto do this.\n  First, about 11 percent of all crimes occur each year in America's \n85,000 public schools.\n\n  Second, it is estimated that one in 20 students bring a gun to school \nat least once a month.\n  Third, it has been said that more than 200,000 students pack weapons \nalong with their lunches because of fear of violence in, or on the way \nto school.\n  Finally, according to the National School Safety Center, nearly 3 \nmillion crimes are committed in or near a school campus every year--\nabout 1 every 6 seconds that a school is in session.\n  Mr. President, as this Congress talks about the problems of crime and \nviolence, the inescapable reality is that the conditions described \nabove create an educational environment that thwarts the efforts of \npublic school teachers to educate students; it impedes teaching and \nlearning, and underscores one of the main reasons why more and more \nparents are refusing to send their children to public school.\n  But before another member of this body stands up to criticize public \nschools and public school teachers, it is time each of us consider the \nenvironment many public school teachers find themselves trying to teach \nin. In urban America, that environment has been hostile not only to \nteaching, but to life itself. Students committing indiscriminate acts \nof violence against another student because of drugs, clothing, or \nsimply because they wanted to. In fact, the arrest rate for juveniles \naged 10-17 for weapon law violations increased 117 percent between 1983 \nand 1992.\n  It is no longer enough to say that you cannot teach a child who comes \nto school hungry. The problem today is well beyond the single issue of \nhunger that previously confronted public school teachers. Today's \nproblems are multifaceted and to a greater degree than ever before, are \ncompounded by crime and violence on the way to, during and after \nschool.\n  Public school teachers today must now serve not only as teachers, but \nas counselors and referees, while also fearing for their own safety.\n  What is before us therefore is the fact that both approaches--both \nthe Democratic bill and the Republican bill, the 1994 crime bill and \nthe 1995 appropriation--both of these efforts are woefully, shamefully \ninadequate.\n  We are like doctors who discover, at long last, that our patient has \ncancer; and we are prescribing aspirin.\n  Just as to police: the President told us, and he is correct, that we \nnow have one-tenth the effective police strength of 30 years ago. Did \nhe ask us for ten times the police, to return us to the levels of \nsecurity we once knew? No. He did not suggest 5 million new police. He \ndid not ask us for 1 million. He did not ask us to, and we did, even \ndouble the police we now have.\n  He asked us, we will remember, for funds to add perhaps 30,000 new \npolice. We, in the Senate, last year, Democrats and Republicans, joined \nto increase the number to a possible 100,000. But we did not by that \nact begin to solve the problem, or meet the needs of the country.\n  What do we need? The American people are already paying, out of their \nown pockets, for about 1.5 million private police--three times the \nnumber of police paid for by taxes, on public payrolls. They are not \navailable to work where the real problems are. They are not trained to \nwork the mean streets \n\n[[Page S 18155]]\nwhere crime and criminal activity breed. They protect only enclaves. Is \nthat to be our strategy, as in the Vietnam of long ago--to protect only \nthe enclaves of the comfortable, and business, and leave the rest of \nour own fellow citizens alone and unprotected?\n  In Vietnam, I saw a lot of wonderful men give their lives for this \ncountry: not for some abstraction, not for a piece of colored cloth. \nBut for their families, and for their fellows, and for the children \nthat too many of them never lived to see. Are we keeping faith with \nthem? Are we protecting their children and grandchildren today? Are we \ndoing our duty to preserve the country for which they, as so many \nbefore them in the history of the Nation, gave the last full measure of \ndevotion?\n  So let us vote these funds today. But let us understand that this \nbill is less than a beginning, less than a start. It is my \nunderstanding that there will be offered, later this year, a new \nsubstantive crime bill. At that time I intend to offer amendments that \nwill substantially increase authorized spending assistance to State and \nlocal law enforcement, and to perhaps begin the debate we should have \nhad long before this time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I now will yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I think what is one man's pork is another person's beef. I remember \non the floor of this body, when the crime bill was first considered, \nthe wonderful porker that the Senator from New York had drawn on a \nchart and had before this body. The contention was that the crime bill, \nand this particular aspect of it, was a porker.\n  I want to say, it has turned out to be the beef of the crime bill. \nThere is no question in my mind that the community policing part of the \ncrime bill is the most popular part of the crime bill out there.\n  ``If it isn't broke, don't fix it.'' The fact of the matter is, in my \nState, crime rates are going down in all of the jurisdictions because \nof the community policing aspect of this bill.\n  So I am very disappointed--there are good things in this bill--but I \nam very disappointed by the fact that we take the discretionary aspect \nout of the community policing bill, make it a block grant program, give \nit to the local jurisdictions, but enable those local jurisdictions to \nuse it for whatever they want to use it. They can use it for new squad \ncars. They can use it for some aspects, I gather, of police stations. \nThey can use it for desk sergeants, if they want to. That defeats the \npurpose of the community policing aspect of this bill.\n  What is that purpose? The purpose is really to show that a police \nforce in a crime-troubled area with trained community police officers \nwho know the communities and know the difference between the bad guys \nand the good guys are going to be more effective in making good arrests \nand, secondly, in retarding crime in that area.\n  To date, the crime bill has targeted about $8.4 billion directly to \nStates and localities.\n  This program, as I said, is working. According to the Department of \nJustice, California has received sufficient funding to support the \nhiring or redeployment of 3,900 police officers from the crime bill \nCOPS program. This is not pork. This is beef. These funds have gone to \nthe larger and most troubled crime-plagued cities: Los Angeles, San \nJose, San Francisco, San Diego, and, most recently, Oakland.\n  As a matter of fact, beginning in March of next year, the Los Angeles \nPolice Academy will be graduating 100 officers a month for 6 months, \nfunded through the community policing aspects of this bill.\n  Additionally, community policing funds have gone to smaller \nCalifornia cities--Selma, Victorville, Santa Cruz, Ojai, and Millbrae.\n  It is no coincidence, then, that the crime rate in California's \nbiggest cities dropped by 7 percent during the first 6 months of this \nyear, compared to the same period last year, with double-digit \ndecreases--double digit, that is more than 10 percent--in homicide, in \nrape and in robbery.\n  California's Attorney General, Dan Lungren--a Republican, by the \nway--credited the intensified use of community-oriented policing by \nlocal police departments for this drop in crime. Attorney General \nLungren said of community-oriented policing, and I quote:\n  ``It should be utilized in every part of the State.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  So the COPS Program is working. ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' \nIt is putting cops on the streets. It is reducing crime.\n  Second, my other concern with this bill is the drug courts. In \nAmerica, we constantly have the debate: Do you fight drugs on the \nsupply side or do you fight them on the demand side? I know, as a mayor \nfor 9 years, that you have to do both and you have to do it well. \nAmerica has never fought drugs equally on the supply side and the \ndemand side.\n  This crime bill was the first time that more moneys were put in for \nprevention and for rehabilitation to almost equal the amount for \ninterdiction and enforcement. Drug courts were a relatively new aspect.\n  About $1 billion dedicated to drug court programs over the next 6 \nyears is eliminated in this conference report. That is a mistake. A \nstudy by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs found \nthat for every $1 spent on treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, $7 in \nsavings is accrued. There are now evaluations coming out of drug \ncourts. We are finding--surprise of all kinds--they are working. ``An \nEvaluation of the Oakland Drug Court After Three Years,'' by Judge \nJeffrey Tauber of the Oakland-Piedmont-Emeryville Municipal Court, \nfound the following results, which I quote:\n\n       The data collected supports the conclusion that the \n     imposition of an immediate and intensive supervision and \n     treatment program substantially reduces the rate of felony \n     recidivism during a 3-year period following arraignment. It \n     is estimated that there were 44 percent fewer felony \n     arrests--\n\n  That is 582 fewer felony arrests--\n\n     for offenders in what is called the FIRST Program--fast, \n     intensive, report, supervision and treatment--than under the \n     previous program.\n\n  California is expected to receive an estimated $119 million for drug \ncourts, or enough for about 59,500 offenders over the next 6 years. By \neliminating this program, this bill will deprive States of a tough \nprogram to get and keep nonviolent offenders off drugs and to unclog \nour courts of violators who would otherwise walk.\n  Another problem I have with the bill is the cuts in the Commerce \nprograms. I come from a State where 1.2 million people are out of work. \nThe unemployment rate currently exceeds 7.8 percent. It exceeds the \nnational rate by 2 points. This bill cuts EDA, which is the last \nremaining economic tool provided by the Federal Government since \nprograms were developed in the 1970's to help cities.\n  The program that is cut targets the defense conversion support. In my \nState, to cut defense conversion and its ability is to put people out \nof work, plain and simple.\n  The bill also eliminates funding for the Advanced Technology Program \nwhich assists firms with new technology to provide new breakthrough \nproducts and processes. One of the things that California was assured, \nhaving gone through more than 30 base closures, with between 500,000 \nand 1 million people who have lost their jobs so far because of defense \ndownsizing, is that there would be an adequate program of defense \nconversion to help industries convert into nondefense pursuits. And now \nwe find that these funds will be cut off by this bill as well. It is \nunfortunate.\n  Let me conclude by saying, community police have reduced crime. \nCommunity policing works. The crime bill has worked. It is not pork; it \nis where the beef is.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, before I yield time, I do think that a \nnumber of comments that have just been made both by the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from California \n\n[[Page S 18156]]\ndeserve a quick response, because I do not believe that they accurately \ncharacterize the bill.\n  It was ironic, in fact, that the Senator from Delaware came down here \nand excoriated us for approximately an hour and a half on the attitude \nthis bill takes, specifically citing one of the programs, which is \nprison construction, where we have created the possibility of States to \nobtain approximately $0.5 billion in prison construction for illegal \naliens.\n  This was not done to benefit my State. My State does not have a whole \nlot of illegal aliens running around. This was done to benefit the \nState of California, the State of Texas, the State of Florida, and it \nwas done at the expense, as was pointed out most vividly by the Senator \nfrom Delaware, at the expense of some of the smaller States, of which I \nhappen to be a representative.\n\n  So I find a certain irony when the Senator from California comes down \nand attacks this bill on the basis that it is not doing enough. I find \nequal irony when the Senator from Massachusetts comes to the floor and \nsays we are not spending enough money, when this bill increases the \nspending in the crime area by 19 percent. To do that, it had to take \nthe money from the State Department and the Commerce Department because \nwe were assigned a certain allocation.\n  So if the Senator from Massachusetts, or other Senators, wish to \nattack the nature of this bill and the amount of money being spent on \ncrime prevention in this bill, which happens to be a 19-percent \nincrease--a substantial increase considering the present climate--I \nbelieve they should tell us where they want to take more money from--\nfrom Commerce or the State Department?\n  On the issue of the drug courts, the fact is that under the block \ngrant proposal, drug courts are not eliminated. They are an available \noption for any State that decides to expand and use drug courts. It is \nvery much available under that block grant.\n  There are other points on which I will probably have to reserve my \nright to put a written statement in the Record.\n  I now yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho makes some very valid points. One of them, essentially, is that it \nfocuses on the crucial issue here, and that is whether or not law \nenforcement is a State and local function still, as it has always been \nin this country, or whether or not, basically, it is a matter for the \nFederal Government to attend to, given the Federal Government's \nwonderful track record in solving these problems historically.\n  I think people realize, ultimately, that this money that flows down \nfrom on high to the State and local communities comes from their own \npockets. It is not free money. I have often wondered how we got into a \nsituation in this country where folks down where I grew up, in \nLawrenceburg, TN, will get in their car and drive by the courthouse, to \nNashville, past the State capital, and go out to the airport to get on \na plane to fly to Washington, DC, and talk to me about how many cops \nthey ought to have in Lawrenceburg. That is the situation we have \ngotten to in this country.\n\n  While I do not think the conference report is the ultimate solution \nto this, I think more and more money ought to be left in the pockets of \nthe people on the local level and let them solve the problems. It is \ncertainly better than any alternative we have.\n  The conference reports reflects what those of us who are new to this \nbody were elected to do. Its provisions reflect the reality that there \nis not always a Washington-based solution to every problem. The \nConstitution limits the power of the Federal Government. Crimes, \ntraditionally, in this country are not a national problem, with \nexceptions, but it is primarily a State and local problem. By \neliminating the COPS Program, the conference report respects the proper \nrole of the States and the people under our constitutional system.\n  The COPS Program shows insufficient respect for our system of \nfederalism. With the COPS Program, citizens of States and localities \nare taxed by the Federal Government. The tax money is returned to the \nStates, minus the cost of a Federal bureaucracy, and with the addition \nof many strings on their own money.\n  The formula for allocating the money is peculiar. COPS funds go to \ncommunities without regard to their crime rate. The COPS office \nknowingly gave $75,000 to one town for the police chief to leave the \noffice for the street, supposedly. He wound up reading stories to \nsecond graders. How does that serve any Federal purpose? Two officers \nwere sent to a low-crime Chicago suburb, whereas a poor Chicago suburb, \nwhose crime rate tripled, received only one simply because it had fewer \nofficers than the wealthier suburb.\n  The strings on localities make even less sense, Mr. President. The \nmoney can be spent only on putting police on the street. Rural areas \nmay not find community policing appropriate to their sparse population, \nbut with the COPS Program, that is the only option. It is said on the \nfloor of this Chamber that, my goodness, they might spend it on police \ncars, equipment, or do something else with the money.\n  My question to that is: What is the problem? Have we in this body \nachieved such expertise on the details of law enforcement in the small \ncommunities across the Nation that we are in a position of supplanting \nour judgment for the people whose responsibility it is?\n  The President complains that police are outgunned by criminals, but \nunder the COPS Program, localities are prohibited from spending grants \non guns and ammunition, equipment, technology, training, or other \npurposes that actually correspond to the needs of the citizens where \nthe police will actually serve. The District of Columbia, with an \nenormous crime problem, refused to apply for a COPS grant because the \npolice chief says that the District has all the police it needs. What \nit lacks is appropriate technology and equipment. If the Federal \nGovernment does not even know what is best for Washington, DC, how can \nit know what is best for communities around the rest of the country?\n  Of course, the monetary rules are the COPS Program's worst \ninfringement on State's rights. COPS funds officers at $25,000, but the \nJustice Department's own figures show that the average police officer \ncosts $50,000. When a locality receives a COPS grant, it is also \nreceiving a Federal order to spend another $25,000 that the community \nmight wish to spend on other law enforcement functions, or even other \ndesirable local functions, or even tax relief.\n  Sunnyvale, CA, which the Clinton administration hailed in its \nReinventing Government campaign, returned its COPS grant because it was \nrequired to spend an enormous amount of its own money and to comply \nwith numerous Federal strings as a condition of Federal funding.\n  Moreover, the COPS Program is political. Applicants are required to \nindicate the locality's congressional district. The COPS office is \nduplicative. The Justice Departments's Bureau of Justice Assistance \ncareer civil servants already dispensed law enforcement grants to State \nand localities. By contrast, COPS funds are allocated by political \nappointees in a separate office. That office has a budget of $28 \nmillion, much more than the $16.3 million of COPS grants that Tennessee \nhas received, for example.\n  By contrast, the conference report replaces the COPS Program with \nblock grants. Local officials will best determine how to meet local \nneeds, without the interference, or even the existence of a Federal \nbureaucracy. It would have been better if the conference report had \ngone further, in my opinion--eliminating block grants and simply \nletting localities make their own law enforcement decisions, and \nleaving the money there for them to do it with. Then, municipalities \nwould be responsible for decisions made, and we would have a little bit \nmore accountability in our governing process. When multiple layers of \nGovernment are involved with street crime, each level can pass the buck \nto another, and the citizenry will not know who to hold accountable.\n  The differences between Congress and President Clinton are clear. \nPresident Clinton may well veto the conference report over the COPS \nProgram. He may \n\n[[Page S 18157]]\nfeel he wants to take a stand on something. If he wants to take a stand \nfor a Federal, bureaucratic, inefficient, and inflexible program, so be \nit. The conference report's approach is local, flexible, and efficient. \nIn fact, it is so efficient, Tennessee will not only receive more than \ntwice as much money under this approach than under the COPS Program, \nbut it will not have to comply with the whims that come from out-of-\ntouch bureaucrats. I am sure many other States will find themselves in \nthe same position. Therefore, I rise in support of the conference \nreport.\n  I yield back any time I may have remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement accompanying H.R. 2076, the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  The conference agreement provides $27.3 billion in budget authority \nand $19.1 billion in new outlays for the programs of the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, State, the judiciary, and related agencies.\n  When adjustments are made for prior-year outlays and other completed \nactions, the bill as adjusted totals $27.3 billion in budget authority \nand $26.6 billion in outlays.\n  Under very difficult funding contraints, this is a bill that honestly \nand straightforwardly sets forth funding priorities while staying \nwithin the subcommittee's revised 602(b) allocation. The final bill is \nless than $1 million in budget authority and $2.4 million in outlays \nbelow the revised 602(b) allocation.\n  I commend the new chairman of the subcommitee, Senator Gregg, for the \nfine job he did in conference on this bill. This bill provides dramatic \nincreases in our front-line law enforcement and the Border Patrol as \nwell as increased flexibility for States in developing their crime \nfighting strategy through the new State and local law enforcement \nassistance block grant. A total of $1.9 billion will be provided to \nStates and local governments for the hiring and equipping of law \nenforcement personnel, updated technology, and crime prevention \nprograms.\n  There are a few items for which I would like to express particular \nappreciation to the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. One is the $4 million provided for the Women's Outreach \nProgram under the Small Business Administration, another is the \nflexibility for States to fund drug court programs under the law \nenforcement block grant, and lastly, the agreement to preserve the \nLegal Services Corporation.\n\n  With regard to the Legal Services Corporation, I must say that I am \nnot pleased with the final funding agreement of $278 million. I realize \nthe House was concerned about passing the conference report and felt it \nnecessary to remain at the House funding level.\n  However, it is highly likely that the President will veto this bill. \nWhen we revisit this issue, I and a number of my colleagues will insist \non a higher funding level.\n  This bill retains the Legal Services Corporation but significantly \nrestructures its activities. I believe the Corporation should withstand \nscrutiny from even its harshest critics. Tough new restrictions on the \nuses of LSC and non-LSC funds are in place and enforceable through the \nindependent office of the inspector general, rather than through the \nCorporation itself.\n  The funds will be targeted toward basic legal services for low income \nindividuals ensuring equal access to justice. Within 6 months, the \nCorporation will be out of the more controversial business activities \nthat have brought so much criticism in the past.\n  Finally, I note that the conferees have continued bipartisan support \nfor the Fulbright Exchange Program recommending $102.5 million to \ncontinue the program in fiscal year 1996.\n  Since the Fulbright Program was signed into law in 1946, nearly \n230,000 Fulbright grants have been awarded to U.S. citizens and to \nnationals of 150 other countries. These scholars go abroad to study, \nteach, or conduct research and foreign nationals come to the United \nStates for the same purpose.\n  For every $100 the U.S. Government spends on Fulbright exchanges, the \nFulbright Program attracts $44 from foreign governments and from in-\nkind support and private contributions both here and abroad attesting \nto its international stature.\n  Non-U.S. Government support for the Fulbright Program increased by 20 \npercent from 1993 to 1994 alone, a strong indication of the program's \nprestige throughout the world.\n  I am pleased that the Congress will support the Fulbright Program in \nits 50th anniversary year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nBudget Committee scoring of the conference report accompanying the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the judiciary appropriations bill be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    COMMERCE-JUSTICE SUBCOMMITTEE, SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT   \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in

Mr. President, let me suggest that in times when we do \nnot have all the money in the world, the appropriation process, in my \nhumble opinion, has a very, very specific job to do and that is to \nprioritize where the money will be spent. If there is not enough money \nfor what everybody wants in a bill, then it is the responsibility of \nthose who lead the committee to look at the spectrum of things they are \nsupposed to be considering and say, ``Which are most important?''\n  Frankly, under our new chairman, Senator Judd Gregg, ably assisted by \nthe ranking member, Senator Hollings, who has chaired this subcommittee \nbefore, they have done just that, as it pertains to the No. 1 issue in \nthe United States of America: crime.\n  If you ask the American people what they would want us to spend their \ntaxes on in this bill, they would say pay for crime prevention, and \nU.S. attorneys who are prosecuting, and for prisons that are holding \nprisoners, and for U.S. marshals who make sure they are taken into \ncustody, and pay for FBI and DEA, and, lo and behold, add to that the \nentire Department of Justice criminal apparatus. Funding for these \nkinds of programs went up 19.2 percent.\n  Frankly, I come to the floor to congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember for that. They have added one other area that definitely needs \nimprovement, because if you ask Americans what else they are very \nworried about, they will say, ``Illegal immigration.'' They will say \n``our borders are \n\n[[Page S 18158]]\nnot our borders any more. They are sieves,'' and they will say, ``What \ncan you do to improve it?''\n  In this bill, in a dramatic way, we have increased the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, the INS. The American people would vote \n``aye'' for that. They would say yes.\n  Frankly, there are a lot of other things in this bill that are \nsecondary. If we had all the money in the world we ought to fund them. \nI want to lodge a complaint and a concern because we did not have \nenough money, but if we ever get back to the table and are producing \nanother bill, I am a strong advocate of giving legal services to poor \npeople who need a lawyer. I am not an advocate of Legal Services taking \non all kinds of causes. I want them to pay for individual poor \nAmericans who are being sued or have a lawsuit, so they have access to \na lawyer.\n  I believe Democrats and Republicans alike ought to be for that. This \nbill contains prohibitions against the Legal Services Corporation that \nthey can live with and still provide services for the poor. It does not \nhave enough money but there is not enough to continue providing the \nmost critical services.\n  This bill may not see the light of day. It may be vetoed. Who knows \nwhat the budget negotiations might bring? I came to the floor to say I \nbelieve we are about $60 million below the Senate-passed level for \nLegal Services, and I hope at some point we can make that up.\n  I close these remarks once again by saying if ever there was a \nsubcommittee that saw what America truly needs from its Federal \nGovernment, and where our people would like their taxes spent, this \nsubcommittee did it, because they have increased every legitimate bona \nfide area of crime prevention that the U.S. Government is in by a \nsignificant amount. I laud them for it. I hope we can eventually get \nthis new money into these programs and these activities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. First, I wish to thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \ngenerous comments. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I congratulate the authors for an excellent piece of \nlegislation. I come to the floor quite often complaining about wasteful \nspending earmarks and other pork barrel projects and find this \nlegislation largely devoid of that. I want to express my appreciation \nto both the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from New \nHampshire. I hope we can continue that practice and indeed expand it. I \nhave seen it in 2 of the 13 appropriations bills, and I hope that we \nwill be able to continue to make progress in that area.\n  Mr. President, the reason why I came to the floor, and I will not use \nmy full time, is that every time I come to the floor to talk about our \nrelationship with Vietnam I hope it is my last. Unfortunately, I have \nbeen given one more opportunity.\n  The bill before us conditions funds in an unacceptable manner for \nexpanding diplomatic relations with Vietnam on our efforts to gain the \nfullest possible accounting of American servicemen. The President has \nmade clear in his statement of policy on this bill that he will veto \nit. Among the reasons he listed for doing so is his objection to this \nparticular provision.\n\n  This being the case, I will not take a long time to discuss the \nissue. But I do want to point out one simple fact: The President of the \nUnited States has normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam. That is \na fact. The Senate has managed to at least grasp this reality. Just \nover 2 months ago it supported the President's decision by voting \nagainst an amendment prohibiting normal economic relations with \nVietnam. As for the other body, the language which has made Vietnam an \nissue in this bill at all was approved without a recorded vote.\n  Mr. President, to state the obvious, the President must have the \nauthority to conduct our foreign relations. Whether I agree or disagree \nwith the President of the United States--in this case I happen to \nagree--I know that elections have consequences. For better or for \nworse, President Clinton was elected to conduct our Nation's foreign \npolicy.\n  He is the President of the United States and he has decided it is \ntime to move forward in our relationship with Vietnam. Again, this is a \nfact.\n  He will veto this bill, as is also within his constitutional \nauthority, and we will begin again. I hope the next time the conference \ncommittee considers the issue of United States-Vietnam relations it \nwill dispose of it in a manner that allows us to put the issue behind \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the compromise \nlanguage that was worked out by the House and Senate conferees with \nrespect to an expansion of our diplomatic presence in Communist \nVietnam. I also take vigorous exception to the remarks made by the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, in opposition to the work done by \nthe conferees. I would say to my friend from Arizona that this language \nis so reasonable, that there is no way the House is going to back down \non it, and I intend to use every means at my disposal to prevent any \nweakening of the approved language. Moreover, while I respect the \nSenator from Arizona's right to raise his objections, I must say that I \nam extremely disappointed that he would make such a statement with \nrespect to this specific provision on Vietnam worked out by the \nconferees.\n  I would note that, in addition to a majority of the House-Senate \nconferees, this provision is supported by the majority leader, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the chairman of the Asian/Pacific Subcommittee, the \nchairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, as well as the \nHouse chairman of the International Relations Committee and the \nNational Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel. Moreover, four of \nour major national veterans organizations--the American Legion, the \nDisabled American Veterans, AMVETS, and Vietnam Veterans of America--\nsupport this language, in addition to the National League of POW/MIA \nFamilies and the National Alliance of POW/MIA Families. In short, there \nis broad support for this provision, notwithstanding the remarks by the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that all Congress has asked for from the \nPresident in this provision is his assurance that Vietnam is fully \ncooperating on the President's own established criteria for measuring \nprogress by Vietnam on the POW/MIA issue. Let me repeat, so there can \nbe no misunderstanding: all the Senate and House conferees have asked \nfor is the President's assurance that Vietnam is fully cooperating on \nthe President's own established criteria for measuring progress by \nVietnam on the POW/MIA issue. If Vietnam is not fully cooperating, then \nI would think most of my colleagues would agree that perhaps we need to \ntake a closer look at the administration's policy toward Hanoi and \nwhether it is working. If the President says Hanoi is fully \ncooperating, then it is full steam ahead with Vietnam relations.\n  I am both confused and amazed that the Senator from Arizona does not \nlike the term fully cooperating. All year long we have heard rhetoric \npraising Vietnam's cooperation on the POW/MIA issue from the \nadministration and certain Members of the Senate using every adjective \nin the book--words like ``superb,'' ``splendid,'' ``unprecedented,'' \n``undiminished,'' ``great,'' ``outstanding''--that is what we've been \ntold, Mr. President. But now, when we ask the administration to put \ntheir assurances in writing, with words that have real meaning, some \npeople up here get nervous and we see the kind of statement we heard \nearlier. Ironically, I think the remarks made earlier may cause the \nAmerican people to wonder whether they have been deliberately misled by \nthe President in order to allow the normalization of full taxpayer-\nfunded relations with Communist Vietnam. I find it very troubling that \nmy friend is raising a red flag on such a reasonable provision.\n  Mr. President, should the Senator from Arizona or any other Senator \nwant an extended debate on this issue, I would put them on notice right \nnow that they will get such a debate from this Senator if they try to \nweaken this language in the coming days.\n  The reason many of the wounds from the Vietnam war have yet to heal \nhas \n\n[[Page S 18159]]\nto do with things like honesty, commitment, and priorities. That is \nwhat this debate will be about, because that is what the House and \nSenate conferees are seeking from the administration with the \ncertification on POW/MIA cooperation in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the referenced \nprovision on Vietnam be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks in order that my colleagues may see how reasonable a provision \nit really is. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Bill Language Agreed to on Nov. 27, 1995, by the House-Senate \n Conference on H.R. 2076, the Commerce/Justice/State and the Judiciary \n               Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1996:\n\n       Sec. 609. Limitation on the Use of Funds for Diplomatic \n     Facilities in Vietnam.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended to pay for any cost incurred for:\n       (1) opening or operating any United States diplomatic or \n     consular post in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam that was \n     not operating on July 11, 1995;\n       (2) expanding any United States diplomatic or consular post \n     in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam that was operating on \n     July 11, 1995; or\n       (3) increasing the total number of personnel assigned to \n     United States diplomatic or consular posts in the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam above the levels existing on July 11, \n     1995,\n\n     unless the President certifies within 60 days, based upon all \n     information available to the U.S. Government, that the \n     Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is fully \n     cooperating with the United States in the following four \n     areas:\n       (1) resolving discrepancy cases, live-sightings, and field \n     activities,\n       (2) recovering and repatriating American remains,\n       (3) accelerating efforts to provide documents that will \n     help lead to the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIA's,\n       (4) providing further assistance in implementing trilateral \n     investigations with Laos.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, momentarily the Senator from Delaware, \nwho I understand has substantial time left, will come to the floor.\n  Let me agree with my distinguished chairman relative to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service whereby we cut not only New \nHampshire, we cut the State of South Carolina and other small States to \nthe tune of $500 million--half a billion bucks out of the prison fund, \nout of prison construction, so that we could set up this imprisonment \nof immigration violators in the States of California, Texas, Florida, \nand otherwise.\n  So there should not be any criticism on that score. There should be \nthanks to the Senator from New Hampshire and the committee that has \ndone its work in that particular regard.\n  Otherwise, Mr. President, let me emphasize one more time the advance \ntechnology program while I have a few minutes. We started that in our \nCommerce Committee after a series of over 2 years of hearings, and we \nwere trying our dead-level best to get America back on top of its own \ntechnology in the context of yes, we were leading in the research but \nnever in the development.\n  Specifically, down in Houston on the superconductor we had Nobel \nPrize winners there, but the competitor, Japan, orchestrated some 22 \nentities and markets and wins and profits. We win the prizes. They win \nthe profits. We wanted to get on top of that particular problem and \nwith the advance technology program whereby they pick the winner--not \nthe Government--and it is picked by them coming with at least 50 \npercent of the funds and thereafter reviewed, peer reviewed by the \nNational Academy of Engineering, that the award is made.\n  It is has worked very successfully. The industry, particularly the \nelectronics industry, the computer industry and otherwise, came to us \nand the Council on Competitiveness under President Bush, John Young of \nHewlett-Packard testified on behalf of this program.\n\n  I dovetailed the program, having chaired the hearings otherwise on \nthe trade bill back in 1988. It was not in the budget. Thereafter, \nPresident Bush did pick up and submit a request for it.\n  Now, over on the House side they have the bit in the teeth relative \nto winners and losers, industrial policy, all kinds of nonsensical \npollster slogans--are you for the Washington Government picking winners \nand losers? You hear some of that, and of course carried to its logical \nconclusion about the best government is the least government, and we do \nnot have to wait for Washington. Just do away with the county and State \ngovernment and let the township operate and forget about Washington, \ntoo.\n  These are good arguments on the campaign trail but the fact of the \nmatter is we have an ongoing program that should never be abolished, to \nmaintain the development, not just the research, but the development of \nour technology.\n  At the end of World War II we had 50 percent of the work force in \nAmerica in manufacturing; 10 years ago it was down to 26 percent; \ntoday, it is 13 percent.\n  I used to go to the factories in New Hampshire campaigning.\n  There are very few factories left in New Hampshire. I can find up on \nthe highway, 128, I think it is, going up from Nashua to Boston, Wang \nand some of the others, Wheeler, Beta, Frye--oh, I had a good time.\n  I mentioned earlier, the Governor of North Carolina, there, after \nSecretary of Commerce Hodges, he had been the national president of the \nRotary, and his widow, now a resident of your home State, made sure I \nwas introduced to all Rotary Clubs up there. It was a tremendous \npleasure. Otherwise, when referred to on the Hoover Commission by our \ndistinguished full chairman, Senator Hatfield of Oregon--yes, we served \non that Hoover Commission back in 1953 and 1954, investigating the \nintelligence activities.\n  I have, again, the same reverence he has for former President Herbert \nHoover. He is the one who, incidentally, started the telecommunications \nbill that we are trying to conference. It had a very interesting \nbeginning, that particular program, you might say, in law. It was back \nin 1912, at the sinking of the Titanic, whereby David Sarnoff, working \nin the store Wannamakers, in Philadelphia, selling wireless sets, went \nup on the roof and contacted survivors and nearby ships in the rescue \nand orchestrated the rescue effort. He stayed up there 3 days and \nnights. The crowds gathered below.\n  But, thereafter, then everybody wanted a wireless, and, by 1924, \nunder Secretary Hoover, the industry asked to be regulated. They had \njammed the airwaves and you could not reach anyone. They said, ``For \nHeaven's sakes, we need the National Government to come and regulate \nus.''\n  So, those who are now running around, deregulate, deregulate--we want \nto. We want to catch up the law with the technology, which is far ahead \nof us here in the Congress. But, in so doing, we want to make certain \nit is done on a competitive basis rather than a noncompetitive basis. \nWe do not want to extend the monopoly.\n  So, that being the case, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nconference report on the Commerce, Justice, and the State Department \nappropriations bill for fiscal 1996.\n  While this agreement is an improvement in some respects over the bill \nthat passed the Senate earlier this fall--most notably in the funding \nfor the Economic Development Administration--it still fails to provide \nadequately for many programs which are absolutely essential to \npromoting economic and business development, investing in research and \ndevelopment and protecting American consumers.\n  I want to underscore some of the most egregious provisions in this \nconference agreement.\n  First, this bill proposes to eliminate the President's Community \nPolicing Program, one of the most successful and popular anticrime \ninitiatives ever enacted. Communities throughout the Nation have \nalready benefited enormously from the Federal resources made available \nunder this program. There are today over 25,000 new police officers on \nthe street battling violence and drug-related crime. In my own State of \nMaryland, 365 new officers are on the beat in urban and rural \ncommunities creating a new sense of security and adding to the quality \nof life for all of our residents. The conference agreement's proposal \nto replace this program with a block grant program would defeat the \nentire premise of community policing by shifting money \n\n[[Page S 18160]]\naway from providing new police officers to communities in need. Lumping \nCOPS grants in with other law enforcement and prevention programs would \ninstead allow States to use the money for numerous other intentions \nranging from prosecutors to housing code inspectors.\n  Second, the conference agreement has proposed to significantly reduce \nfunding in important programs and laboratory upgrades for the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology. I would zero out the Advanced \nTechnology Program which assists businesses large and small in \ndeveloping high-risk/high-impact technologies for the 21st century. The \nATP is fast becoming a key mechanism accelerating the pace of \ncommercial technology development. In its first 5 years of operation, \nATP has already shown tremendous potential for enhancing economic \ngrowth--especially during this time of intensifying investor pressure \nto cut costs and spend limited research funds. Even though ATP is \nrelatively new, it is already helping researchers in 38 States. The \nconference agreement would eliminate not only future grant initiatives, \nbut also suspend funds for projects already in progress. This program \nhas truly been a success and must be continued.\n  I am also particularly concerned about the rescission of $75 million \nin prior year unobligated balances and reduction of $10 million in the \nfiscal 1996 request for the modernization of NIST's 35-year-old \nlaboratory facilities in Gaithersburg and Boulder, CO. Without these \nfunds, NIST will be unable to proceed with its construction of the much \nneeded Advanced Technology laboratory, the centerpiece of NIST's \nupgrade and construction program. As the only Federal laboratory whose \nexplicit mission is developing scientific standards and providing \ntechnical support for U.S. industry's competitiveness objectives, NIST \nmust have modern infrastructure--the laboratories, equipment, \ninstrumentation, and support--in order to maintain a viable scientific \nresearch program and to keep our Nation on the cutting edge of science \nand technology as we move into the 21st century.\n  Third, Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the funding level \nfor the Legal Services Corporation in this conference agreement. The \nagreement would provide significantly less funding than provided in the \nSenate bill, which would have reduced substantially the funding for \nlegal services from the fiscal year 1995 level of $400 million.\n  For more than two decades, the Legal Services Corporation has been at \nthe forefront of our efforts to give real meaning to the words \nemblazoned in stone above the portals of the Supreme Court: ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' The Legal Services program has provided critically \nneeded services to millions of poor, elderly, and disabled citizens who \notherwise would not have access to the American legal system and the \nprotection it affords the many basic rights we enjoy in this country.\n  Maryland's Legal Aid Bureau, which receives by far the largest \nportion of its total funding from the Legal Services Corporation, has \ndone an outstanding job of representing Maryland citizens living in \npoverty. With the funding received from LSC, the 13 legal aid offices \nlocated throughout Maryland provide general legal services to \napproximately 19,000 families and individuals annually, assisting \nMarylanders in such routine legal matters as consumer problems, housing \nissues, domestic and family cases, and applying for and appealing the \ndenial of public benefits.\n  I am very concerned that the significant reduction in funding in this \nconference report for legal services would seriously impair the ability \nof legal services organizations like Maryland Legal Aid to provide \nthese vital services.\n  Fourth, the conference report cuts $43 million from the \nadministration's fiscal 1996 budget request, funding that is absolutely \nessential for the Bureau to gear up for the 2000 census. These cuts \nwould seriously endanger the Census Bureau's ability to collect and \nprocess periodic economic data. This data is essential for businesses \nand policy makers to understand what is happening in the economy. A \nrecent editorial in the Washington Post underscores the importance of \nthis funding for the Census and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  For these and other reasons I urge my colleagues to join me in \nrejecting this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 7, 1995]\n\n                     Counting the Cost of Counting\n\n       Measured by the product created for the money spent, the \n     U.S. Census Bureau is one of the most valuable agencies of \n     government. Data from the Census Bureau are vital to \n     business, to academia, to transportation planners, to those \n     who assess future housing demand and to many others. Census \n     numbers are also among the country's most important political \n     numbers, determining how legislative seats are allocated and \n     where billions in federal dollars will go.\n       The Census Bureau, like every other agency, is caught up in \n     the battle for a balanced budget. The bureau is unusual among \n     federal agencies because its costs do not go up along a \n     straight line; they peak toward the end of one decade and the \n     very beginning of the next, because of the bureau's central \n     mission: to conduct a national head count every 10 years. The \n     misfortune for the Census Bureau is that the cuts needed to \n     achieve a balanced budget between now and 2002 fall right in \n     the middle of its biggest spending years.\n       The Census Bureau itself agrees with its various critics \n     that its needs to figure out how to produce better data for \n     less money. If the census in the year 2000 were conducted \n     exactly as the 1990 census was, the estimates are that its \n     cost would grow from $2.6 billion to $4.8 billion. The bureau \n     wants to come in at well under that. But to do so, it may \n     have to rely on various sampling techniques that many \n     Republicans are leery of. Some of the biggest costs the \n     census faces are in going back and finding those who do not \n     reply to the census form. Sampling would cut those costs. So \n     a key question is whether Congress is willing to accept \n     sampling methods in the interest of saving money. If the \n     savings came instead from less intensive efforts to find \n     those who do not answer the census initial query--many of \n     them are poorer than average, members of minority groups, \n     immigrants and city dwellers--the biases that already creep \n     into the data would deepen.\n       Many in Congress suggest that costs could be cut and \n     response rates improved if the census shortened the \n     questionnaire of its ``long form,'' which goes to about one \n     American in six. A shorter long form would save some money, \n     but at the cost of data lost to government, business and \n     researchers of all kinds. If ever there was a place for one \n     of those cost-benefit analyses the new Congress seems so fond \n     of, this is it.\n       For the next fiscal year, the Clinton administration had \n     asked for $193.5 million for the census, and the Senate went \n     right along. But the House appropriated only $135 million. \n     The conference committee has settled on $150.3 million. For \n     the short term, it's not clear to us that the census is the \n     best place to look for that much in savings, especially since \n     the bureau is now spending on technological improvements and \n     research designed to save money when the big bucks start \n     getting spent around the year 2000. The test should be \n     whether small cuts now would risk larger cost increases \n     later. Even more important is for Congress to face up to the \n     underlying policy issues, since the goal of a cheaper census \n     could be at odds with some of Congress's other objectives.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senate had proposed a 20-percent cut \nin the budget of the International Trade Commission. The conference \nreport restored most of the International Trade Commission's budget. \nVarious trade reorganization proposals have been advanced. Any attempt \nat trade reorganization must also encompass the reorganization of the \nInternational Trade Commission. It is my firm belief that the \nCommission flaunts the will of the Congress with regard to enforcement \nof our trade laws. Furthermore, the Commission is rife with internal \nconflict. At this time I ask for unanimous consent that memorandums \nwritten by the Chairman and various Commissioners be printed in the \nRecord. Mr. President, these memos speak for themselves, and they speak \nvolumes for the need to reform the ITC.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: The Commission.\n     From: Chairman Peter S. Watson.\n     Subject: Attempted override of direction to issue press \n         release re study in Inv. No. 332-TA-344.\n       Earlier today I learned from the Director, Office of Public \n     Affairs, of a purported decision by four Commissioners to \n     override my direction to her to issue a press release in the \n     form that I had approved.\n       Section 1331, of course, provides that any of my \n     administrative decisions ``shall be subject to disapproval by \n     a majority vote of all the commissioners in office.'' But \n     that section does require a vote. As our own General \n\n[[Page S 18161]]\n     Counsel has advised: ``While the statute clearly provides that the \n     Commissioners shall have the right to vote on the question of \n     disapproval, it is silent with respect to voting procedure. \n     We know of only two ways in which the Commission and other \n     collegial bodies vote on matters--by notational voting (e.g. \n     action jacket) and by vote in the course of a meeting. The \n     Commission utilized both forms of decisionmaking at the time \n     Congress was considering the amendments to section 331, and \n     we presume that Congress intended that disapproval votes \n     could occur in either manner.''\n       The reason for such voting is to allow all Commissioners a \n     say in any business before the Commission--in other words, it \n     enforces some minimal deliberation by the entire body, \n     whether in writing or orally.\n       This advice was confirmed to me late today by the Inspector \n     General. I continue, therefore, to direct the issuance of the \n     press release as originally drafted.\n       Per Administrative Order 94-26, ``any Commissioner may \n     request that an item, other than an outstanding action \n     jacket, be placed on the agenda for a public meeting of the \n     Commission.'' If any of my colleagues wish to do so, they \n     may.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Peg O'Laughlin.\n     From: Peter S. Watson.\n     Subject: Press Release for Inv. 332-TA-344.\n       I direct you to issue the attached press release \n     immediately. The authority of me to direct the release of the \n     same, over the objections of certain Commissioners; is \n     contained in CO70-S-066, a copy of which I attach. As there \n     has been no legally recognized override of my direction to \n     you, the press release is to be issued without any delay.\n       Using the same authority, I direct you, or any subordinate \n     of yours, not to release any other press release concerning \n     this investigation unless authorized by me in advance, in \n     writing.\n       Attachment.\n\n\n     itc releases study on the economic effects of antidumping and \n          countervailing duty orders and suspension agreements\n\n       The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) \n     today released the results of its investigation Economic \n     Effects of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Orders and \n     Suspension Agreements (Investigation No. 332-344). The \n     report, which also reports on the economic effects of the \n     dumping and subsidy practices that such orders and agreements \n     address, was forwarded to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey \n     Kantor, who requested study.\n       The investigation was originally requested by former USTR \n     Carla Hills in January 1993. Ambassador Kantor resubmitted \n     the request in June 1993 with a broadened investigative \n     scope. The ITC instituted the investigation in July 1993. Two \n     days of public hearings were held in September 1994 as part \n     of the ITC's full investigative process.\n       The ITC report Economic Effects of Antidumping and \n     Countervailing Duty Orders and Suspension Agreements \n     (Investigation No. 332-344, USITC Publication No. xxxx, June \n     1995) can be ordered without charge by calling 202-205-1809 \n     or by writing to the Office of the Secretary, Publications \n     Branch, 500 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20436 (FAX: 202-205-\n     2104).\n       The report will also be available on the ITC's Internet \n     server at http://www.usitc.gov or ftp://ftp.usitc.gov.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Director, Office of Public Affairs.\n     From: Vice Chairman Nuzum, Janet Nuzum, Commissioner Rohr, \n         Commissioner Newquist, and, Commissioner Bragg.\n     Subject: Press Release in Inv. No. 332-344.\n       We are very concerned about the events of Friday, June 30, \n     surrounding the issuance of a press release that had been \n     disapproved by a majority of the Commission. You work for the \n     entire Commission, and may not carry the instructions of a \n     single Commissioner, including the Chairman, if those \n     instructions conflict with the direction of a majority of \n     Commissioners.\n       In the future, we expect that you will take actions \n     consistent with the views of the Commission majority. If you \n     encounter what you believe are unfair tactics or intimidation \n     by a single Commissioner attempting to thwart the will of the \n     majority, please advise the remaining Commissioners promptly \n     and take no action until so authorized by a majority of \n     Commissioners. We will not tolerate such behavior by our \n     colleagues and have advised them that we will take \n     appropriate action if it occurs. In the case of a career \n     employee threatened with termination or other adverse \n     personnel action for refusing to follow instructions that \n     violate the will of a majority of the Commission, we note \n     that the Chairman does not have the authority to terminate a \n     supervisory employee at or above grade GS-15 without the \n     express approval of a majority of the Commission. 19 U.S.C. \n     1331(a)(2)(A). In the case of other adverse personnel action, \n     the Commission majority can and would take action to override \n     any such adverse action under these circumstances.\n       Press releases concerning Commission determinations or \n     reports require the approval of the Commission. Contrary to \n     the Chairman's characterization in his memorandum CO70-S-066 \n     (June 30, 1995), the issuance of such press releases is not \n     an administrative decision subject to override by a majority \n     of the Commission within the scope of 19 U.S.C. 1331(a)(1). \n     Rather, as described in the attached memorandum from the \n     General Counsel, the issuance of a press release regarding a \n     Commission response to an Executive Branch request is a \n     substantive matter involving external relations, and as such \n     requires majority approval by the Commission. This is \n     precisely the reason that such press releases are routinely \n     circulated by the Office of Public Affairs to all \n     Commissioners' offices--for approval by the Commission, not \n     approval by the Chairman. The Commission did not approve the \n     press release that you issued on June 30; in fact, a majority \n     of Commissioners disapproved it, and instead indicated its \n     approval of a revised press release. thus, issuance of that \n     press release was improper.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Chairman Watson.\n     From: Vice Chairman Nuzum, Commissioner Rohr, Commissioner \n         Newquist, Commissioner Bragg.\n     Subject: Press Release in Inv. No. 332-344.\n       We strongly object to your action of Friday, June 30, in \n     directing the issuance of a press release that had been \n     disapproved by a majority of the Commission. We are disturbed \n     by your heavy-handed tactics regarding issuance of a \n     Commission press release, which before your actions of that \n     Friday had been an uncomplicated collegial process. We also \n     disagree with both the premise and substance of your \n     memorandum CO70-S-066 (June 30, 1995).\n       The premise of your memorandum is incorrect: the issuance \n     of a press release concerning a Commission study is not an \n     administrative decision within the Chairman's authority under \n     19 U.S.C. 1331(a)(1), but rather a substantive matter \n     involving external relations, for which Commission approval \n     is required. In this case, a majority of Commissioners \n     disapproved the press release in favor of a revised press \n     release. Thus, when you directed the issuance of a press \n     release that had been disapproved by a majority of the \n     Commission, you acted outside of your authority.\n       Although this was not a case of an attempted override, you \n     are incorrect in suggesting that a vote to override an \n     administrative action by the Chairman can only be \n     accomplished by means of an action jacket or by vote in the \n     course of a public meeting. The courts have upheld various \n     means of notational voting, including the separate expression \n     of views to an office compiling the views. In this case, four \n     Commissioners expressed their disapproval of the press \n     release and their concurrence in a revised text, both to the \n     Director of Public Affairs and to your office, orally and by \n     means of electronic mail. This would have been sufficient for \n     an override, had this been an override situation.\n       Your action further contravenes 19 U.S.C. 1331(a)(3) which \n     states: ``No member of the Commission, in making public \n     statements with respect to any policy matter for which the \n     Commission has responsibility, shall represent himself as \n     speaking for the Commission, or his views as being the views \n     of the Commission, with respect to such matter except to the \n     extent that the Commission has adopted the policy being \n     expressed.''\n       You directed the issuance of a press release to the public \n     with the knowledge that it did not represent the policy of \n     the Commission. In fact, there was a majority consensus on \n     what the policy of the Commission would be regarding this \n     study and the public's access to its contents, but you did \n     not agree with it. Instead, you made your own determination \n     on what that policy should be, and you represented to the \n     public that policy as being the Commission's position, \n     knowing that it was not. Thus, in our view, you improperly \n     represented yourself as speaking for the Commission by \n     ordering the issuance of this release as a Commission \n     document.\n       Your actions in this matter are rendered even more \n     egregious by the ``management by intimidation'' tactics that \n     you employed. It is highly inappropriate for the Chairman to \n     threaten career government employees with adverse personnel \n     action if they fail to follow his personal instructions that \n     violate the clearly-expressed position of a majority of the \n     Commission. We are very concerned about your use of such \n     tactics, which place the entire Commission at risk for \n     employee grievances, sexual harassment lawsuits, and \n     resulting potential liability. To the extent that we are \n     required to do so by law, we hereby serve notice that we do \n     not condone such behavior and will not hesitate to take \n     appropriate action should it occur in the future.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Vice Chairman Nuzum, Commissioner Rohr, Commissioner \n         Newquist, Commissioner Bragg.\n     From: Peter S.

No. 332-344.\n\n       Thank you for the above-referenced joint Memorandum and the \n     Memorandum GC-S-295 attached thereto, both dated July 12, \n     1995.\n       The submissions are interesting insofar as they reflect \n     creative interpretation and writing. Yet, as entertaining as \n     your submissions might be, I do not find them compelling. \n     \n[[Page S 18162]]\n\n       Instead, I find the interpretation of Commission voting \n     procedure the GC set forth in GC-L-047, and in which the IG \n     orally concurred, to be compelling. Accordingly, I continue \n     to be directed by it, and I will expect relevant Commission \n     employees to do the same. For the same reason, the validity \n     of my original action stands.\n       What I found less amusing was the assertion that my conduct \n     ``place [note: not may place] the entire Commission at risk . \n     . . sexual harassment lawsuit''. A separate communication \n     will be forthcoming on this particularly serious, and totally \n     groundless, charge.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Chairman Peter Watson.\n     From: Vice Chairman Janet Nuzum, Commissioner David Rohr, \n         Commissioner Don Newquist, Commissioner Lynn Bragg.\n     Subject: Clarification of our memo of July 12.\n       In light of your comments in CO70-S-070 of late yesterday, \n     we wish to clarify our statements in the last paragraph of \n     our memorandum of July 12. We were not, and are not, alleging \n     that you have engaged in sexual harassment, and regret any \n     inference of such. Our concern is the use of intimidating \n     tactics and the possibility of grievances or lawsuits being \n     filed by staff should such treatment persist. Obviously, we \n     would not welcome such filings; besides the obvious legal \n     costs, there would be serious repercussions to morale within \n     the agency. We need a Chairman who leads by respect, not \n     threat. We hope you agree. In bringing these concerns to your \n     attention now, it is our sincere hope that you will \n     appreciate these concerns and that we can all avoid this \n     situation from escalating.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Vice Chairman Janet Nuzum, Commissioner David Rohr, \n         Commissioner Don Newquist, Commissioner Lynn Bragg.\n     From: Peter S. Watson.\n     Subject: CO69, 64, 67, & 71-S-003 of July 14, 1995.\n       I am in receipt of the captioned Memoranda. In respect to \n     your actions that I took issue with in the last paragraph of \n     my Memorandum CO70-S-070, knowledgeable counsel has advised \n     me that, upon a review of the facts and applicable law, he \n     believes actionable libel was committed by each of you (and \n     perhaps others, yet to be identified) in respect to the same.\n       Adlai Stevenson once observed that it is often easier to \n     fight for principles than to live up to them. I have no \n     lessons to learn from those who would presume to piously \n     school me while simultaneously publishing and disseminating \n     the insidious and odious language referred to. I am, however, \n     prepared to accept the unconditional retraction of, and \n     apology for, the language that you issued as an end of your \n     role in this most regrettable matter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 11, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: The Commission.\n     From: Peter S. Watson.\n     Subject: Request for hiring authorizations.\n       The purpose of this memo is to seek comment on action I am \n     considering on several requests for authorization to hire. As \n     you know, I instituted a hiring freeze this past April \n     (Administrative Order 95-13) that allows exceptions for \n     demonstrated critical staffing needs. Because all hiring \n     decisions made before the end of FY 95 will affect our budget \n     planning for FY 96, I believe it is important that the \n     Commission be advised of my decisions in that regard and \n     given the opportunity to comment on the same.\n       I recently received a request (OP-S-028) dated July 21, \n     1995, from the Director of Operations regarding certain \n     critical staffing needs. Attached for your review and \n     information is Mr. Rogowsky's July 21, 1995 memorandum, other \n     memoranda related to requests for hiring authority, and \n     background information on the ITC's Cooperative Education \n     Program.\n       Upon review of these memoranda and after numerous \n     conversations with staff, I have decided that it is sagacious \n     to authorize Office of Industries (OI) to convert three co-op \n     employees to permanent status (authorization to hire into the \n     co-op program granted 12/27/94 by this Office) and to \n     authorize the Office of Information Systems (OIS) to announce \n     and hire a computer specialist. I have concluded that it is \n     in the ITC's best interest to fill these positions despite \n     the possibility that the Commission's FY 96 appropriation may \n     necessitate a reduction in force. At this time, I do not \n     expect to grant any other hiring authorizations in FY 95.\n       We may estimate that the Commission will have approximately \n     425 full-time permanent employees on board at the close of FY \n     95 (if the aforementioned positions are filled). This number \n     is based on several considerations including the assumption \n     of a conservative attrition rate during FY 96. The last \n     transaction report (AD-S-175 dated August 7, 1995) indicates \n     that the Commission has approximately 423 funded permanent \n     position filled. This number would change as follows: 1) \n     the Commission is currently expecting to hire a Director \n     of Administration and a Director of Economics (+2); 2) \n     four more voluntary early retirements will occur by \n     September 30th (-4); 3) replacing Andy Fontaine in OIS and \n     approving the conversions of the three co-op employees \n     would add four (+4). The net result under this scenario \n     would be 425 permanent employees. I recognize that \n     staffing in Commissioners' offices may fluctuate slightly \n     as well.\n       It is, or course, useful to ask whether the Commission \n     could sustain 425 full-time permanent employees under \n     different budget scenarios. Based on Mark Garfinkel's \n     estimations, if we are funded at $44.5 million, the \n     Commission would be able to support 425 positions. If we are \n     funded at $43.5 million, a furlough appears to be required to \n     avoid a RIF. If, however, we are funded at $42.5 million or \n     below, a RIF would become necessary even with a furlough. All \n     of these scenarios assume a non-personnel expenditure \n     reduction of 10% (not including rent) and some attrition in \n     FY 96. We also expect some savings from reducing leased space \n     to be realized in FY 96. \\1\\\n       With the departure of Andy Fontaine in OIS, there exists a \n     critical need for additional technical computer support in \n     that Office. The only other OIS employee that has a technical \n     experience is Wally Fullerton. While OIS may be currently \n     over-staffed, existing employees cannot be trained to fill \n     Andy's position. It is important to note that the positions \n     currently filled by Andy and Wally Fullerton would likely be \n     placed in a separate ``competitive level'' from other staff, \n     preventing those positions from competing in a RIF targeted \n     at OIS.\n       The Office of Industries is operating at a level well below \n     its current ceiling of 125 full-time permanent positions. The \n     co-op conversions will still leave industries six positions \n     below its ceiling and fill important or critical needs in OI \n     divisions. I am mindful that a significant investment in the \n     program and these particular employees has already been made. \n     The Commission would be hiring highly productive individuals \n     at a GS-9 level (average entry level is GS-11/3) who have \n     already been trained. I note that precedent exists to convert \n     co-op personnel during a hiring moratorium. Although the \n     Commission does not have a legal obligation to hire co-op \n     employees on a permanent basis, it makes sense to do so with \n     successful candidates if we are going to continue to embrace \n     the program. \\2\\ It is my understanding that the Office of \n     Personnel does not believe an extension of their temporary \n     status is possible. Moreover, they would not have health \n     insurance unless converted. Because the co-op employees, if \n     converted, would likely be among the first to go in a RIF \n     targeted at Industries, I would advise them in advance of \n     their questionable job security.\n       Please provide me with your comments in writing by the \n     close of business August 16, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 17, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     From: Peter S. Watson.\n     To: David B. Rohr.\n     Subject: Use of title: ``Senior Commissioner''.\n       I am in receipt of your Memorandum CO64-S-055 dated August \n     14, 1995. Upon a thorough review of the entire matter it is \n     clear that the only relevant activity of disseminating \n     misleading information relates to your persistent and ongoing \n     public use of the non-existent title ``Senior Commissioner''. \n     It is a matter of public record that you are the longest-\n     serving Commissioner. However, it is obvious from the style \n     and context of your use of the term ``Senior Commissioner'' \n     that the same connotes a formal and legal title, and does not \n     merely indicate relative length of tenure.\n       The correspondence attached to your Memorandum indicates \n     that you have on at least three occasions formally and in \n     writing represented yourself with the title ``Senior \n     Commissioner''. The record reflects that you sent two letters \n     to the Financial Times and one letter to Inside U.S. Trade \n     using this non-existent title. This self-appointed title \n     apparently misled the Letters Editor of the Financial Times \n     who indeed addressed you with the title ``Senior \n     Commissioner'' in his response to you dated August 1, 1995.\n       Please note that the term ``Senior Commissioner'' does not \n     appear as a title designating a position in any statute \n     relating to the Commission, or in any Commission regulation, \n     directive or administrative order. See the attached OGC \n     Memorandum LMS-S-041.\n       Your use of non-existent title is, at the least, a profound \n     embarrassment to the Commission and especially to yourself. \n     Moreover, I am concerned that any continuing use of the same \n     might bring about a situation that results in a claim that \n     use of the title in question is in violation of law. In this \n     context one should note 18 USC Section 912 entitled ``Officer \n     or employee of the United States'' which states:\n       ``Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or \n     employee acting under the authority of the United States or \n     any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such. \n     . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more \n     than three years, or both.''\n       In that context, the Supreme Court case of United  States  \n     v.  Barnow, 339 US 74, 60 1 Ed 155, 36 Ct 19 (1915) supports \n     the obvious conclusion that 18 USC Section 912 is to be read \n     broadly to include the false representation as to some office \n     or employment which has no legal or actual existence. As the \n     Court notes ``. . . the mischief is much the same. . . \n     whether the pretender names an \n\n[[Page S 18163]]\n     existing or non-existing office or officer. . .''.\n       Since the entire Commission is now on notice of your \n     continuing use of the said title and of possible claims \n     arising from ongoing use thereof, I hereby direct you to \n     immediately and permanently cease and desist in the use of \n     the same.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 1995.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: The Chairman.\n     From: The General Counsel.\n     Subject: ``Senior Commissioner''.\n       This is in response to your request for a review of whether \n     the term ``Senior Commissioner'' appears as a title \n     designating a position in any statute relating to the \n     Commission, a Commission regulation, a directive, or an \n     administrative order. We have found no such usage in statutes \n     (both current provisions and those applicable in 1996) \n     relating to the Commission, the Commission's Rules of \n     Practice and Procedure, directives, or administrative orders.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 22, 1995.\n     To: Chairman Peter S. Watson.\n     From: David B. Rohr.\n     Subject: Your memorandum CO70-S-082 (use of term ``Senior \n         Commissioner''); My memorandum CO64-S-055 (Title VII \n         Study, Investigation No. 322-334).\n       I have seen your August 17, 1995 memorandum, CO70-S-082. I \n     note that you take issue with my use of the term ``Senior \n     Commissioner,'' but avoid the important matter raised by my \n     memorandum CO64-S-055, the circulation of misleading \n     information to the media on our Title VII investigation and \n     report.\n       Your views regarding the use of the term ``Senior \n     Commissioner,'' while interesting, reveal a surprisingly \n     deficient research effort. Rather than merely parse the \n     statute, you could have researched Commission custom and \n     tradition, precedent that is important in matters such as \n     these. Such research would have revealed the use of the title \n     by other Commissioners at appropriate periods of their \n     tenures. I recall, in those cases, the Senior Commissioners \n     were accorded courtesy and respect by their colleagues, \n     qualities that are, indeed, in short supply within the \n     current Commission.\n       Also on the ``Senior Commissioner'' issue, I must point out \n     that the letterhead I use clearly shows the statutorily \n     designated title of ``Commissioner'' in the upper left hand \n     corner. My use of the term ``Senior Commissioner'' is \n     subordinate to this statutory designation. The term \n     ``Senior'' in ``Senior Commissioner'' is merely an adjective, \n     reflecting my seniority of tenure among the current \n     Commissioners, a fact that even your memorandum acknowledges. \n     Seniority of tenure is statutorily referred to in section \n     331(c)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. I am \n     merely using the title as it has been customarily used at \n     this agency, and, in my case, perhaps, also as a reference \n     to chronological age.\n       I am very disappointed that you have chosen to ignore the \n     purpose of my memorandum CO64-S-055, which was to call your \n     and our colleagues' attention to what I believe to be \n     misleading publicity regarding the Title VII report. My \n     concern is heightened by a second letter from the Financial \n     Times, received on Friday, August 18 (copy attached), which \n     states in paragraph 2 that ``Nancy Dunn's original story . . \n     . was based upon information supplied by the ITC.'' (emphasis \n     added). This suggests very strongly that the June document \n     ``Release of U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) Study \n     on Economic Effects of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \n     Orders and Suspension Agreements,'' which included the $16 \n     billion dollar cost figure, actually originated in and was \n     disseminated from this agency with some sort of deliberate \n     intent that it be mistaken for a Commission-sponsored \n     document.\n       I think we all should be very concerned about the \n     appearance (at least) of dishonesty and lack of integrity at \n     the Commission if, indeed, such information originated here \n     and was disseminated as though it were a Commission \n     publication. I believe the information disseminated was, in \n     fact, wrong. I documented this in my previous memorandum. \n     Regardless, however, of how the information is characterized, \n     it appears to have been disseminated as though it were from \n     the Commission. This is the critical misrepresentation--not \n     that the information was wrong--but that it was apparently \n     deliberately misrepresented to be from the Commission.\n       Therefore, I renew my request for your thoughts and those \n     of my colleagues about any actions that we might take to shed \n     light on this case and assure that similar occurrences are \n     precluded in the future. I will have to assume that continued \n     silence by you or any other Commissioners is a lack of \n     interest and concern.\n       I also renew my request for your communications with the \n     Financial Times related to the Title VII study.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would just like to make a few comments \nwith respect to Senator Biden's remarks.\n  First, Senator Biden remarked that the process by which this bill was \nbrought to the floor was problematic. I agree, the process was \nimperfect. I would rather have brought the authorizing language through \nthe normal process. I would note, however, that we have already held \nmore hearings on the authorizing language in this bill than the \nJudiciary Committee held on the entire 1994 crime bill. I think it's \ntough to argue about the process by which this bill was sent to the \nfloor.\n  Second, I would like to address the so-called cuts to Federal law \nenforcement. Federal law enforcement is increased nearly 20 percent \nover 1995 levels. And I would note that since 1990, the only real cut \nto Federal law enforcement came in the President's first budget. \nIndeed, Congress actually restored the President's cuts.\n  For example, the Commerce, Justice, State conference report funds INS \nat an increased rate of $2,557,470,000.\n  The conference report provides over a 23.5-percent increase of fiscal \nyear 1995 enacted levels. This increase provides funds to better \ncontrol our borders and to stem illegal immigration.\n  The conference report provides funds for 800 new border patrol \nagents, 160 support personnel, and allows for better INS efficiency by \nredeploying interior agent positions to locations where the illegal \nimmigration problem is most severe, the border.\n  The report also increases, by 1,400 positions, personnel dedicated to \napprehend, locate, detain, and deport illegal aliens. Funding is also \nprovided for over 2,800 detention beds and funding for antismuggling \nunits.\n  Construction funds are provided for a triple fencing pilot project in \nsouthern California and funds to renovate a naval base for use as an \nINS satellite training facility.\n  Although the FBI does not receive quite the funding that I would like \nit to, it nevertheless receives a substantial increase over 1995.\n  The conference report represents over a 9.8-percent increase compared \nto fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. This increase provides resources \nenabling the FBI to address many projects and initiatives. These \ninitiatives include: Personnel to staff the FBI Command Center; FBI \nlegal attaches; safe streets task forces; FBI laboratory equipment and \npersonnel; emergency response teams; upgraded databases on \ngangs; State, local, and Indian tribal law enforcement training; \naviation maintenance and equipment; and wireless radio communications.\n\n  Construction funds are provided to renovate the FBI Command Center, \nto modernize the FBI Training Academy for use by Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement officers, and to begin work on a new FBI \nlaboratory facility.\n  The conference report does not include a $29 million request relating \nto the full annualization of personnel that could have been hired in \nfiscal year 1995. In light of this hiring delay, however, the full \npersonnel funding request is not necessary.\n  The report provides significant funding for U.S. attorneys offices as \nwell. The $925,509,000 in the conference report represents over a 8.5-\npercent increase compared to the fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. \nFunding will support expedited deportation of denied asylum applicants, \nFederal victims counseling under the Violence against Women Act and \nincreased demands for criminal prosecution and related activities.\n  The conference report also pays for security upgrades at U.S. \nattorneys offices, increased prosecutions of immigration laws, and \nfunds to maintain attorney and support personnel levels for the \nprosecution of violent crime.\n  The DEA also received an increase in this bill, as it should. Drug \nuse is the scourge of America, and it needs to be combated.\n  I fought for $60 million in trust fund money for the DEA during the \nComprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act. I appreciate the Appropriations \nCommittee taking my funding recommendation into account and providing \nDEA with $60 million of trust fund money.\n  The conference agreement provides over a 6.4-percent increase \ncompared to fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. This provides to the DEA \nfunds to improve its infrastructure and to better support investigative \nefforts.\n\n  The conference report includes program increases for the DEA's legal \nattache program, contract linguist support, advanced telephony, office \nautomation, new agents for domestic heroin enforcement, mobile \nenforcement teams, and wireless radio communications.\n  The conference report does not include $15 million requested relating \nto \n\n[[Page S 18164]]\nfull annualization cost of personnel that could have been hired in \nfiscal year 1995. In light of this hiring delay, however, the full \nrequest personnel is not necessary.\n  The marshal's service is also adequately funded under the bill.\n  The conference report provides over a 12.9-percent increase compared \nto fiscal year enacted levels. This agreement provides funds to upgrade \nsecurity at existing courthouses. Additionally, it provides additional \nsecurity personnel, equipment, and communications funds for new and \nexpanded courthouses.\n  As for today, we are trying to balance the Federal budget. The \nPresident's request for Federal law enforcement was not made in the \ncontext of balancing the Federal budget. He has the luxury of not \nbalancing the budget.\n  I would certainly like to put more money back into Federal law \nenforcement, but where will that money come from?\n  I would ask if we do not balance the budget now, then when will we do \nit? Where should we take the money from?\n  The plain truth is, this bill is an increase to Federal law \nenforcement--an increase of 20 percent. The only budget passed here in \nrecent years that cut Federal law enforcement was Fiscal Year 1994--The \nfirst full Clinton budget.\n  I would also like to comment on the Prison Grant Program Senator \nBiden mentioned. The Department of Justice has engaged in what might be \ncharitably characterized as a campaign of misinformation about the \nprison grants provisions contained in the conference report. For \nexample, while committee staff was working on the details of these \nprovisions, the staff solicited and received informal comments from the \nDepartment's Office of Policy Development. The Department's comments \ncontained numerous factual errors.\n  For example, I was quite surprised to receive a letter on behalf of \nthe American Society of Corrections Administrators [ASCA] which \nparroted, errors and all, the Department's informal comments. These \ncomments were apparently transmitted to corrections departments in \nevery State. As the corrections director of my State of Utah, who \nserves as the legislative committee chairman of ASCA, noted in a \nfollowup memorandum to the association's executive director:\n\n       These informal comments appear to be designed to sidetrack \n     or block any congressional attempts to revise the 1994 crime \n     bill in any way as the administration admittedly does not \n     want any revisions to this Bill.\n\n  Recently, the Department has been circulating a series of \nspreadsheets containing data purporting to demonstrate how many of our \nStates would suffer under the conference report as compared to the 1994 \ncrime bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two of the analyses to be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. The problem is, the numbers they use are unreliable, and \nare based on assumptions which are either unprovable, or simply untrue.\n  Indeed, an early Department criticism of this grant program stated \nthat:\n\n     [t]he way the funds are divided among qualified States \n     prohibits the determination of grant amounts until all States \n     applications are submitted and reviewed for compliance, and \n     grant decisions are made.\n\nYet the figures being bandied about purport to be exactly such \ndeterminations.\n  There are several sets of numbers floating around. Apparently, the \nDepartment would run figures based on any assumption given them. In \nsuch a case, one really can use statistics to prove anything.\n  As just one example of the wildly varying sets of numbers released by \nthe Department, under one set, my State of Utah would receive no money \nin fiscal year 1996, in another it would qualify for $2,324,958, and \nunder a third scenario, Utah would receive $4,350,000. There is even a \nfourth analysis, under which Utah receives more than $7.3 million. I \nunderstand that a fifth analysis exists that gives Utah nearly $6 \nmillion. At this rate, eventually the Department will be reporting that \nall of the money will go to Utah. While my State, like each of our \nStates, can certainly use prison grant assistance, this only highlights \nthe spurious nature of these so-called analyses. Each of these analyses \npresumably are evaluating the same program.\n  As an example of assumptions used in the analyses that are simply \nuntrue, the Department has repeatedly assumed that the grant program \nwould be funded at a level of $500 million in fiscal year 1996. Yet the \nconference report which the Department purports to be evaluating \nclearly appropriates $617 million for the program.\n  Moreover, several of the Department's analyses assumes that all $500 \nmillion assumed appropriated pursuant to the 1994 crime bill would be \napplied directly to grants, while it assumes that under the conference \nreport, only $300 million would be applied to grants. With such a \nstarting assumption, it is hardly surprising that the analyses would \nconclude that States will receive less funding under the conference \nreport.\n  The problem is, the premise simply isn't true. While the conference \nreport admittedly utilizes $200 million of the $617.5 million \nappropriated to provide extra assistance to truth-in-sentencing States \nwith high numbers of criminal aliens, there is absolutely no reason to \nbelieve that Congress would not do the same thing if no other change \nwere made to the prison grant program. Implying otherwise to arrive at \nthe desired result is disingenuous.\n\n  Some of the Department's results may be skewed on political grounds. \nSome of the results look peculiar indeed. For instance, one analysis \npurported to show which States would qualify for truth-in-sentencing \ngrants, which would qualify for the less-lucrative general grants, and \nhow much each State would receive under the conference report. Perhaps \nit is only a coincidence, but among the 28 general grant States in this \nanalysis were 16 States that are represented in the Senate by 18 \nSenators who sit on either the Judiciary Committee or the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  There is much more one could say about the numbers being bandied \nabout by the Department of Justice on this issue. I will say no more \nabout them, except to comment that this debate should involve policy \narguments, not political scare tactics. The bottom line is that I \nbelieve that, if it is administered in an unbiased manner, all our \nStates will receive a fair share of funds under this bill--a share that \nis proportionate to their crime rate and to their efforts to keep \ncriminals off the streets. If a problem with the language does exist we \nwill certainly fix it on the next round.\n  This bill is not perfect. But it has its priorities right, and \ndevotes significantly more resources to the incarceration of violent \nprisoners than the fiscal year 1995 appropriation bill did. That bill \nappropriated only $24 million of an authorized $175 million. I believe \nthat we can do better, and this conference report does so. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Furthermore, my friend from Delaware has also criticized the \nindeterminate sentencing provisions in the conference report.\n  I listened with great interest to my colleague's remarks. I am \ncertain that it was not his intent to imply that this provision was \ndesigned to harm other States.\n  The truth is, 34 States practice some form of indeterminate \nsentencing. In many instances, violent prisoners can be kept in jail \nlonger in these States than in determinate-sentencing States. For \ninstance, in Delaware, even if they keep a prisoner in jail 10 years, \nhe could be out in 9. In a system like Utah's, the same criminal could \nbe sentenced to 5 to 15 years. Using criteria very similar to the \nFederal sentencing guidelines, the Utah Parole Board can keep the \nprisoner in for 5 more years.\n  This bill does nothing more than level the playing field for \nindeterminate States that keep violent thugs locked up.\n\n[[Page S 18165]]\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               CRIME SUBCOMMITTEES

Mr. President, when this bill was originally on the Senate \nfloor, and Senator Domenici offered his amendment to preserve the Legal \nServices Corporation, I supported Senator Domenici's effort but \nexpressed some grave reservations about the restrictions that were \nbeing placed on recipients of LSC funds.\n  I hoped that the conference might come to understand the folly of \nthese restrictions and report out a bill that would provide the LSC \nwith sufficient funds to fulfill its important mission of ensuring that \nour most needy citizens have equal access to our system of justice--a \npromise written in stone on the front of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Unfortunately, the product of the conference with respect to the LSC \nis entirely inadequate.\n  Under the conference report, LSC funding would be cut from $400 \nmillion in fiscal year 95 to $278 million, a reduction of over 30 \npercent.\n  The bill would place 19 separate restrictions on recipients of LSC \nfunds. These restrictions control not only how legal services \norganizations may use their Federal grants but also how they may use \nfunds derived from the States, bar associations, and private donations.\n  Under this bill, legal services organizations and the skilled \nattorneys that work for them are precluded from testifying at a \nlegislative hearing, commenting on a public rulemaking, or \ncommunicating with Federal, State, or local officials that operate \nprograms for the indigent.\n  At a time when we are authorizing the States to operate welfare, \nMedicaid, and a host of other programs with less Federal intervention, \nwe are depriving them of the advice and expertise of some of the most \nknowledgable poverty law attorneys in the country.\n  And, at a time when we are trying to reduce the intrusiveness of the \nFederal Government, we are imposing new Federal mandates on how private \norganizations--such as Maine's Pine Tree Legal Assistance and the \nVoluteer Lawyer Project--may use their own money.\n  The bill also fails to provide the Corporation with sufficient \nadministrative funds to properly perform the competitive bidding and \nmonitoring requirements that this bill creates.\n  I realize that there are many in the other body that wish to \neliminate LSC in its entirety and see these measures as the first steps \nin that process. But there were over 60 votes in the Senate to preserve \nLSC and those votes should not be ignored.\n  I understand that the President intends to veto this legislation, so \nI expect that the issue of the funding and structure of LSC will be \nbefore this body again. I agree that LSC must share in the budget belt-\ntightening that is being experienced throughout the entire Government. \nAnd some new restrictions may be in order to ensure that LSC funds are \ntargeted at the most critical needs of our indigent citizens.\n  But in the end, the Corporation must be provided funds sufficient to \nguarantee the continued operation of its programs and restrictions that \nhinder legal services organizations from promoting the interests of \ntheir clients must be eased. I will continue to work toward this result \nwith the President and members of the Appropriations Committee on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief \ncomments on the conference report to H.R. 2076, the fiscal year 1996 \nspending bill for the Department of Commerce, State, Justice and \nrelated agencies.\n  I appreciate the diligent work of the respective House and Senate \nsubcommittees to craft a conference report that seeks to maximize \nfunding that will be allocated to the Department of Commerce, \nDepartment of State, the Department of Justice and the 18 other \nagencies included in this appropriations measure. It has been made \nclear from the development of H.R. 2076, that this measure would be \nsubject to a Presidential veto. Today, as we debate this conference \nreport it is apparent the President will follow through to veto this \nmeasure.\n  While I will support the conference agreement today, because it \ncontains vital funding for very meritorious programs, I want to express \nmy serious reservations with legislative language included in this \nmeasure that may seriously undermine the ability of law enforcement \nofficials to effectively address crime in their respective States and \ncities.\n  As you know, I have been a strong supporter of the 100,000 cops \nprogram. This program, which passed with widespread bipartisan support \nas part of the 1993 crime bill. In that bill, Congress authorized funds \nto go directly to where the problem exists: that is the shortage of law \nenforcement personnel. This important program would be administered in \na block grant under the legislation now being considered.\n  I am concerned that scarce dollars would be spend by some mayors on \nanything that can arguably be construed as law enforcement under a \nblock granting scheme.\n\n[[Page S 18167]]\n\n  Also, I want to once again, reiterate my strong support for drug-\ncourt funding. In Denver, our drug court is a tough, law-enforcement \noriented solution to society's drug problem. It has already begun to \nshow success. It would be a mistake to eliminate this valuable tool for \nenforcement of our drug laws.\n  Understanding this bill will be vetoed by the President, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to reach a middle ground in a \nsubsequent appropriations bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the 1996 \nCommerce, Justice, and State appropriations conference report, I wanted \nto focus my colleagues' attention on the need to obligate substantial \nresources to combat the devastating increase in drug use among our \nchildren. Let me take this opportunity to describe one such effort.\n  In its annual survey of drug use by junior and senior high school \nstudents, the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education \n[PRIDE] reported significant increases among teenagers for crack, \ncocaine, heroin, LSD, non-LSD hallucinogens, inhalants, and marijuana.\n  The PRIDE survey found that 33 percent of our high school seniors \nsmoked marijuana in the past year, and 21 percent smoked monthly. Since \nthe 1990-91 school year, annual reported use of marijuana in junior \nhigh school has risen 111 percent and has risen 67 percent in high \nschool. There has been an alarming 36-percent increase in cocaine use \nby high school students since 1991-92, which was the period of lowest \nuse in recent years. If we allow this trend to continue, teenage drug \nuse will reach the U.S. all-time high of 54 percent, in less than 2 \nyears. Let me restate, we will have more kids in high school who are on \ndrugs than are not.\n  Despite these alarming trends, surveyed teenagers report only one-\nthird of nearly 200,000 parents talk to their children frequently about \nthe dangers of drug use. Yet the study shows that parental involvement \ncould significantly deter drug use, even among older teenagers. Among \nhigh school students whose parents never talk about drugs, 34 percent \nsmoked marijuana, versus 24 percent who said their parents speak about \ndrugs a lot--a relative decrease of 29 percent. Drug use declines \nsharply among students whose parents frequently discuss drugs with \nthem.\n  According to the president of PRIDE, Dr. Thomas J. Gleaton, the most \neffective drug prevention program in the world--parental intervention--\nis used far less than we think.\n  Since last March, PRIDE has devoted a great deal of attention to the \nquestion of how we, as a nation, can again capture the necessary level \nof parental involvement that successfully drove down teenage drug use \nin the previous two decades. By active involvement in the antidrug \nmovement, parents were successful in driving down drug use by teenagers \nfrom the all-time high of 54 percent in 1979 to just 27 percent by \n1992.\n  PRIDE has proposed a grassroots plan focused on a renewed parent \nmovement in the fight against teenage drug use. The goal of this effort \nis to educate parents and involve them in programs that will prevent \nand reduce drug abuse by their children. PRIDE's volunteer-based \napproach will allow parents to create a drug prevention program most \nsuitable to the needs of their community. I feel strongly that the best \nsolutions are found closest to the problem, which in this case, is the \nlocal level. I believe PRIDE's proposal is a valiant step toward \npreventing drug use among our Nation's most vulnerable targets--our \nchildren. Putting an end to drug use among teenagers is a key component \nin winning the war against the drugs.\n  In closing, I urge the Attorney General to ensure that adequate \nresources are available to combat teenage drug use. In addition, I \nencourage the Department of Justice to make available discretionary \ngrant funds through justice assistance and juvenile justice programs to \nsupport PRIDE's efforts to establish programs involving parents in our \nfight against teenage drug use.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, before I discuss my views on the conference report, \nlet me begin by commending the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, and the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, Senator Hollings, for their hard work on this legislation. \nSenator Gregg in particular has managed to get up to speed on the \nintricacies of this legislation after Senator Gramm left the \nsubcommittee. That's not an easy thing to do, and he deserves real \ncredit for his efforts. Similarly, Senator Hollings, as always, has \ndemonstrated his expertise on the programs covered in this legislation, \nand he also deserves credit for his work.\n  Mr. President, given the hard work of these two Senators, I rise to \noppose the conference report with some reluctance. However, I have \nserious concerns with the final product, and so I am left with little \nchoice.\n  I am especially concerned about the complete elimination of funding \nfor the Community Policing Program.\n  Mr. President, this body previously voted to fully fund the COPS \nProgram reaffirming our commitment to putting 100,000 new police \nofficers on the streets.\n  Unfortunately, we apparently have now backed down in the fact of \nopposition from the House. And this conference report would completely \neliminate the COPS Program.\n  Mr. President, the Community Policing Program is a program that \nworks. I can attest to that because I've seen it first hand. A few \nmonths ago, I was in Plainfield, NJ, and I saw what the Community \nPolicing Program has meant for that town. The results have been \ndramatic.\n  Crime has been reduced. The relations between the police and the \ncommunity have improved. And the whole city has benefited.\n  I've seen similar results in several New Jersey cities.\n  Mr. President, community policing works largely by preventing crime \nbefore it happens. Under the program, officers are encouraged to get \nout of their cars and onto the streets. There, they go to know the \npeople of the community and their problems. In the process, they also \ngain citizens' trust and confidence.\n  The improved relationship between the police and their community has \nseveral payoffs. Perhaps most importantly, officers are able to \nidentify and resolve conflicts early on--before they erupt into \nviolence. Community police officers often know when tensions are \nbuilding between rival gangs, or between a husband and a wife. And they \ncan take steps to defuse these tensions in a constructive way.\n  By contrast, officers who don't get out of their patrol car may have \nno idea that violence is about to erupt until it's too late to do \nanything about it--or after the fact.\n  Community policing also makes citizens feel more safe. People tell me \nthat it's very reassuring to see an officer walking the beat, available \nto help out if a problem arises. This increased sense of security can \nmake a huge difference in the quality of peoples' lives. It allows them \nto go out at night, to take their kids for a walk in the park, to get \nto know their neighbors.\n  These are the kind of things that Americans should be able to take \nfor granted. But they can't in today's climate of fear.\n  Another benefit of community policing is that it helps to involve the \npolice in the daily lives of young people.\n  As you know, Mr. President, many teenagers today are growing up \nwithout fathers, and without responsible adults who can set them on the \nright course. Community policing officers can help fill that void. \nAlthough no policeman can substitute for a father, officers can help \ninstill a sense of values, and can lead young people away from lives of \ncrime and drugs.\n  But they can't do that if they're just sitting in their patrol cars, \nisolated from the community.\n  Mr. President, a broad range of law enforcement officials have \nrecognized the value of community policing. In fact, a national poll \nfound that a clear majority of chiefs and sheriffs surveyed called \ncommunity policing the most cost-effective strategy for fighting crime.\n  In addition, national law enforcement organizations, including the \nMajor Cities Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, \n\n[[Page S 18168]]\nall have come out strongly in support of the COPS Program. These are \nthe people at the front lines in the battle against crime. And they \nknow what works.\n  Mr. President, it would be a serious mistake to eliminate the \nCommunity Policing Program in favor of a whole new bureaucratic \nmechanism that does not now exist, and has no track record of success.\n  Unlike the Community Policing Program, which was worked out in \nlengthy negotiations during last year's crime bill debate, the new \nblock grant program in this bill hasn't been subject to serious review. \nWe don't know whether it will work.\n  There also are serious questions about how State politicians will use \nthis money. Under the terms of the block grant, Governors could choose \nto fund building code inspectors, parking meters, bullhorns, or even \ncarpets for courthouses. They wouldn't have to hire a single new police \nofficer.\n  Mr. President, there is no need to deal with these kind of questions, \nand the variety of other problems that are involved in creating a whole \nnew program. The Community Policing Program has an established track \nrecord. It's been up and running for some time. And we know it works. \nI've seen the results myself. And I am sure many of my colleagues have \nseen similar successes.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will not abandon our national \ncommitment to providing 100,000 new police officers. Community policing \nwill make a real difference in reducing crime, if we stick to it. Yet \nthis conference report proposes to eliminate the program altogether. \nAnd that would be a serious mistake.\n  Mr. President, another serious problem with this conference report is \nthat it virtually eliminates crime prevention programs.\n  Mr. President, it's a cliche, but it's also true that an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure. And there has never been a more \nurgent need to help ensure that young people, especially, are given \npositive alternatives to lives of crime. Arrest rates for violent \ncrimes by juveniles have risen by nearly 100 percent in the last \ndecade. And these arrest rates are expected to double again in the next \n15 years.\n  We need to do more to reverse these trends. And yet the conference \nreport largely ignores this need.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nover the cuts in programs in the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations conference report.\n\n\n                       CUTS IN COMMERCE PROGRAMS\n\n  Let me turn first to cuts in the Commerce portion of the bill. Most \nof us agree that we must balance the budget, but let us avoid the trap \nof being penny wise and pound foolish in this process of making \ncutbacks. In our efforts to effectively balance the budget, we should \nmake smart cuts, and protect investments that will improve our quality \nof life, will provide high-wage, high-skilled salaries and will \nmaintain U.S. leadership in the global economic marketplace. Afterall, \nthese are the reasons we are trying to balance the budget in the first \nplace.\n\n\n                 Background of Overall Technology Cuts\n\n  In a recent talk to directors of Federal laboratories, the House \nSpeaker listed three priorities for his view of our technology future: \nWe should be on the cutting edge of defense and knowledge, We should \nsystematically bring science to Government, and we should maximize the \nspeed by which we move from science to product. He is right about this \nagenda. Even though it is singled out in this bill for elimination, \nCommerce's Advanced Technology Programs [ATP] fits the Speaker's agenda \nperfectly. This cut comes against a background of deep R Program cuts \nthis year. The American Association for the Advancement of Science \nestimates that Congress' current course will cut Federal R by 30 \npercent.\n  Three recent comprehensive technology reports explain the need for \nGovernment involvement in technology investment such as the ATP \nprogram. An October National Institute of Science and Technology \nplanning report in October entitled, ``Technology and Economic Growth: \nImplications for Federal Policy,'' points out that ``technology is the \nsingle most important determining factor of long-term econmic growth''; \nit demonstrates why Government investment in science and technology \nprograms leverage similar investments in the private sector.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers has just released a report entitled, \n``Supporting Research and Development to Promote Economic Growth: The \nFederal Government's Role,'' and it tells us just how damaging cuts in \nR will be. In November, the administration released a white paper on \ntechnology and economic growth that underscores this point. It reviews \nthe role that Government has played on a bipartisan basis in supporting \ninnovative technologies that create high-wage job markets, to provide \nour citizens with higher standards of living and to maintain U.S. \nleadership in the global economy.\n  The CEA report points out that U.S. Government support in research \nand development has yielded a rich history of innovation, from Samuel \nMorse's original telegraph line in 1842, to discovery of DNA and the \ncreation of Internet. Investments in research and development have high \nrates of economic return for the Government--a stunning 50 percent \nsocial return and a 20 to 30 percent private rate of return.\n  The effect of Government technology investment on the American people \nis clearly illustrated in the aerospace industry. Even as recently as \nthe late 1980's, Federal investments were as high as 80 percent of the \ntotal for aerospace research and development. Today, this industry is a \ncritical U.S. economic sector, employing many thousands of Americans, \nand exporting billions of dollars worth of American-made products. \nAerospace R investments have brought a huge rate of return for the \ntaxpayer. This sector illustrates that investing in innovative \ntechnologies has been a keystone to the Nation's economic growth.\n  Until now, Presidential and Congressional support for Government \ninvestment in R has been bipartisan. In 1960, President Eisenhower \nannounced in his State of the Union Message,\n\n       We now stand in the vestibule of a vast new technological \n     age--one that, despite its capacity for human destruction, \n     has an equal capacity to make poverty and human misery \n     obsolete. If our efforts are wisely directed--and if our \n     unremitting efforts for dependable peace begin to attain some \n     success--we can surely become participants in creating an age \n     characterized by justice and rising levels of human well-\n     being.\n\n  President Eisenhower understood science and technology and its \nrelationship to Government. He supported a great expansion of R \ninvestment including the growth of the research university and the \ncreation of ARPA, the great Defense Department R innovator. In 1961, \nEisenhower noted that:\n       The free university, historically the fountainhead of free \n     ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution \n     in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs \n     involved, a Government contract becomes virtually a \n     substitute for intellectual curiosity.\n\n  In other words, the old stereotype of the brilliant tinkerer, \nlaboring away in his basement, making a great technological \nbreakthrough with no help from the outside world is an engaging, but \nout-of-date image today. Individual inventors, or even private \nbusinesses acting on their own, do not have the resources necessary to \nkeep America at the forefront of technological innovation.\n  I am concerned, however, that the majority in Congress this year is \nnow reversing their historic course and now plans to sacrifice the \ntechology investment that made the United States a global economic \nleader. I admire the goal of balancing the budget in 7 years, and I \nhave supported legislation to reach that goal. But I do not support \nsome of the means; including this conference report, that the majority \nhas chosen to reach that end. Cutting technology investment is akin to \nthrowing the lifeboats overboard to reduce the ballast of a rapidly \nsinking ship. Cut technology funding, and you cut the heart out of our \nefforts to promote economic growth, trade, job creation. Yet that is \nwhat the majority's budget will do by slashing research and development \nfunding by one-third by the year 2002, at a time when other \nindustrialized countries--our competitors--are increasing their \ntechnology budgets. \n\n[[Page S 18169]]\n\n\n  Some like to say that Government should run more like a private \nbusiness. Well, imagine you are the head of AT, and you see MCI \npouring millions into R Do you say, ``Great. Let us cut our R \nbudget, and that will improve our bottom line?'' If you did that, the \nboard of directors would have your head.\n  The Japanese Government, one of our chief competitors, intends to \ndouble its technology investment in the coming years. And we are going \nto respond to that challenge by cutting our technology investment? I \nfear that these discrepancies in investing trends will do real harm to \nU.S. exports and to our economy as a whole. According to the Office of \nTechnology Policy, the American high-technology trade balance, after \nbeing a key factor for years in U.S. economic growth, is now \ndeteriorating rapidly, with an abrupt shift from a surplus of $26.6 \nbillion in 1991 to a deficit of $4.3 billion in 1994. With severe \nbudget cuts in technology and a diminishing trade performance, America \nwill loose its footing on the high-technology global market ladder.\n  In his book, ``Blindside: Why Japan Is Still on Track to Overtake the \nU.S. by the Year 2000,'' Eamonn Singleton lists technologies that have \nbeen commercialized and are the chokepoints that Japanese industries \nnow control in the electronics industry: flat panel displays, compact \ndisc players and CD-ROM drives, notebook computers, semiconductor \nmaterials and equipment, cellular phones and pagers, fax machines and \nlaser printers. A Japanese technology expert notes that the ``silicon \nrevolution promises as big a transformation in the world economy as all \nof the other technologies developed since the 18th century put \ntogether.'' These are all technologies where the initial advances \noriginated in the United States. Outside of the electronics field, \nJapan's technology advantage has enabled it to take a lead in a long \nseries of economic sectors including auto parts, auto industry \nmanufacturing machinery, molds and dyes, cameras, medical and \nscientific instruments, musical instruments, and construction \nequipment. This is not the moment to cut back on U.S. R\n  The Council of Economic Advisers report reveals that the United \nStates has fallen behind Japan and Germany in its cumulative nondefense \nresearch expenditures as a percentage of GDP for the past 20 years. \nMore serious, the CEA study shows that the United States by the end of \nthe decade will also be behind Japan in actual annual funding spent on \nnondefense R This is a dangerous development in an area where the \nUnited States has long relied on a comparative economic advantage. \nThough we are leaders in telecommunications, semiconductors, and \ncomputers now, we well may soon stand behind other industrial countries \nif they continue to put their money where the jobs are and if we begin \nto pull our money back.\n  Historically, the private sector moves in the same direction as the \nGovernment sector with regard to R investments. Trends in Federal \nresearch and development support cycles correlate closely with private \nR as Federal investment expands, the private sector responds with a \nsubsequent increase in R spending. So the Federal investments \nleverage private sector investments. The CEA study warns, therefore, \nthat the upcoming cut in Federal R will likely lead to corresponding \nreductions in private sector R\n  The administration's white paper on R investments points out that \n``the Republican budget puts American technological and economic \nleadership at grave risk'' and ``this is exactly the wrong time to cut \ninvestment in R'' The white paper argues that we must protect key \ninvestments in research, education and technology while balancing the \nbudget.\n\n\n                                  ATP\n\n  In 1991, Alan Bromley, the science adviser during the Bush \nadministration, developed a list of critical long-term, high-risk \ntechnologies which should receive Government and industry attention and \nsupport. From these initial ideas, ATP was established to provide a \ncost-sharing mechanism to support new, world-class products, services \nand industrial processes projects valuable to Government users, that \nwould also stimulate U.S. economic growth. These industry-government \npartnerships evolve from industry-proposed ideas for viable new, \ninnovative technologies which are managed by industry, involve \nsignificant university participation and are cost shared with NIST. ATP \nequals industry-driven, fair competition, partnership, and evaluation. \nATP does not fund product development initiatives. Tax credits are not \na substitute for the ATP. Without government cooperation, these types \nof precompetitive projects would otherwise be ignored or developed too \nslowly to effectively compete in the global environment.\n  ATP programs have already begun to establish niches in the \nmarketplace creating new jobs for Americans, including the small- to \nmedium-sized business sectors. For example, in my State of Connecticut, \nCuraGen Corp. has received two 3-year, ATP awards in 1994 for unique \nideas that are designed to combat serious illness as well as to \ndiagnose and prevent disease. Edward Rothberg, the chair of the board \nof Laticrete International, Inc.: wrote to me saying that\n\n       The greatest benefit of this (ATP) program is the \n     development by CuraGen . . . to provide the means to attack \n     and eventually cure serious illnesses that result in a high \n     number of deaths from cancer, and hundreds of billions of \n     dollars spent for drugs to control illness. A few million \n     invested in research to prevent illnesses will save a \n     hundredfold the investment in drugs that only maintain, \n     but do not cure them.\n\n  According to Gregory Went, the vice president of CuraGen, these two \nawards have ``created over 19 new jobs during 1995 directly related to \nthe ATP programs, with 15 in Connecticut, and will create scores of \nadditional jobs in Connecticut and the United States.'' Since the R \nwill provide a foundation for products that can be commercialized. He \nadds that companies like CuraGen would not be effective players in the \nglobal market competition without the support of ATP.\n  Edward Dohring, the president of Lithography Systems, Inc., in \nWilton, CT, wrote to me in support of ATP, emphasizing the merits of \nthe fair selection process which is entirely based on technical and \nbusiness merit. He adds:\n\n       Half of all ATP awards and joint ventures fo went to small \n     business directed partnerships * * * and quality proposals in \n     pursuit of ATP funds far outstrip the funds available. \n     Without ATP, the technological opportunities would be slowed, \n     or ultimately forfeited to foreign competitors more able to \n     make key investments in longer term, higher risk research, \n     such as is the focus of ATP.\n\n  ATP stimulates economic growth by developing high-risk innovations \nand by enabling technologies through proposed and cost shared by \nindustry. U.S. Government investment in research and development is in \nperil at a time when our competition is increasing its support. Cuts in \nR are bad news for America's future. Last month, the Congress \napproved conference reports that reduced both the Department of \nTransportation's research, development, and technology programs and the \nDepartment of Energy's alternative energy R programs by 30 percent \nfrom the President's budget request. The CEA report confirms that \nFederal investments in R have a significant impact on high-wage jobs \nand maintaining U.S. leadership in the global economy. Now is not the \ntime to drop out of the global R race and wander down a path toward \ntechnology bankruptcy. We need to protect our R investments, maintain \nour strong base and build upon our technology infrastructure so that \nAmerica will remain an economic world leader. Eliminating ATP, as this \nconference report proposes, is a grave error.\n\n\n                     Other Technology Program Cuts\n\n  This bill also contains large cuts in the National Information \nInfrastructure grants program which helps supply community services \nwith advanced communications equipment to promote better health care, \nlocal government efficiency, and education services. Funding for the \nGLOBE Program which promotes understanding of science and environmental \nscience in schools would be zeroed out in this bill. Commitments made \nto the joint projects of the United States-Israeli Science and \nTechnology Commission by Commerce's Technology Administration would \nalso be hampered by the reductions in this bill. Two other programs: \nthe Manufacturing Extension Program and the Economic Development \nAdministration Defense Conversion program will also be compromised if \nthis bill is passed. \n\n[[Page S 18170]]\n\n\n\n                        CUTS IN JUSTICE PROGRAMS\n\n  The conference report also undoes much of the good work we \naccomplished in passing the 1994 anticrime bill. It takes the COPS \nprogram--an extraordinarily successful program that has been putting \nthousands more police on the streets of our communities quickly and \nefficiently--and turns it into a smaller, State block grant program. \nThere are no guarantees under the conference report that States will \nuse those dollars to put more police on the streets. As I understand \nit, they have discretion to put these Federal dollars to use for \ngeneral law enforcement purposes. Experience tells us that fewer police \nwill be funded under such an approach. And every study tells us, and my \nconstituents certainly have let me know, that what we need to feel \nsafer and be safer in their communities is more police walking beats. I \nam strongly opposed to drastically altering this program, and \nparticularly doing so on an appropriations bill.\n\n\n                        CUTS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\n  The bill also does not adequately fund foreign affairs functions \nessential to American engagement in the world and pursuit of our \ninterests abroad. While the funding levels are higher than in the \noriginal bill, they remain inadequate, funding for State Department \noperations--American diplomacy and services for American citizens and \ncompanies around the world--is set below last year's levels. The \nPresident had requested an increase in order to keep necessary foreign \nposts open, replace antiquated computer equipment and maintain U.S. \nassets.\n  The funding levels for international organizations are grossly \ninsufficient to meet our obligations and our national interests. The \nUnited Nations, NATO, and other organizations carry out activities--\nfrom peacekeeping and nonproliferation to control of epidemic diseases \nand protection for human rights--which directly serve America's \nnational interests.\n  Many of these international organizations need management reforms \nsimilar to the reinventing Government exercise which Vice President \nGore is leading within the U.S. Government. But our diplomats cannot \neffectively pursue these reforms, and reduce the expenditures of these \norganizations, if the United States is not a responsible member. For \nsome functions, such as U.N. peacekeeping, U.S. arrearages have already \nimpeded sound management and cost-efficient procurement. The United \nStates must be a responsible member of the international community. We \nshould pay our debts. It does not make sense to build up arrearages to \nthe U.N. and other organizations which we will need to pay off in the \ncoming years as we move toward a balanced budget.\n  Public diplomacy programs are also severely underfunded in this bill. \nThe international broadcasting programs managed by USIA are critical \nfor U.S. leadership, since they reach people around the world living \nunder repressive governments or in emerging democracies. I was also \ndisappointed to see support for the National Endowment for Democracy \nreduced even modestly.\n  World leadership is a responsibility which is not free. But the \nfinancial cost for effective American diplomacy, formal and public, is \na reasonable price to pay for the continued U.S. leadership in the \nworld which is so important to the safety and prosperity of every \nAmerican.\n  I cannot support this Commerce, State, Justice conference report. It \nstrips funds needed to fight the war on crime, to develop the \ntechnology that will be a keystone to our economic future, and to \nundertake basic foreign policy tasks.\n\n\n   restricting the united states government growth of united states-\n                           vietnam relations\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one provision in the Commerce, Justice, \nState appropriations bill that I oppose is the language that prohibits \nthe Department of State from spending any funds to expand our \ndiplomatic relations with Vietnam until the President certifies that \nVietnam is fully cooperating with the United States in four areas \nrelating to POW/MIA's: First, resolving discrepancy cases, live \nsightings and field activities; second, recovering and repatriating \nAmerican remains; third, accelerating efforts to provide documents that \nwill help lead to the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIA's; and \nfourth, providing further assistance in implementing trilateral \ninvestigations with Laos.\n  I must say that I am somewhat dumbfounded as to why we would include \nthis provision. In fact, the President certified these four criteria \nthis past summer, when he made the decision to move forward on full \ndiplomatic relations with Vietnam.\n  I certainly understand that there are many who disagree with that \nmove, but the fact is that as President, he has the authority to \nconduct foreign affairs, and it is not appropriate for us to try to \nundercut him.\n  Shortly after the President moved forward with full diplomatic \nrelations, a vote was taken in the Senate on whether additional \nsanctions should be imposed against Vietnam. By an almost 2-to-1 \nmargin, the Senate voted that no, we should not implement any more \nsanctions on Vietnam. Let me repeat that. By nearly 2-to-1, we in the \nSenate said ``no more sanctions on Vietnam.''\n  The President made the right decision in moving forward with full \ndiplomatic relations. This provision would threaten those new relations \nwithout in any way helping to meet its goal of resolving MIA cases. \nMoving forward with relations and increasing bilateral contacts is the \nbest way of achieving that goal.\n  It appears almost certain that this bill is headed for a veto, which \nmeans we will have another opportunity to address this topic. I urge \nconferees to reconsider this provision and to eliminate this \nunnecessary and unhelpful encroachment on the President's power to \nconduct foreign policy.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the language \nincluded in this conference report which reprograms money to establish \na Border Patrol training facility at the Charleston Naval Base. This \nannouncement was made back in July of this Year after the Department of \nJustice completed a competitive evaluation of several active and former \nDepartment of Defense facilities. In August, Congress approved the \nreprogramming request that was sent by the Department of Justice for \nthis facility. During conference on this appropriations measure, the \ncommittee voted by an overwhelming majority of 11 to 1 to put the \nBorder Patrol training facility in Charleston.\n  It is expected that this facility will train up to 2,400 agents over \nthe next 3 years. Also, approximately 60 full-time instructors will be \nemployed to conduct the training. Mr. President, Charleston is an ideal \nlocation for this facility. It is only about 2 hours from Glynco, GA, \nwhere the Border Patrol has its main training facility, and the naval \nbase has readily available and convertible facilities to use for this \nproject. The facilities, climate, and friendly community make \nCharleston an ideal location for the Border Patrol School.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the conference report the Senate is \ncurrently considering does some weighty damage to the 1994 Violent \nCrime Prevention Act passed by a bipartisan Congress last year. It \nwould dismantle the Community Oriented Policing Services [COPS] \nProgram, block grant it, and combine it with the crime prevention block \ngrant into one big block grant. It would also cut funding for the \nresulting block grant. Along the way it destroys funding for child \nsafety centers. The bill does fully fund the Violence Against Women \nAct, also known as VAWA, and for that I am grateful.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin my statement by focusing on the \npositive, and by congratulating my colleagues for deciding to fully \nfund VAWA. The conference report restores the $76 million for VAWA that \nthe House would have cut. VAWA funds are of vital importance to this \nnation. VAWA funds training for police, prosecutors, and victims \nadvocates to target family violence and rape; programs to reduce sexual \nabuse and exploitation of young people; training for judges and \nprosecutors on victims of child abuse; training for State court judges \non rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence cases, and programs to \naddress domestic violence in rural areas.\n  Last year, $240 million was promised by Congress for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act [VAWA] programs for fiscal year 1996--$176.7 million \nfor VAWA \n\n[[Page S 18171]]\nprograms administered by the Department of Justice, and $61.9 million \nfor VAWA programs administered by the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  All of this is funded out of $4.2 billion provided by the Crime Trust \nFund in 1996. Funding in the Crime Trust Fund comes from eliminating \n123,000 Federal jobs and cutting domestic discretionary spending. Full \nfunding of the Violence Against Women Program has no effect on the \nbudget deficit and requires no new taxes. Now, I want my colleagues to \nclearly understand what this all means. Last year, we as a country \ndecided that addressing crime was a top priority. We decided that \nsavings from streamlining the Federal Government and cutting other \ndomestic programs would go to fight crime.\n  As a country we made a commitment to breaking the cycle of violence \nand see that a person's home is the safe place that it should be. As of \ntoday, we are still living up to that commitment, by supporting this \nprogram.\n  I must also commend my colleagues on the Appropriation Subcommittee \non Labor/HHS for their efforts and wisdom in fully funding the Violence \nAgainst Women Act program under their jurisdiction.\n  We must remember all the programs in the Violence Against Women Act \nare a package. Senator Biden and others worked for 5 years on this \npiece of legislation. All the pieces of it fit together. They all must \nbe in place for it to work effectively. For example, we can encourage \narrests by police officers but if they are not properly trained to \nunderstand the dynamics of domestic violence, an arrest could make the \nsituation more explosive. Likewise, if more batterers are being \narrested but judges are not trained to understand or take domestic \nviolence seriously, batterers are likely to go free or be charged with \nlesser offenses.\n\n  Violence Against Women Act programs deserve the funds we are giving \nthem. Anything less would have resulted in a betrayal of the bipartisan \npromise Congress made. Domestic violence must continue to be a priority \nfor national crime-fighting efforts.\n  We know all too well that violence in the home seeps out into our \nstreets. If we do not stop the violence in the home we will never stop \nit in the streets. We knew this when we passed the crime bill last year \nand it is still true today.\n  As I travel and meet more and more women and children who are victims \nof domestic violence, I become even more outraged that a woman's home \ncan be the most dangerous, violent, or deadly place she can be; if she \nis a mother, the same is true for her children. It was with the passage \nof the Violence Against Women Act that Congress said, loud and clear, \nit is time to stop the cycle of violence, it is time to make homes safe \nagain, and it is time to help communities across the country deal with \nthis crisis.\n  I thank my colleagues for protecting this program. I wish that the \nrest of the conference report reflected such concern on the part of my \ncolleagues for preventing crimes.\n  Unfortunately, the conferees have decided to block grant COPS and to \ncombine it with local community crime prevention block grants. There \nare may serious problems with this approach.\n  In passing the crime law last year, Congress authorized $75.9 million \nfor local community crime prevention block grants for fiscal year 1996, \nand $1.85 billion for COPS. Instead of fully funding both individual \nprograms, the conference report that is before us creates a single \nblock grant, combining both the COPS program and the prevention block \ngrants and funding the result, the local law enforcement block grant, \nat $1.9 billion, about $25 million less than the two programs would \nhave cost individually.\n  First of all, I believe that this block grant approach would open the \ndoor to funding anything under the sun that a governor determines is \nlaw enforcement or crime prevention. And it effectively could eliminate \nall crime prevention that was envisioned by the 1994 crime bill. For \nwhen law enforcement is pitted against crime prevention efforts, law \nenforcement always wins. The only specifically earmarked crime \nprevention money left is now the Violence Against Women Act. Out of an \nallocation for the Department of Justice of $14.5 billion dollars, only \n$175 million is directly targeted to the prevention of crimes.\n  This, I say to my colleagues, turns the clock back on the commitment \nwe made last year to help communities which are both fighting and \ntrying to prevent crime.\n\n  While I am on the subject of ignoring our commitments, in addition to \ngutting prevention programs, the conference report guts the very \ncenterpiece of the 1994 crime law--COPS, which provides money for \nhiring, over 5 years, 100,000 more police officers to patrol our \nNation's streets. To date, under this program, more than 25,000 police \nofficers have been hired--in Minnesota alone, 354 new cops have been \nfunded, and Minnesota has applied for 128 more. Importantly, each of \nthese officers were hired to be on the beat, not in the office.\n  At a time of very tight budgets, the money for both the COPS Program \nand the crime prevention block grant come from savings achieved by \nreducing the Federal bureaucracy. None of these new police officers or \ncrime prevention programs are adding an additional burden on the \ntaxpayer. We as a Congress, and indeed a country, made fighting crime a \ntop priority last year when we decided to use the savings from \nstreamlining the Federal Government and from cutting some domestic \nprograms for fighting crime.\n  The COPS Program is a good program. It is reaching and helping \ncommunities. It is very flexible. Local jurisdictions can work with the \nJustice Department to meet their particular needs. The Justice \nDepartment has acted swiftly, has minimized the paperwork, and has \nstaffed 800 numbers for immediate assistance. It is not surprising, \ntherefore, that approximately 200 Minnesota jurisdictions have \nparticipated in this program. What's more, Attorney General Janet Reno \nhas created a new effort at the Department of Justice to target some of \nthese new cops on the beat to help address domestic violence.\n  Having more cops involved in community policing fighting crime means \nless crime. It is as simple as that. In only a short time the COPS \nProgram is already delivering on its promise of providing more police \nofficers in a very cost effective, flexible manner. Not surprisingly \nthose on the frontline in the fight against crime have only praise for \nthis program. Police chiefs, sheriffs, deputies, and rank-and-file \npolice officers all support this effort to put more police in \ncommunities.\n  But now this very successful and popular crime-fighting program is \nunder attack by Republicans who have converted its funding into a block \ngrant. The conference report block grant plan does not stipulate that \nthe money must be spent on hiring cops. Instead, the money can be \nredirected to fund restaurant inspectors, parking meters, radar guns--\nand any other of a host of things.\n  The money ought to be spent the way it was intended and the way law \nenforcement officials want it spent: to hire police officers. The \nNation's major police enforcement organizations all agree on this \npoint.\n  We all know that crime is one of the great plagues of our \ncommunities. People in the suburbs and people living downtown are \nafraid--they are afraid to go out at night, they are afraid to venture \ninto the skyways, they are afraid to leave their cars parked on the \nstreet. We also all know that having a larger police presence helps \ndeter the very crimes that people fear the most. Buying more parking \nmeters, radar guns, or hiring more restaurant inspectors does not \naddress this plague nor address peoples' legitimate fears.\n\n  It is peculiar that the party that claims to be tough on law and \norder is proposing as one of their first steps to change a successful, \ncost-effective law and order program--one that ought to have broad, \nbipartisan support.\n  Crime prevention was also an essential element of the crime bill. \nDespite the fact that at each step of the way in passing the crime bill \nprevention programs got watered down, in the end we decided that crime \nprevention had to be part of that bill.\n  Two years ago, when Congress began consideration of the crime bill, \nwe started with a substantial portion of the crime bill addressing \nprevention; after all, prevention is crime control, stopping crime \nbefore it ever happens. \n\n[[Page S 18172]]\nIt, by the way, included something that I think is extremely \nimportant--supervised visitation centers. A model that I brought from \nMinnesota to help families with a history of violence, which I will \ndiscuss in a moment.\n  Ultimately, we ended up with a crime bill that included a block grant \nto the States for prevention programs--the local community crime \nprevention block grant. And, funding was not even authorized until \nfiscal year 1996. We haven't even given it a chance to work and get \ninto communities--the only provision in the crime bill other than VAWA \nthat was intended to prevent crime, one of the few provisions that was \nnot funded until next year.\n  The local crime prevention block grant, like the COPS program, was \nsupposed to provide a lot of flexibility to the States and communities. \nUnder this block grant communities could have determined what types--\nwithin a general list of about 14 different ideas--of prevention \nprograms to fund, and which prevention plans fit their community the \nbest. But this block grant was for prevention, nothing else. And, as I \nstated earlier, it had not even had a chance to be implemented. This \ncoming year would have been the first year funding would actually go to \nhelp communities.\n  But instead these 14 programs are now left to compete for funds with \npolice stations and mayors' offices and jail. The money will never make \nit to community prevention efforts.\n  If we were to listen to people in the communities that are most \naffected by the violence, they would tell us that money has to go to \nprevention. You have to put some resources toward making sure our young \npeople have opportunities. How interesting it is that those who would \nessentially eliminate these prevention programs do not come from those \ncommunities, do not know the people in those communities, and I do not \nthink asked the people in those communities at all what they think \nshould be done.\n  Mr. President, I can just tell you that in meeting with students, \nstudents that come from some pretty tough background--students at the \nWork Opportunity Center in Minneapolis, which is an alternative school, \nyoung students who are mothers and others who come from real difficult \ncircumstances, all of them said to me: You can build more prisons and \nyou can build more jails, but the issue for us is jobs, opportunity. \nYou will never stop this cycle of violence unless you do something that \nprevents it in the first place.\n\n  Then I turn to the judges, the sheriffs, and the police chiefs, and I \ncall them on the phone in Minnesota, and I ask them what they think. \nAnd they say yes we need community police and yes we need the other \nparts of the crime law, but they all say, if you do not do something \nabout preventing crime, if these young people do not have these \nopportunities, if we do not get serious about reducing violence in the \nhome, do not believe for a moment that we are going to stop the cycle \nof violence.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a highly trained police, highly \nmotivated, community-based, sensitive to the people in the communities, \ncan make a difference. They are wanted and they are needed. But the \nconference report we are considering today will do nothing to prevent \nthe criminal of tomorrow. And indeed without more cops on the beat it \nmay not do much to fight the criminals of today.\n  Every 5 seconds a child drops out of school in America. This is from \nthe Children's Defense Fund study. Every 5 seconds a child drops out of \na public school in the United States of America. Every 30 seconds a \nbaby is born into poverty. Every 2 minutes a baby is born with a low \nbirthweight. Every 2 minutes a baby is born to a mother who had no \nprenatal care.\n  Every 4 minutes a child is arrested for an alcohol-related crime. \nEvery 7 minutes a child is arrested for selling drugs. Every 2 hours a \nchild is murdered. Every 4 hours a child commits suicide, takes his or \nher life in the United States of America. And every 5 minutes a child \nis arrested for a violent crime.\n  Mr. President, if we do not continue to be serious about the \nprevention part, we are not going to stop the cycle of violence.\n  All too many young people are growing up in neighborhoods and \ncommunities in our country where if they bump into someone or look at \nsomeone the wrong way they are in trouble, where there is too much \nviolence in their homes, where violence pervades every aspect of their \nlife. And people who grow up in such brutal circumstances can become \nbrutal. And that should not surprise any of us.\n  Prevention and law enforcement--both essential elements of any crime \nfighting effort. These two should not have to compete with each other \nfor funding, nor should funding be cut for either.\n  Which brings me to the most painful part of my statement today. This \nnew block grant takes away funding for child safety centers. By \ndiscarding local community crime prevention block grants, which would \nhave provided funding for child safety centers specifically as one of \nits 14 prevention programs, the conference report discards this program \nas well.\n\n  Child safety centers were created by the Child Safety Act, which \nbecame law in 1994 as part of the crime bill. It authorized funds to \ncreate supervised visitation centers for families who have a history of \nviolence.\n  The prevalence of family violence in our society is staggering. \nStudies show that 25 percent of all violence occurs among people who \nare related. Data indicates that the incidence of violence in families \nescalates during separation and divorce. Many of these assaults occur \nin the context of visitation.\n  Supervised visitation centers would:\n  Provide supervised visitation for families where there has been \ndocumented sexual, physical, or emotional abuse.\n  Provide supervised visitation for families where there is suspected \nor elevated risk of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, or where \nthere have been threats of parental abduction of the child.\n  Provide a safe and neutral place for parents to visit with children \nwho have been put in foster care because of abuse and neglect.\n  Provide a safe location for custodial parents to temporarily transfer \ncustody of their children to non-custodial parents.\n  Serve as an additional safeguard against children witnessing abuse of \na parent or sustaining injury to themselves.\n  The Child Safety Act would have supported the establishment and \noperation of approximately 30 centers across the United States. The \nChild Safety Act requires grant recipients to submit an annual report \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the volume and type of \nservices provided at the supervised visitation center. Twenty percent \nof the grants made under the Child Safety Act would support the \nestablishment of special visitation centers created to study the \neffectiveness of supervised visitation on sexually and severely \nphysically abused children. These centers would be staffed with \nqualified clinicians and would have enhanced data collection \ncapabilities. From the reports submitted by grant recipients, the \nSecretary would prepare and submit a report to Congress on the \neffectiveness of supervised visitation centers.\n  Mr. President, because this program is unenumerated it doesn't stand \na chance in competition with other, established entities under the \nconference report's block grant. Mr. President, there is nothing that \nwill replace this program. There is no one who will step in and take \ncare of these children. There is no one who will try to make these \nfamilies whole. The communities trying desperately to repair themselves \nwill get no help from us.\n  Mr. President, for this and the other reasons I have discussed today, \nI have severe reservations regarding this conference report.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2076, the \nConference Report Making Appropriations for the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice and State. This bill would eliminate the Community \nOriented Policing Program [COPS] and replace it with a block grant \nprogram. By gutting a program that has proven effective in putting \npolice officers on the streets to interact with community residents, \nCongress is reneging on a promise that was made to the American people \nlast year to aggressively attack the epidemic of crime.\n  In August of last year, Congress passed the $30.2 billion Violent \nCrime \n\n[[Page S 18173]]\nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the largest, most \ncomprehensive piece of legislation in the history of this country. The \ncenterpiece of the crime bill is the Community Oriented Policing \nServices Grant Program [COPS], a six year, $8.8 billion crime fighting \nprogram designed to put 100,000 law enforcement officers on the \nstreets. I provided a jumpstart for the community policing initiative \nin the crime bill when I introduced a bill in March of 1993 that \nauthorized a major new expansion of community policing.\n  Mr. President, in 1 year, roughly 80 percent of the police \ndepartments in the country have been authorized to hire or redeploy \nalmost 26,000 officers for community policing. To date, Mr. President, \nover 300 New Jersey jurisdictions have received more than 670 \nadditional cops to walk the beat. Over the next 5 years, New Jersey can \nexpect to receive a total of about $250 million in community policing \ngrants to hire approximately 2,800 officers on the beat.\n  Mr. President, community policing involves establishing a close \nrelationship between community residents and the entire police \ndepartment. This enhanced relationship will result in better law \nenforcement by putting more cops on the beat to stop trouble before it \nturns into violent crime. Community policing also will improve the \noverall quality of life of community residents by involving all police \npersonnel in community activities.\n  In my talks with the citizens and law enforcement officers in New \nJersey, I have been told that the Community Policing Program is \nimproving the quality of life by making neighborhoods and communities \nsafer. For example, in Woodbury, NJ, Chief Carl Kinkler has reported \nthat the one police officer hired under the COPS Program has made a \ntremendous difference in the quality of life in the city. The hiring of \nthe officer has allowed the department to deploy two officers to patrol \na problematic community where open air drug dealing has been prevalent. \nDuring the last 3 months, 11 major drug arrests have taken place and \nopen air drug dealing has declined by 90 percent. According to Chief \nKinkler, deploying cops on the beat has allowed the city of Woodbury to \nallow the residents of this community to take control of their \nneighborhood.\n  In Newark, NJ, the community policing program has been enormously \nsuccessful. Officers patrol neighborhoods on foot, and in those areas \nrequiring acute attention, Neighborhood Stabilization Units have been \nset up. These units are literally mobile police stations, in which \npolice officers in a specially equipped van drive into an area and set \nup a police station in the community.\n  In addition to solving and deterring crime, Newark police indicate \nthat officers on the beat have been instrumental in dealing with \nquality of life issues. The officers solicit from citizens problems \nthat merit attention, such as prostitution, illegal dumping, and loud \nmusic which creates a public nuisance. The officers then solve the \ncommunity problems. The cops on the beat also handle citizen concerns \nthat traditionally fall outside the realm of police activity, such as \nrepairing streets, towing abandoned cars, and razing abandoned \nbuildings. The police department reports that community policing has \nhave a significant impact on providing citizens with safer communities \nand an enhanced confidence in the police force.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides that the block grant funding \ncan be used for basic law enforcement functions, which can include \nprison guards, meter maids, file cabinets and parking meters. There is \nno guarantee that one police officer will be hired to stand with \ncommunity residents to fight crime. I am reminded that when Congress \ndebated the crime bill, critics of community policing argued that it \nwas impossible to put 20,000 police officers on the streets over the \nlife of the crime bill. However, in approximately one year, almost \n26,000 cops have been deployed to walk the beat and rid communities of \ncrime. Mr. President, a year ago a promise was made to put 100,000 \npolice officers on the streets within 6 years. We are well on the way \nto fulfilling this promise. However, if Congress kills the community \npolicing program--a program that has proven hugely effective in \ncombatting crime--the guarantee that Congress will make to the American \npeople is that their security is no longer a priority issue.\n  Mr. President, Congress has had past experience with block grants in \nthe Law Enforcement Assistance Administration Program. I would like to \nremind my colleagues that this program had to be terminated because of \nwaste. We should not make the same mistake today by eliminating a \nhighly successful program that to date has funnelled Federal money \ndirectly to approximately 80 percent of police departments around the \ncountry to enable those departments to deploy officers on the beat to \nform a partnership with community residents to fight crime.\n  Mr. President, the community policing program has been immensely \nsuccessful and is supported by the law enforcement community, including \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the National Organization \nof Black Law Enforcement Executives, the National Troopers Coalition, \nthe Police Executive Research Forum and the Police Foundation. In \naddition, 65 percent of the American people support funding for more \npolice officers. I urge my colleagues to stand with the American people \nin opposition to this bill and preserve the community policing program.\n\n\n                   gender bias studies in the courts\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the \nremaining barriers to equal justice in our State and Federal judicial \nproceedings--bias by judges and court personnel, and in particular, \ngender bias. I, and my colleagues from Massachusetts and Delaware, \nSenators Kennedy  and Biden, strongly believe that funds appropriated \nfor the Federal judiciary, as set out in title III of the fiscal year \n1996 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations conference report, should be \nused to study bias in the courts, if any, and to educate judges and \ncourt personnel about this barrier to equal justice in the courts.\n  As enacted, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision--the \nEqual Justice for Women in the Courts Act--that authorizes and \nencourages each of the Federal judicial circuits to conduct studies of \nthe instances, if any, of gender bias in the courts and to implement \nappropriate reforms. These studies were intended to examine the effects \nof any differential gender-based treatment in areas such as the \ntreatment of litigants, witnesses, attorneys, jurors, and judges, the \nservices and facilities available to victims of violent crime and \nthe selection, retention, promotion, and treatment of employees.\n\n  In addition to authorizing the circuit studies, the act also requires \nthe Administrative Office of the United States to act as a \nclearinghouse to disseminate any reports and materials issued by these \ngender fairness task forces. The act also requests the Federal Judicial \nCenter to include in its educational programs, such as training \nprograms for new judges, information related to gender bias in the \ncourts.\n  These circuit-by-circuit studies were included in the act after the \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously accepted an amendment that I had \noffered. In passing the Violence Against Women Act, Congress recognized \nthe need for research of this kind and the importance of disseminating \nthe results of such research throughout the judicial system.\n  The importance of these studies extends well beyond their actual \nresults. For example, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which I authored \nand which President Bush signed into law in 1990, requires the Justice \nDepartment to collect data on crimes based on race, religion, \nethnicity, and sexual orientation. Oversight hearings on the \nimplementation of that act demonstrated that one of its many benefits \nwas to dramatically increase the awareness and sensitivity of the \npolice about hate crimes. In this case, requiring circuit courts to \nstudy gender bias would have the same beneficial effect of increasing \nthe awareness and sensitivity of judges and court personnel about \ngender bias.\n  While some of my colleagues may disagree, I strongly hope that, as \nauthorized by Congress, the Federal judiciary will issue the reasonable \nfunds appropriated under this act to fulfill \n\n[[Page S 18174]]\nthe purposes of the Equal Justice for Women in the Courts Act and \nachieve the ultimate goal of our Federal judicial system--equal justice \nfor all.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his remarks, with \nwhich I fully agree. There should be no disagreement on the need to \ntake steps to identify and eliminate any gender- or race-related bias \nin our judicial system. We must not tolerate any barriers to equal \njustice in our State and Federal judicial proceedings. More than 40 \nState and Federal court systems have conducted studies of gender bias \nin their courts. In part in reaction to some of the State court \nstudies, the 1990 report of the Federal Courts Study Committee \nsupported educational programs on bias for judges and court personnel. \nThe Study Committee found that many task force studies at the State \nlevel revealed the presence of gender bias in State judicial \nproceedings. The 1990 report concluded, ``[w]e believe education is the \nbest means of sensitizing judges and supporting personnel to their own \npossible inappropriate conduct and to the importance of curbing such \nbias when shown by attorneys, parties, and witnesses.''\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States has endorsed the need \nfor gender bias studies three times. In 1992, the conference adopted a \nresolution noting that ``bias, in all its forms, presents a danger to \nthe effective administration of justice in Federal courts'' and \nencouraging each Federal circuit not already doing so to ``sponsor \neducation programs for judges, supporting personnel and attorneys to \nsensitize them to concerns of bias based on race, ethnicity, gender, \nage, and disability, and the extent to which bias may affect litigants, \nwitnesses, attorneys, and all those who work in the judicial branch.'' \nIn 1993, the conference's ``Resolution on the Violence Against Women \nAct,'' endorsed the gender bias studies provision as having great \nmerit. And earlier this year, the conference approved a report of its \nCourt Management Committee that encouraged the study of gender and race \nbias by the Circuit Judicial Councils.\n  When we passed the Violence Against Women Act last year, we \nencouraged such studies, a policy that remains in force unless it is \nrepealed or altered by a subsequent statute. But even without our \nencouragement, the judiciary retains inherent authority to investigate \nbias in the courts. It strikes me as an inappropriate intrusion into \nthe internal affairs of a coequal branch of government for Congress to \nprohibit such studies.\n  As the national debate on the O.J. Simpson trial made clear, many \nminorities are skeptical that they will be treated fairly in the \njustice system. Many women harbor similar doubts. The bias task forces \nare one way through which the judiciary can address legitimate \nproblems. The judicial branch, independent of the Violence Against \nWomen Act, is obligated to ensure the fair administration of justice, \nand investigations of bias in the courts are consistent with that \nimportant goal.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I wish to thank the Senators from Illinois and \nMassachusetts for their remarks on this important subject. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act is the first comprehensive measure aimed at making \nour Nation's streets, college and university campuses, and homes safer \nfor women. Following extensive hearings, the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously approved the act, and Congress passed this landmark \nlegislation.\n  Subtitle D of the act, entitled ``Equal Justice for Women in the \nCourts,'' was an important part of that legislation. As described by my \ncolleagues, this provision encourages the circuit judicial conferences \nto conduct studies of gender bias within their respective circuits and \nto disseminate their results.\n  By enacting this provision, Congress intended to promote a greater \nunderstanding of the nature and extent of gender bias, to educate \njudges, and, ultimately, to reduce any bias. The Equal Justice for \nWomen in the Courts Act takes us one step closer to achieving and \nmaintaining equal justice under the law. It is an important part of an \noverall effort to ensure meaningful protection of the rights of those \nwho were victimized by sex crimes, domestic violence, and crimes of \nviolence motivated by gender.\n\n  A majority of the Federal circuits have already established gender \nbias task forces. Some circuits have expanded the mission of the task \nforces to include the study of racial and ethnic bias issues as well. I \nstrongly believe that these studies and related education and training \nprograms are critical to understanding whether there is any disparate \ntreatment in the courts and, if so, what steps the courts should take \nto address it.\n  Task forces on gender, racial and ethnic issues have been endorsed \nby, among others, the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and \nRemoval, the Long Range Planning Committee of the Federal Courts and, \nas noted by my colleagues, the Federal Courts Study Committee and the \nJudicial Conference of the United States.\n  As ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and as the author of \nthe Violence Against Women Act and the 1994 crime bill, I wish to join \nmy colleagues in expressing my strong intent, that the Federal \njudiciary is authorized to use funds appropriated for violent crime \nreduction programs, as set out in title III of fiscal year 1996 \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations conference report, to study \ngender bias and other related barriers to equal justice in our courts.\n  Mr. KERREY. I concur with distinguished Senators' analysis of the \nstatus of funding for the bias studies and with their beliefs about the \nimportance of these studies. When we encouraged the judicial circuits \nto conduct gender bias studies, Congress acknowledged the importance \nand tradition of judicial self-examination on issues--such as this--\nthat are critical to the administration of justice.\n  The Judicial Council of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth \nCircuit, which includes the State of Nebraska, voted unanimously to \nconduct a bias study. The council's vote does not reflect any doubt \nabout the talent or integrity of any judge on that court, but rather \nreflects their commitment to the identification and elimination of bias \nwhere it exists, and their recognition of the importance of that task \nto preserving the integrity of our judicial system.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce Justice, \nState and Judiciary, I fully support the use of Federal funds for the \ncontinuation of this effort to improve the justice system in the eighth \ncircuit and other Federal circuits.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I wish to join my colleagues in their support for the \ncontinuation of the work of the Federal judiciary in studying the \nexistence, if any, of gender bias in the courts.\n  I am proud to say that in 1982, the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of New Jersey established the Nation's first task force on gender \nin the courts. Now, the majority of States have commissioned gender \ntask forces and issued reports of their findings. In general, these \nstudies have identified some problems in the State courts and \nidentified steps that can be taken by the bench and bar to improve the \nfair treatment of attorneys, litigants, and employees.\n\n  No one should question the importance of ensuring that our Federal \ncourts truly function as fair, neutral adjudicators. Toward that end, \nthe Federal courts should be commended for taking the steps to identify \nand, where it exists, to eradicate, gender bias in decisionmaking, \nemployment, and the treatment of individuals. The work of these gender \nfairness task forces may not always be popular. The work may not always \nbe comfortable for some. But in the end, their work will help ensure \nthat the courts are, and are perceived to be, fair to all litigants.\n  I agree with Senators Simon, Kennedy, Biden, and Kerrey that the \nFederal judiciary is fully authorized under the Violence Against Women \nAct to conduct these important studies and that the allocation to the \njudiciary under this appropriations bill may be used for that purpose.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was proud to be a coauthor of Violence Against Women \nAct when I served in the House and I am pleased now to join my \ncolleagues in stating my strong support for the important work of the \ngender task forces authorized under VAWA. I fully agree that the courts \nare authorized to continue this work using funds provided in this \nappropriations bill.\n  The ninth circuit was the first Federal circuit to form a task force \nto \n\n[[Page S 18175]]\nstudy the effects of gender in the judicial system. The work of the \ntask force was initiated before Congress encouraged such studies. The \nninth circuit report was issued in July 1993 and it concluded in part \nthat ``[a]lthough the judiciary aspires to a system of justice in which \nthe gender of participants is of no import, the results [of the study] \ndocument that in the current world, gender counts.'' Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor called the ninth circuit report a \ncomprehensive, well-supported report.\n  The majority of Federal circuits have already created task forces to \nstudy the effects of gender in the courts. Their work should not be \ndiscouraged in any way now.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As a member of the Appropriations Committee \nSubcommittee on Commerce, State, Justice, and Judiciary, I wish to \nexpress my support for the work of the task forces on gender and racial \nbias in the courts. I concur with my colleagues as to the importance of \nthe task forces and I join my colleague, Senator Bradley, in noting \nthat New Jersey has been a leader in the effort to ensure gender and \nracial fairness in the courts.\n\n  I firmly believe that funding for this important work is provided for \nin this appropriations bill and I join my colleagues in encouraging the \njudiciary to continue this work.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my colleagues for their insightful remarks on this \nimportant topic. I believe what we are really talking about here is \nmaintaining the ability of the judiciary to address issues of \nparticular importance to that branch of government. And bias is \ncertainly such a topic. The judiciary is in the best position to \ndetermine whether this topic merits study or educational activities. \nAnd I believe the judiciary should be given the flexibility to do so.\n  The Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit, which includes my home \nState of Ohio, felt strongly enough about this issue that it has \napproved the formation of a task force on gender fairness and a task \nforce on racial and ethnic fairness.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I join my colleagues to express my support for the \nefforts of the task forces on gender bias in the Federal courts.\n  Six of the seven States in the eighth circuit have conducted gender \nand/or racial bias studies. When bias was documented, these State task \nforces recommended improvements designed to assure the fair \nadministration of justice for men and women in the courts.\n  In 1994, Chief Judge Richard Arnold of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Eighth Circuit appointed a 30-member gender fairness task force on \ngender bias. The group includes 12 Federal judges from each of the 7 \nStates in the circuit as well as court administrators, attorneys, and \nlaw professors. These distinguished task force members are committed to \na careful, responsible survey of the court to determine whether gender \nbias exists there. Congress has unequivocally authorized this work and \nI strongly believe that the Federal judiciary should continue this \neffort.\n\n\n                      Community Relations Service\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nspeak on the conference agreement regarding the structure of and \nfunding for the Community Relations Service.\n  The appropriations level for the Conflict Resolution Program of the \nCommunity Relations Service [CRS] of the U.S. Department of Justice in \nthis bill--$5.3 million--would have a catastrophic impact on the \nagency's conflict resolution mandate.\n  CRS is vital to this Nation's ability to continue to make progress in \nimproving race relations. The important work of CRS is essential to \npreventing and resolving the day-to-day racial conflicts in the \ncommunities we represent. Without an effective CRS, racial tensions and \nconflicts will disrupt the economy and tear at the social fabric of the \nhometowns across Florida and elsewhere.\n  Over the past 3 years CRS has shifted resources from headquarters \nadministration to field conciliation, leaving CRS with no buffer of \nadministrative staff. Due to a series of budget reductions over the \nyears, the CRS conflict resolution budget is almost all salaries and \nexpenses at this point.\n  Because this program does not operate large scale grant, contract, \ntraining, or other operations that could offset the impact on \npersonnel, this funding reduction will lead to the necessity to lay off \nalmost 65 percent of the conflict resolution staff.\n  At this funding level, CRS would only be able to staff its 15 offices \naround the country with 2 or 3 conciliators in each office. Florida's \nregional office is in Atlanta and covers 7 other states in the region. \nWith these drastic cuts, these people cannot begin to provide the \nracial conflict resolution services that Florida needs.\n  And even with this modest staffing level of 2 to 3 conciliators in \nmost offices, the ability of the agency to sustain independent \nadministrative and management operations would be seriously undermined.\n  We must recognize what this loss of service will mean to the people \nof this country. Without the full funding of $10.6 million CRS, the \ncountry will be without a vital service that no one other than CRS can \nprovide.\n  Further, I am opposed to the transfer of the Cuban-Haitian \nResettlement Program from the Community Relations Service to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. INS is, in large part, an \nenforcement agency whose mission is not that of administering \nresettlement activities such as the Cuban-Haitian program. I am also \nconcerned that the Cuban-Haitian program would be lost in such a large \norganization as INS which has scores of priorities.\n  At CRS, the Cuban-Haitian program is one of two missions that \ncomplement each other successfully: conflict resolution and Cuban/\nHaitian resettlement. The Cuban-Haitian Program has been successfully \nadministered by CRS for 15 years. CRS has successfully implemented the \noutplacement operations of Cubans and Haitians from Guantanamo and the \nresettlement programs for unaccompanied alien minors. The resettlement \nprogram has been indispensable to our Defense Department's Atlantic \nCommand in managing the Cuban-Haitian programs at Guantanamo and in \nPanama. CRS has helped to resettle over 17,000 migrants as part of \nDoD's Operation Sea Signal.\n  The conflict resolution program works hand in hand with communities \nthroughout the country to gain receptivity to the influx of refugees \nand entrants under the Cuban/Haitian program and has smoothed the way \nfor an orderly resettlement process. CRS resettlement efforts directly \nsupport local communities by reducing and preventing strain on local \npublic services and preventing potential community tensions.\n  Both missions of CRS, Cuban-Haitian resettlement and the Conflict \nResolution Program should remain as a separate division within the \nDepartment of Justice. Should the Senate have another opportunity to \nconsider the Commerce, Justice bill, I would encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the CRS language in the Senate-passed bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, when the Commerce/Justice/State \nappropriations bill was before the Senate I noted that it included an \namendment of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. That \namendment is in this conference report. Since a veto of this measure is \nlikely, this is not the right time to pursue my objection to this \namendment. But, it is my purpose now to give notice that I will \ncontinue--at the appropriate time--to oppose this and any other attempt \nto weaken the Motor-Voter Act.\n  The provision that I object to would change the exemption provision \nof the Motor-Voter Act. That exemption was drafted--at the specific \ninsistence of Republicans--so as to exempt only those States that had \nalready, as of March 11, 1993, enacted election day registration or had \nno registration requirement. The amendment in this conference report \nwould change the date to extend the exemption to include two more \nStates, New Hampshire and Idaho.\n  The Motor-Voter amendment included in this report violates the \npurpose of the exemption provision. That purpose was clearly stated by \nthe Republican floor manager of the Motor-Voter bill. His statement \nregarding the exemption is clear and unambiguous, so I will repeat it \nhere.\n\n       Republicans slammed the escape-hatch shut. No longer is \n     this bill a backdoor means of forcing states into adopting \n     election day \n\n[[Page S 18176]]\n     registration or no registration whatsoever. * * * Republicans succeeded \n     in grand fathering in the five States that would have \n     qualified for the exemption prior to March 11, 1993.\n\n  With regard to requests from other states--Michigan, Illinois, and \nSouth Dakota--urging that the exemption not include such a deadline, \nthe Republican floor manager said ``their constituents are better \nserved by the closing of the escape hatch than if it had been left \nopen.''\n  It should be clear from the foregoing that this is not merely an \ninsignificant or technical amendment. Its purpose is contrary to the \nintent of the exemption provision of the Motor-Voter law. Its \nunderlying intent is obvious and should be addressed directly. This is \nanother attack on the implementation of the Motor-Voter law. It is also \na thinly veiled attempt to curry favor of New Hampshire election \nofficials shortly before that all-important first Presidential primary.\n  I made a more detailed statement of my reasons for opposing this \namendment when this measure was first under consideration. Rather than \nrepeat them now, I will conclude by reiterating that I will continue to \noppose--at the appropriate time--this and any other attempt to weaken \nthe National Voter Registration Act.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport appropriating funds for the Departments of Commerce, State and \nJustice for fiscal year l996. The funding levels contained in this \nreport are no better than those contained in its predecessor that the \nPresident vetoed. I have expressed earlier my extremely serious \nreservations about the provisions relating to the Justice Department \nand the elimination of the Cops on the Beat Program that I and many of \nus worked so hard to enact.\n  I now would like to focus my comments briefly on those provisions of \nthe conference report that deal a serious blow to the Commerce \nDepartment's technology programs as well as to the provisions relating \nto Vietnam. Many of the Commerce Department technology programs, like \nthe Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension \nProgram, have played a pivotal role in the start-up of high-technology \nand biotech businesses and the growth of jobs in these sectors in my \nState of Massachusetts.\n  The conference report completely zeros-out funding for any new \nprojects that would have been supported by the Advanced Technology \nProgram, or ATP. The ATP had been funded at a level of $323 million in \nfiscal year l995, and the President had requested more than $490 \nmillion for this program in fiscal l996. Companies that had applied for \nnew project funding to bring enabling technologies to the point of \ncommercialization will be denied funds under this bill. This will hurt \na number of firms in my State, including Dynamet Technology of \nBurlington which is developing surgical implant components, Gensym \nCorp. of Cambridge which is developing variable air conditioning \nsystems and the Lorron Corp. of Burlington that is working to upgrade \nfire protection modeling codes. I had hoped the Senate figure of more \nthan $100 million would prevail. Instead, the elimination of funding \nfor this program will deal a severe set-back to many start-up and other \nhigh-technology firms in my State.\n  The conference report preserves $80 million in funding for the \nManufacturing Extension Program [MEP]. Through the University of \nMassachusetts at Amherst and Bay State Skills, MEP has provided \nvaluable, hands-on technical and management consulting on manufacturing \nprocesses for small and mid-sized businesses. MEP estimates that every \ndollar of its support generates $15 in economic growth for the local \ncommunity. The funding cut contained in this report will hurt companies \nlike Alpha Industries of Woburn, whose 600 employees are successfully \nmaking the transition from manufacturing semiconductors for the Defense \nDepartment to a commercial product operation.\n  Among many other programs in my State that will be hurt as a result \nof funding reductions or terminations in the conference report are the \nMassachusetts Biotechnology Research Institute, which has leveraged \nventure capital funds for new biotechnology companies in and around \nWorcester, and the textile center at the University of Massachusetts at \nDartmouth, which had hoped to become the first university outside the \nSoutheastern United States to participate in the National Textile \nUniversity Centers. Cutbacks in the National Telecommunications and \nInfrastructure Assistance Program will hurt groups in my State that are \nseeking to get on the information superhighway. Among them are the \nExecutive Office of Education in Boston that is developing a statewide, \nintegrated, interactive voice and data network, called the \nMassachusetts Information Infrastructure. This network will begin by \nconnecting 20 of an estimated 352 sites at libraries of K-12 schools \nand higher education institutions, local government and health and \ncommunity organizations throughout Massachusetts. More than 80 other \nentities in my State have sought assistance from this program, but are \nnot likely to receive any help in the face of the proposed funding \ncuts.\n  I would now like to turn briefly to the State Department title of the \nbill that relates to Vietnam.\n  The conference report conditions the establishment of an embassy in \nVietnam on a certification by the President with respect to Vietnamese \ncooperation on providing POW/MIA information. As the former chairman of \nthe Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, I believe that no one \nhas worked harder or more conscientiously to ensure that our Nation and \nthe families of our POW/MIA's get answers to the fate of these heroes. \nBut I believe the way we secure continued and even enhanced assistance \nfrom the Vietnamese is by engagement.\n  I believe this provision could have the perverse effect of setting \nback our efforts. This amendment, offered by the House in conference, \nis really a thinly disguised effort to undermine the administration's \ndecision to normalize relations with Vietnam, and it is contrary to the \nSenate's position opposing direct linkage of the POW/MIA issue and the \nprocess of normalizing relations with Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, being a strong supporter of the Cops on the Beat and \nother anticrime programs administered by the Justice Department, being \na staunch advocate for the international trade, technology, \nenvironmental and fisheries programs carried out by the Commerce \nDepartment and being a steadfast advocate for the resolution of \ninternational conflicts through diplomatic means, it pains me to have \nto oppose this conference report. But I must and I will, knowing that \nthe funding cuts and terminations will not sustain the programs we must \nhave to keep our streets and communities safe, to keep our economy \nvibrant and to promote job creation and to maintain our presence in and \nthe peace of this world.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report accompanying the fiscal year 1996 Commerce, Justice, \nState appropriations bill.\n  I am opposed to this conference report because it takes this country \nin the wrong direction. The conference report undermines our efforts to \nfight crime by abolishing the highly successful COPS Program and \nreplacing it with a block grant to the States. Under the COPS Program, \nMaryland has received funding for 440 new police officers throughout \nthe State devoted to community policing and keeping our streets safe. \nThis conference report would pull the rug out from under this program \nand jeopardize future funding for these officers.\n  In addition, this conference report makes draconian cuts to the \nCommerce Department that will harm America's ability to maintain its \ntechnological edge. The conference report contains a rescission of $75 \nmillion in construction funds for the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology [NIST]. These funds were going to be used to construct a \nnew advanced technology laboratory that would play a critical role in \nmaintaining America's technological supremacy.\n  Originally built between 25 and 40 years ago, the majority of NIST's \nfacilities are now technically and functionally obsolete, which makes \nit difficult if not impossible to support the requirements of advanced \nresearch and development projects. As a result, experiments are often \ndelayed or subject to costly rework, and scientists must often accept \nlevels of precision and accuracy below those needed by industry. \n\n[[Page S 18177]]\n\n  As the only Federal laboratory whose explicit mission is developing \nscientific standards and providing technical support for U.S. \nindustry's competitiveness objectives, NIST must have a modern \nscientific infrastructure--the laboratories, equipment, instrumentation \nand support--in order to maintain a viable scientific research program \nand to keep our Nation on the cutting edge of science and technology as \nwe move into the 21st century. This view was recently underscored by a \ngroup of 25 nobel laureates who called the laboratories ``a national \ntreasure,'' which ``carry out the basic research that is essential for \nadvanced technology.''\n  Under the conference report, the Commerce Department's Advanced \nTechnology Program receives no new funding for fiscal year 1996. The \nATP is another vital program for developing new technologies that lead \nto the creation of new jobs by supporting innovative research.\n  I believe this bill will not further America's long-term economic \ninterests nor the interests of my own State of Maryland. Furthermore, \nthe cuts to law enforcement will hurt our ability to fight crime in the \nstreets and make our neighborhoods safer.\n  So, I will oppose the approval of this conference report.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to address briefly a few \nprovisions in H.R. 2076, the fiscal year 1996 Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill, that relate to funding of the United Nations.\n  First, I want to compliment the fine work of the new subcommittee \nchairman, the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, for his great \nwork on this bill. As all of us know, our friend from New Hampshire had \nto assume command, so to speak, while this bill was in flight. And as \nall of us know, this is a very important and complicated piece of \nlegislation. The Senator from New Hampshire took command and has \nproduced a good bill that is worthy of our support.\n  One provision worth noting is that which would limit U.S. \ncontributions to the United Nations. Under the conference report, 20 \npercent of the funds appropriated for our regular budget assessed \ncontribution to the United Nations would be withheld until a \ncertification is made by the President to the Congress that the United \nNations has established an independent office of inspector general as \ndefined in section 401(b) of Public Law 103-236--the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act of 1994.\n  This withholding requirement should sound familiar to my colleagues. \nThe provision in the conference report extends a withholding \nrequirement I offered as an amendment to the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act during Senate consideration in 1994. The reason why I \ntook this step nearly two years ago was because of rampant waste, \nfraud, abuse, and outright thievery at the United Nations.\n  For years, I have identified specific examples of budgetary \nmismanagement and wasteful practices at the United Nations. I believed \nthat the solution to these practices was the same solution the federal \ngovernment has adopted to ensure American taxpayer funds are well-\nspent: an independent inspector general. Specifically, what was needed \nthen and now is an office or mechanism that can conduct budgetary \naudits; recommend policies for efficient and effective U.N. management; \ninvestigate and detect budgetary waste, fraud and abuse; and provide an \nenforcement mechanism that would enable the Secretary General, or even \nthe so-called inspector general, to take corrective action.\n  The withholding requirement was put in place for two reasons: First, \nit was important to demonstrate that the U.S. Government was very \nserious about putting an end to U.N. fiscal mismanagement. As the \nsingle largest contributor to the United Nations, I believed that it \nwas time to use this leverage to achieve real reform at the United \nNations. Second, I believed that American taxpayer dollars should not \nbe used to subsidize waste, fraud, and abuse. Frankly, I had sought a \nhigher withholding amount--50 percent--to achieve this goal, but twenty \npercent was the highest I could get through what was then a Senate \ncontrolled by the Democrats.\n  Since the adoption of this withholding provision, U.N. reform has \nbecome a more important and open topic of discussion in the halls of \nthe United Nations, and the Clinton administration. During the 50th \nanniversary celebration of the United Nations, the President devoted \nmuch of his address to U.N. management reform. The United Nations has \nappointed a so-called inspector general that released a report \ndetailing vast mismanagement within the United Nations, particularly in \nthe area of peacekeeping activities. All this is good news. A few years \nago, former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in his capacity as \nUndersecretary General for Management, produced a similar report, and \nthe United Nations did everything it could to hide it from public view.\n  So the fact that the United Nations has produced a report detailing \nits own mismanagement is an important development. The United Nations \nhas been a mismanagement addict, and it has taken the vital first step \nto reform its addiction: recognition. The United Nations recognizes it \nhas a serious mismanagement problem and it now is willing to admit it. \nIt is about time.\n  However, one more crucial step needs to be taken: action. The U.N. \nmust take action to correct its addiction, and that is why the \nwithholding requirement in the conference report before us today is so \nimportant. By my interpretation of section 401(b) of Public Law 103-\n236, the President would be unable to make this certification because \nof the requirement in that section that the United Nations has \nprocedures in place designed to ensure compliance with the \nrecommendations of the inspector general.\n  In short, there must be enforcement of management reform, not simply \nrecognition or discussion of the need for it. That is why the \nwithholding requirement in the conference report before us is needed. \nWe have made progress, but we have yet to achieve our ultimate goal: \nreal reform within the United Nations. For that reason, we must stay \nthe course. We must continue to insist on a withholding of taxpayer \ndollars until the United Nations has cleaned up its act.\n  Mr. President, I intend to speak in more detail on this matter in the \nnear future, particularly on the subject of our contributions to the \nUnited Nations, and additional reforms that must be put in place. In \nthe meantime, I am pleased that the conference report maintains our \ncommitment to U.N. reform. I commend my friend from New Hampshire for \nhis efforts to make sure this provision was included in the final bill. \nI look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to ensure our \nU.N. management reform goals are met.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier this year, America recoiled in \nhorror as we heard the tragic story of Stephanie Kuhen, a 3-year-old \ngirl who was shot dead in her family's car after the car took a wrong \nturn and drove down a gang-infested alley in Los Angeles. Stephanie's \ngrandparents have remarked, ironically and unfortunately with some \ntruth, that their family would probably be safer in Bosnia.\n  In September, we read about 42-year-old Paul McLaughlin, a \nMassachusetts State prosecutor, devoted to his job, who was shot dead \nat point-blank range outside a commuter train station while returning \nhome from work. At the time of the murder, police speculated that it \nmay have been a gang-ordered assassination. Several officials remarked \nthat ``the slaying was the kind of event that might happen in Italy, \nColombia, or other nations where prosecutors, judges, and police are \nkidnapped or assassinated.''\n  And last August, three employees of a Capitol Hill McDonald's \nrestaurant--18-year-old Marvin Peay, Jr; 23-year-old Kevin Workman; and \na 49-year-old grandmother named Lillian Jackson--were all herded into \nthe restaurant's basement freezer late one Saturday night and shot in \nthe head. All three died instantaneously.\n  Mr. President, what I have just described did not take place in \nBosnia or Italy or Colombia or some other country, but right here in \nAmerica. These are real people. With real families. Feeling real pain. \nAnd dying real deaths. They are citizens of our country.\n\n\n                         Some facts about crime\n\n  We must put an end to this madness. If America wants to continue \ncalling itself a civilized society, we can no \n\n[[Page S 18178]]\nlonger accept an annual crime tally of nearly 24,000 murders, 100,000 \nforcible rapes, 670,000 robberies, and more than 1 million aggravated \nassaults. We must stop tolerating the intolerable.\n  Listen to these facts.\n  Fact: For the first time in our Nation's history, the FBI estimates \nthat a majority of all murders are committed by persons who are \nstrangers to their victims. In a very real sense . . . no matter where \nwe live or where we work. Americans are hostage to the vicious, random \nacts of nameless, faceless strangers.\n  Fact: More and more young people are resorting to violence. According \nto the Justice Department, the murder rate among 14-to-17 year-olds has \nincreased by 165 percent during the past 10 years, fueled in large part \nby crack cocaine. If current trends continue, juvenile arrests may \ndouble by the year 2010.\n  Fact: Violent crime is destroying America's minority communities. The \nJustice Department estimates that a staggering 1 out of every 21 \nAfrican-American men in this country can expect to be murdered, a \nmajority rate that is twice the rate for U.S. soldiers during World War \nII.\n  Fact: The revolving prison door keeps swinging and Americans keep \ndying. At least 30 percent of the murders in the United States are \ncommitted by predators who should be behind bars, but instead are out \non the streets while on probation, parole, or bail.\n\n\n                      law enforcement block grant\n\n  Now, Mr. President, this conference report will not solve the crime \nproblem. The best antidote to crime is not a prison cell or more \npolice, but conscience--that inner voice that restrains the passions \nand enables us to recognize the difference between right and wrong.\n  To put it simply: values count, not just in our lives, but in our \nsociety. There will never be enough prisons or police to enforce order \nif there is growing disorder in our souls.\n  But, of course, we have to start somewhere. Last year, I opposed the \nso-called crime bill because I believed it was a flawed Federal \npolicy--too light on punishment and too heavy on pork, spending \nbillions and billions of dollars on untested social-programs. This \nconference report tries to correct some of these excesses.\n  The report also rejects the ``one-size-fits-all approach'' of the \ncurrent COPS Program by giving local communities more flexibility to \ndetermine what best suits their own unique law-enforcement needs. Is it \nmore police? Better training? More squad cars? Or perhaps modern crime-\nfighting technology? As the Washington Post recently editorialized:\n\n       Because community policing has proved to be so effective \n     and so popular with the public, many areas will spend the \n     money as Washington intends. But if new technologies, more \n     cars or a social service unit trained with juveniles are \n     needed, why shouldn't local authorities have more choice? \n     Word processors, a modernized telephone system or better \n     lab equipment may not have the political appeal of 100,000 \n     new cops. But for some cities, they may be a much better \n     deal.\n\n  And let me emphasize that if a local community wants more police \nofficers--needs more cops--it can use the block-grant funds for this \nvery purpose.\n\n\n                          truth-in-advertising\n\n  Mr. President, in the coming days, we will no doubt hear President \nClinton denounce the Congress for attempting to repeal his so-called \n100,000 COPS Program. But what the President will not say is that this \nprogram never existed in the first place. The current program fully \nfunds only 25,000 new police officers, not the 100,000 we hear so much \nabout. That is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of experts like \nPrinceton University Prof. John Diiulio.\n  So, when it comes to the COPS Program, it is time for a little truth-\nin-advertising.\n\n\n                            other provisions\n\n  This conference report contains other important provisions: $10 \nmillion for the innovative police corps program; truth-in-sentencing \ngrants that will help the States abolish parole for violent offenders; \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, which will go a long way to reduce \nthe number of frivolous claims file each year by litigation-happy \ninmates, the so-called frequent-filers; and $500 million to reimburse \nthe States for the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens, including \nthose who have committed crimes while in the United States.\n  Finally, I want to commend Senator Judd Gregg, the manager of this \nbill, for his skill in developing this conference report and bringing \nit to the floor. Senator Gregg just recently assumed the chairmanship \nof the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee, and with today's action, \nhe has proven that he is a very fast learner indeed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to go on record opposing a last \nminute addition to the statement of managers in the conference report \non the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary appropriations bill, to \nwhich I object strenuously. On page 127 of the statement of managers \nthere is a provision to have a deep ocean isolation study. This report \nlanguage would have NOAA conduct an analysis of a particular patented \ntechnology that would be used for the disposal of dredge soil to the \ndeep ocean.\n  Mr. President, I strongly object to this direction to NOAA. First, \nthere was no mention of this issue in the House bill, the Senate bill, \nthe Senate report or the House report. But, it is in the conference \nreport.\n  Second, this is special interest legislation of the most egregious \nkind--it is intended to help one and only one company at the expense of \nthe environment.\n  Third, the company had, in the past, a similar study provision in a \nDefense appropriations bill. In January, the Navy released its study \nthat this technology was determined to be ``unacceptable from both \nproduction rate capability and because of handling systems problems.''\n  I objected strenuously against this study in 1993 because it would be \na waste of Federal resources and because it was intended to lead to \nrenewed disposal of sewage sludge in the ocean. Mr. President, the \nstudy has been completed, and the Navy determined the technology was \nnot feasible. The money was wasted and yet, in these difficult budget \ntimes, a request is being made to do a similar study by a different \nagency of the Federal Government! When is enough enough?\n  Mr. President, our oceans are too valuable to be used as a garbage \ndump. Our oceans include diverse species that rival the tropical rain \nforests. Because of the rich environmental heritage of the oceans and \nthe tremendous economic vitality of our coasts that are dependent on a \nclean ocean environment, I have worked to end the ocean dumping of \nsewage sludge and the proper handling of contaminated sediments. That \nis why I sponsored legislation to ban ocean dumping of sewage sludge \nand sponsored provisions in water resources development legislation \nthat will help develop technologies to decontaminate dredged sediments.\n  Mr. President, this study is not just a study of whether a technology \nwill work. It is a study about the feasibility of a technology that is \ndesigned to facilitate illegal activities.\n  The intent of this technology is to dispose of contaminated dredge \nmaterials. Clean dredged disposal is used beneficially on golf courses \nand other uses. However, the disposal of contaminants in the ocean that \nthis technology contemplates is illegal above trace amounts under the \nMarine Protection Act and several international conventions.\n  Mr. President, the tourism industry in my state, the water recreation \nindustry and users, and numerous environmental groups have rejected \nadditional disposal of contaminated sediments as contemplated by this \nlanguage. The public has spoken out forcefully and repeatedly against \nthe ocean dumping of pollutants. And, the Navy has determined that this \ntechnology is not feasible and will lead to the release of contaminated \ntoxic sediments into the water column.\n  Mr. President, I know that this report language is not binding on the \nAgency. Based on the fact a similar study has just recently been \ncarried out, I strongly urge the Agency to ignore this ill-conceived \nand ill-considered language.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nrequest the time be allocated equally to all sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. \n  \n[[Page S 18179]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I ask \nunanimous consent the 12 remaining minutes of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with \nthe time assigned to all sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, again I would like to thank the \nprofessional staff who worked so hard on this appropriations bill. On \nthe majority side I want to recognize David Taylor, Scott Corwin, Vas \nAlexopoulus, and Lula Edwards. And, of course, I would be remiss if I \ndid not recognize Mark Van DeWater, our full committee's deputy staff \ndirector. Time and time again Mark worked to develop compromises that \nlet this bill go forward. Finally, I want to recognize Emelie East, of \nour minority staff, who staffs this bill, foreign operations, military \nconstruction, and defense appropriations.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back, except that there be 10 minutes reserved for the leader \nand 10 minutes reserved for the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd; that a vote be set to occur at 4 o'clock on \nfinal passage; that the yeas and nays be ordered; and, that, pending \nthe 10 minutes being used by the leader, or the 10 minutes to be used \nby Senator Byrd, we be in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is not exactly a secret that I \nintroduced legislation many months ago to reform the foreign affairs \napparatus of the United States by abolishing three wasteful, \nanachronistic Federal bureaucracies--the Agency for International \nDevelopment, which we call AID around this place; the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency, which is called ACDA; and the U.S. Information \nAgency, USIA--and folding their functions into the State Department, \nthus saving billions of dollars.\n  Senators know the history of what has transpired since that day early \nthis year when I offered that bill. There has been one delay after \nanother. But I am hopeful that late this afternoon Senator Kerry and I \nwill complete an agreement that will lead to a consummation of the \nactivities so that we can have some ambassadors confirmed and some \nother things accomplished by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe U.S. Senate, which could have been done months ago had it not been \nfor the objection to our having a vote on my bill.\n  That is all I ever asked. I did not ask that there be a victory or \nthat the bill be passed. I asked only that there be a vote. But that \nwas denied me. And the media, of course, do not make that clear. That \nis all right with me if it is all right with them. They are not very \naccurate about many things anyhow.\n  Many Senators are aware that Vice President Gore has been one of the \nmost vigorous opponents of my proposal to abolish the Agency for \nInternational Development as an independent entity and place it \ndirectly under the purview of the Secretary of State--a proposal, I \nmight add for emphasis, that has been supported from the very beginning \nby a majority in the U.S. Senate and endorsed by five former U.S. \nSecretaries of State.\n  As I understand it, Vice President Gore is in South Africa today. And \nwhile Al Gore, as we called him when he was a Senator, is there, I do \nhope that he will take the time to visit the South African mission of \nthe Agency for International Development.\n  Let me point out that the Agency for International Development was \ncreated more than three decades ago as one of those temporary Federal \nagencies--temporary, don't you know.\n  Well, Ronald Reagan used to say that there is nothing in this world \nso near eternal life as a ``temporary'' Federal agency. And AID, the \nAgency for International Development, is one of them.\n  Let me get down to business. I have before me documented information \ndisclosing that the Agency for International Development's inspector \ngeneral has just completed an extensive investigation into abuses in \nU.S. foreign aid programs in South Africa involving millions upon \nmillions of dollars of the American taxpayers' money. This \ninvestigation raises, obviously, serious questions about the \ncontracting and hiring practices within the Agency for International \nDevelopment's mission in South Africa, as well as the headquarters here \nin Washington, DC.\n  These questions range from whether AID officials unlawfully awarded \nmultimillion-dollar Federal contracts to politically connected U.S. \norganizations, and they range from that point to whether AID also \nattempted to hire personnel on a basis other than the question, were \nthe persons being hired qualified for the job?\n  This is not Jesse Helms talking. This is the inspector general of the \nAgency for International Development.\n  Whether the laws have been broken will be decided after careful \nreview of information that led the inspector general of the Agency for \nInternational Development to request the Department of Justice and the \nOffice of Management and Budget to review the many, many pages of \ninformation already transmitted to the Justice Department and to OMB.\n  I will add, Mr. President, that this matter will be carefully \nexamined by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the earliest \npracticable time.\n  Interestingly enough, the Agency for International Development \noperation in South Africa has been extolled and praised by Mr. Brian \nAtwood, whom President Clinton appointed to head the Agency for \nInternational Development. Now, Mr. Atwood calls the operation in South \nAfrica AID's flagship program in Africa--a program that has spent, I \nmight add, Mr. President, more than $450 million of the U.S. taxpayers' \nmoney in the past 5 years.\n  All right. Now, Mr. Atwood, in defending his agency explains that AID \nemployees were simply overtaken with ``enthusiasm''--and that is his \nword--in awarding contracts in South Africa. And AID management \nsuggests that this multimillion-dollar problem can be solved simply by \ngiving a little ``sensitivity'' training to AID employees in South \nAfrica.\n  That is Mr. Atwood's, and AID's, position as of now, as I understand \nit to be. It remains to be seen, of course, whether the American public \nwill buy that explanation.\n  My own view is that the American people have a right to know exactly \nwhat is going on with AID's giveaway program in South Africa. Congress \nhas an obligation to get to the bottom of it, and I for that reason \nhave asked the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mrs. Kassebaum, who \nchairs the African Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, of which I am chairman, to schedule a hearing on this matter \non December 14 at 2 p.m. Senator Kassebaum has indicated that she \nshares my concern about the inspector general's report, and she has \nreadily agreed to schedule such a hearing. We will request the presence \nof members of AID's South Africa management as well as AID officials in \nWashington who directly oversee the South Africa program in order to \ngive them an opportunity to explain to the Senate and to the American \npeople precisely what has been going on in South Africa.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. \n  \n[[Page S 18180]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe there has been a unanimous- \nconsent request that has been acted upon relative to the continued \nbusiness of this body. I wonder if I may ask unanimous consent that I \nmay make a statement not lasting more than 5 or 6 minutes on section \n609 which I think is the issue before this body.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, 10 minutes has been reserved for the \ndistinguished majority leader and also 10 minutes for the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. So within that framework, I would not \nobject.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Five minutes will suffice.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend, the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18179-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18180-S18181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n          AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this bill has a section, section 609, \nwhich I feel jeopardizes the new chapter in relations between the \nUnited States and Vietnam which began last July. With President \nClinton's announcement at that time that he was prepared to establish \nfull diplomatic relations with the Government of Vietnam, and with the \nsubsequent steps to open an embassy and begin trade discussions over \nthe last few months, the two-decade long campaign to obtain the fullest \npossible accounting of MIA's in Southeast Asia truly entered a new \nstage and a more positive phase. That progress I think is threatened by \nthis section and I wish to go on record as opposing it.\n  I understand the objective of the authors of the amendment. They \nwant, as I do, to resolve the issue of accountability of the MIA's, and \nthey believe this is the best way to achieve that objective. And while \nI agree with the objective, I disagree with the means which they have \nproposed.\n  I supported the President's decision to establish relations. I have \nbeen over there a number of times. And I continue to believe, and \nevidence supports it, that increased access to Vietnam, not reduced \naccess, leads to increased progress on the accountability issue.\n  Resolving the fate of our MIA's has been and will remain the highest \nsingle priority of our Government. Under no circumstances should it be \nany different. This Nation owes that to the men and women and the \nfamilies of the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for this \ncountry and for freedom.\n  In 1986, I was chairman of the Veterans' Committee, and I was \nappalled to learn at that time that we had no firsthand information \nabout the fate of the POW/MIA's because we had no access to the \nVietnamese Government records or to the Government or to the military \narchives or to the prisons. We could not travel to crash sites. We had \nno opportunity to interview Vietnamese individuals or officials.\n  That has changed now. The American Joint Task Force, the JTF-FA \npersonnel located in Hanoi now have access to Vietnam's Government and \nto its military archives and prisons. They are free to travel to crash \nsites and interview Vietnamese citizens and officials.\n  As a result of these and other positive developments, the overall \nnumber of MIA's in Vietnam has been reduced significantly through a \npainstaking identification process. Most of the missing involve men \nlost over water and other circumstances where survival and \nidentification is doubtful.\n  Most, if not all, of the progress has come since 1991 when President \nBush established the office in Hanoi devoted to resolving the fate of \nthe MIA's and supported further activity by President Clinton. Opening \nthis office ended almost two decades of isolation, a policy which, in \nmy opinion, failed to meet our goals.\n\n  In 1993, opponents of ending our isolationist policy argued that \nlifting the trade embargo would mean an end to Vietnamese cooperation. \nWell, this was not the case. As the Pentagon assessment from the \nPresidential delegation's trip to Vietnam earlier this year notes, the \nrecords offered are ``the most detailed and informative reports'' \nprovided so far by the Government of Vietnam on missing Americans.\n  So let me state firmly here that while we have made progress, we \nshould not be satisfied, and we should continue to push for greater and \ngreater results. But there are limits to the results we can obtain by \npotentially--potentially--turning to a failed policy which remains \nrooted in the past and is dominated by the principle of isolation. We \nhave reached those limits. It is now time to continue a policy of full \nengagement with access and involvement.\n  Being represented in Vietnam does not mean forgetting our MIA's. \nHaving an embassy there does not mean that we agree with the policies \nof the Government of Vietnam. But it does help us promote basic \nAmerican values such as freedom, democracy, human rights, and the \nmarketplace.\n  When Americans go abroad or export their products, we export an idea \nand an ideal. We export the very ideas that America went to fight for \nin Vietnam. Moreover, diplomatic relations give us greater latitude \ntoward the carrot-and-stick approach. So do economic relations, as \nevidenced by the administration's trade team which recently visited \nVietnam for the first time after relations were established.\n  Retaining diplomatic relations will also advance other important U.S. \ngoals. A prosperous, stable and friendly Vietnam integrated into the \ninternational community will serve as an important impediment to \nChinese expansionism. Normalization should offer new opportunities for \nthe United States to promote respect for human rights in Vietnam.\n  Finally, competitive United States businesses which have entered into \nthe Vietnamese market after the lifting of the trade embargo will have \ngreater success with the full faith and confidence of the United States \nGovernment behind it. The amendment in question could jeopardize all \nthis progress and put us back where we were several years ago, which is \nnowhere. Now I understand that the President plans to veto this bill \nfor a variety of reasons, including because of this amendment. As the \nadministration has told us, it ``regrets the inclusion of extraneous \nlanguage in the bill related to the presence of United States \nGovernment facilities in Vietnam.'' As a result, I expect that the bill \nwill come back to us, to the conference committee, to be considered \nagain. I hope at that time this section will be removed, or at least \nmodified in a way which will not stop progress down the road which has \nalready led to many positive results.\n\n  Mr. President. Let me conclude by repeating what I said last July \nwhen we first moved toward establishing relations with Vietnam, when I \nsaid that I hope that step will continue this country's healing \nprocess. I think now, as I thought then, that the time has come to \ntreat Vietnam as a country--and not as a war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. And I again want to thank my good \nfriend from West Virginia for his accommodation. I wish him a good day.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, both the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee deserve a great \ndeal of credit for the many months of hard work--and it is hard work--\nthat they have put into the fiscal year 1996 Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill.\n  This is the first time that the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Gregg], has chaired the appropriations conference. He \ndid so very ably. I congratulate Senator Gregg on his success and \nkeeping his mind on track throughout the conference on this very \nimportant, complex appropriations bill.\n  I wish to recognize the outstanding efforts of the distinguished \nranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Hollings, on this bill. On \nNovember 9, 1966, a new Member came into this Senate. And for these 29 \nyears and 28 days it has been my good fortune to serve with Fritz \nHollings. He is a man of sterling character. He is absolutely \n\n[[Page S 18181]]\nfearless. He is a man of great courage with supreme dedication to his \nwork. He is smart, and he does what he thinks is best. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  It has been a pleasure for me to work with Senator Hollings on the \nAppropriations Committee these many years. He has been a fine \nsubcommittee chairman, has always been most cooperative with me in the \nyears that I was chairman. I could always depend on him to carry his \npart of the load, and then some. His knowledge and expertise in all \nareas of the Commerce-Justice-State Subcommittee's jurisdiction are \nwell known and unequaled in the Senate.\n  For two decades he has served on the Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations Subcommittee, served with great distinction, and has \nworked tirelessly throughout his years of service as a member of that \nsubcommittee and as its chairman to ensure that the many important \nprograms and activities that are funded by the subcommittee received \nfair treatment and equitable treatment, often at times of severe \nbudgetary constraints.\n\n  I understand that the President has indicated he will veto this \nconference report for a number of reasons. I can assure all Senators \nthat such a veto will in no way reflect upon the outstanding work of \nthe chairman and ranking member, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings. \nThe Senate and the American people are in their debt.\n  It is with great pleasure that I take this moment to express my deep \nappreciation to Senator Hollings, a man whose heart is as stout as the \nIrish oak and as pure as the lakes of Killarney.\n  I also want to compliment the staff. He has an excellent staff, and \nso does Senator Gregg, the staff of the subcommittee; Mr. David Taylor \nand Mr. Scott Corwin for the majority; Mr. Scott Gudes for the \nminority. There is no better--no better--along with Lula Edwards and \nEmelie East. They deserve our gratitude and our thanks.\n  Now, Mr. President, we pass out a lot of encomiums in this body. But \nI try to be reserved in doing so. I want to close with just these \nwords. I salute Senator Hollings, my old friend of these 29 years and \n28 days.\n\n     When a man does a deed that you greatly admire,\n     Do not leave a kind word unsaid\n     For fear to do so might make him vain\n     Or cause him to lose his head;\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done,''\n     And see how his gratitude swells.\n     It is not the flowers we strew on the grave;\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My good friend, the distinguished Senator, has been so \ngenerous. I hasten to add I am not leaving. It would be most \nappropriate here for me to tell of my admiration in one sense, but then \nthey would say it is tit for tat.\n  I have served under Senator Byrd as leader; I have served under him \nas our chairman. He is the one remaining in the U.S. Senate who \nmaintains the decorum, the dignity, the civility that is so fundamental \nto the good working of this body. So to hear from him on this \noccasion--I join with him in congratulating our distinguished chairman \nof the subcommittee for his difficult and hard work. I have apologized \nin the sense of not being able to vote for the bill, but I think that \nis understood in the light of the constraints and what has been \ncontained therein.\n\n  But let me genuinely thank my good friend. You make some good friends \nin this service here. And there is none better than my friend, Bob \nByrd, the Senator from West Virginia, and I really thank him.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also wish to thank the Senator from West Virginia, who \nhas been of tremendous assistance to this committee, obviously. I was \nsort of dropped into this committee out of the clear blue, and with the \nhelp of the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from West \nVirginia, Members on our side have been able to struggle through the \neffort. I think we have produced a bill that is, if not supported by \nthe other side, hopefully at least respected by the other side.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Hatch, who was very helpful in this \nundertaking, and Senator Helms, and especially the staff on both sides \nof the aisle who have already been mentioned, of course, Scott Gudes \nand Emelie East, and David Taylor and Scott Corwin, Lula Edwards, and \nVasiliki Alexopoulos on our side. They worked incredible hours, just \noverwhelming hours, under tremendous intensity. I do not know really \nhow they do it.\n  It is extremely impressive. I think what they all deserve is a good \nvacation in New Hampshire, and I hope they come. We would love to have \nthem come up and relax.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nabout 8 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18180-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18181-S18182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about the current \nstate of funding for the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. \nIn the State of Minnesota last year there were about 110,000 \nhouseholds--over 300,000 men, women and children--who receive energy \nassistance. They received an average energy assistance benefit of about \n$360 per heating season.\n  That was last year. This year, given the huge cuts in LIHEAP funding \nalready enacted, that grant is expected to be about $200, even though \nfor these households during the heating season, the overall cost of \ntheir heating bill is somewhere between $1,800 and $2,000.\n  Last year, we funded this program at a little over $1.3 billion. We \nhad a rescissions package which contained a cut of $319 million. On the \nSenate side, the appropriators proposed to fund this program at $900 \nmillion, and on the House side, it has been zeroed out.\n  In this bloodless debate that we too often have about the budget, I \nthink sometimes we are completely disconnected from people's lives. \nThat's why I would like to talk about what is going on in Minnesota \nright now, and what is going on in other cold-weather States. I speak \nabout this with some sense of urgency. Last year, Minnesota received \nabout $50 million in heating assistance. This year, we have received so \nfar, after the last continuing resolution, about $9 million. Usually by \nthis time, we have received about $20-$25 million.\n  The energy assistance program, I say to my colleagues who are not \nfrom cold-weather States, is really not a year-long program. It is \neffectively a 6-month program. You need to allocate the heating money \nnow during the cold-weather months. It is truly an example of a program \nwhere you cannot do it over a 1-year period of time. You need to get \nthe assistance to people now when they need it.\n  What we have going on right now with the way we have been funding \nthis program that we are forcing people to freeze on the installment \nplan. That has to change. I hope there will be a change in the third \ncontinuing resolution which we'll likely have before this body next \nweek.\n  Let me put my colleagues on notice: This will not be the last time I \nam going to speak about the Energy Assistance Program here on the \nfloor. I intend to raise the alarm until something gets done on it.\n  It may be--and people may have a hard time understanding this--it may \nbe that in Washington, DC, when it is 30 or 40 or 50 degrees, in my \nState of Minnesota, it can be 10 degrees below zero, and in some parts \nof the State, those are exactly the kinds of temperature with which we \nhave been faced.\n  I want to give a couple of examples, just a few examples, of what \nthis actually means to people who rely on LIHEAP benefits.\n  Nancy Watson is 55 years old. She is disabled. She lives in Clear \nLake, MN. Her income is from SSI and medical assistance. It is $529 a \nmonth. She received her grant of $81 this year for energy assistance, \nand she does not know what she is going to do for the rest of the year. \n\n\n[[Page S 18182]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the State of Minnesota, there are people who have \nbeen cut off already from utilities. There are people who do not have \npropane or fuel in their tanks. There are people who do not have any \nheat at all, and who are having to struggle to patch together help from \nfriends, churches, the Salvation Army--anywhere they can get it.\n  There are elderly people who have closed off all but one room of \ntheir homes. That is all the heating they can afford. There are people \nwho have the thermostat turned down to 50 degrees. What are we going to \ndo about that in the U.S. Congress?\n  Mr. President, Clara Mager is a 73-year-old resident of a town on \nMinnesota's Iron Range. She receives $675 per month in Social Security. \nShe lives alone and raised six children on her own. She has just \nreceived her grant of $222. She owed her fuel provider, Inter-City Oil, \n$177, and on Monday had only 60 gallons left in the fuel tanks. She \nwonders what she is going to do at the end of December or in January or \nin February or in March.\n  In Blue Earth County, we have talked with a woman who is 90 years \nold. I will make a long story short. She is very worried about how \nshe's going to heat her home, and she has now reached the conclusion, \nafter having been self-reliant and self-sufficient her whole life, that \nshe may have to move into a nursing home.\n  Mr. President, you can criticize the Low-Income Energy Assistance \nProgram. There are imperfections in all our programs. But let me remind \nmy colleagues that nationally, two-thirds of the energy households have \nan income of less than $8,000 a year. More than half have incomes below \n$6,000 a year. I tell my colleagues today, and I am going to speak \nabout this over the next week: we have to do something now in this \ncontinuing resolution, we have to get adequate funding allocated to \npeople who need it. The total cost of the Energy Assistance Program \ndoes not equal the cost of one B-2 bomber, and if we do not do \nanything, I say to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, I \nguarantee you that sooner or later there will be people in our country \nin the cold-weather States who will freeze to death. Then we will do \nsomething.\n  We should not wait. We should not wait. That would be wrong. We can \ndo better. People expect more of us.\n  Nobody in 1994 voted for an elimination of an energy assistance \nprogram for the most vulnerable citizens in this country to make sure, \nwhether they are elderly or whether they are children or whether people \nwith disabilities or whether they are a working poor family, that they \nat least have this survival supplement. We cannot keep doing it this \nway. In my State of Minnesota, by now, we have just over $9 million \nthat we are getting out to people. It is 10 degrees. It is 8 degrees. \nIn northern Minnesota, it will reach zero or below tonight. There is a \nwindchill below zero. People are cold, and we have to get this \nassistance out to those who need it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of a \ndraft letter that is circulating among Senators, and that will soon be \nsent to Chairman Hatfield, from the Northeast-Midwest Coalition. I was \npart of the effort, and urged that such a letter be done. Senator \nJeffords from Vermont is co-chair of this coalition, and we have worked \nwith him on the effort. It makes the case clearly for addressing the \nLIHEAP problem in the next CR.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Appropriations Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatfield: We would like to call your \n     attention to a serious problem with the interim funding for \n     the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). We \n     believe that if we are to continue funding programs under the \n     FY96 Labor/HHS Appropriations bill through a Continuing \n     Resolution (CR), states must be allowed to draw down LIHEAP \n     funds at a higher rate which takes into account their \n     historical spending practices and which is sufficient to \n     ensure the program's viability. Temperatures have dropped \n     below freezing and there is snow on the ground in many parts \n     of the country, but the language in both CRs that limits \n     state draw downs to a proportional annual rate does not \n     provide states sufficient funds to operate programs and meet \n     the heating needs of their low income families.\n       In past years, states have drawn down a majority of their \n     LIHEAP funds during the fall. This allows states to purchase \n     fuel at lower rates, maintain continuity of service, avoid \n     shut offs, and plan for the upcoming winter. Furthermore, \n     nearly ninety percent of LIHEAP funds are used for heating \n     assistance during the coldest months. The CR language \n     requires that LIHEAP funds be spent out over a twelve month \n     period. While this may leave funds for heating assistance in \n     June, many low income families may not be able to heat their \n     homes this winter.\n       We believe it is critical to safeguard this program which \n     protects the elderly, the disabled, the working poor, and \n     children. When it gets cold, these vulnerable Americans \n     should not be forced to choose between heating and eating. \n     Continuing delays in funding and limits on the payout rate \n     will hamper states' ability to help the 5.6 million LIHEAP \n     households survive the winter. We ask your assistance in \n     ensuring that the bulk of LIHEAP funds can be spent during \n     the cold weather months at a rate sufficient to meet the \n     needs of low income families this winter. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jim Jeffords.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be speaking about this in much \nmore detail over the next week or so. We have to do something about \nthis, I say to my colleagues.\n  On the last continuing resolution, finally I was able to get, and \nSenator Jeffords and others can talk about what's happening in their \nStates, $2 million more for my State. That is it. But that is a \npittance. We have long waiting lists of people who need the assistance, \nand adequate funds are not available. That's why people are having to \ngo cold.\n  We have to get the funding out now, and we have to figure out a way \nin this continuing resolution to make sure that we do so; otherwise, \nMr. President, there is no question that in the United States of \nAmerica, this winter some people will likely freeze to death.\n  For God's sake, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, liberals, \nconservatives, and whatever other label you choose to call yourself or \napply to yourself, let us try to do better, and let us try to make sure \nin this continuing resolution that we are able to get some of this \nfunding out. We should not be freezing people on the installment plan. \nIt is unconscionable. It is not right. We should not be doing this. We \nhave to take some action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18181-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18182-S18183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n          AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator to yield, the \nSenate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senators to the left of me take their \nconversations off the floor?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the pending bill to outlaw \nmedically necessary abortions, and I strongly support the Boxer \namendment to protect the lives and health of women.\n  The Senate began to debate H.R. 1833 last month, a mere 6 days after \nthe bill had passed the House. At first, the bill's Senate sponsors \neven refused the reasonable request that hearings be held. But a strong \nbipartisan majority of the Senate rejected that unacceptable approach. \nThe bill was committed to the Judiciary Committee for a hearing. But \nthere was no committee markup and the Senate does not have the benefit \nof a committee report.\n  The haste with which this bill is being pushed through the Senate is \nunseemly. Obviously, its proponents don't want their proposal examined \ntoo closely. They'd rather have the Senate vote on emotion, not on the \nfacts.\n  I attended the November 17 hearing, and I came away from it more \nconvinced than ever that this bill is an unwise, unconstitutional, and \ndangerous proposal.\n  The hallmark of good legislation is clarity. But the November 17 \nhearing revealed that this bill is unacceptable vague. In criminal \nlegislation like this, that's unconstitutional, and it's quite likely \nthat the courts will throw out this bill under the void for vagueness \ndoctrine.\n  The problem is obvious. The Judiciary Committee heard from a panel of \nmedical experts who could not even agree among themselves on the \nmedical meaning of the legislative language, or on which procedures \nmight be banned. Dr. Courtland Robinson of Johns Hopkins University \ncalled the language ``vague, not medically substantiated, and just not \nmedically correct . . . the name [partial-birth abortion] did not exist \nuntil someone who wanted to ban an abortion procedure made up this \nerroneous, inflammatory term.''\n  The bill's very vagueness itself threatens the lives and health of \nAmerican women. In the absence of a clear definition of what is \noutlawed, doctors will decline to perform any abortion that a \nprosecutor or jury might later find objectionable.\n  Prof. Louis Michael Seidman of Georgetown Law Center testified: ``If \nI were a lawyer advising a physician who performed abortions, I would \ntell him to stop, because there is just no way to tell whether the \nprocedure will [violate this law].''\n  Dr. Robinson, who has practiced medicine for over 40 years, expressed \nthe fear that if doctors are unwilling to perform needed abortions, \nwomen will resort to the back-alley methods that were used before safe, \nlegal abortions became available. He testified:\n\n       In the 1950's in New York, I watched women die from \n     abortions that were improperly done. By banning this \n     technique, you would, in practice, ban most later abortions \n     altogether by making them virtually unavailable. And that \n     means that women will probably die. I know. I've seen it \n     happen.\n\n  Despite the bill's apparently deliberate vagueness, the one activity \nit clearly bans is a procedure known as ``intact dilation and \nextraction'' or ``D'' surgery. There are perhaps 450 such operations \nperformed in the United States each year, and they involve ``wanted \npregnancies gone tragically awry,'' according to Dr. Mary Campbell of \nPlanned Parenthood, who testified at the hearing. Dr. Campbell \nexplained that when emergency conditions threaten the life or health of \nthe pregnant woman, this procedure is safer than any other abortion \nmethod, such as induced labor or caesarean section.\n  Depending upon the position of the fetus in the womb, a woman is 14 \ntimes as likely to die from a C-section as from a D, and twice as \nlikely to die from induced labor as from a D, according to Dr. \nCampbell. C-sections create an increased risk of rupture of the uterus \nin future pregnancies.\n  The bill's supporters ignore this compelling medical testimony and \nthe scholarly articles that support it. They rely instead on a single \nquotation from a single doctor to the effect that 80 percent of these \nabortions he performs are ``elective.'' But proponents of the bill are \ngrossly distorting what that doctor said. They never complete the \nquotation--the doctor stated that he is referring to abortions before \nthe sixth month of pregnancy.\n  The Supreme Court has made plain that in the case of such pre-\nviability abortions, a woman may elect to terminate her pregnancy \nwithout the undue interference from the Government. After viability, of \ncourse, there are no elective abortions. As Dr. Campbell noted \nemphatically, ``third trimester abortion for healthy babies is not \navailable in this country.* * * Occasionally, someone comes to see me \nwho thinks she is 10 weeks pregnant; it turns out she is 32 weeks \npregnant. I don't say, `where can we get you a third-trimester \nabortion.' I say, `You will be having a baby.' ''\n  The Judiciary Committee heard the facts about the D procedure from \ndoctors. We also heard moving testimony from two women who needed and \nobtained this surgery to avoid serious health consequences.\n  Coreen Costello is a pro-life Republican. She learned that the fetus \nshe \n\n[[Page S 18184]]\nwas carrying had ``a lethal neurological disorder. * * * Due to \nswelling, her head was already larger than that of a full-term baby. \nNatural birth or an induced labor were impossible.'' The D procedure, \nshe said, ``greatly lowered the risk of my death. * * * There was no \nreason to risk leaving my children motherless if there was no hope of \nsaving [my baby].''\n  Vicki Wilson testified about an equally tragic pregnancy. As she told \nthe committee, ``approximately 2/3 of my daughter's brain had formed on \nthe outside of her skull. * * * Because of the size of her anomaly, the \ndoctors feared that my uterus would rupture in the birthing process, \nmost likely rendering me sterile.'' She pleaded with the committee: \n``There will be families in the future faced with this tragedy because \nprenatal testing is not infallible. I urge you, please don't take away \nthe safest procedure available. This issue isn't about choice, it's \nabout medical necessity.''\n  The bill's supporters obviously cannot deal with the force of this \nfirst-hand testimony. So what do they do? They now suggest that the \nsurgical procedures that saved Coreen Costello and Viki Wilson were not \n``partial-birth abortions.''\n  That devious retreat speaks volumes about the vagueness of this bill, \nand the uncertainty it is designed to create. Even its sponsors don't \nknow what it means. But let there be absolutely no mistake. The \nprocedure that these two witnesses underwent was an intact D It was \nthe procedure depicted on Senator Smith's charts. It is the procedure \nthat the bill's proponents say they object to. It is the procedure that \nsaved the lives and health of Coreen Costello and Vicki Wilson. And now \nthe bill's supporters pretend the bill wouldn't apply to those cases. \nIf it doesn't apply to those cases, it will not apply to any cases.\n  These two brave women do not stand alone. Five other women submitted \ntestimony for the record describing similar cases. Thousands of women \nowe their lives or their health to the availability of a surgical \nprocedure that the U.S. Senate is on the verge of outlawing and sending \nany doctor to prison who performs it.\n  On its face, this bill is an unprecedented intrusion by Congress into \nthe practice of medicine. Its passage would represent the first time in \nAmerican history that Congress has outlawed a specific medical \nprocedure and imposed criminal penalties on doctors for treating their \npatients. As Dr. Robinson told the Judiciary Committee: ``With all due \nrespect, the Congress of the United States is not qualified to stand \nover my shoulder in the operating room and tell me how to treat my \npatients.''\n  This political excursion into the practice of medicine is plainly \ninappropriate. So why is it before the Senate today? The answer is \nsimple. The right-to-life movement has brought this bill to Congress in \nthe hope that its passage will advance their goal of discrediting Roe \nversus Wade and eventually outlawing all abortions. The bill's \nsupporters in the House boasted of such a strategy. At least one \nwitness at the committee hearing spoke frankly of this broader agenda. \nHelen Alvare of the Catholic Conference testified in support of the \nbill. She responded to questioning by Senator Feingold that she \nabsolutely favored criminal penalties for all abortion procedures. As \nshe said, ``If abortion proponents are afraid that somehow this [bill] \nopens the public mind to considering abortion further, they are \ncertainly right.''\n\n  That is why supporters of this bill do not mind its vagueness. They \ndo not really want to imprison the doctors who perform this procedure. \nThey want to intimidate all doctors into refusing to perform any \nabortions at all.\n  Before we head down that dangerous road, we should remember that Roe \nversus Wade and the subsequent Supreme Court decisions affirming a \nwoman's right to choose are based squarely on the Constitution. The \nconstitutional basis of the decision has been reaffirmed by the Supreme \nCourt in case after case since 1973. In its decision in Planned \nParenthood versus Danforth, the Supreme Court specifically invalidated \na Missouri law that banned a particular abortion procedure. The Court \nheld that the Missouri law might force ``a woman and her physician to \nterminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than \nthe method outlawed.''\n  This bill is a frontal assault on settled Supreme Court law. \nBasically, it asks the Supreme Court to overrule Roe versus Wade.\n  At the hearing, Professor Seidman of Georgetown Law Center identified \na half dozen independent reasons why the bill is unconstitutional. The \nmost disturbing of all the reasons is the bill's failure to permit \nabortions that are necessarily to preserve the life of the woman or to \nprotect her from serious adverse health consequences.\n  The Boxer amendment would at least remedy this most glaring defect. \nIt states clearly that the criminal prohibition in the bill will not \napply in the case of pre-viability abortions, or in the case of \nabortions that in the medical judgment of the attending physician are \nnecessary to preserve the life of the mother or avoid serious, adverse \nhealth consequences.\n  Every Member of the Senate who supports Roe versus Wade should \nsupport the Boxer amendment. So should every Member of the Senate who \nwants to protect the lives and health of American women.\n  In contrast, the Smith/Dole version of the exception is grossly \ninadequate. It fails to address the situation where an abortion is \nnecessary to avoid serious adverse health consequences. The Boxer \namendment protects both the life and the health of the woman. The \nSmith/Dole amendment protects only the woman's life.\n  Senator Smith and Senator Dole know how to write a genuine life-of-\nthe-mother exception. The model is obvious--the long-standing Hyde \namendment in Medicaid, which allows Medicaid to pay for abortions in \ncases where it is necessary to save the life of the mother.\n  But Senator Smith and Senator Dole don't want a real exception for \nthe life of the mother. In fact, their language does not even protect a \nwoman's life. It contains two gaping loopholes, and these loopholes \nmake it meaningless.\n  First, the Smith/Dole amendment limits the types of life-threatening \nsituations in which the exception applies. Only threats to a woman's \nlife that arise from ``a physical disorder, illness or injury'' are \ncovered. It does not cover the threat to a woman's life that may arise \nfrom the pregnancy itself, since pregnancy is not a ``physical \ndisorder, illness or injury.'' Coreen Costello, for example, did not \nhave an illness like cancer or diabetes that threatened her life. The \nthreat to her life arose from her pregnancy itself, and would not be \ncovered by the Smith/Dole exception.\n  Second, the Smith/Dole exception is conditioned on whether ``any \nother medical procedure would suffice'' to save the woman's life. This \nproviso is an outrageous example of second-guessing a doctor's \njudgment. Doctors who had literally saved a patient's life could find \nthemselves in a Federal prison because a prosecutor and a jury \nconcluded after the fact that the patient's life could also have been \nsaved using a different medical procedure that offended Congress' \nsensibilities less.\n\n  What doctor would take that chance? None. The Smith/Dole exception is \na sham. It provides no significant additional protection to doctors who \nwant to save the life of the woman.\n  Few aspects of the lives of citizens are as sensitive and as \ndeserving of privacy as the relationship between patients and their \nphysicians. Several years ago, we debated a proposal to gag physicians \nand prevent them from counseling women about abortion. But this bill \nmakes the gag rule debate pale by comparison. It puts the Federal \nGovernment--indeed, Federal law enforcement officers--directly into the \ndoctor's office in the most intrusive way.\n  The procedure involved in this case is extremely rare. It involves \ntragic circumstances late in pregnancy where the mother's life or \nhealth is in danger. The Federal Government has no business intruding \ninto these family decisions at all, and certainly not in so misguided a \nfashion.\n  The laws in 41 States already regulate post-viability abortions. The \nappropriations of medical practices is overseen by state and local \nhealth departments, medical societies, hospital ethical boards, and \nother organizations. The Federal criminal law is a preposterous means \nof regulating the highly personal, individual decisions \n\n[[Page S 18185]]\nfacing families with tragic pregnancies.\n  Coreen Costello told the Judiciary Committee: ``We are the families \nthat ache to hold our babies, to raise them, to love and nurture them. \nWe are the families who will forever have a hole in our hearts. We are \nthe families that had to choose how our babies would die. Each one of \nyou should be grateful that you and your families have not had to face \nsuch a choice. I pray that no one you love ever does. Please put a stop \nto this terrible bill.\n  I join Coreen Costello in urging the Senate to defeat this bill. The \ntest for every male Senator in this Chamber is very simple--would you \ndeny this procedure to your wife or daughter if it's needed to save her \nlife or health? Would you send her doctor who performed it to jail?\n  This bill is medical malpractice. The Senate should stop practicing \nmedicine without a license. This bill should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he might require to \nthe distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Americans have honest disagreements over \nthe subject of abortion. Strong convictions often lead to strident \nrhetoric, at times straining the bounds of civil discourse. Labels and \nname calling too easily substitute for persuasion as a means of winning \nthe hearts and minds of fellow citizens. Extremism and fanaticism are \nserved up as daily fare, often being dismissively attached to those \nwith strong pro-life views.\n  And yet there are times when strong words are necessary, when truth, \nraw and exposed, merits an apt label. There is only one issue at stake \nhere: It is an affront to humanity and justice to kill a kicking infant \nwith scissors as it emerges from its mother.\n  This legislation is not the expression of extremism. Only the \nprocedure itself is extreme--extreme in its violence, extreme in its \ndisregard for human life and dignity.\n  We have listened to the words of an eyewitness to this procedure. So \nwe know what the procedure is. A pro-choice nurse who assisted an \nabortionist in this procedure described the procedure. I do not like to \ndescribe the procedure on this floor. I do not like to read the \nprocedure. But I know one thing. I cannot condone or support this \nprocedure. And, if we are going to vote with a clear understanding of \nwhat it is we are dealing with, we need to understand the procedure.\n  I quote from this pro-choice nurse who assisted an abortionist in \nthis procedure.\n       What I saw is branded on my mind forever . . . Dr. Haskell \n     went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled \n     them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's \n     body and the arms--everything but the head. The doctor kept \n     the head right inside the uterus. . . .\n       The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and \n     his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the \n     scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked \n     out, like a startled reaction, like a flinch, like a baby \n     does when he thinks he is going to fall.\n       The Doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains \n     out. Now the baby went completely limp.\n       I was really completely unprepared for what I was seeing. I \n     almost threw up as I watched Dr. Haskell doing these things.\n       Next, Dr. Haskell delivered the baby's head. He cut the \n     umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby \n     into a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he \n     had just used. I saw the baby move in the pan. I asked \n     another nurse, and she said it was just ``reflexes.''\n       I had been a nurse for a long time, and I have seen a lot \n     of death--people maimed in accidents, gunshot wounds, you \n     name it. I have seen surgical procedures of every sort. But \n     in all my professional years, I had never witnessed anything \n     like this.\n       The woman wanted to see her baby, so they cleaned up the \n     baby and put it in a blanked and handed it to her. She cried \n     the whole time. She kept saying, ``I am so sorry, please \n     forgive me.'' I was crying, too. I couldn't take it. That \n     baby boy had the most perfect angelic face I think I have \n     ever seen in my life.\n\n  The only possible way to defend this procedure is with evasion and \nmisrepresentation.\n  It is said that this procedure is rare. But we are safely talking \nabout hundreds of these abortions annually. And as a matter of \nunalienable human rights, it should not only be rare, it should be \nnonexistent.\n  I suggest, if we are talking about 1 abortion with this procedure \nrather than 600, the issue is exactly the same.\n  It is said that the child feels nothing. But we know that a mother's \nanesthesia does not eliminate her child's pain. And we know that a \nchild killed in this procedure feels exactly what a preemie would feel \nif its doctors decided to kill it in its nursery.\n  It is said that this procedure is done to save the life of the \nmother. But we know that this procedure is not without substantial risk \nfor the mother. And, in fact, its primary purpose is the convenience of \nthe abortionist.\n  It is said that partial birth abortions are part of the mainstream of \nmedicine. But we know that the AMA Council on Legislation stated that \nthis practice is not a ``recognized medical technique'' and that the \n``procedure is basically repulsive.''\n  I am quoting. The AMA Council on Legislation said that this procedure \nis ``basically repulsive.'' I think anyone who understands the \nprocedure and knows the description of the procedure can come to no \nother conclusion.\n  It is said that only prolife fanatics support this legislation. But \nhow could this possibly apply to Members of the House like Patrick \nKennedy, Susan Molinari, and John Dingell? One pro-choice Member of the \nHouse commented, ``It undermines the credibility of the pro-choice \nmovement to be defending such an indefensible procedure.''\n  When we strip away all these arguments, we are left an uncomfortable \ntruth: This procedure is not the practice of medicine, it is an act of \nviolence.\n  It is hard to clearly confront reality in this matter, because \nclarity causes such anguish. But that reality is simple and terrible: \nThe death of a child with the most perfect angelic face I think I have \never seen in my life. That face should haunt us and shame us as a \nsociety. It should cause us to grieve--but more than that, it should \ncause us to turn back from this path to barbarism.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article written by George Will called, ``Fanatics For `Choice.' \nPartial-birth abortions, sonogram photos and `the idea that the fetus \nmeans nothing.' ''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Fanatics For ``Choice''\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Americans are beginning to recoil against the fanaticism \n     that has helped to produce this fact: more than a quarter of \n     all American pregnancies are ended by abortions. Abundant \n     media attention has been given to the extremism that has \n     tainted the right-to-life movement. Now events are exposing \n     the extraordinary moral evasions and callousness \n     characteristic of fanaticism, prevalent in the abortion-\n     rights lobby.\n       Begin with ``partial-birth abortions.'' Pro-abortion \n     extremists object to that name, preferring ``intact dilation \n     and evacuation,'' for the same reason the pro-abortion \n     movement prefers to be called ``pro-choice.'' What is \n     ``intact'' is a baby. During the debate that led to House \n     passage of a ban on partial-birth abortions, the right-to-\n     life movement was criticized for the sensationalism of its \n     print advertisements featuring a Dayton nurse's description \n     of such an abortion:\n       ``The mother was six months pregnant. The baby's heartbeat \n     was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen. The doctor went \n     in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled them \n     down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's body \n     and the arms--everthing but the head. The doctor kept the \n     baby's head just inside the uterus. The baby's little fingers \n     were clasping and unclasping and his feet were kicking. Then \n     the doctor stuck the scissors through the back of his head, \n     and the baby's arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle \n     reaction, like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall. \n     The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube into the opening and sucked the baby's brains \n     out.''\n       To object to this as sensationalism is to say that \n     discomforting truths should be suppressed. But increasingly \n     the language of pro-abortion people betrays a flinching from \n     facts. In a woman's story about her chemical abortion, \n     published last year in Mother Jones magazine, she quotes her \n     doctor as saying, ``By Sunday you won't see on the monitor \n     what we call the heartbeat.'' ``What we call''? In partial-\n     birth abortions the birth is kept (just barely) partial to \n     preserve the legal fiction that a baby (what some pro-\n\n[[Page S 18186]]\n     abortion people call ``fetal material'') is not being killed. An \n     abortionist has told The New York Times that some mothers \n     find such abortions comforting because after the killing, the \n     small body can be ``dressed and held'' so the (if pro-\n     abortionists will pardon the expression) mother can ``say \n     goodbye.'' The New York Times reports, ``Most of the doctors \n     interviewed said they saw no moral difference between \n     dismembering the fetus within the uterus and partially \n     delivering it, intact, before killing it.'' Yes.\n       Opponents of a ban on partial-birth abortions say almost \n     all such abortions are medically necessary. However, an \n     abortionist at the Dayton clinic is quoted as saying 80 \n     percent are elective. Opponents of a ban on such abortions \n     assert that the baby is killed before the procedure, by \n     the anesthesia given to the mother. (The baby ``undergoes \n     demise,'' in the mincing words of Kate Michelman of the \n     National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. \n     Does Michelman say herbicides cause the crab grass in her \n     lawn to ``undergo demise''? Such Orwellian language is a \n     sure sign of squeamishness.) However, the president of the \n     American Society of Anesthesiologists says this \n     ``misinformation'' has ``absolutely no basis in scientific \n     fact'' and might endanger pregnant women's health by \n     deterring them from receiving treatment that is safe.\n       Opponents of a ban say there are only about 600 such \n     procedures a year. Let us suppose, as not everyone does, the \n     number 600 is accurate concerning the more than 13,000 \n     abortions performed after 21 weeks of gestation. Still, 600 \n     is a lot. Think of two crashes of jumbo airliners. Opponents \n     of the ban darkly warn that it would be the first step toward \n     repeal of all abortion rights. Columnist John Leo of U.S. \n     News & World Report says that is akin to the gun lobby's \n     argument that a ban on assault weapons must lead to repeal of \n     the Second Amendment.\n       In a prophecy born of hope, many pundits have been \n     predicting that the right-to-life ``extremists'' would \n     drastically divide the Republican Party. But 73 House \n     Democrats voted to ban partial-birth abortions; only 15 \n     Republicans opposed the ban. If the ban survives the Senate, \n     President Clinton will probably veto it. The convention that \n     nominated him refused to allow the Democratic governor of \n     Pennsylvania, Bob Casey, who is pro-life, to speak. Pro-\n     choice speakers addressed the 1992 Republican Convention. The \n     two presidential candidates who hoped that a pro-choice \n     stance would resonate among Republicans--Gov. Pete Wilson, \n     Sen. Arlen Specter--have become the first two candidates to \n     fold their tents.\n       In October in The New Republic, Naomi Wolf, a feminist and \n     pro-choice writer, argued that by resorting to abortion \n     rhetoric that recognizes neither life nor death, pro-choice \n     people ``risk becoming precisely what our critics charge us \n     with being: callous, selfish and casually destructive men and \n     women who share a cheapened view of human life.'' Other \n     consequences of a ``lexicon of dehumanization'' about the \n     unborn are ``hardness of heart, lying and political \n     failure.'' Wolf said that the ``fetus means nothing'' stance \n     of the pro-choice movement is refuted by common current \n     practices of parents-to-be who have framed sonogram photos \n     and fetal heartbeat stethoscopes in their homes. Young \n     upscale adults of child-bearing age are a solidly pro-choice \n     demographic group. But they enjoy watching their unborn \n     babies on sonograms, responding to outside stimuli, and they \n     read ``The Well Baby Book,'' which says: ``Increasing \n     knowledge is increasing the awe and respect we have for the \n     unborn baby and is causing us to regard the unborn baby as a \n     real person long before birth . . .''\n       Wolf argued for keeping abortion legal but treating it as a \n     matter of moral gravity because ``grief and respect are the \n     proper tones for all discussions about choosing to endanger \n     or destroy a manifestation of life.'' This temperate judgment \n     drew from Jane Johnson, interim president of Planned \n     Parenthood, a denunciation of the ``view that there are good \n     and bad reasons for abortion.'' So, who now are the fanatics?\n\n  Mr. COATS. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes, and then I will \nyield directly to Senator Specter.\n  I wish to put a face to the women in this debate, so night after \nnight as Senator Smith and I have debated this issue, I have shown the \nfaces of different families who have had to face this tragedy who are \nnever shown on the posters that the other side has used during this \ndebate. Those are the faces that I think are very, very crucial and \nvery, very important.\n  This is Coreen Costello about whom Senator Kennedy commented. This is \na woman who describes herself as a pro-life Republican who underwent \nthis procedure so she could live to see her other children grow.\n  Why on Earth would we in the Senate, knowing nothing about medicine, \nban a procedure that some doctors testified before us at the Judiciary \nCommittee saves lives like this and gives these children a mother.\n  I would say that as Senator Coats read the quote from the nurse, what \nhe failed to say is she had worked for 3 days in this clinic in a \ntemporary capacity. The fact is that her supervisor wrote the \nfollowing, and I would place it in the Record:\n  Miss Pratt--\n  This nurse--\n  Absolutely could not have witnessed fetal movement as she describes. \nWe do not train temporary nurses in second trimester dilation and \nextractions since it is highly technical and would not be performed by \nsomeone in a temporary capacity.\n  He also failed to mention that the American Nurses Association, which \nrepresents 2.2 million nurses, who learn to save lives, strongly \nopposes this legislation. They do not believe it is humane to deprive \nwomen such as Coreen Costello and their beautiful families of a chance \nto live. So we will be talking about that.\n  And now I would yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSpecter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, I support both of the pending amendments, the \namendment offered by the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, \nand the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer.\n  I believe that the broader amendment, the Boxer amendment, is the \npreferable one because it articulates the basic constitutional standard \nwhich was setforth in Row v. Wade and upheld in Casey v. Planned \nParenthood in 1992, an opinion written by three Justices appointed by \nPresidents Reagan and Bush.\n  When you talk about the life of the mother and the health of the \nmother, conditioning the health on ``serious adverse health \nconsequences,'' that is the constitutionally protected doctrine. When \nyou talk about the language of the Dole amendment, which I intend to \nsupport, it is not in the blanket terms of life of the mother as in the \nHyde amendment or the traditional amendments which are offered on \nappropriations bills which make an exception for life of the mother but \ninstead talks about ``saving the life of the mother whose life is \nendangered by a physical disorder, illness or injury, provided that no \nother medical procedure would suffice for that purpose.''\n  That language is hard to interpret at best, and I do believe would \nplace substantial doubt in the minds of many doctors who would be \ncalled upon to try to figure out what it means.\n  This is a medical procedure which is chilling beyond any question, \nand we do at the present time have a line drawn as to when there is \nsomeone alive protected by the laws against homicide and infanticide \nand the constitutional protections which apply on the medical procedure \nof abortions.\n\n  We had only 1 day of hearings on this matter. The day we had was \ncertainly preferable to having no hearings at all, but we were unable \nto get on relatively short notice, because we had a very limited time \nspan, the doctors who were really familiar with these procedures. The \nfact is that those who are familiar were reluctant to step forward and \noffer medical judgments. But we heard very profound testimony from \nphysicians who expressed the concern about having legislation in this \nfield where it is very difficult to start to draw lines about what \nmedical practices and what medical procedures ought to be.\n  There is so much to be said for the proposition that it is between \nthe doctor and the patient as to what is necessary for the life of a \nmother, which is at least the most restrictive standard which ought to \nbe adopted in clearcut terms and really is not by the amendment offered \nby the distinguished majority leader but really ought to be extended \nlife of the mother or health of the mother which has been established \nby the constitutional parameters by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  We have legislation which is very profound in its import, which had \none limited hearing in the House, one limited hearing in the Senate, \nand which we will be legislating upon which will leave many, many open \nquestions and many doubts on a very, very serious medical procedure.\n  So, at a minimum, Mr. President, I hope that the Boxer amendment \nwould \n\n[[Page S 18187]]\nbe adopted as well as the Dole amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 4 minutes yielded to the Senator from \nPennsylvania have expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time is available on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 minutes, 14 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 19 minutes exactly.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to begin by congratulating our dear \ncolleague from New Hampshire. First of all, I wish to congratulate him \nfor his leadership on this issue. I wish to congratulate him for the \nway that he has handled the issue. I hope that we are successful today \nin ending this procedure which I believe no civilized society can \ncondone.\n  This is not an issue that I had heard discussed before on the Senate \nfloor until one day I came over to the floor to speak on another \nsubject, and the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire was \ndescribing this procedure. Questions were raised as to whether someone \nmight be offended by the description. I rose simply to make the point \nthat if we are offended by the description of the procedure, surely we \nhave to be offended by the fact that the procedure is occurring in \nAmerica today.\n  I joined the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire as his original \ncosponsor when he introduced the bill. There were only two of us to \nbegin with on the bill. That number has grown.\n  I do not know that I can add much to this debate. But let me try to \nsum up my feelings on the issue. The Dole amendment, which is now \npending, removes any doubt about the fact that the life of the mother \nand any threat to the life of the mother is a defense for using this \nprocedure. If the mother's life is in danger, this procedure can be \nused.\n  So the question really boils down to whether a civilized society can \ncondone this procedure when the life of the mother is not at risk. And \nI submit this: We have heard the description. We have heard testimony \nof a nurse who witnessed this procedure first-hand. It really boils \ndown to this. This procedure is almost always used with a late-term \nbaby, which is generally viable outside the womb. And when the baby is \n3 inches away from the full protection of the Constitution, the baby's \nlife is terminated in a violent manner that I think is objectionable in \na civilized society.\n  The question is, Are we going to stop it? I remind my colleagues, \nthis is a vote about banning a procedure when the mother's life is not \nin danger. The child is delivered feet first, and when only the head of \nthe child remains in the womb, its life is terminated--just 3 inches \naway from the full protection of the Constitution.\n  This amendment bans no other type of abortion. It simply bans this \nprocedure, which I believe is offensive, and which I believe is \nunacceptable in a civilized society.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote for the Dole amendment because it \nformalizes what those of us who were for the Smith proposal to begin \nwith understood, and that is, the life of the mother exception was \nincluded to begin with. This further clarifies it for someone who is \nconcerned about that. And I think it is a legitimate concern, though I \nwas satisfied with the original language. But with the Dole amendment \nadopted, I think we have a clear-cut choice. I hope our colleagues will \nvote for the Dole amendment, against the Boxer amendment, and then vote \nfor the Smith proposal.\n  I think it is the right thing to do. I am very proud to associate \nmyself with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire on this issue. \nI reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I plan to yield to the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, \nin a moment.\n  I wanted to answer a couple points made by my friend from Texas. \nFirst, he did describe the usual life-of-the-mother exception, which we \nvoted on many times in the Senate, which is usually the Hyde language. \nThat is not the language in the Dole amendment. The language in the \nDole amendment, although described as life-of-the-mother, relates to a \nwoman with a preexisting condition, not to situations that we are \ntalking about where the woman's life is in danger due to the pregnancy \nitself.\n  So the only real life-of-the-mother exception is the Boxer amendment. \nBut we will support both Dole and Boxer because under the Dole \namendment two or three women may be saved a year. Under the Boxer \namendment you will save more women like Coreen and others. So we would \nadvise Senators to vote for both.\n\n  I want to say that I am very proud that we reached across the aisle \nhere and the Boxer amendment is supported by Senator Brown, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Snowe, and also on our side, Senators Murray, Moseley-\nBraun, and Lautenberg.\n  At this time I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Maine, Senator \nSnowe.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I rise in support of the \namendment that has been offered by my colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer. I think there is no question in light of the testimony \nthat was presented to the Judiciary Committee during a hearing on this \nlegislation, when many of us advocated that this legislation go to \ncommittee so that we would have a chance to hear first hand from those \nwomen who would be affected by this kind of legislation, that without a \ndoubt this amendment becomes even more important, more crucial, more \nvital to women's health.\n  Twenty-two years ago the Supreme Court handed down the Roe versus \nWade decision. It said that the woman's interest and decisions in \nreproductive matters should remain paramount. It also said the States \ncould ban abortion in the last trimester. But they also had to include \nexceptions for when the life and health of the mother is in danger--let \nme repeat--as long as they allowed exceptions for cases in which a \nwoman's life and health is endangered.\n  The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that decision time and time again. \nForty-one States ban abortion in the last trimester, but they provide \nexceptions for the life and health of the mother, as is \nconstitutionally required by the Roe versus Wade decision. That is what \nthe Boxer amendment does. It upholds that decision providing for the \nlife and health of the mother. The Supreme Court recognized, in its \nwisdom, that there would be certain limiting, exceptional, tragic \ncircumstances that may require an abortion in the final trimester. That \nis a decision that has to be made between the doctor and his patient.\n  Without such an exception, without providing for life and health \nexceptions, innocent women are harmed. I have been somewhat amazed by \nsome of the discussion that has taken place here on the floor. These \nare not casual decisions. These are not decisions that are made \nlightly. This procedure is not performed for sex selection.\n  These are tragic and compelling circumstances under which a woman has \nto make this decision. That was verified and reinforced by the \ntestimony presented by so many women before the Judiciary Committee \nrecently. It was compelling testimony. These are heart-wrenching \ndecisions and very difficult ones. These are procedures that are rarely \nperformed, seldom performed. But there are times in which they have to \nbe performed to save the life of the mother or to prevent drastic \nconsequences to her health. Those are the facts.\n\n  There have been 450 such procedures performed annually. They are so \nrare that they amount to 0.04 percent in the last trimester. Now we are \ntalking about criminalizing a procedure that can save the life and the \nhealth of the mother. Now we are saying that political judgment will \noverride medical judgment.\n  I cannot imagine that any doctor, under the language in this \nlegislation, if this amendment is not accepted, would be willing to \ntake an action that is the safest and the most appropriate course, \ngiven the criminal prosecution involved in this legislation, unless we \n\n[[Page S 18188]]\naccept the Boxer amendment that provides for the exception in cases of \nlife and health.\n  One doctor was quoted in the New York Times recently. He said, ``I \ndon't want to make medical decisions based on congressional language. I \ndon't want to be that vulnerable. It's not what I want for my \npatients.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator an additional 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 60 \nseconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Another doctor, Dr. Robinson, an OB-GYN at Johns Hopkins, \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Telling a doctor that it is illegal for him or her to \n     perform a procedure that is safest for a patient is \n     tantamount to legislating malpractice.\n\n  So what we are doing under this legislation if we do not accept the \nBoxer amendment is saying to doctors, we want you to perform more \ndangerous, more traumatic procedures for the woman, even if it is \nagainst their best medical advice; for example, caesarean sections, \nthat would require four times the risk of death as vaginal delivery. In \nfact, a woman is 14 times more likely to die from a caesarean section \nthan from the procedure that this legislation seeks to outlaw.\n  Induced labor carries a potentially life-threatening risk and \nthreatens the future fertility of women by potentially causing cervical \nlacerations and hysterectomies which leave women often unable to have \nchildren for the remainder of their lives.\n  As one professor said during the hearing, the only thing that this \nprocedure does is to channel women from one less risky abortion \nprocedure to another more risky abortion procedure. That is what we are \ndoing here. He said that the Government does not have a legitimate \ninterest in trying to discourage that.\n  I hope that we will not throw women's lives and women's health into \nlimbo by rejecting this legislation. I hope that they support the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do not need time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor yielding. I want to congratulate him on the work he has done. He \nhas been here many, many days and many, many hours debating a very \ndifficult, emotional issue.\n  I have been in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives now \nfor 5 years. I have never spoken on the floor of either body on the \nissue of abortion. I never felt in my heart comfortable coming to the \nfloor and talking about legislating the issue of abortion.\n  I thought, as do many folks who vote pro-life here, that the issue is \none that we have to educate and we have to change hearts and we have to \ngo out to the public and sensitize the public to the horrors of \nabortion in this country. I say that as someone who is pro-life, but I \nthink there are people who are pro-choice who believe also that \nabortion is wrong, it should be minimized in this country. So I always \nfelt uncomfortable talking about legislating abortion.\n  I have to say, I felt compelled to come up and talk about this. This \nis not about pro-life or pro-choice. This is about a horrific procedure \nthat should shock the conscience of anyone who has heard how this \nprocedure is done.\n  The Senator from Maine just said, ``Well, you are going to take folks \nand force them from one risky procedure to another risky procedure. \nThat may be true, but this risky procedure shocks the conscience of \nanyone who has heard it described. This is so horrific. There is some \nsort of moral code in this country. To see a baby three-quarters born \nhave scissors stuck in the back of their brain--where have we come as a \ncountry when we say, ``Well, we need a statute to prohibit that,''--\nthis is wrong.\n  I do not even think we should be having debate about it. One of the \nproblems I think many of us have who are pro-life, who are conservative \nis that we tend to argue facts and figures. I was ready to read you \nthat of the two doctors who performed the majority of these abortions, \nhalf of the babies who were born were perfectly healthy. One doctor \ntestified to that effect and nine of the flawed babies had cleft \npalate. Flawed babies.\n  We had Dr. Haskell, the other abortionist who does this, saying 80 \npercent of the abortions were purely elective abortions. So do not try \nto sell a bill of goods. Those are facts and figures.\n  I think what we have trouble with sometimes, as Republicans, is we \nput up charts, graphs, and numbers, and people just sort of glaze over. \nOn the other side, they are much smarter. There is Senator Boxer with \npictures of happy faces. There are no facts and figures.\n  There is no medical evidence to support that partial birth abortion \nis the right thing to do, this is the moral thing to do, that this is \nwhat our society should stand for. No, you put up pictures of happy, \nsmiling faces. You pull at the heartstrings on the other side and hope \nthat all the truth just gets pushed in the background.\n  There is an obvious truth here. There is an obvious truth here. You \nhave a baby, not what they like to refer to as, ``an intact dilation \nand extraction.'' That is the way they describe this. An intact \nprocedure. This intact thing is a baby, and it is three-quarters of the \nway delivered through the birth canal. It is not terminated, it is \nkilled.\n  Whether you are for abortions or against abortions, you cannot be for \ndoing this. It shocks the conscience of a society and should not--\nshould not--be a procedure that is sanctioned by this body.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes, and I am glad \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania is staying here because his remarks about \nthis family are the most outrageous thing I have ever heard.\n  The reason this family is smiling is because Coreen Costello was \npregnant with her daughter, Katherine Grace, and the dad's hand is on \nher stomach, and they are so excited about having this baby, their \nthird child.\n  This is a woman who is pro-life who found out that Katherine Grace \nhad a lethal neurological disorder and had been unable to move for 2 \nweeks.\n  Do you want facts? I will give you facts, sir.\n  The movements that Coreen had been feeling were not the healthy \nkicking of her baby. They were nothing more than bubbles in amniotic \nfluid which had puddled in her uterus rather than flowing through the \nbaby. The baby had not been able to move for months--not her eyelids, \nnot her tongue, nothing. The baby's chest cavity was unable to rise and \nfall to stretch her lungs to prepare them for air. Her lungs and her \nchest were left severely undeveloped, almost to the point of \nnonexistence. Her vital organs were atrophying.\n  The doctors told Coreen and her husband the baby was not going to \nsurvive, and they recommended terminating the pregnancy. She did not \nhave an option. Her doctor told her if she did not use this procedure, \nwhich you will vote to outlaw today, she would probably not live.\n  So when you stand up here and you talk about happy faces and you try \nto demean the other side, you ought to know your facts and, sir----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from California will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have no time to yield on my time. I will be glad to \nyield on your time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thirty seconds. You cannot have it both ways, Senator. \nYou cannot have it both ways. You cannot have a life-of-the-mother \nexception, claim her life is in jeopardy and say our bill does not take \ncare of that. If you are going to claim life-of-the-mother in her case, \nour bill covers that.\n  If you are going to claim that she had alternative procedures, like a \ncesarean or other kinds of procedures where she could have had an \nalternative, you cannot argue both sides of the story, Senator. You \nhave to argue the facts, just one side at a time. \n\n[[Page S 18189]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have read you the facts of the case. The \ndoctor said her life might be in danger. The doctor said for sure she \ncould suffer infertility. That is not excepted in your bill. As a \nmatter of fact, sir, when your bill was written, there was no exception \nat all, and the exception that is now in your bill would not cover her \nparticular case in any event because your exception only covers a \npreexisting condition. Therefore, the Boxer-Brown language is \nabsolutely essential to cover this particular case.\n  I will give you more facts, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania. The \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists represents 35,000 \nphysicians. They opposes this bill. They think it is dangerous.\n  The American Nurses Association, representing 2.2 million nurses, \noppose this bill. So those are just some of the facts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski as a \ncosponsor of the Boxer-Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1833. I \noppose it because it is a direct assault upon women's reproductive \nrights.\n  But let me first thank Senator Smith for agreeing to support the \nmotion which the Senate adopted on November 8. This motion called on \nthe Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on H.R. 1833, the so-called \npartial-birth abortion ban.\n  As my colleagues know, the committee held that hearing on November \n17. I believe the hearing process was very important. The issues raised \nby this bill are complex and sensitive. It is vital they be thoroughly \nexplored before the Senate votes on this legislation.\n  I believe both proponents and opponents of H.R. 1833 found the \nhearing most helpful. I think all would agree Senator Hatch conducted a \nfair and informative hearing. We heard from medical professionals, \nlegal and constitutional experts, and from the women themselves who \ncourageously shared their compelling and heartrending stories.\n  After reviewing all of the testimony, I am more convinced than ever \nthat Congress should not pass the bill before us. I heard nothing to \nchange my mind, and much to reinforce my deep concerns.\n  Let me tell you why I oppose this bill.\n  First, it intrudes on the doctor/patient relationship, by \ncriminalizing a specific medical procedure.\n  Second, it is poorly drafted. The bill's vague language will have a \nchilling effect on physicians who provide abortions.\n  Third, it provides no exceptions for cases involving threats to the \nlife and health of the woman.\n  Fourth, most significantly, it is a direct assault on Roe versus \nWade. In my view, the bill is part of a concerted effort to ban all \nabortions.\n  I oppose this bill because it is a dangerous and unwarranted \nintrusion on the doctor/patient relationship. It has an impact far \nbeyond the issue of abortion. For the first time, Congress would be \ndeciding what medical procedures a doctor can and cannot provide. This \nbill substitutes political reasoning for medical judgment. Congress, \nnot medical experts, would pass judgment on a medical procedure.\n  H.R. 1833 makes criminals of doctors, doing their best to serve the \npatient's needs, who perform the procedure banned by the bill. It makes \ncriminals of doctors even when in their expert opinion, the procedure \nis medically necessary to save a woman's life or prevent serious, \nadverse consequences to her health.\n  At the November 17 hearing, medical experts had very different views \non what the procedure involves, on what the medical alternatives would \nbe, and on what is best to safeguard a woman's life and health. If they \ncannot agree on this medical issue, how can we expect to legislate in \nthis area? This is reason enough why Congress should not intervene in \ndecisions on medical procedure.\n  I oppose this bill because it provides no true exception for the life \nand health needs of the woman. At the hearing, very compelling \ntestimony was offered by women who have faced the difficult decision to \nhave a late term abortion to save their lives or their health. These \nwere women who eagerly awaited the birth of their child.\n  Then a medical emergency occurred--one that threatened their lives or \nposed serious consequences to their health. Congress should not tell \nthese women, and others who face this most tragic and personal of \ndecisions, that they cannot have the medical procedure their physician \nrecommends to save their life, or their health, or their ability to \nhave a child in the future. Congress should not tell them that it knows \nbetter than their doctor what medical care they should be provided.\n  Senator Smith has offered an amendment to provide an exception for \ncases where the woman's life is at risk. I have some concerns about \nthis amendment. I fear it may not cover all situations where the life \nof the woman is threatened by continuing her pregnancy. And I am \nconcerned that, under his amendment, the burden of proof will still be \nplaced upon the physician. However, I will support his amendment. If it \nwill save even a few women who need a late term abortion to save their \nlives, I cannot oppose it.\n  But I believe it is absolutely essential that we pass the amendment \noffered by Senator Boxer. Her amendment provides clear, direct \nlanguage. It will enable physicians to use their expert medical \njudgment to act to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious, \nadverse consequences to her health.\n  Senator Boxer's amendment makes it clear that when a woman must \nchoose abortion late in pregnancy, she must have access to the safest \npossible procedure. And, physicians, not Senators, should make that \ndecision.\n  The Boxer amendment lets doctors be doctors. It trusts them to do \nwhat is right for their patients. It ensures that women's lives and \nhealth are not put at risk. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis essential amendment.\n  I oppose this bill because it is poorly drafted. It is filled with \nvague, nonmedical terminology. Much of the Judiciary Committee hearing \nwas spent debating what the bill meant. Witnesses and committee members \nalike could not agree on such basic questions as: How is the procedure \nin question actually performed? What procedure is the bill describing \nat all? What does partial birth mean?\n  If Congress passes H.R. 1833, and it is signed into law, I guarantee \nyou will open the door to endless litigation in an effort to sort out \nwhat the bill does and does not do.\n  The bill's vagueness creates a further problem, whether intentionally \nor not is unclear. This lack of clarity would have a chilling effect on \nabortion providers, who are trying to make the best decision for their \npatients. Physicians who are trying to do their duty to protect life or \nhealth, now will have to guess whether their decision might violate \nFederal law.\n  How many doctors will continue to perform this type of late term \nabortion, or any abortions at all, if faced with possible criminal or \ncivil liability. There is already a tremendous shortage of abortion \nproviders. The bill will make this shortage even greater. And, of \ncourse, that is part of the plan--to scare doctors from the field.\n  Doctors who provide abortion services already face death threats, \nfirebombings, and harassment at work and home. Now they will have to \nlook over their shoulder in fear of arrest. Who will be willing to \nprovide abortion services in that climate? And who will pay the price? \nWomen will pay the price, women trying to exercise their right to a \nlegal medical procedure.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I oppose this bill because it is a direct \nassault on Roe versus Wade. In Roe and all its subsequent rulings, the \nSupreme Court has consistently upheld the right of doctors to perform \nlate term abortions to protect life or health. The Court has allowed \nStates to ban post-viability abortions, but only when an exception for \nlife or health is provided.\n  The Court has maintained that a doctor's first duty is to the woman. \nHer \n\n[[Page S 18190]]\nlife and health must be the doctor's paramount concern. The doctor \ncannot trade off her life for the life of the fetus.\n  So, this bill, by ignoring the Court's requirement of a life and \nhealth exception is a direct challenge to Roe. And not the last \nchallenge. Proponents of this bill have made clear they want to ban all \nabortions, one procedure at a time, one woman at a time.\n  If they succeed in passing this bill, what procedure will they target \nnext? Which women will next be denied their right to choose? If we \nallow this bill to pass, even with the amendments which I hope will be \nadopted, Congress will have struck a major blow against reproductive \nrights.\n  Mr. President, the basic question is not what is decided, but who \ndecides. And the answer is, women and their doctors should decide, not \npoliticians. Women must have the right to make their own decisions on \nreproductive matters, in consultation with their physicians. That is \nwhat it means to be pro-choice, and that is why I will oppose this \nbill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me just say at the outset that I \nthink it is incredible that we are here today debating this bill. There \nare unfinished appropriations bills, and an unresolved Federal budget \nsituation that demand our full attention. I believe the American people \nwould prefer us to address the real issues of the day--issues that \naffect our hard-working families--and not this kind of divisive, \ninflammatory legislation.\n  Of course, the reality is that we are here and we are considering \nthis so-called partial-birth abortion ban, and there are a few things \nthat I want to say regarding the bill, and also to talk briefly about \nthe amendment offered by my friend, Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. President, I have listened carefully to this debate and I am \nincreasingly convinced that it is far from being a clear and narrowly \ndefined piece of legislation, as the proponents of the bill keep \nclaiming it to be. I find it to be a vaguely written and dangerous \nattempt to ban not just a single procedure. Rather, I see it as a way \nto instill fear and confusion in the doctors who perform abortions, and \nto deter them from performing a procedure that may help save a woman \nwhose life is in danger.\n  It seems clear to me this bill is about families who are faced with a \nterrible tragedy, and it is about the doctors who must make an expert \ndecision based on what they believe to be in the best interest of the \nmother. Frankly, this bill is about Congress muscling its way into the \ndoctor's office. It is not only presumptuous, it is unprecedented and \nit is dangerous. We are proposing to criminalize doctors, and I want to \ncaution each and every one of my colleagues to stop this legislation. \nLike Senator Boxer has said, this is a slippery slope we do not want to \nstart down.\n  But, unfortunately, it looks like there are Senators who are intent \non pressing on with this bill, and so we, at least, have to try and do \nwhat our colleagues in the House failed to do--to include an exception \nfor cases to save the life and health of the mother. Mr. President. The \nSenator from New Hampshire has offered an amendment which he claims \nprovides a life of the mother exception. Well, I will vote for his \namendment, because it is at least a step in the right direction.\n  But let's be honest. The amendment makes no room for instances where, \nin the medical judgment of the attending physician, the procedure would \nbe necessary to avert serious health consequences to the woman--\nconsequences such as severe hemorrhaging or paralysis.\n  Only the Boxer amendment can be considered a true life exception. \nOnly the Boxer amendment takes the health of women into account. Only \nthe Boxer amendment sends the right message to the families of this \nNation, to the women who are faced with an unimaginable tragedy. We \nhear, over and over again, graphic depictions of this procedure, but \nwhat of the vivid descriptions of the pain and torment these mothers \nhave gone through? Of the horror of losing a much wanted child? Of the \nfear that she will never again have a chance to have a baby?\n  Is there anyone here who honestly believes these women are choosing \nto have a late-term abortion? This insinuation is an affront to the \nwomen of this Nation. The small number of women who have late-term \nabortions do so because their doctors have determined it to be \nmedically necessary to save their lives and their health. End of story.\n  The Boxer amendment says: We respect you and will leave this \ndifficult decision where it belongs--between you, your doctor, and your \nGod. We think it is important to allow families to choose the procedure \nthat is best for them, to best protect the health of the woman and to \nbest safeguard her chances of being able to conceive again.\n  Without this amendment we send the women of this country the message: \n``We don't care about you, we don't respect your or your doctors. The \nU.S. Congress and the Federal Government know best.\n  Well, I don't believe Congress know best. We should leave this \ndifficult decision to the experts and to the families who are faced \nwith this tragedy. Congress has no place telling doctors what \nprocedures they can and cannot perform--we have never even considered \ngetting involved in the lives of physicians, and we shouldn't start \nnow. Not this way.\n  There is too much at stake, and I appeal to the common sense and \nhumanity of each Member of this Chamber: If you must pass this \nreprehensible bill, at least vote to include this critical \nmodification, and allow for exceptions in cases where women's health \nand lives are at stake.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Supreme Court has held in Roe versus \nWade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood versus Casey, that States can \nban late-term abortions except when necessary to preserve a woman's \nlife or health. Forty-one States have established postviability bans on \nabortion with exceptions to preserve a woman's life or health. Only one \nState has banned the intact D abortion procedure which is the \napparent subject of the bill before the Senate and that ban is being \nchallenged in the courts.\n  Forty-nine States have not banned this procedure. If the bill before \nthe Senate becomes law, the Federal Government would dictate the \nregulation of abortion by banning a specific abortion procedure. This \nFederal ban in this bill would even apply to abortions performed \npreviability, that is, in the second trimester and the bill does not \ncontain the exception required by Roe, to preserve a woman's health.\n  Some physicians believe the intact D abortion procedure represents \nthe safest late-term abortion option. Others disagree. Politicians are \nnot equipped to make decisions banning specific medical procedures when \nthe medical community itself cannot even reach agreement on these \ndecisions. We should not be voting to criminalize a specific medical \nprocedure when doctors themselves are divided on the matter.\n  If a physician is engaged in any inappropriate medical practice, the \nmedical establishment has systems of peer and professional review in \nevery State to deal with it. These systems of review include State \nmedical boards and peer review on hospital review boards that police \ntheir membership. They should be the ones to ban a procedure if they \ndetermine it to be inappropriate.\n  But physicians and their review processes have not banned this \nprocedure. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, an organization representing more than 35,000 physicians \nthat specialize in this area of medicine, oppose the bill before us. It \nwrote, in a letter to majority leader Dole, that:\n\n       The College finds very disturbing that Congress would take \n     any action that would supersede the medical judgment of \n     trained physicians and criminalize medical procedures that \n     may be necessary to save the life of a woman.\n\n  The American Medical Women's Association, Inc., representing 13,000 \nwoman physicians, has also said of the bill:\n\n       This legislation represents a serious impingement on the \n     rights of physicians to determine appropriate medical \n     management for individual patients.\n\n  In addition, the American Nurses Association, the only full-service \nprofessional organization representing the Nation's 2.2 million \nregistered nurses through its 53 constituent associations, oppose the \nbill. Their letter states:\n\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an \n\n[[Page S 18191]]\n     inappropriate intrusion of the federal government into a therapeutic \n     decision that should be left in the hands of a pregnant woman \n     and her health care provider.\n\n  I also received letters from physicians in Michigan familiar with \nthis field of medicine opposing the proposed ban of the intact D \nabortion procedure. I ask unanimous consent to insert those letters in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. SIMPSON. This bill would criminalize a so-called partial birth \nabortion which is defined by the bill as, ``an abortion in which the \nperson performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living \nfetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' Senator \nHatch referred to a statement by Dr. Haskell, a physician who has \nperformed many intact D abortion procedures, that only about one-\nthird of the fetuses he extracted using the procedure were dead.\n  My question is, in the one-third of the intact D abortion \nprocedures he performed where the fetuses were dead, did Dr. Haskell \nknow before beginning the procedure if those fetuses were dead? If he, \nand any other physicians in this situation, did not, they were taking a \nrisk by beginning a procedure that could be a criminal act under the \nterms of this bill.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and others have said that Coreen \nCostello's abortion was not a partial birth abortion, presumably \nbecause she said the ``fetus passed away peacefully in the womb.''\n  Did the physician know when he began the procedure whether the fetus \nwas alive or dead? If a physician doesn't know for sure before \nbeginning an abortion procedure whether the fetus is alive or dead, \nwouldn't the physician who starts down the path of performing the \nprocedure be facing the possibility of criminal prosecution under the \nterms of this bill?\n  In addition, the physician who performed the intact D procedure on \nMrs. Costello might not be sure when he began the procedure if the \nfetus would be alive or dead when extracted since there is a range of \nfetal response to the anesthesia administered in an intact D \nabortion, the procedure that Mrs. Costello underwent.\n  The performance of that procedure might then be considered an attempt \nat committing a crime even if the fetus turned out to be dead upon \ndelivery. The procedure Mrs. Costello underwent thus could be covered \nby this bill and the physician that performed it subject to Federal \ncriminal prosecution even if the fetus turned out to be dead when \ndelivered.\n  While banning one abortion procedure, this bill leaves legal other \nabortion procedures which can be used in later-term pregnancies. Are \nthose other procedures as safe for the mother? Are they any less \ndestructive to the fetus? Why are the other procedures left legal when \nsome have argued they are less safe for the mother, while this one \nprocedure, which some physicians believe is the safest for the mother, \nis made criminal?\n  These other procedures that are left legal under this bill include \ninducing labor and delivery with drugs despite evidence of risk to the \nwoman. A caesarean operation called a hysterotomy, which could result \nin severe bleeding, infection and even death for the woman, is also \nleft legal, even in the third trimester to preserve the woman's life. \nAnother procedure that would be left legal under this bill is called \nstandard D which is performed in the second trimester and does not \ndeliver the fetus intact, but removes the fetus from the uterus piece \nby piece.\n  In conclusion, the Supreme Court has held that States can ban late-\nterm abortions except when necessary to protect a woman's life or \nhealth. Forty-one States have done that. But only one State has banned \nthe intact D abortion procedure, and that ban is being challenged in \nthe courts.\n  Forty-nine States have not acted to ban intact D The medical \nprofession's own self-regulating system has also not acted to ban \nintact D The U.S. Senate is not equipped to make this technical \nmedical decision.\n  The bill under consideration today would ban abortions using this \nprocedure even in the second trimester and it does not allow for an \nexception required by Roe, to preserve a woman's health.\n  Finally, this bill establishes Federal criminal penalties for a \nspecific abortion procedure which may be the safest alternative for the \nmother while permitting other abortion procedures that could be less \nsafe for the mother. We should leave this issue to the medical \nprofession and the State legislatures, where it now and where it \nbelongs.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1995.\n     Hon.

The College finds \n     very disturbing that Congress would take any action that \n     would supersede the medical judgment of trained physicians \n     and criminalize medical procedures that may be necessary to \n     save the life of a woman. Moreover, in defining what medical \n     procedures doctors may or may not perform, HR 1833 employs \n     terminology that is not even recognized in the medical \n     community--demonstrating why Congressional opinion should \n     never be substituted for professional medical judgment.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Ralph W.

AMWA \n     recently passed resolution 15, which opposes federal \n     legislation banning this or any other medical procedure \n     determined to be of benefit to patients, at its annual House \n     of Delegates Meeting.\n       AMWA urges the Senate to carefully consider the \n     implications that its support of this legislation will have \n     on the practice of medicine. We encourage the Senate to \n     actively oppose S. 939 as legislation which unduly interferes \n     with the physician-patient relationship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Jean L. Fourcroy, MD, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl M. Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing to express the opposition \n     of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1833, the \n     ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995'', which is \n     scheduled to be considered by the Senate this week. This \n     legislation would impose Federal criminal penalties and \n     provide for civil actions against health care providers who \n     perform certain late-term abortions.\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider. ANA has long supported freedom of choice and \n     equitable access of all women to basic health services, \n     including services related to reproductive health. This \n     legislation would impose a significant barrier to those \n     principles.\n       Furthermore, very few of those late-term abortions are \n     performed each year and they are usually necessary either to \n     protect the life of the mother or because of severe fetal \n     abnormalities.

I am absolutely \n     opposed to political intervention in the practice of \n     medicine.\n       As a practicing OB-Gyn, I cannot begin to cite the \n     ramifications of such a bill. If passed, it will prevent me \n     from providing the best possible care for my patients in \n     emergency situations. The D procedure is the safest option \n     for many women faced with medical emergencies during \n     pregnancy. It is done only in extreme situations, such as \n     when a woman's life is in danger or when a fetus has severe \n     abnormalities that are incompatible with life. This bill \n     endangers the lives of women, who are already making \n     heartwrenching decisions.\n       I find it very disturbing that the Senate would take any \n     action that would overrule the judgment of trained \n     physicians. As a physician, I and others like myself, would \n     find it frightening that my government would prevent me from \n     providing the best possible care for my patients. Please do \n     not lot this happen.\n           Sincerely,\n     Samuel Edwin, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Department of Dermatology,\n\n\n                                          Henry Ford Hospital,\n\n                                    Detroit, MI, November 6, 1995.\n     Re Bills to limit physician abortion procedures.\n\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am very upset to hear proposed \n     legislation to make criminal various surgical procedures \n     performed by physicians. I realize the legislation is being \n     introduced as a method to limit abortion. However I am \n     incensed that non-physicians are trying to limit the scope of \n     medical practice, and make it criminal as well!\n       Personally I feel it is the woman's right to choose, and as \n     men, we should not interfere. But as a physician it is a \n     slippery slope for non-physicians to limit our practices \n     especially for political means.\n       Please block this legislation!\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Tor Shwayder, M.D.,\n         Director, Pediatric Dermatology; Fellow, American \n           Academies of Pediatrics & Dermatology.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1833.\n  I do so because this legislation raises serious policy, legal and \nmedical issues.\n  H.R. 1833 seeks to impose criminal sanctions upon physicians who \nperform certain types of late term abortions.\n  It is important, Mr. President, to understand that very few late term \nabortions take place in this country, under any circumstances. It is \nestimated that there are approximately 600 abortions annually performed \nin the third trimester of pregnancy, with about 450 done by what is \ncalled an intact D procedure. The procedure which would be banned \nunder this legislation is a form of an intact D procedure. Late-term \nabortions take place under the most tragic of circumstances, where \nsomething has gone wrong with the pregnancy. Late-term abortions are \nphysically difficult and emotionally devastating to the women involved \nand their families. Several women who were forced to have such an \nabortion testified at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the \npain and anguish they and their families had experienced.\n  This bill would place the Federal Government into the role of \ndeciding what procedures a physician can or cannot use in performing a \nlate-term abortion. It would substitute the judgment of Congress for \nthe judgment of the individual physician performing an abortion.\n  I believe that such legislation is bad policy. The American people \nhave repeatedly said that they want less government interference in \ntheir lives. This bill moves in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Since the beginning of the 104th Congress, there has been a great \ndeal of rhetoric about how we need to restrain the Federal Government, \nabout how the Federal Government has usurped the powers of State and \nlocal government entities, and about how the Federal Government has \nintervened in areas beyond its primary realm of responsibility. We have \nheard repeatedly that we need fewer Federal mandates and fewer Federal \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I agree with a good deal of those \nsentiments. I believe that the Federal Government has gone too far in \nmany areas. That is one reason why I voted against last year's Federal \ncrime bill and this year's terrorism bill. In each instance, I saw \nexamples of the Federal Government overzealously reaching into areas of \nlaw which have traditionally been within the jurisdiction of State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies.\n  I voted for the unfunded mandate legislation because I agree that the \nFederal Government needs to exercise restraint in forcing the States to \ncomply with Federal mandates. I support many aspects of the regulatory \nreform drive because we do need greater flexibility and less Federal \nmicromanagement in many areas.\n  But now, Mr. President, we are presented with legislation that places \nthe Federal Government in the role of deciding what specific procedures \na physician should use or not use when faced with a problem pregnancy \nand a woman's desire to terminate that pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, there are many reasons why this is a dangerous area \nfor Federal Government intervention. One of the physicians said it well \nduring the Judiciary Committee hearing on November 17. Dr. J. Courtland \nRobinson testified:\n\n       Sometimes, as any doctor will tell you, you begin a \n     surgical procedure expecting it to go one way, only to \n     discover that the unique demands of the case require that you \n     do something different. Telling a physician that it is \n     illegal for him or her to adapt his or her surgical methods \n     for the safety of the patient . . . flies in the face of \n     standards for quality medical care.\n\n  Dr. Robinson also pointed out in his testimony that many physicians \nwould not undertake a surgery at all if they were legally prohibited \nfrom completing it in the safest, most effective way, according to \ntheir professional judgment.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate that the measure under \nconsideration would insert the Federal Government into one of the most \nintensely private and personal areas. This bill would have Congress \noverride the decisions made by a woman and her physician in an area \nthat literally involves life or death.\n  It is ironic that many of the same individuals who strongly \nchallenged the ability of the Federal Government to handle \ncomprehensive health care reform are among the foremost proponents of \nthis effort to insert the Federal Government into a physician's \ndecisions in the operating room.\n  For example, during last year's health care debate, the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) asked:\n\n       Do you want the Federal Government, the Government that \n     operates your postal system to decide whether you should have \n     an operation or not? With this kind of government \n     intervention, what is left for the doctor and the patient to \n     decide?\n\n  Yet, that is precisely the kind of intervention that is being \nproposed by this legislation. This measure says that a physician who \ndetermines that a specific procedure is necessary to protect the life \nor health of his or her patient may face a Federal criminal prosecution \nfor exercising his professional judgment.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to note that the language of this \nbill is so vague that a number of physicians have indicated that they \nwould simply stop performing late-term abortions rather than run the \nrisk of criminal prosecution or endangering the life or health of their \npatient. Dr. Robinson told the committee:\n\n       For many physicians, this law would amount to a ban on a \n     D [procedure] entirely the law is so vague and based on \n     erroneous assumptions, it would leave doctors wondering if \n     they were open to prosecution or not each time they \n     performed a late abortion. That means that by banning this \n     technique, you would in practice ban most later abortions \n     altogether by making them virtually unavailable. And that \n     means that women will probably die.\n\n  Dr. Robinson, incidently, is a former Presbyterian missionary who has \npracticed medicine for more than 40 years. He described for the \ncommittee his exposure to the consequences of illegal abortions prior \nto the Roe decision. He testified that over a period of five years on \nthe staff of a hospital in New York, he watched women die from \nabortions that were improperly performed. His concerns about the \nconsequences of legislation that would make certain types of abortions \nillegal and deny women access to the safest abortion procedure for \ntheir individual circumstances were clearly an outgrowth of his \nfamiliarity with what happens when Government treads too \n\n[[Page S 18193]]\nfar into what should be a decision made by a woman and her physician.\n  Mr. President, that brings me to a second policy concern regarding \nthis legislation. On its face, H.R. 1833 seeks to criminalize the \nperformance of a particular type of abortion. Yet, Mr. President, there \nis little doubt that the purpose behind this legislation is to begin \nthe process of curtailing and ultimately denying all access to legal \nabortion.\n  When pressed, many of the proponents of H.R. 1833 will admit the \ntruth of this assertion.\n  One of the major House proponents, Congressman Chris Smith (R. N.J.) \nstated in a November 9, 1995, USA Today article, `` We will begin to \nfocus on the methods [of abortion] and declare them to be illegal.''\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing on this measure, I asked one of \nthe proponents, Helen Alvare, Director of Planning and Information, \nSecretariat for Pro-Life Activities of the National Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, whether all methods of abortion should be \ncriminalized. The response I received was very clear. Ms. Alvare stated \nher view that ``every single kind of procedure that takes an unborn \nlife'' should be outlawed.\n  Mr. President, I specifically asked whether that included nonsurgical \nforms of abortion, such as the use of a drug like RU-486 which leads to \nthe termination of a pregnancy in the very early stages, the first few \nweeks. The answer was yes, and Ms. Alvare was very clear that she found \nthe use of an abortifacient drug at the earliest stages of a pregnancy \nto be as objectionable as the procedure under discussion.\n  Mr. President, I think the record should also note that in the past \nthere have been efforts to ban other methods of abortion which the \nproponents of this legislation now point to as remaining available \nshould this ban be enacted into law. For example, in 1976, in Planned \nParenthood versus Danforth, the Supreme Court struck down a Missouri \nstatute which would have prohibited saline abortion procedures after \nthe first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n  It is clear that this legislation is part of a calculated plan to \nmake abortion more difficult for women and their physicians. It is part \nof a calculated plan to limit and erode a woman's ability to exercise \nher constitutionally protected rights. We cannot lose sight of the fact \nthat Dr. Robinson's memories of a time when abortion was illegal and \nwomen died from illegal abortions might become a reality again if these \nefforts are successful.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus now upon an important aspect of the \nJudiciary Committee hearings dealing with why this particular procedure \nmight, in the judgment of a woman's attending physician, be the most \nappropriate in light of her individual circumstances.\n  Mr. President, throughout this debate, different physicians who \ntestified at the Judiciary Committee hearing will be quoted as to their \nview regarding whether the procedure under discussion is more or less \nsafe for a woman than other procedures, whether the procedure may be \nnecessary in a particular situation to protect a woman's future ability \nto bear children, and precisely what the procedure is that would be \nbanned under this legislation.\n  What occurred at the hearing, Mr. President, was a professional \ndisagreement among members of the medical community on the efficacy and \nrisks associated with various abortion procedures. That members of the \nmedical community have different opinions on these issues is both \nunderstandable and expected.\n  It is also precisely the reason why trained physicians and their \npatients, not members of the Congress, should make the decisions about \nwhat course of treatment is appropriate in individual situations.\n  The ability to choose between alternative courses of medical \ntreatment and the ability to choose between physicians who favor one \nprocedure over another is something that we often take for granted.\n  Physicians who themselves do not choose to perform the type of \nprocedure at issue have also made it clear that they do not believe \nCongress should be legislating in this area. In particular, Dr. Warren \nM. Hern of Boulder, Colorado, a physician who performs late-term \nabortions has been quoted by proponents of H.R. 1833 as having \nreservations about this particular procedure. However, in his testimony \nsubmitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 17, 1995, he \noutlined the possible advantages of using the intact D procedure, \nincluding a reduction of the risk of perforation of the uterus and \nreducing the risk of embolism of cerebral tissue into the woman's blood \nstream. He concluded by stating:\n\n       While I may choose a different method of performing a late \n     abortion, I support the right of my medical colleagues to use \n     whatever methods they deem appropriate to protect the woman's \n     safety during this difficult procedure. It is simply not \n     possible for others to second guess the surgeon's judgment \n     in the operating room. That would be dangerous and \n     unacceptable.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not sure that it is appropriate for Members of \nCongress to even try to resolve a matter that is the subject of debate \nbetween physicians as to whether there are situations where this \nprocedure is preferable to another procedure. It is clear from the \ntestimony at the Judiciary hearing that there are respectable \ndifferences of opinion in this area.\n  For example, Dr. Mary Campbell, medical director of Planned \nParenthood of Washington, DC, testified there were a number of \nsituations where alternative abortion procedures such as induction or \ncesarean section are considered less safe than an intact D procedure. \nFor example, Dr. Campbell testified that ``a woman is twice as likely \nto die'' with an induction procedure, an alternative abortion procedure \nin a late-term pregnancy. She further testified that a cesarean section \nwas another option, but that a woman was 14 times as likely to die with \na Cesarean hysterotomy as with a D procedure.\n  Dr. Campbell outlined her views as to why the intact D procedure \nwas preferable in certain cases. According to Dr. Campbell, the \nprocedure requires less dilation of the cervix and thus markedly \ndecreases the chances of cervical lacerations and cervical incompetence \nwhich can adversely affect future pregnancies. She also testified that \nthe uterine scar, especially from the kind of vertical incision most \noften used in cesarean sections involving abnormal preterm fetuses, \ncreates an increased risk of uterine rupture in future pregnancies.\n  Dr. Robinson testified with the same concerns about the risks posed \nby alternative procedures. In response to my question, Dr. Robinson \ntestified that a vertical scar in the uterus resulting from such a \ncesarean was definitely an increased hazard when a woman has a \nsubsequent pregnancy.\n  Included in the hearing record are letters from Dr. Elaine Carlson of \nCedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles indicating that alternative \nprocedures can cause a traumatic stretching of the cervix that then \nincreases a woman's changes for infertility in the future and from Dr. \nGeorge Henry of Denver, CO, indicating similar concerns. Dr. Henry, in \na subsequent letter to me elaborated on the risks to both a woman's \nlife and her future ability to bear children from a cesarean section \ntype of surgical approach. ``Such a surgery,'' Dr. Henry wrote, \n``exposes the patient herself to much greater medical risk immediately \nand also increases the need for repeat C- sections in future \npregnancies as well as the risk of uterine rupture in future \npregnancies because of the uterine scar--and even the potential loss of \nthe uterus if emergency hysterectomy is required.''\n  Other witnesses, proponents of this legislation, disagreed and stated \ntheir view that the intact D procedure was more risky than the other \nprocedures, and that there were no circumstances where they would \nconsider this procedure necessary to protect the life or health of the \nwoman.\n  Mr. President, what this debate told me is that there is room for \ndisagreement between physicians about specific medical procedures; it \nis not for Congress to determine which side of this debate is right or \nwrong. These are medical questions which ought to be decided by medical \nprofessionals, not Members of Congress. Congress ought not to tie the \nhands of a physician trying to make the best decision for his or her \npatient. As Dr. Robinson testified, ``The physician needs to be able to \ndecide, in consultation with the patient and based upon her specific \nphysical \n\n[[Page S 18194]]\nand emotional needs, what is the appropriate method. The practice of \nmedicine by committee or legislature is not good for patients or for \nmedicine in general.''\n  Mr. President, the reasons why Congress ought to stay out of this \ndecisionmaking process was also eloquently made by several women who \nhad made the difficult choice of choosing this procedure when a much \nwanted pregnancy has turned into a tragedy.\n  Coreen Costello testified:\n\n       It deeply saddens me that you are making a decision having \n     never walked in our shoes. When families like ours are given \n     this kind of tragic news, the last people we want to seek \n     advise from are politicians. We talk to our doctors, lots of \n     doctors. We talk to our families and other loved ones, and we \n     ponder long and hard into the night with God.\n\n  Mr. President, we ought to heed those words. These decisions are \nprivate, personal decisions to be made by the families involved, guided \nby their physicians. The Federal Government ought to leave these \ndecisions with the people involved.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me briefly address the Constitutional \nissues raised by this legislation.\n  H.R. 1833, in my view, is fatally flawed because it fails to \nadequately provide protections for procedures necessary to preserve or \nprotect a woman's life or health. Roe vs. Wade, and the cases that have \nfollowed including Casey, have made it clear that States have the \nauthority to restrict and even ban abortions after fetal viability \nexcept where necessary to protect a woman's life or health. H.R. 1833 \nas originally proposed included an utterly inadequate provision \nallowing only an affirmative defense to be asserted by the physician \nthat the procedure was necessary to protect a woman's life. In other \nwords, a physician who performs this procedure in order to save a \nwoman's life could be hauled into a Federal court and prosecuted for \nviolating this statute. The physician would only be able to raise as a \ndefense that the procedure was performed to save a woman's life. It is \nonly after extensive debate that the proponents of H.R. 1833 proposed \nto change their language to provide an explicit exception from the \nstatute's coverage for a procedure necessary to preserve a woman's \nlife. However, the amendment they have offered contains limitations \nupon the life of the mother exception which also raise questions as to \nwhether it comports with the standard set forth in Roe v. Wade.\n\n  Moreover, the proponents have failed to even acknowledge the \nrequirement that an exception be provided where the procedure is \nnecessary to protect a woman's health, including her future ability to \nbear children. The proponents argue that such an exception is \nunnecessary because alternative procedures are available. Those \narguments fail to acknowledge the medical disagreement over whether \nsuch alternative procedures pose greater risks to the woman's health. \nThe proponents of this legislation seem to take the view that even if \nan alternative procedure would result in a woman being unable to bear a \nchild in the future, that is an adequate alternative.\n  Mr. President, I find this to be a particularly harsh judgement to be \nimposed upon families who have experienced the tragic end to a much-\nsought pregnancy. To tell a woman and her family that Congress will not \nallow her doctor to use a procedure which will allow her a greater \nchance to be able to have another pregnancy and bear a child in the \nfuture is cruel and unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by reiterating again that this \nlegislation would insert the Federal Government into one of the most \nprivate, personal decisions a woman and her family and her physician \nmust face. The American people have said time and again they want less \nGovernment intrusion into their lives, not more. This bill is in every \nway an inappropriate extension of power by the Federal Government into \nthe lives of individual Americans at a very traumatic and emotion \npoint. It ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President. A month ago, the Senate chose to refer to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee a bill which would ban from use a \nmedical procedure currently used to terminate late-term pregnancies. I \nsupported that referral because it was unclear what all of the \nramifications of such a ban were and the Senate deserved the \nopportunity to have a complete record upon which to make an informed \ndecision regarding this complex and controversial issue.\n  Today, we have that record before us. I thank the members of the \ncommittee for their thorough and detailed work in exploring this \ndifficult matter and based on that record, I have come to the \nconclusion that I will oppose this legislation.\n  I do so because I believe that the bill goes too far in its virtual \nban of the use of this procedure, despite the fact that in many cases \nmedical professionals believe that it is the safest means to terminate \ntroubled and tragic late-term pregnancies. I believe that medical \ndoctors, following the constitutional guidelines under which abortion \nis legal and following consultation with a woman and her family, should \nbe able to choose the medical procedure he or she deems most \nappropriate to terminate a pregnancy without facing criminal or civil \npenalties. Indeed, criminalizing a medical procedure in the manner \nproposed in the bill would be the first such time we have done so in \nour country's history.\n  I do not come to this position lightly. I, and I believe virtually \nall Americans, am disturbed with the harsh realities that this issue \nforces our human conscience to acknowledge. In the end, however, I \nbelieve that it is not the place of Congress to interject itself in \nthis manner into the tragic personal decisions that women and families \nmust face. I do believe it should be a rarely used procedure and in \nthat regard have been informed that there is no recollection of it \nbeing used in my State of Rhode Island. Indeed, there are only a \nhandful of practices throughout the country that utilize it and the \ntotal number of cases amount to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \ntotal abortions. I also believe that the heightened scrutiny that this \nprocedure has received will reduce those occasions when it is used \ninappropriately. In the end, however, I believe that it should remain \nan option available to doctors when they deem it medically necessary in \norder to terminate a pregnancy.\n  By way of conclusion, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from the New York Times written by a woman who went \nthrough this procedure. I believe it eloquently makes the case that it \nwould be wrong to enact the outright ban contained in this bill for \nthis procedure and, accordingly, that this option should remain \navailable to women and families of this country.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the New York Times, November 29, 1995]\n\n                           Giving Up My Baby\n\n                          (By Coreen Costello)\n\n       Those who want Congress to ban a controversial late-term \n     abortion technique might think I would be an ally. I was \n     raised in a conservative, religious family. My parents are \n     Rush Limbaugh fans. I'm a Republican who always believed that \n     abortion was wrong.\n       Then I had one.\n       It wasn't supposed to be that way. My little girl, \n     Katherine Grace, was supposed to have been born in the \n     summer. The births of my two other children had been easy, \n     and my husband and I planned a home delivery.\n       But disaster struck in my seventh month. Ultrasound testing \n     showed that something was terribly wrong with my baby. \n     Because of a lethal neuromuscular disease, her body had \n     stiffened up inside my uterus. She hadn't been able to move \n     any part of her tiny self for at least two months. Her lungs \n     had been unable to stretch to prepare them for air.\n       Our doctors told us that Katherine Grace could not survive, \n     and that her condition made giving birth dangerous for me--\n     possibly even life-threatening. Because she could not absorb \n     amniotic fluid, it had gathered in my uterus to such \n     dangerous levels that I weighed as much as if I were at full \n     term.\n       I carried my daughter for two more agonizing weeks. If I \n     couldn't save her life, how could I spare her pain? How could \n     I make her passing peaceful and dignified? At first I wanted \n     the doctors to induce labor, but they told me that Katherine \n     was wedged so tightly in my pelvis that there was a good \n     chance my uterus would rupture. We talked about a Caesarean \n     section. But they said that this, too, would have been too \n     dangerous for me.\n       Finally we confronted the painful reality: our only real \n     option was to terminate the pregnancy. Geneticists at Cedars-\n     Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles referred us to a doctor \n     who specialized in cases like ours. He knew how much pain we \n     were going through, and said he would help us end Katherine's \n\n\n[[Page S 18195]]\n     pain in the way that would be safest for me and allow me to have more \n     children.\n       That's just what happened. For two days, my cervix was \n     dilated until the doctor could bring Katherine out without \n     injuring me. Her heart was barely beating. As I was placed \n     under anesthesia, it stopped. She simply went to sleep and \n     did not wake up. The doctor then used a needle to remove \n     fluid from the baby's head so she could fit through the \n     cervix.\n       When it was over, they brought Katherine in to us. She was \n     wrapped in a blanket. My husband and I held her and sobbed. \n     She was absolutely beautiful. Giving her back was the hardest \n     thing I've ever done.\n       After Katherine, I didn't think I would have more children. \n     I couldn't imaging living with the worry for nine months, \n     imagining all the things that could go wrong. But my doctor \n     changed that. ``You're a great mother,'' he told me. ``If you \n     want more kids, you should have them.'' I'm pregnant again, \n     due in June.\n       I still have mixed feelings about abortion. But I have no \n     mixed feelings about the bill, already passed by the House \n     and being considered in the Senate, that would ban the \n     surgical procedure I had, called intact dilation and \n     evacuation. As I watched the Senate debate on C-Span this \n     month, I was sick at heart. Senator after senator talked \n     about the procedure I underwent as if they had seen one, and \n     senator after senator got it wrong. Katherine was not \n     cavalierly pulled halfway out and stabbed with scissors, as \n     some senators described the process.\n       I had one of the safest, gentlest, most compassionate ways \n     of ending a pregnancy that had no hope. I will probably never \n     have to go through such an ordeal again. But other women, \n     other families, will receive devastating news and have to \n     make decisions like mine. Congress has no place in our \n     tragedies.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Hampshire \nhas 12 minutes and 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues are listening \ncarefully at this stage of the debate, because we are down now to where \nwe are about to vote on two very important amendments related to this \nbill.\n  Senator Boxer has taken the time to go through two very compelling \ncases, very tragic cases. Both of those women testified before the \nJudiciary Committee, and that was heart-rending testimony.\n  I viewed the testimony. I have read it. There is only one problem, \nand I have said it, Senator DeWine has said it and others have said \nit: These women did not have partial-birth abortions. I will repeat, \nthese women did not have partial-birth abortions. Coreen Costello and \nViki Wilson did not have partial-birth abortions. Senator Boxer knows \nthat, and both of the young women know that. A partial-birth abortion \nspecifically is killing a child who is 90 percent born through the \nbirth canal by the use of the catheter and the scissors.\n\n  Now, let me read from the testimony of Coreen Costello:\n\n       When I was put under anesthesia, Katherine's heart stopped. \n     She was able to pass away peacefully inside my womb, which \n     was the most comfortable place for her to be. When I awoke a \n     few hours later, she was brought to us. She was beautiful. \n     She was not missing any part of her brain. She had not been \n     stabbed in the head with scissors. She looked peaceful.\n\n  Mr. President, that is my point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, that picture is not factual, \nright? That picture is not factual, is it?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me on my own time?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will place in the Record a letter from these women, and \nI will read it later, which completely makes the statement that this \nparticular procedure that they underwent is, in fact, the procedure \nthat would be outlawed. And, in fact, the doctor that was vilified in \nthis debate--by name, Dr. McMahon--and was summoned before the House \ncommittee is the doctor that performed the intact dilation and \nevacuation procedure. These women are completely upset, and here is a \nquote from the first sentence:\n\n       We are shocked and outraged--\n\n  This is to Senator Smith.\n\n     --at attempts by you and other Members of the Senate to \n     dismiss our significance as witnesses against the partial-\n     birth abortion ban.\n\n  I have to tell you Senators, you can fight this and you may well have \nthe votes. But do not demean these women. I have to say, Viki Wilson, \nwho you said yesterday did not have this procedure, had Dr. McMahon as \na doctor. She is a registered nurse. Her husband is a physician in an \nemergency room. They both know this bill. They say what Viki underwent \nis exactly what is described in the bill.\n  So if we are going to have an argument every time I bring out another \nfamily, and you are going to say they are excepted, are we going to \nwrite legislation like that?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President, when you look out the \nwindow and it is raining, and the person sitting next to you says it is \nnot raining--I mean, you can argue this, but facts are facts. I am not \ndemeaning the testimony of Viki Wilson or Coreen Costello. They were \nvery, very moving stories. This Senator was very moved by those \nstories. But they are not partial-birth abortions.\n  This Senator's bill, and all the amendments we are talking about on \nthe bill, does not stop the procedure that Viki Wilson and Coreen \nCostello had.\n  I will now repeat and read verbatim from the testimony of Viki \nWilson. Please listen carefully and make your own judgment.\n  Viki Wilson said:\n\n       My daughter died with dignity inside my womb. She was not \n     stabbed in the back of the head with scissors. No one dragged \n     her out half alive and killed her. We would never have \n     allowed that.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield. So the second picture the \nSenator from California has up there is also not factual, is that true?\n  Mr. SMITH. It is a fact that that is the family, but it is not a fact \nthat they had a partial-birth abortion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So we are going to continue to throw pictures up, and \nthat is how we are going to deal with facts.\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes. This bill is very clear and specific, and it outlines \nthis procedure in the birth canal. That is all this allows. I say that \nin sincerity to the Senator because I know he feels very strongly. I \nmust say to him, that is the fact.\n  Why Senators would come down here and testify to things that are not \naccurate, you will have to ask them. Listen, here is the exact language \nof my bill:\n\n       The term partial-birth abortion means an abortion in which \n     the person performing the abortion partially, vaginally \n     delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and \n     completing the delivery.\n\n  When I read the testimony of the two women, both of them said their \nchild died in their womb peacefully. Now, dying in womb peacefully--\ndoes that say ``an abortion in which the person performing the abortion \npartially, vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus \nand completing the delivery''? That is what this bill stops. That is \nall it stops. That is all it says. That is exactly what it says.\n  I say to my colleagues, no matter how you feel on the issue, please, \nat least accept facts as being facts. This is the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. We have an obligation to tell the truth. That is not the truth, \nwhat Senator Boxer is saying. Whether it is meant to be or thought to \nbe is another issue. But it is not fact. I know what my bill says. That \nis what it says. I just read it to you.\n\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield 2 minutes to myself and ask to be notified when \nthe 2 minutes are up.\n  Let me just say that this Dole-Smith amendment provides a life-of-\nthe-mother exception. We had an affirmative defense in the bill. \nMembers came to me and said, ``We want it a little more clarified.'' I \nsaid, ``Fine,'' and we clarified it because I think Senators sincerely \nhad a concern about that--even though there have been no witnesses to \ntestify that the mother's life was ever a problem. Let me just say that \nthis applies to any situation in which a pregnant woman's life is \nphysically threatened by any pregnancy, complication, or other \ndisorder, and a partial-birth abortion is the only means by which her \nlife can be saved. That is the life-of-the-mother exception. It is very \nclear. There is no question about it.\n  If we go to the Boxer partial-birth abortion on demand amendment, it \nallows partial-birth abortions on demand throughout the full 9 months \nof the pregnancy. If a woman has any health \n\n[[Page S 18196]]\nproblem that she so indicates, then any child could be aborted for any \nreason. That is a fact.\n  We voted on this before on the floor of the Senate, and we voted it \ndown. I hope that we will vote it down now and have a true life-of-the-\nmother exception, as we have tried to do.\n  I remember in the debate when the Senator from California, and \nothers, made a big case here on the floor to please have the life-of-\nthe-mother exception, have it clarified. We have done that. In fact, I \nvoted to send the bill back to committee to have time to do that and to \nhear the testimony of the witnesses.\n  I will conclude on this point, Mr. President. We had no doctors who \nperformed partial-birth abortions testifying and no women who had them \ntestifying. So I am not sure what the committee hearing produced.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes, 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that I be notified when I have used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you, this debate is one of the most \nfascinating I have ever been in. I will hold up picture after picture \nof people who know that this bill applies to the procedure they had, \nand my colleague, who thinks he might perhaps be a doctor, and his \nfriends think that, in fact, they do not know what they are doing \nbecause they are U.S. Senators. After all, they know more than the \nfamilies that went through this what happened. Again, here is the \nletter I read part of, dated December 7--and that is today. This was \nraised yesterday as a red herring, that these people that I held up did \nnot know what they were talking about.\n  These women and families wrote us. Seven of them said this, and I \nwill quote--this is to Senator Smith:\n\n       We are shocked and outraged by attempts by you to dismiss \n     our significance as witnesses against the partial-birth \n     abortion bill.\n\n  Then they say:\n\n       Your rhetoric vilifies our physician, Dr. McMahon, who is \n     the Nation's leading developer and practitioner of this \n     technique for third-trimester abortions, and you claim \n     simultaneously that we did not undergo the procedure in \n     question. But we definitely had intact dilation and \n     evacuation procedures, and it is definite that no doctor who \n     wants to stay out of prison will perform that procedure, or \n     any surgery that remotely resembles it, if your bill is \n     passed.\n\n  They write this:\n\n       If your bill passes, families with tragedies like ours will \n     have added misery and pain because the surgical procedure \n     that helped us will be unavailable. Please stop pushing this \n     awful bill and please stop pretending that we are \n     irrelevant.\n\n  Of course, Senators will continue to say that these people, religious \nfamilies, loving families, simply do not know what they are talking \nabout and do not know what was done to the body of their incredibly \nimportant family member.\n  Now, this is Viki Wilson. She testified to the Judiciary Committee as \nfollows. These are facts, facts from her mouth.\n\n       I am a practicing Catholic and I couldn't help but believe \n     that God had some reason for giving us such a burden, and \n     then I found out about this legislation. I knew then and \n     there that Abigail's life had special meaning.\n       I think God knew I would be strong enough to come here and \n     tell you my story, to try to stop this legislation from \n     passing and causing incredible devastation for other families \n     like ours, because there will be other families in our \n     situation, because prenatal testing is not infallible and I \n     urge you please do not take away the safest method known.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take an additional 30 seconds, and I will retain \nthe time for my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Coreen Costello says, ``I hope you can put aside your political \ndifferences, your positions on abortion, your party affiliation''--this \nis a picture of Coreen--``and just try to remember us. We are the ones \nwho know. We are the families that ache to hold our babies, to love \nthem, to nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a hole \nin our hearts.''\n  I say to any Senator that tries to demean these families and tell \nthem they do not know what went on in these families should think \nagain. We were elected to be Senators, not doctors, and not God.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes twenty-two seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield myself 3 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. President, it is very frustrating. Again, I will just repeat for \nemphasis for those, I hope, who are listening to the debate: Viki \nWilson in her testimony not only indicated that she did not have a \npartial-birth abortion, she said she would not have one. So these are \nnot partial-birth abortions. But again I will not continue to debate \nit.\n  Any reasonable person, hopefully, who is watching the debate would \nunderstand the definition is very clear. A partial-birth abortion is \nwhen a child is killed in the birth canal. These two women in the \nhorrible circumstances they went through lost their children in the \nwomb. This amendment would not prevent what happened to them.\n  Since I have been accused of not being a doctor, which is a fair \naccusation, let me offer into the Record a sample of the 200 \nunsolicited letters from ob-gyn's from all over America. I \nask unanimous consent that all of these be printed in the Record after \nthis debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH. I will quote from a letter from a Dr. Dorothy Czarnecki, \nan ob-gyn from Philadelphia. She says:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: I appreciate your efforts on behalf of \n     the ``partial-birth abortion'' controversy. In no way are \n     these done only on abnormal infants. This is just another \n     brutal way to destroy life. This procedure is not necessary \n     to protect the life or health of women in this country.\n\n  Another one from Dr. Lauri Scott, M.D., assistant professor of \nmaternal-fetal medicine in Dallas, TX.\n\n       I am a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine and on faculty \n     in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the \n     University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center. It is the \n     nature of my specialty that I deal with high-risk pregnancies \n     and would be the consultant called to deal with issues \n     regarding the ``life-of-the-mother.''\n       I can tell you unequivocally there is no maternal medical \n     reason for ``late-term abortions.'' In situations where the \n     life of the mother is at stake, we simply deliver the infants \n     and the baby takes its chances in the nursery.\n\n  ``Dear Senator Smith,'' Mary Davenport, Oakland, CA:\n\n       I am writing to you in support of the partial-birth \n     abortion bill. There is no medical indication for this \n     procedure, and the performance of this operation is totally \n     in opposition to 2,000 years of Hippocratic medical ethics. \n     Please do your best to eliminate this procedure. It is not \n     done in any other nation of the world.\n\n  Margaret Nordell, M.D., caring for women of all ages, Minot, ND:\n\n       I am a member of the DakotaCare Physicians Association. I \n     believe that this procedure is unnecessary to protect either \n     the life or health of women in this country.\n\n  Dr. Karin Shinn, Coney Island Hospital:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am a practicing ob-gyn on the staff \n     of Coney Island Hospital. It is my professional opinion that \n     the partial-birth abortion procedure is very dangerous and \n     absolutely unnecessary to protect either the life or the \n     health of the women in America.\n\n  Letter after letter after letter, Mr. President, all over the \ncountry. To say that somehow the U.S. Senator who stands here on the \nfloor, quoting from doctors about a medical procedure, to taking the \n``slam'' that somehow we cannot vote for something or talk about \nsomething because we are not doctors--we send troops into Bosnia, that \nwill happen. And I assure you that every Senator who votes to send them \nthere has never served in combat and probably never been there. That is \nfor sure. We vote on Medicare and we vote on Medicaid and not everybody \nhere is a senior citizen.\n  The argument is absolutely ludicrous and frankly insulting. I hope my \ncolleagues will defeat the Boxer amendment and support the Smith-Dole \namendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                             Philadelphia, PA,\n\n                                                November 28, 1995.\n     Hon.

Robert Smith,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am a specialist in Maternal-Fetal \n     Medicine and on faculty in the Department of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical \n     Center. It is the nature of my specialty that I deal with \n     high risk pregnancies, and thus would be the consultant \n     called to deal with issues regarding ``the life of the \n     mother''. Prenatal diagnosis is also part of my specialty, \n     and I am the one who breaks the news of fetal abnormalities \n     and helps to plan how best to manage the rest of the \n     pregnancy.\n       I can tell you unequivocally that there is no maternal \n     medical indication for ``late term abortions.'' In situations \n     where the life of the mother is at stake, we simply deliver \n     the infant and the baby takes its chances in the nursery. In \n     our nursery, 50% of the infants born at 24 weeks gestation \n     will survive, most without significant problems. Prior to 24 \n     weeks we recognize that the baby will generally die due to \n     extreme prematurity, but we perform no procedures to ensure \n     its death; there is no medical reason for this when the \n     concern is with the life of the mother. ``Late term \n     abortions'' are no safer, and may be more dangerous for the \n     mother, than simple induction of labor.\n       The only reason for a ``late term abortion'' is to ensure \n     that the late second trimester and third trimester fetus is \n     born dead. The only possible medical indication would be a \n     situation in which the fetus has abnormalities incompatible \n     life. However, in most of these situations, the infant would \n     die shortly after birth anyway and terminating the pregnancy \n     in the late 2nd or 3rd trimester carries the same \n     complications as allowing the pregnancy to go to term and end \n     naturally.\n       This procedure has no place in modern obstetrics and only \n     serves to destroy lives that might otherwise survive. I \n     suspect that the women who made such tragic decisions for \n     medical reasons chose this procedure without truly informed \n     consent or full knowledge of their options. It should never \n     be performed as an elective procedure. Please support \n     legislation banning this procedure.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        L.

Robert Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am a practicing OBGYN on the staff of \n     Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. It is my \n     professional opinion that the partial birth abortion \n     procedure is very dangerous and absolutely unnecessary to \n     protect either the life or the health of women in America. \n     Therefore, I whole heartedly support the partial birth \n     abortion ban bill to be passed and become officially law. \n     Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Karin E. Shinn, D.O.,\n                                              Assistant attending.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 52 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, let me commend my colleague \nfrom California for speaking so forthrightly about an issue that does \nnot belong in the kind of debate that we have heard from the other side \nfrom the proponents of this amendment.\n  Strangely enough, and I speak now as a father and a grandfather, as a \nfather of four. We lost a couple because of health problems with my \nwife, and every one of those pregnancies that was lost was a terrible \nexperience for us.\n  When my youngest daughter lost a fetus, lost a pregnancy that was in \nits 7th month because the baby was entangled in the cord, it was very \npainful, very painful. We did not know whether we had a healthy baby or \nnot, but we were torn by this experience, to have her go to the \nhospital, spend 8 hours in labor to deliver the fetus.\n  The interesting thing to me, Mr. President, is I have not heard one \nwoman speak for that side. It is the men who speak on what women ought \nto do, tell them how to conduct their lives, tell them what to do with \ntheir bodies, describe the pain that they will never feel. It is quite \ninteresting. They want to tell everybody what the moral right is.\n  I just heard one of our Senators say something that to me is so \npreposterous. He says those who will vote to send troops to Bosnia will \nnever serve in combat. Who is he that knows all this information? What \na silly thing to say. It is the same thing we are talking about here.\n  What this is is license for the Government to participate in the \noperating room when a doctor does a procedure, when a doctor decides to \nperform a procedure that the woman carrying the fetus wants to have \ndone because she feels that it is essential or the doctor feels it is \nessential for her health.\n  These abortions, these procedures are rarely done when someone was \nmaking that choice simply to rid themselves of that pregnancy.\n  This is a sad day, I think, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us is extremely dangerous and I \nstrongly oppose it.\n  This bill is poorly titled for many reasons. It would more \nappropriately be called The Big Government Intrusion into the Doctor-\nPatient Relationship Act.\n  Under this bill, we will literally have FBI agents snooping around \nexamining rooms. Let me repeat this. This legislation authorizes the \nFBI to go wandering around doctors' offices looking at patients and \nwhat doctors are doing to them.\n  Furthermore, this bill does not include a life and health of the \nmother exemption.\n  This bill will send a chilling signal to doctors in this country. And \nthey will leave the practice of reproductive health care in droves.\n  And women could die in waiting rooms while doctors are on the phone, \nconsulting with defense and constitutional lawyers, about what they can \nor cannot do to treat their patients.\n  Mr. President, one reason I am opposing this bill is because I \nbelieve doctors and patients can make proper decisions about which \nhealth care treatment is most appropriate.\n  Mr. President, one of the most extreme elements of this bill is its \nfailure to include an exception to deal with situations in which the \nlife or health of the mother is at risk. The pending Boxer amendment \nseeks to make this bill a little less extreme. The Boxer amendment \nwould create a real health and life-of-the-mother exception.\n  Under the bill, as originally presented, if a doctor thought it \nlikely that a woman would become permanently disabled if she carried a \nfetus to term, the doctor would still be prohibited from performing \nthis procedure. Can you imagine that? A doctor would have to feel \ncertain that carrying a fetus to term would endanger the life of the \nmother in order to do what is medically required for treatment.\n  Otherwise, the doctor could not perform this procedure even though \nthe woman could suffer severe, permanent health damage without the \nprocedure.\n  Mr. President, this bill will affect real people. Real women and \nfamilies who have had to go through this procedure.\n  One such woman is Viki Wilson, a nurse, who 18 months ago was \nexpecting her first child. Early tests showed the child to be normal \nbut an 8-month ultrasound revealed that the fetus had a fatal \ncondition--two thirds of the brain had formed outside the skull.\n  Carrying the pregnancy to term would have imperiled Viki's life and \nhealth. In consultation with her doctor, Viki and her husband Bill made \nthe heartbreaking decision to undergo this procedure. This bill would \nmake this practice illegal.\n\n[[Page S 18198]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to quote Viki at this point. She stated \n``I strongly believe that this decision should be left within the \nintimacy of the family unit.''\n  So do I Mr. President.\n  While this bill is really extreme, the Boxer amendment would make it \na little less extreme. At a minimum, we ought to adopt the amendment, \nwhich would establish a meaningful exception in cases where the life \nand health of the mother is at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the Boxer amendment and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor and hope that my colleagues will \nsupport the amendment that is proposed by Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no other time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thought I saved some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have no time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this has been a tough debate so far. We \nhave gone through it for 3 days. Maybe this is the 4th day, Senator \nSmith.\n  I have to say, it is emotional. Why is it emotional? Because what we \nare doing impacts real people. We have seen these families night after \nnight. We have seen charts of part of a woman's body, as if she had no \nface. I have to say to my colleagues, if they really think about it, if \ntheir daughter came to them and said, ``Dad, I have been told the most \nhorrible news. If I do not terminate this pregnancy, even though it is \nso late term, I could die. I could be infertile. And the only procedure \nis this procedure,'' I really do believe, if Senators are honest, male \nor female, they would fall to their knees and pray to God and go ahead \nand have that procedure.\n  Why would we want to risk that woman's life? Please vote ``yes'' for \nDole and ``yes'' for Boxer-Brown.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3081\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 3081, \noffered by the majority leader, Mr. Dole.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3088 to Amendment No. 3082\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Senate should, \nthrough the Committee on the Judiciary, conduct hearings to investigate \n  the effect of the new patent provisions of title 35, United States \nCode, (as amended by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act) on the approval \n                           of generic drugs)\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for Mr. DeWine \n     and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 3088 to \n     amendment No. 3082.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 1, line 3, strike ``APPROVAL'' and all \n     that follows through line 22 on page 3 and insert the \n     following: ``SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should, \n     through the Committee on the Judiciary, conduct hearings to \n     investigate the effect of the new patent provisions of title \n     35, United States Code (as amended by subtitle C of title V \n     of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Public Law 103-465; 108 \n     Stat. 4982)), on the approval of generic drugs under section \n     505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     355).''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I will try to explain the amendment.\n  First, I yield to the majority leader.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been asked to indicate what may be in \nstore for the rest of the evening. It is not certain that these are all \nthe amendments, but we have an amendment by Senator Bingaman on \nshutting down the Government; an amendment by Senator Feinstein which, \nas I understand it, is similar to the Boxer amendment just disposed of; \na Brown amendment on deadbeat dads; then we have \n\n[[Page S 18199]]\nthe pending amendment of Senator Pryor, which Senator Smith will \nsecond-degree. There may be additional amendments. I think it is safe \nto say there will be votes well into the evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the majority leader has any indication, if \nthis is disposed of this evening, what would happen tomorrow?\n  Mr. DOLE. We have a cloture vote scheduled on the constitutional \namendment on the desecration of the flag. That could be resolved if we \nget an agreement on State Department reorganization. If we do that, \nthen we can vitiate the vote on cloture and probably have debate only \ntomorrow on the flag amendment, but no final disposition.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the majority leader expect we will have a small \nwindow where we might get home to get a bite to eat?\n  Mr. DOLE. How close are you?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. About 20, 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. You are not going to New Orleans, are you? I think we may \nhave a vote in the next few minutes, and then we can probably arrange \nat least an hour.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, let me just say, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, I am not going to prolong the debate on this second-degree \namendment. I know Senator Pryor has some comments and Senator DeWine \nwants to speak. I do not know of any others. But if others are going to \nspeak, hopefully, they will come to the floor and we can expedite this \nmatter as quickly as possible.\n  This amendment requires hearings on the relationship between GATT \npatent laws and the FDA Hatch-Waxman law relating to prescription \ndrugs. At the outset, let me say I would have preferred not to have \nthis bill, become a Christmas tree for nongermane amendments. It was \nhopeful that we would not have nongermane amendments. But the \nunderlying Pryor amendment dealing with pharmaceutical products, GATT, \nand patent protections has nothing to do with partial-birth abortion. \nHowever, I recognize the right my colleague has to offer such an \namendment, and I respect that. I hope that we will not spend a lot of \ntime on this and delay this bill. We saw the same tactic a few weeks \nago, and it seems to me that maybe there is some reluctance to face the \nissue at hand.\n  Mr. President, this second-degree amendment calls for hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee to look into this issue. I say to my colleague from \nArkansas that it is an important issue and deserves a hearing, and I \nrecognize that. I recognize that the Senator has a legitimate interest \nin this. I hope that it will not delay a vote on the bill, as other \nSenators have expressed interest to me--or have asked me whether or not \nthere would be a vote tonight on final passage of the partial-birth \nbill. I am prepared to do that at any time. I do not know specifically \nof other amendments, but you never know.\n  If this second-degree amendment fails or if any other Senators are \ngoing to try to load the bill up, we will have to be offering second-\ndegree amendments on all kinds of things from sex selection to Down's \nsyndrome, and Lord knows what. Let's hope we do not get into all that.\n  Hopefully, Mr. President, why don't we just vote and move on and see \nwhere the votes fall on this bill.\n  If we want to talk about patent protections, come to the hearing and \ntestify about patent protections. Then when the Senate is ready to vote \non that, when we can come down and debate it.\n  It is a very complicated issue, patents and trade. I don't think it \nought to go through the Senate in a hurry without having an opportunity \nto hear from both sides. The Senator from Arkansas voted a couple weeks \nago to have a hearing on partial-birth abortion, and we did. I was not \noriginally in favor of it, I admit, but we did have the hearing.\n  I did reconsider my views and allowed it to be sent to the committee. \nI hope the Senator from Arkansas will do the same.\n  I urge my colleagues if there is a vote to vote for the Smith \namendment so we can have a full hearing under this issue of patent \nprotection. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my colleague from Arkansas speaks on this \nparticular subject which he has been such a leader on, I wanted to make \na comment that President Clinton has long believed that it is important \nto protect the life and the health of a mother, of a woman.\n  We know he will, in fact, veto this bill because the Senate now voted \nthis down. A very close vote. I want to thank my colleagues who stood \nwith Senator Brown, with me, and with those who feel so strongly about \nthis, that we must put a woman's face on this debate.\n  I am very moved by the vote that we had. It sends a very strong \nsignal to the President of the United States: That 47 Senators, \nnotwithstanding incredible organized phone banks, et cetera, stood up \nfor the life and the health of the women in this country. I am proud \nthat you stood with me. I am proud that you stood with women.\n  I want to particularly thank in that context every one of my \ncolleagues that spoke on this. Senator Moseley-Braun spoke so \neloquently yesterday and she made the point that the women of America \nwill have to wake up to what is happening to their rights. She did that \nin the most beautiful fashion. I urge everyone to read the Record, \nbecause this assault on a woman's right to choose has begun in earnest.\n  When people do go to the polls they will have to decide where they \nstand. Could they stand with a Government that wants to get right into \nthe hospital room with your family, right into your bedroom with your \nfamily, or do they believe that the families in our country with their \nGod and with their conscience can make those kind of decisions?\n  I am very moved by the vote that we had. I will certainly vote \nagainst the final passage of this bill. Senator Feinstein will be \noffering us an excellent substitute which basically restates the law of \nthe land that says in the late term of a pregnancy the States control \nwhat happens in these late-term abortions.\n  I think everyone was very surprised by this vote. I was moved by the \nvote. I hope colleagues will vote ``no'' on final passage, since there \nis no exception for the life of the mother. The Senate voted for a \npartial exception, and therefore it makes it a very, I think, weak \nbill, and the President has said he would veto it. I applaud that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. Mr. \nPresident, the day before yesterday I introduced an amendment on behalf \nof myself and my very good friend from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, \nand our good friend from Colorado, Senator Brown.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Robert Byrd of \nWest Virginia be added as an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, what we are seeing here tonight on the \nsecond-degree amendment, and I say this in all due respect to my \ncolleagues who have offered this second-degree amendment to this \nprincipal amendment, this is merely an attempt to kill the Pryor-\nChafee-Brown-Byrd amendment. That is it, pure and simple.\n  First, it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which all of us know in \nthis body has no force of law. It has no real meaning. It has no \ntraction, as we say around here. Beyond that, it does not require any \nCommittee to hold any hearing at any specific time.\n  It merely says that the Judiciary Committee would conduct hearings to \ninvestigate the effect of the new patent provisions of title 35 U.S. \ncode as amending subtitle C. of title 5 of the Uruguay Round \nagreements.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would probably end up in the \nwastebasket. There is no date certain for a hearing. Additionally, the \namendment sends instructions for a hearing, under this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment, to the Judiciary Committee. It would not be sent to \nthe Labor Committee that has jurisdiction over food and drug issues. It \nis being sent to the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate.\n  Once again, there is no date certain for when a hearing might be held \non \n\n[[Page S 18200]]\nthe effect of the proposal that we are discussing this evening in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Make no mistake, what this amendment is all about is an attempt to \nkill the Pryor-Chafee-Brown-Byrd amendment. It is a tactic to delay. It \nis a motion to protect one of the greatest windfalls that we have ever \ncreated in the history of our entire Government.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have several things I want to say during the \ncourse of this debate. I see my very good colleague, Senator Chafee, my \ncolleague on the Finance Committee, who has been so loyal as a friend \nand as a supporter in trying to close this loophole that we created \nwhen we did not conform the food, drug and cosmetic law to the GATT \ntreaty and its provisions.\n  Mr. President, I also see my friend from Colorado, Senator Brown, an \noriginal cosponsor of our amendment.\n  Mr. President, expecting that my colleagues might have something to \nsay on this issue, for the moment I yield the floor and I reserve the \nopportunity to address this issue further.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss the \npending amendment. This is really a very simple issue.\n  Under the Uruguay Round the nations agreed to boost protection of \npatents significantly. This was an historic step. Indeed, this was the \nfirst time that in these multilateral trade agreements such as this, \nthe GATT, we became involved with so-called intellectual property.\n  In order to implement the provisions of the commitment to increase \nthe protection for patents, the Congress changed the U.S. patent law \nfrom 17 years from approval to 20 years from filing date. This was a \nchange to conform with GATT.\n  To be fair to existing patent holders, Congress gave those existing \npatent holders the option of taking the longer term. As a result, those \nholding patents as of June 1985 received an extension of up to 3 years.\n  However, granting this extension affected generic drug manufacturers \nwho had been preparing to go to market after the original patents \nexpired. To be fair to them, too, Congress made a compromise: \nmanufacturers who had already made a substantial investment preparing \nto go into the market, would be allowed to proceed--but they would be \nrequired to pay a royalty to the holder of the patents. This was a \ncarefully worked out compromise.\n  This transition was made available to all manufacturers, not just \ngeneric manufacturers of drugs. There are generic manufacturers of blue \njeans and every other patent. Wherever there is a patent involved \nsomeone is waiting for the patent to expire and then come forward with \ntheir own product.\n  The product is called a generic product--not just a generic drug, but \ngeneric blue jeans, or whatever it might be. However, Congress made an \nerror. It is not the first error Congress has ever made, but it was a \ncostly one. We failed to consider a conforming amendment to the patent \nprovisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which Senator Pryor \npreviously alluded to.\n  The consequence of this oversight is that one group of generic \nmanufacturers--in other words, those coming on with a substitute \nproduct--had been denied the benefits of this transition provision. \nThese were the generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. So, while the \nmanufacturers, that is the manufacturers who had the patent of these \nbranded pharmaceutical products, got an extra 3 years, the generic drug \nmanufacturers were cut out altogether from transition remedies--from \ndoing anything.\n  This oversight, if left uncorrected, I must say, is a wonderful \nwindfall for the pharmaceutical manufacturers who are protected by it, \nwho got this windfall which was never planned for. This windfall is in \nthe area of billions of dollars--not millions, but billions. So, quite \nunderstandably, they are very enthusiastic to prevent anything from \nhappening around here, to prevent the Pryor amendment from going into \neffect. Obviously, others can give illustrations of this.\n  What will be the effect of the passage of the Chafee-Brown-Pryor-Byrd \namendment? First, it will level the playing field by making the GATT \ntransition provision available to generic drug manufacturers like it is \nto generic blue jeans manufacturers, or whoever it might be. This is \nwhat we intended. Second, it will stop the unintended, and therefore \nunfair, windfall. And, third, it will save consumers, insurers, and, I \nmight say, the Government--because the Government will benefit greatly \nfrom getting their Medicaid prescription drugs at a far lower price \nthan otherwise would be true.\n  There are two counterpoints that opponents of this will make. Some \nhave warned that this amendment would negate or otherwise affect the \nhard-won gains that came about through GATT and the intellectual \nproperty protections. That is a red herring. The STR, the Special Trade \nRepresentative, has assured us that our amendment will not in any way \ninterfere with the GATT intellectual property protection rights. In \nfact, the USTR supports this amendment, for they say the conforming \namendment--namely, the Pryor effort--should have been included in the \nGATT bill but was overlooked inadvertently.\n  Now, as to the argument that our amendment would upset the delicate \nbalance of the Hatch-Waxman Act, that also is a red herring. This is \nnot about Hatch-Waxman; this is about GATT. Officials of the Food and \nDrug Administration have assured us that our amendment absolutely would \nnot disturb the so-called Hatch-Waxman Act. Let me say, if this were \ninterfering with GATT in some way, the intellectual property \nprovisions, I would not be for this amendment.\n  This is what we might call a ``good Government'' amendment. It seeks \nto close a loophole which was unintentionally created. We made a \nmistake, and now we are trying to correct it. Does it have any support \noutside of those of us here? Certainly a broad coalition of senior \ncitizens and consumer groups support it. Furthermore, it is the right \nthing to do. Occasionally we do the right thing around here.\n  I certainly hope that this amendment of the Senator from Utah, to \nsend this back, and the Senator from New Hampshire, would not prevail. \nI hope it will not prevail because, if it does prevail, that does in \nthe Pryor effort here.\n  Could I ask the Senator from Arkansas, does this amendment provide \nfor a date that the hearing must be completed?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I respond to my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, there is absolutely no date set forth in the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to require the Judiciary Committee, or any other \ncommittee of the Senate, to hold a hearing. It is totally open ended. \nAgain, there is no date specified in the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have a question for the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire. He mentioned the sending of his bill back to committee for a \nstudy. I guess the Senator from New Hampshire supported that in the \nend, reluctantly.\n  My question is this: Did that amendment, that sent the Senator's bill \nback to committee, have a date at which the committee must report back? \nAs I recall, it did. I may be mistaken.\n  Mr. SMITH. I believe it was 17 days, I say to my colleague, Senator \nChafee. But I need to check that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I certainly would abide by whatever the Senator says, and \nif he wishes to correct it later, that is fine. But, as I recall, when \nthat was sent, Senator Smith's bill which came up here, say, a month \nago, when that was sent back to committee, that was sent back with a \ntime limit to it, a definite period. Whether it was 17 days or 3 weeks \nor whatever it was, I am not sure. But I remember, to the best of my \nrecollection, there was a time certain. Yet, in this case, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, in his amendment, has not provided for a date \ncertain. What does the Senator from Arkansas suggest on that? Would \nthis be more palatable if there was a time limit?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Let me respond, Mr. President, to my friend from Rhode \nIsland once again. It would certainly be more palatable if we had an \nimminent date for the Judiciary Committee to hold such a hearing. But, \nto be honest, I do not think a Judiciary Committee hearing is going to \ngive us any more facts than we know today. We pretty well have the \nfacts. Those facts are that the Congress made an mistake. We created an \nerror in the GATT legislation. We opened a loophole, and now we have an \nopportunity to fix it.\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island just stated, this is really a very, \nvery \n\n[[Page S 18201]]\nsimple matter. It becomes dramatic because of all the dollars involved: \nAll the dollars that appeared unexpectedly in a windfall that goes to a \nsmall handful of drug companies that had no idea a year ago that this \nwindfall would occur and that these billions of dollars would basically \nbe falling out of the trees into their bank accounts.\n  So I say, even if there were a day certain, we are about to leave for \nChristmas. If we even set a day certain of 10 days from now, perhaps \nthe Senate and the House will not even be in session. We do not know \nwhen we are coming back in session next year. So I say once again, this \nis an attempt to kill the original Pryor-Chafee-Brown-Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would ask the Senator from Arkansas another question. \nIt seems to me that this is an odd provision, in that it is referred to \nthe Judiciary Committee, yet the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug \nAdministration is in the Labor Committee.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So, why is this being sent to the Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I believe the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is \nthe author of this amendment. Perhaps he could advise us as to why the \namendment is being sent to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from New Hampshire is not the sponsor of the \namendment. The Senator from New Hampshire offered the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I will be happy to answer that. \nI will be happy to answer that. It is because it involves a hallowed \nand important element in the history of this country and in the world, \nand that is patents. We happen to handle patents. It involves \nintellectual property. It also involves an international intellectual \nproperty agreement which we better be careful of here, because there \nare a lot countries out there that do not honor intellectual property.\n  There are a lot of countries out there that do not believe in \npatents. Or, if they do not believe in patent terms--if, after a \nmultiyear negotiated agreement in international relations, intricate, \nnegotiated every line of that agreement--it is bunk to say that this \nwas a mistake. We then retrench on patent terms the first time out of \nthe blocks when we have gone all over the world talking about \nintellectual property, respect for intellectual property, and for other \ncountries to treat American products fairly. And right out of the \nblocks we say we have to do away with that, you send a message that we \nare going to wreck the world window on the rest of our lives. We have \ntaken years to get to this point.\n  I am going to have a lot to say on why there are two sides to this \nthing, and that it is more important to uphold the international \ntreaty, uphold the international patent protection, than it is to \ndemagogue on this particular issue.\n  I will make my points afterwards. But the reason it is sent to the \nJudiciary Committee is because it involves the most important aspects \nof the patent law and intellectual property law. That is what is \ninvolved here.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first of all, if it involves treaties, \nthen, of course, it goes to the Finance Committee. The last place in \nthe world it should go is the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not if it involves patents.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If you want time, you can have time after I finish.\n  We have a letter from Mickey Kantor, U.S. Trade Representative, \nSeptember 25, 1995:\n\n       The extension of the section 1534(c)--that is what we are \n     doing here to pharmaceutical property products--would not \n     undermine ongoing U.S. efforts to seek high levels of \n     intellectual property protection around the world.\n\n  So there is no problem here with patents. That does not have anything \nto do with it. The fact of the matter is that this reference, if indeed \nit should be made--I do not think it should--but if it should, it \nshould go to one of two places: The Finance Committee, which deals with \ntrade, or the Labor Committee, which deals with FDA. I would be far \nhappier to see it go there than to the place suggested.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if the Senator from Rhode Island will \nyield--then I want to hear, and I know we all do, our friend from \nColorado, Senator Brown--I'd like to ask if in the history of the \nJudiciary Committee has that committee held hearings on the Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act? That committee does not have jurisdiction over this \nact, yet that is where we are about to dump this issue.\n  The second point I would like to raise is my friend from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, has talked about, ``Oh, this is relating to patents. We \nhave to protect these patent rights.'' That seems ironic, since on June \n7, 1995 the United States Patent Office ruled--the Patent Office ruled, \nMr. President--that they determined the expiration dates of the patents \nin question. They are in force on June 8, 1995 and, therefore, are \nentered into the greater of the term of 20 years from their relevant \nfiling days, or 17 years from grant. In other words, they held in our \nfavor. The Patent Office held in our favor that the generics could in \nfact come in and compete with the brand-name companies. Of course, the \nbrand-name companies with all of their high-powered lawyers, money, et \ncetera, moved on to the courts. And because the courts interpreted \nliterally our mistake as being the intent of Congress, and I must say \nthat I think they made a mistake, Glaxo and other major pharmaceutical \ncompanies won out.\n  I would like to make one more point, and then I am going to sit down \nfor a spell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island controls the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would certainly like to hear the Senator make that \nexplanation, if he might.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would like to just say, if we allow this situation to \npersist and refuse to close this loophole, let us for a moment look at \nwhat is going to happen to one pharmaceutical company that has \ninherited this windfall. Let us look at Glaxo. They make Zantac. Here \nis some Zantac. It cost $170 a bottle. You can go over to Canada, by \nthe way, and buy this for about $70 a bottle. Or, if in our country we \nhad the competition for Zantac on the shelves today, as we should have \noccurred earlier this week, it would cost about half of what this $170 \nbottle of Zantac cost.\n  But, if we go forward, let us say even for an additional 30 days and \nallow this windfall to continue, or let us say just to Christmas day--\nand Christmas day is just a few days away, Mr. President--Glaxo is \ngoing to make another $115 million. If we hold a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee, say next November, and then keep this thing in \neffect, maybe until 1996, a year from Christmas and do not correct it \nuntil a year from this Christmas, this one company--because of our \nmistake and because of our refusal to correct that mistake--will have \nmade an extra $2.328 billion.\n  Do we want our patent law in this country to be based upon an error, \nto be based on a mistake that we made, and refuse to correct? I do not \nthink so, Mr. President.\n  I look forward to hearing some of the comments from other colleagues \nwho feel, I believe, as strongly about this issue as I do.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nArkansas one more question. I understand that these substantial amounts \nwill be made by the companies that they would not otherwise make, if we \ncorrected this. My question is: But, if we correct it sometime in the \nfuture, then is there a refund in some type that occurs? Does it undo \nitself, or everything is just prospective?\n  Mr. PRYOR. The way that I understand the law, I say to my friend, if \na generic company has been out there and has made what we call a \nsubstantial investment where they are ready to come into the market at \nthe end of the 17-year patent protection period, then the generic would \nbe allowed to go on the shelves, to go on the market, to be advertised, \nto be marketed, selling for one-half of what the brand name sells these \ndrugs for today. At that time a royalty for this time that was \nunexpired--like for 600 additional days for Glaxo and Zantac--a royalty \nwould be paid even to the Glaxo company by the competing generic drug \ncompany. The amount of that royalty would be established in a court of \nlaw, and there is a system whereby that amount would be established.\n  I think that is the question the Senator from Rhode Island is asking.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I understand that. But now my question is: But, let us \nassume \n\n[[Page S 18202]]\nthat this is referred back to this committee--the wrong committee, as \nit turns out, but nonetheless it is referred back--nothing happens, and \nfinally let us say in March we straighten out the law, then \nretroactively is there some compensation that takes place?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from Rhode Island. \nI did not understand his original question. I do now.\n  In other words, if we were to correct this, even in March or April, \nwhenever, and admit we made a mistake, which we did and we all agree \nthat we did, then the company gets to keep all of that money. There is \nno refund. The Medicaid programs have continued to pay the highest \nprice for these drugs. The Veterans Administration has continued to pay \nthe highest price for these drugs. The consumers get no rebate. The \nconsumers get no relief. The only benefit accrues to a very few drug \ncompanies that we failed to include in the coverage of the new law in \nthe GATT treaty. They get to keep all of these excess profits. And that \nis what this fight is all about. Every time, every day that these drug \ncompanies get to keep this amount of money, these exorbitant profits, \nthis windfall, it comes out of the pocketbooks of the consumer, the \nveterans, the Medicaid programs, and every citizen of this land.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the thought. I wish to assure \nmy good friend from Ohio that I will not be long.\n  I hope Members, as they vote on this, will consider a couple of \npoints. I don't think these are in dispute. If they are, I know my good \nfriends will correct me. But I think every Member ought to be aware \nthat this amendment is very important and would have a significant \nimpact on the Treasury of the United States. The estimates are that \nthis will save the taxpayers in the neighborhood of $150 million. It \nmay be more than that, but CBO has come forward with that figure. So \none of the things Members ought to think about is the dramatic, \nsignificant increase in revenue and reduction of the deficit that this \namendment can have if it is passed.\n  Second, many Members may have read the Newark Star Ledger's editorial \nof October 26. Let me quote it:\n\n       Thanks to a gigantic loophole resulting in the GATT, \n     consumers may wind up paying as much as $6 billion more for \n     higher priced brand name drugs.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not know if the $6 billion figure is correct or \nnot. That is an estimate by the paper. I must say my own estimate is \nless than that. But there is no question this is big, big, big money, \nand it comes right out of the pockets of the consumers of this country.\n  So the two things that I think are really without question here are \nfirst that the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas is a friend of the taxpayers of this country. It has a \nsignificant impact in a positive way on reducing the deficit.\n  Second, this amendment is very much a friend of the consumers in this \ncountry. It saves the consumers of this country literally billions of \ndollars. Is it the $6 billion the Newark paper talked about? My guess \nis it is less than that. But it is a huge amount. If you are concerned \nabout the consumers of this country, you ought to be in favor of it.\n  Two other points have been raised, and I think they merit addressing. \nOne is, is this fair? Is it fair to adjust the rules? Well, let us take \na look at it. When the patent for this medicine was granted, it \nextended 17 years from the time of filing. Is that diminished in any \nway if this amendment passes? The answer is no. The answer is \nabsolutely no. The drug company gets exactly what they thought they \nwere getting when they filed for the patent. They do not lose in any \nway. They get exactly what they were offered at the time they developed \nthe product, at the time they marketed the product, at the time they \nput the factory together to produce the product. Nothing has changed.\n  What do they lose? They lose the windfall that came from the treaty.\n  If you are on the subject of what is fair, let us ask ourselves, what \nif you were a different firm? What if you were a firm that was aware of \nthe drug and aware of the law and got geared up to produce a \ncompetitive product in reliance on the laws of this Nation, and the \nlaws of this Nation said the exclusivity ends after 17 years.\n  For this particular drug, there are competing companies. There are \ncompanies that relied on the law. There are companies that made \ninvestments. They put together a plant to produce this, and they geared \nup to produce it and sell it on the market. If you are concerned about \nfairness, you should not be concerned about Glaxo. They got exactly \nwhat they invested for. You ought to be concerned about the companies, \nhonest people who invested in facilities and plants and processes in \nreliance on our law and had the product taken away from them after they \nmade that big investment. Now, if you are concerned about fairness, you \nought to be in favor of the amendment, not against it.\n  Last, Mr. President, let me simply add one other thing that I think \nis important. It has been suggested on this floor by a number of people \nthat doing this somehow will be inconsistent with our treaties under \nGATT, and the very distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nhas just pointed out what a great investment we have in intellectual \nproperty. He is absolutely right.\n  I might say, Mr. President, from my point of view, if you were going \nto send this to a committee, I would think the Judiciary Committee \nwould be a great committee. It has some of the brightest, most able \nMembers, and the most modest, too, in the Senate. But the point is this \nshould not go to committee at all. The point is if you send it to the \ncommittee, what you do is you cost consumers hundreds of millions of \ndollars just by the delay, and you cost the taxpayers some money, too.\n  I think the last point that deserves addressing is this one. Are we \ndoing something, with the Pryor amendment are we doing something that \nviolates the GATT treaty? We do have--and I acknowledge it--a vested \ninterest in making sure that treaty is honored.\n  For that point I wish to draw Members' attention to some information. \nIt is the treaty itself. I know a lot of Members did not get a chance \nto read it, and having tried to read it myself I understand why. But \nthere are some interesting things you find out. I wish to read you the \nprecise words of the agreement itself because it relates specifically \nto this point. And I am talking about part VII. This is under article \n70. The title is: ``Protection of Existing Subject Matter.'' In \nparagraph 4, there are the following words:\n\n       . . . or in respect of which a significant investment was \n     made, before the date of acceptance of the WTO Agreement by \n     that Member, any Member may provide--\n\n  By ``Member'' they are referring to a country--\n\n     for a limitation of the remedies available to the right \n     holder as to the continued performance of such acts after the \n     date of application of this Agreement for that Member. In \n     such cases the Member shall, however, at least provide for \n     the payment of equitable remuneration.\n\n  Mr. President, the treaty itself anticipates exactly this kind of \nlegislation. Let me repeat it. This amendment in no way is at odds with \nthe treaty. It in no way violates the treaty. As a matter of fact, the \nexact words of the treaty anticipate this very action.\n  Now, to suggest that we somehow are jeopardizing our intellectual \nproperty rights by taking this action, I do not believe conforms with \neither the spirit of the treaty or the precise words of the treaty. The \nreality is if someone has made a substantial investment relying on our \ncurrent law, we have a right under the treaty, in specific terms, to do \nthis.\n  Mr. President, there are two editorials at this point I would like to \nenter into the Record because they make the point very well. One is by \nthe Des Moines Register and the other is by the Washington Post. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\n  A Costly Oversight--Fine Print in GATT Law Could Cost Zantac Users \n                                Millions\n\n       The nation's prescription drug makers are at war again, \n     with a $1 billion-plus purse \n\n[[Page S 18203]]\n     going to the winner. If the brand-name drug manufacturers win, the \n     losers will include the millions of Americans who suffer from \n     ulcers or heartburn, and take the drug Zantac regularly to \n     combat the problem. It's going to cost each of them about \n     $1,600.\n       Zantac is made by Glaxo Wellcome, the biggest in the \n     business.\n       Here's what started the current war:\n       When a new prescription drug hits the market, generic drug \n     manufacturers await the patent expiration so they can enter \n     the market with the same drug. They offer it for sale without \n     the brand name, usually at a fraction of the brand-name \n     price.\n       The new international GATT treaty signed by the United \n     States and 122 other countries sets the life of a patent at \n     20 years from the date of application. Former U.S. law \n     provided patent protection for pharmaceuticals for 17 years \n     from the date of approval. Because the difference could have \n     a significant impact on the number of years a firm could \n     market its patented drug without competition. Congress made \n     special provisions for drugs under patent at the time GATT \n     was approved last summer.\n       But when the legal beagles got done reading all the fine \n     print, it turned out that Zantac was granted a 19-month \n     extension of its patent life--and it is such a hugely popular \n     drug that that translates into a multimillion-dollar \n     windfall.\n       Generic drug makers call the windfall a congressional \n     oversight, and estimate the difference is worth $2.2 billion \n     to Glaxo, because the generics can't enter the market for 19 \n     more months. Glaxo counters that Congress made no mistake, \n     that the extension was part of the compromise with generics. \n     It won't wash. Nothing in the GATT treaty was intended to \n     further enrich the happy handful of brand-name drug makers \n     who hold lucrative patents--or to penalize the users of the \n     drugs.\n       A month's supply of Zantac ordinarily sells for around \n     $115; the generic price--meaning the same drug without the \n     Zantac label--would be around $35, the generic makers \n     contend. Unless Congress changes the wording of the law \n     regarding transition to GATT provisions, Zantac users will \n     pay the difference for 19 months longer.\n       Some generic drug manufacturers had already spent a bundle \n     preparing to enter the market before the GATT treaty took \n     effect. They lose. So do taxpayers, who pay for Medicaid \n     prescriptions. The Generic Drug Equity Coalition estimates \n     that the higher cost of Zantac and some other drugs affected \n     by the mistake (such as Capoten, for high blood pressure) \n     will cost Iowa Medicaid $3.5 million. Further, say the \n     generic drug makers, it will tack another $1.2 million onto \n     the cost of health-insurance premiums for Iowa state \n     employees.\n       Glaxo's political-action committee has doubled its \n     contributions to Congress in recent months. Glaxo wants the \n     mistake to stay in the law. Generic drug manufacturers want \n     it out.\n       So should ulcer sufferers. So should taxpayers. So should \n     Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 1995]\n\n                          The Zantac Windfall\n\n       All for lack of a technical conforming clause in a trade \n     bill, full patent protection for a drug called Zantac will \n     run 19 months beyond its original expiration date. Zantac, \n     used to treat ulcers, is the world's most widely prescribed \n     drug, and its sales in this country run to more than $2 \n     billion a year. The patent extension postpones the date at \n     which generic products can begin to compete with it and pull \n     the price down. That provides a great windfall to Zantac's \n     maker, Glaxo Wellcome Inc.\n       It's a cast study in legislation and high-powered lobbying. \n     When Congress enacted the big Uruguay Round trade bill a year \n     ago, it changed the terms of American patents to a new \n     worldwide standard. The effect was to lengthen existing \n     patents, usually by a year or two. But Congress had heard \n     from companies that were counting on the expiration of \n     competitors' patents. It responded by writing into the trade \n     bill a transitional provision. Any company that had already \n     invested in facilities to manufacture a knock-off, it said, \n     could pay a royalty to the patent-holder and go into \n     production on the patent's original expiration date.\n       But Congress neglected to add a clause amending a crucial \n     paragraph in the drug laws. The result is that the \n     transitional clause now applies to every industry but drugs. \n     That set off a huge lobbying and public relations war with \n     the generic manufacturers enlisting the support of consumers' \n     organizations and Glaxo Wellcome invoking the sacred \n     inviolability of an American patent.\n       Mickey Kantor, the president's trade representative, who \n     managed the trade bill for the administration, says that the \n     omission was an error, pure and simple. But it has created a \n     rich benefit for one company in particular. A small band of \n     senators led by David Pryor (D-Ark.) has been trying to right \n     this by enacting the missing clause, but so far it hasn't got \n     far. Glaxo Wellcome and the other defenders of drug patents \n     are winning. Other drugs are also involved, incidentally, \n     although Zantac is by far the most important in financial \n     terms.\n       Drug prices are a particularly sensitive area of health \n     economics because Medicare does not, in most cases, cover \n     drugs. The money spent on Zantac is only a small fraction of \n     the $80 billion a year that Americans spend on all \n     prescription drugs. Especially for the elderly, the cost of \n     drugs can be a terrifying burden. That makes it doubly \n     difficult to understand why the Senate refuses to do anything \n     about a windfall that, as far as the administration is \n     concerned, is based on nothing more than an error of \n     omission.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, let me simply conclude this way. If you are \nconcerned about the taxpayers, you ought to like the Pryor amendment \nbecause the CBO says it brings us in $150 million, or saves it. If you \nare concerned about the consumers of this country, you ought to be in \nfavor of the Pryor amendment because it is going to save them $6 \nbillion, if you believe some estimates, or a little less if you believe \nmy estimate.\n  If you are concerned about fairness, you ought to be in favor of the \nPryor amendment because people have invested money in plant and process \nand production capability to comply with our laws and they are simply \nout by this windfall.\n  Last, Mr. President, if you are concerned about the integrity of our \nprotection of intellectual property, you ought to be for the Pryor \namendment because this is precisely and exactly what the treaty \nanticipated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor a number of \ntimes to talk about prescription drug pricing, and to support Senator \nPryor's efforts to control the costs of drugs. Today I am pleased to \ncosponsor Senator Pryor's amendment to correct the GATT treaty loophole \nthat creates a windfall profit for certain prescription drug companies.\n  The GATT treaty, voted on by Congress, included two important \nprovisions that affected every product, company, and industry in the \ncountry. One, provided that all patents would be extended from 17 to 20 \nyears; an additional 3 years of protection. Two, provided that a \ngeneric company, in any industry, would be permitted to go to the \nmarketplace and compete on the 17-year expiration date, if the generic \ncompany had made a substantial investment, and was willing to pay a \nroyalty.\n  An unintended loophole was created, however, when the prescription \ndrug industry was accidently excluded from the generic competition \nprovision. The loophole means that prescription drug companies have a 3 \nyear longer patent period, without any competition during that time \nextension from generic companies. This loophole has created a \nmultimillion dollar windfall for certain drug companies that must be \ncorrected.\n  Seniors use prescription drugs more than any other age group. For \nthem, this loophole means they will pay higher drug prices for 3 years \nbecause of a mistake. Without the ability of generic drug companies to \ncompete, drug prices will remain artificially high during that 3-year \nperiod. There is no reason why seniors should suffer because of an \nunintended mistake that can be corrected today.\n  What drugs are involved here? More than 100 drugs would be protected \nfrom generic drug competition. The world's best-selling ulcer drug, \nZantac, would cost twice as much as it should because of the loophole. \nThe hypertension drug, Capoten, will cost 40 percent more than it \nshould because of the loophole. Additionally such drugs as Mevacor for \nlowering cholesterol, Prilosec for ulcers, and Diflucan, an antifungal \nagent are affected.\n  This loophole will also affect the drug prices paid by the Medicaid \nProgram. Medicaid already faces deep cuts in its funding. If this \nloophole is not corrected, Medicaid will be forced to pay higher drug \nprices during the 3-year period, further straining its ability to \nprovide medical care for the most vulnerable in our country.\n  Veterans will also suffer as the Veterans Affairs Administration will \nbe forced to pay higher drug prices. People using public health \nservices will also be affected. The bottomline is that taxpayers will \npay more for the drugs used by these programs than they should, because \ncompetitive generic alternatives will not be available.\n  There is no reason to allow some prescription drug companies an \nunintended windfall profit to the detriment of all Americans who depend \non drugs for their continued health. Seniors, veterans, and the most \nvulnerable in our country particularly deserve our protection from \nunnecessarily high \n\n[[Page S 18204]]\ndrug prices. I hope my colleagues will see this loophole for the \nmistake it is, and support this amendment to correct it.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my support for the Dodd-DeWine amendment. This \namendment would require the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the \nGATT patent extension provisions. The GATT issue is a complex one and \nrequires full disclosure. The Pryor amendment has no place on the \npartial birth abortion bill. Hearings are appropriate and, in my \nopinion, critical to ensure that the members of this body fully \nunderstand the issue and the implications of any action to modify the \nGATT agreement.\n  The Pryor amendment would modify the current General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade [GATT] as it applies to patent protections for \npharmaceutical products. This amendment, which was voted down in the \nFinance Committee, has been portrayed as a technical correction to the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] agreement. It is not. \nThis amendment opens up an international agreement on trade to resolve \na domestic intra-industry dispute. It is shortsighted, \ncounterproductive and will impede the availability of life saving drugs \nand therapies for all of us.\n  Before, I discuss substantively the issue at hand, I would like to \nstate unequivocally that I firmly believe that all persons who are sick \nshould have access to affordable, comprehensive health care services. \nIn 1992, I campaigned on the issue of health care reform and I remain \nfirmly committed to that goal. My views on the GATT patent extension \nissue are in no way inconsistent with my support for reform. In fact, I \nbelieve present attempts to undo and reopen GATT could have an adverse \nimpact on the development of state of the art medicines and treatments, \nwhich in turn deny all of us the benefit of advances in medical \nscience.\n  At question, is a provision, in the newly adopted agreement, that \nprovides additional patent protection to pharmaceutical products. GATT \nprovides 20 year patent protection to all products and industries \ncovered by the agreement--there are over 1 million patent holders in \nthe United States who will receive extended patent protection. This \nchange, which extends U.S. patent protection from the current 17 years \nfrom the date the patent is granted to 20 years from the date of \nfiling, conforms U.S. patent law to the international standards agreed \nto under GATT. The agreement, including the patent provisions, was \noverwhelmingly approved by Congress last November. The Pryor amendment \nwould repeal the patent extension provisions as they apply to \npharmaceutical products. Some of my colleagues believe this amendment \nis needed because they believe the patent extension provisions were a \nmistake and that an inadvertent windfall to a handful of pharmaceutical \ncompanies was created. I do not believe this assertion is fair or \naccurate.\n  The GATT law was very clear. The implementing legislation provided \nthat, in certain circumstances, individuals or organizations that had \nrelied on the shorter expiration term could use the patented technology \nduring the extension period, although they must pay a royalty to the \npatent holder to do so. Section 102 of the GATT, however, states that \n``Nothing in this Act shall be construed . . . to amend or modify any \nlaw of the United States . . . unless specifically provided for in this \nAct.'' GATT changed many areas of patent law, but it did not change \ncurrent Federal law that prohibits the FDA from granting approval for \nthe manufacture of generic drugs until the patent term on the original \nproduct has expired. On May 25, the FDA ruled that nothing in the GATT \nexplicitly overrules this provision and on November 1, the court of \nappeals for the Federal circuit also upheld the patent extension \nprovisions in GATT.\n  The actions by the FDA and the Federal circuit court of appeals \nunderscore the purpose of the GATT treaty which is to make trade laws \nmore uniform and consistent. Uniformity is needed to prevent countries \nfrom passing laws that are favorable to their own domestic companies; \n110 countries worked for over 7 years to complete negotiations on GATT. \nThe intellectual property issues were among the most contentious. The \nessential goal of patent protections are to allow companies and \nindividuals to invest freely and securely in the development of \nimportant and needed products. If companies are provided exclusive \nprotection over an innovation, they are more likely to invest the \nnecessary resources into developing a safe and effective product. This \nkind of market stability and security are vital with respect to \npharmaceutical products, which require enormous R & D resources. \nAchieving better protection of intellectual property was a major \nvictory for the United States as U.S. manufactured products, \ntrademarks, and services are increasingly counterfeited abroad. The \nagreement is final and cannot be renegotiated without putting these \nhard fought, and hard won, protections at risk.\n\n  The patent language in GATT gives the United States greater assurance \nthat innovations that originate here will not be pirated by foreign \nfirms. The benefits of the provisions cannot be overstated. First, it \nwill provide American companies the economic and intellectual security \nneeded to develop safe and effective new products; second, it will \nensure stability in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. This will not only \nstabilize the U.S. market, but also protect U.S. jobs. Third, it will \nensure research and investment by U.S. companies on products that are \nneeded to treat fatal disease. To change this international agreement \nnow, because of an intra-industry dispute, invites retaliation from \nother countries eager to undo our gains.\n  One of my main concerns is that if the United States is seen as \nhesitant about implementing this part of the new GATT, a number of \ncountries that have been reluctant to prevent their firms from pirating \nUnited States products would have the excuse they need to go slow in \nimplementing the agreement, or to avoid implementing it at all. That \nwould result in the destabilization of the U.S. market, a loss of U.S. \nexports and U.S. jobs, have a letter here, that I would like to place \nin the Record from Sir Leon Brittan, Vice President of the European \nCommission, that comments on a proposed changes to the patent extension \nprovisions in GATT. Brittan states that ``this threat causes serious \nconcern to the European research-based pharmaceutical industry and to \nthe Commission, and it seems to be in contradiction with the long-\nstanding U.S. policy of providing strong protection for research-based, \nintellectual property right both home and abroad.'' Brittan also notes \nthat changes to the GATT law in the area of patent extension will set \nback hard-won improvements in universally agreed upon patent \nprotections.\n  Finally, I would like to return to my first concern--consumer \ninterest. On average it takes 12 years and $360 million to bring a new \ndrug to market. Research-based, pharmaceutical firms spend nearly $18 \nbillion annually on research and development. This emphasis on R has \nproduced treatments not only for common conditions and ailments, but \nalso for life-threatening diseases. The United States invests more than \nany other nation on research. I have received numerous letters from \npatient groups that are very concerned that modifications to GATT will \nadversely impact research and development, particularly on orphan \ndiseases for which there is little or no ability to recoup the up-\nfront, financial investment. At the close of my statement I will insert \nseveral of these letters for the Record. We must continue to increase \nour investment if we are to discover cures and effective treatments for \ndiseases that continue to plague millions of Americans like AIDS, \nAlzheimers, Parkinson's disease, and cancer.\n  Some have maintained that repealing the patent-extension provisions, \nas they apply to pharmaceutical products, is appropriate, because it \nwould make available cheaper versions of a limited number of name-brand \ndrugs a few months earlier than they would otherwise be available. I \nbelieve there is a more compelling issue regarding the balance of trade \nand the larger consumer interest. Increased patent protection ensures \nthat research and development will continue in, not only, the medical \nfield, but also in all areas of innovation. This country leads the \nworld in research and innovation; it \n\n[[Page S 18205]]\ncontributes to the public good both here and abroad, and every American \nbenefits from our leadership. Changes to the GATT agreement that seek \nto repeal patent extensions for only one class of innovations are, in \nmy opinion, shortsighted. Such changes will decrease private sector \nrevenues for research and development, compromise U.S. leadership on \nintellectual property protection, and adversely impact the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. companies in relation to their foreign \ncounterparts.\n  The competitiveness of U.S. industries is of great concern to me \nsince I became a Member of this body 3 years ago. This is because of \nthe inextricable linkage between competitive industries and the growth \nand maintenance of U.S. jobs. This is why I supported legislation such \nas NAFTA, GATT, product liability reform. I have given careful \nconsideration to all of the these issues. I am convinced that these \nmeasures will increase the ability of U.S. industries to compete and \nlead to a more viable job market. The patent-extension issue is a \ncomplex one, and I believe, any action by Congress to modify the GATT \nagreement should only be undertaken after a thoughtful and thorough \nreview of the long-term implications of such action. It is for these \nreasons that I must oppose the Pryor amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters referred to earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      United Patients' Association\n\n\n                             for Pulmonary Hypertension, Inc.,\n\n                                                     Speedway, IN.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I'm writing to you on behalf of \n     400-500 Americans who suffer from a very rare and very deadly \n     disease known as Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH). Until \n     recently, the best hope for long-term survival from PPH was \n     through a lung or heart/lung transplant. However, today, \n     thanks to research which dates back to the 1970's, a new drug \n     was recently approved to treat PPH which not only is \n     extending these patients' lives but is allowing them to live \n     full, active and productive lives.\n       I have learned that some generic companies are now trying \n     to change the law so that they can gain financially by \n     bringing their products to market before the patents on the \n     pioneering companies' products expire. I can attest to the \n     value that research-based companies bring to patients as a \n     result of strong patent protection, and I urge you to oppose \n     these efforts.\n       While I appreciate the cost savings that generic drugs can \n     offer in the short term, I also know that innovative new \n     therapies for complex, life-threatening diseases will come \n     only from research-based pharmaceutical companies. When it \n     comes to serving patients suffering from deadly orphan \n     diseases like PPH, it is the research-based companies that \n     give us hope.\n       Glaxo Wellcome recently received approval to market the \n     first medicine that will significantly extend the life, \n     greatly improve the quality of life, and help avoid complex, \n     risky surgery for people suffering from PPH. I know of no \n     generic drug company that would commit the millions of \n     dollars or many, many years of research to discover or \n     develop such a medicine, and it is unlikely that they will \n     ever produce a generic version for a patient population so \n     small. There are many other similar patient populations who \n     depend on the research-based companies to bring these new \n     medicines to market.\n       The purpose of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     (GATT) was to strengthen intellectual property law around the \n     world and bring U.S. intellectual property law into \n     compliance with other industrialized countries. If the GATT \n     resulted in longer patent protection for a few medicines--all \n     of which already face competition from other therapies--that \n     in my view is a benefit for our society.\n       Our patients have experienced the direct benefits of the \n     tremendous investments that the pharmaceutical industry has \n     made in research and development. Research-based companies \n     need and deserve the incentives provided by strong \n     intellectual property protection. Please do nothing to weaken \n     them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Judith Simpson,\n     R.N., Ed. S., President, UPAPH.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          Fibrosis Foundation,\n\n                                   Bethesda, MD, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I understand Senators Pryor and \n     Chafee are attempting to amend the Hatch-Waxman Act to \n     eliminate extensions for existing pharmaceutical patents \n     granted by GATT. I urge you not to vote for that amendment, \n     but instead to protect existing legislation that preserves \n     incentives for research and development.\n       As President and Chief Executive Officer of the Cystic \n     Fibrosis Foundation, I have personally witnessed the great \n     suffering endured by patients and their families in their \n     fight against cystic fibrosis (CF). There are 30,000 young \n     individuals in this country with CF, a fatal genetic disease; \n     more than 900 live in Illinois. I have also witnessed how, \n     for many patients, modern medicines have brought hope, relief \n     from suffering, and even a return to health--a miracle made \n     possible by biomedical research.\n       By rewarding ingenuity and encouraging innovation, patent \n     protection makes possible the investment of hundreds of \n     millions of dollars and years of time and effort in medical \n     research, all the while with no guarantee of success. Because \n     of the discoveries born of these investments, the patients we \n     come in contact with every day benefit through saved lives \n     and improved quality of life. Our health care system benefits \n     from a reduction in the overall cost of care.\n       While we certainly support patient access to lower cost \n     treatments for disease, that short-term benefit pales if it \n     comes at the long-term expense of finding cures to life-\n     threatening illnesses. The current law governing \n     pharmaceutical patents is fair and in the long-term best \n     interest of patients.\n       On behalf of those patients who still await a cure or \n     effective treatment to alleviate their suffering, I again \n     urge you not to undercut the patent protection that underlies \n     America's best hope for new and better answers to disease.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert J. Beall,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Kidney Association,\n\n                                  Evanston, IL, November 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I am writing you as both a \n     constituent, and as the President of the National Kidney \n     Cancer Association. Thank you for your recent vote in support \n     of the enforcement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (GATT) provision regarding drug patents.\n       Your action will allow significant pharmaceutical research \n     to continue on numerous diseases, including kidney cancer. As \n     you may be aware, kidney cancer afflicts thousands of \n     individuals each year and at the present time, no cure exists \n     for this disease.\n       Our greatest hope for a cure is innovative pharmaceutical \n     and biotechnology products, derived from private sector \n     efforts. To find this cure, millions of dollars will have to \n     be spent. It is imperative that Congress provide steadfast \n     support for scientific discovery and strong patent protection \n     for new drugs and therapies. My view is that this new GATT \n     law will encourage further investment in research and \n     development, and make new medicines possible. This new law \n     gives hope to millions around the world, including kidney \n     cancer patients, who currently have no options.\n       I applaud your courage in opposing efforts to weaken the \n     GATT patent provisions. Keep up the important battle to \n     support research and development of new drugs. Thank you for \n     your determination and insightful leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eugene P. Schonfeld,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      The National Organization on\n\n\n                                       Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: It has come to my attention \n     that, through an effort by Senator Pryor, Congress is \n     considering changes to existing law that would chip away at \n     patent protections in the United States, and possibly around \n     the world. I ask you to reject that effort.\n       This nation has sought to protect and foster innovation \n     since its very beginnings, primarily through our system of \n     patent protections. Most recently, as a result of the General \n     Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, the U.S. changed its patent \n     terms to bring them in line with international standards. Yet \n     Congress is now considering weakening that agreement.\n       As a member of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome, I find that possibility very disturbing. Patients \n     afflicted with disease book to biomedical research, \n     especially research taking place in America's pharmaceutical \n     industry, for new and better treatments to restore them to \n     health. But this country's huge investments in research and \n     development cannot be maintained without the assurance of \n     strong patent protection, not only in the U.S., but also in \n     other markets around the world.\n       If Congress begins chipping away at patent protection in \n     the U.S., it begins chipping away at the foundations of a \n     system that has made this country Number One in the world in \n     the discovery of new medicines. It also begins to undermine \n     patent protection standards around the world. And it begins \n     the process of deflating the hopes of millions of patients in \n     this country who depend on medical research to find a cure.\n       Please, cast your vote in favor of innovation, and against \n     any effort to undermine \n\n[[Page S 18206]]\n     patent protection in this or any other country around the world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Patti Munter,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Alliance for Aging Research\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: It has come to my attention \n     that, in connection with a proposal sponsored by Senator \n     David Pryor, Congress is considering changes to existing \n     patent law that would erode patent protection in the United \n     States. I am pleased to see that you are opposed to that \n     effort.\n       America has always sought to protect and foster innovation \n     primarily through our system of patent protection and patent-\n     term restoration. Recently in accordance with its \n     multilateral obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related \n     Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights negotiated during the \n     Uruguay Round of GATT, Congress amended the Patent Code to \n     harmonize its provisions with international standards. As a \n     result, patent terms for certain eligible products--in all \n     industries--were extended. Under the Pryor proposal, however, \n     Congress would weaken our implementation of GATT patent \n     provisions.\n       As the Executive Director of the Alliance for Aging \n     Research, I am concerned by any proposal that would have such \n     as effect. Patent rights are the cornerstone of America's \n     biomedical research enterprise. Patents provide a critical \n     incentive for all companies, particularly pioneer \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers, to conduct ground breaking \n     biomedical research. Patients and their physicians depend \n     upon access to the fruits of biomedical research--access \n     which can only occur if there are adequate incentives for the \n     research to be conducted in the first place. Congress cannot \n     expect the private sector to continue making high-risk \n     investments in research and development if there is no \n     assurance of strong patient protection (and if there is no \n     assurance that the United States will meet its multilateral \n     obligations to provide such protection).\n       This is a particularly critical issue for the aging \n     Americans represented by the Alliance. Clearly, the \n     curtailment of biomedical R will lead to a downturn in the \n     rate at which biomedical innovations will become available to \n     the public. New incentives for research and innovation such \n     as those provided by GATT must be maintained. Otherwise, \n     Congress will erode the foundations of a system that has made \n     America the leader in the discovery of new medicines.\n       I thank you for supporting innovation and research for new \n     treatments that will benefit America's elderly.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                      GATT AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked for many years with Senator \nPryor on trying to keep prescription drugs affordable for Americans. \nHigh prices for prescription drugs force some elderly and low-income \nVermonters to choose between buying food or fuel for heat and paying \nfor their medication.\n  In this continuing effort, I am very pleased to join Senator Pryor as \na cosponsor of S. 1277, the Prescription Drug Equity Act of 1995. This \nbill corrects a loophole in the GATT Treaty that gives a handful of \ndrug companies as much as a $6 billion windfall at the expense of \nseniors, the poor and all consumers. This bill would allow generic drug \ncompanies to sell some of the world's most frequently prescribed drugs \nat half the cost that they are available at today.\n  Here is an opportunity for the Congress to lower out-of-pocket health \ncare costs. It is an opportunity that comes at a time when Congress is \ndiscussing multibillion dollar cuts in Medicare and Medicaid that will \nincrease health care costs for seniors and low-income Americans.\n  Today, seniors who rely on Medicare for their health insurance do not \nreceive assistance for the cost of prescription drugs. Even if a senior \nalso has private health insurance, there is no guarantee that it will \ncover prescription drug bills. Seniors on fixed incomes depend on money \nsaving generic drugs.\n  Seniors need the savings on prescription drugs now more than ever. So \ndo the over 40 million Americans with no health insurance whatsoever.\n  Prescription drugs and the research devoted to developing new drugs \nare vital to meet the health care needs of many Americans. While the \nmanufacturers that take risks and invest in the development of new \ndrugs have a right to a return on their research investment, we must \nnot allow prohibitive costs to jeopardize consumer access to these \ndrugs. There must be a balance.\n  If the GATT loophole is closed, Medicaid will save $150 million over \n5 years and consumers will save up to $2 billion. In my home State of \nVermont alone, the savings in Medicaid are estimated to be almost $1 \nmillion. And, Vermont consumers are expected to save as much as $6.8 \nmillion in prescription drug costs.\n  Opponents of the Pryor legislation argue that it will prevent drug \ncompanies from conducting research and development on new drugs. Under \nthe Pryor legislation, however, these companies still would have had \nmore than the full 17 year protection they expected to have when they \nintroduced their products, to gain a return on their research \ninvestment. In addition, drug companies will continue to receive \nroyalties from the generic companies who market competing prescription \ndrug products.\n  Drug firms pocket almost $6 million each day that the GATT loophole \nis in effect. These companies will go to no end to protect their \nwindfall. They have launched a multimillion dollar effort to lobby \nCongress. They even went as far as misrepresenting a statement by \nformer Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, by portraying him as a strong \nsupporter of their billion dollar windfall.\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to protect consumers against \nthese drug company giants. I urge my colleagues to support the \nPrescription Drug Equity Act of 1995 and pass this legislation as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe amendment offered by my colleague, for though it is well \nintentioned, it does have important potential adverse effects on our \ninternational trade agreements.\n  This legislation would deny innovator pharmaceutical products the \nfull statutory term of patent protection that was provided under GATT \nand the Uruguay Round Agreements Act [URAA]. There is a requirement in \nthe GATT Intellectual Property Agreement [TRIPS], found in article \n70:2, that WTO members provide TRIPS level patent protection for \nexisting subject matter on the date of application of the agreement for \nthe country in question. This requirement will greatly benefit U.S. \nindustries across a broad range of intellectual property elements; not \njust those industries concerned about pharmaceutical patents. It is in \nthe U.S. interest that countries with weak patent protection provide \nthe shortest possible transition periods. This is the clear objective \nof the TRIPS agreement and, in particular, article 70:2.\n  To meet this key objective of the TRIPS agreement, I believe the FDA \ninterpretation of the Hatch/Waxman Act must prevail. Article 70:2 was \nspecifically inserted in the TRIPS agreement to prevent WTO members \nfrom delaying the application of the stronger protection found in the \nTRIPS agreement to existing patents, most of which we can safely say \nwill be held by U.S. rightholders.\n  I strongly believe that U.S. commercial interests in WTO countries \nthat currently provide weak protection will be dealt a severe blow \nshould this amendment pass. We need look no further than Argentina, \nwhose patent protection laws are bad and getting worse, as an example \nof what might happen if the United States pursues a policy that \nminimizes GATT mandated improvements in patent rights. And there are \nother countries whose patent regimes offer no protection to the makers \nof patented pharmaceutical products, costing billions of dollars that \nwould otherwise go into research for new breakthrough drugs.\n  I should also point out that the courts have had a chance to render \njudgment on this issue, and they have upheld the current interpretation \nof the Hatch-Waxman Act that this amendment would overturn. So I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against this amendment and for the motion to send \nthis to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Pryor amendment would correct an \nunintended loophole created in the legislation implementing the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. This loophole will cost \nconsumers billions and give a windfall profit to certain drug \ncompanies. Congress must take the responsible course of action and \ncorrect its mistake by passing the Pryor amendment. Omissions and \nerrors are more likely to happen when large, complex bills are taken up \nunder \n\n[[Page S 18207]]\nlimited time constraints. Such is the case with GATT, which was \nconsidered under fast track procedure and was rushed through Congress. \nI believe this is an ill-advised way to conduct Senate business. It is \nthe responsibility of the Congress to correct its unintended oversights \nand omissions.\n  How did this loophole come about? When Congress enacted the Uruguay \nRound Agreements Act [URAA], the legislation implementing the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], which I opposed, it extended all \npatent terms from 17 years from date of approval to 20 years from the \nfiling date. In addition, the legislation allowed generic companies to \nmarket their products as of the 17 year expiration date if they had \nmade a substantial investment and would pay a royalty to the patent \nholder. The carefully constructed transition rules were meant to apply \nto all industries. However, because conforming language to the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was inadvertently omitted, this provision \ndoes not apply to the generic pharmaceutical industry. The drug \nindustry is the only industry that is shielded from generic competition \nunder GATT during the extended patent term.\n  The U.S. negotiators have indicated that it was not their intent to \nexclude the pharmaceutical industry from this provision, and that the \nomission of the conforming language was an oversight. According to U.S. \nTrade Representative Mickey Kantor in a letter to Senator Chafee,\n\n       This provision--the transition rules--was written neutrally \n     because it was intended to apply to all types of patentable \n     subject matter, including pharmaceutical products. Conforming \n     amendments should have been made to the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act and Section 271 of the Patent Act, but were \n     inadvertently overlooked.\n\n  This oversight means consumers will pay more for their drugs than \nwould otherwise have been the case. If generic drug companies cannot \nbring their versions of drugs to market under the transition rules, \nconsumers will be forced to pay more for their prescriptions. \nNationwide, it is estimated this may cost consumers $2.5 billion. West \nVirginians and the West Virginia State government will pay an \nadditional $43 million in drug costs. Those who will likely be impacted \ngreatly by this Congressional oversight are senior citizens. Although \nseniors comprise 12 percent of the population, they use one third of \nprescription drugs. At the same time, seniors live on fixed incomes and \noftentimes experience difficulty in affording their prescriptions. it \nis outrageous that Congress would worsen their situation by failing to \nenact legislation to correct this Congressional oversight.\n  Mr. President, this situation can easily be remedied by adopting the \nPryor amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the Pryor amendment, \nand I would like to be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today the Senate considered an amendment \nauthored by my friends and colleagues, Senators Pryor and Chafee meant \nto clarify confusion that has resulted from the implementing \nlegislation Congress wrote following approval of the GATT Treaty last \nyear. Specifically, the issue involves when the patent terms on \ndomestic pharmaceutical products expire and when generic companies can \nbegin to market copies of those products to the general public.\n  Since this issue has been brought to public attention, many \ncontradictory charges have been levelled which have served to create a \nsense of confusion over whether or not certain entities are receiving \nunfair advantage over the other. Unclear are such issues as: What was \nthe intent of our GATT negotiators, and did this intent change as the \nnegotiations went on? What was the intent of Congress on this matter \nor, as the Federal courts have found, was there no intent expressed at \nall? How do our trading partners feel about our addressing this issue \nnow, long after we approved the implementing legislation approving \nGATT? Who benefits and is that benefit justified or fair?\n  The answers to these questions are not clear at present. And given \nthe enormous stakes on both sides, I find that reaching a satisfactory \nconclusion difficult given the incomplete record. Moreover, this is not \nan abstract policy issue for me as a Senator from the State of Rhode \nIsland, where Glaxo-Wellcome, one of the pharmaceutical companies with \nmuch at stake here, has a manufacturing facility. Prior to making a \ndecision that could affect so many Rhode Islanders, I feel that a clear \nairing of the ramifications of this proposal is required. Given the \nassurances that these hearings will occur within 120 days, I feel \nconfident that this issue will be addressed and when it does, we will \nhave an adequate record on which to base our decisions.\n  I do wish to note that by supporting the effort to refer this to the \nJudiciary Committee for hearings, I am not stating my opposition to the \nproposal per se. I will wait to come to the conclusion once the \nhearings have been completed and when the full weight of the proposal \nis more clear.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Pryor generic drug \namendment which will correct an oversight in the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade [GATT] implementing legislation that has \nunintentionally postponed the date at which certain generic \nprescription drugs can enter the market. While this delay only affects \na handful of drug products, consumers who take these drugs are paying a \nbig price for this technical mistake.\n  This amendment would clarify the intent of transition rules in the \ntrade bill allowing manufacturers who had made substantial investment \nin product development, based on pre-GATT patent expiration dates, to \ngo to market as planned once they pay the patent-holder the required \nroyalty. This correction is needed because certain provisions in the \nHatch/Waxman Act, dealing with drug development, have had the \nunintended consequence of prohibiting generic companies from using the \nGATT transition rules. Pharmaceuticals are the only industry unable to \nuse these rules.\n  Under GATT, new pharmaceuticals are given patent protection for the \nlonger of 20 years from the filing date or 17 years from the patent \nissuance. Transition rules were enacted to provide fairness to all \nindustries and parties--patentee and competitor--during transition to \nthe new patent-term law. We must correct this rather technical error in \nthe trade bill to ensure these rules are available to all industries.\n  Both Mickey Kantor, U.S. Trade Representative, and David Kessler, FDA \nCommissioner, agree with this interpretation and believe a legislative \nfix is needed to allow generic companies to go forward. This amendment \nis tightly constructed and would have no impact on other trade issues \nincluded in the GATT.\n  While I am aware that this amendment will dip into the profits of a \nfew pioneer drug companies, I believe this error has already given them \nan unintended windfall. If left uncorrected, it is estimated that the \ndelay of several generic medications could cost consumers and \ngovernment health programs nearly $2 billion.\n  We have a responsibility to pass this amendment and help consumers \ngain access to more affordable medications. For millions of Americans, \nespecially senior citizens, prescription drugs represent their largest \nout-of-pocket health expense. Many life-sustaining drugs are already \nout of their reach. We can not let the desire of a few drug companies \nto let this error go uncorrected place an even greater burden on \nconsumers who struggle daily to pay for their prescription drugs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the intent of Senator Pryor to \nremedy what was apparently an unintended omission when the Senate \nratified the implementing legislation for the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT) in the 103d Congress. However, I remain \nconcerned with ambiguities in the Pryor amendment with respect to the \ndefinition of substantial investment.\n  When the GATT implementing legislation was approved last year, it \ncontained a provision harmonizing U.S. patent law with the rest of the \nworld by changing patent terms to 20 years from the initial patent \napplication rather than 17 years after granting of the patent. In order \nto be fair to existing patent holders, the legislation gave them the \noption of utilizing the longer of the pre-GATT and post-GATT patent \nterms.\n  However, because the legislation affected many generic manufacturers \nwho had been preparing to go to market with competing products upon the \n\n\n[[Page S 18208]]\nexpiration of the original patent term, Congress agreed to allow \ngeneric manufacturers who had already made a substantial investment in \nthat product to utilize the original patent expiration date and \ncommence marketing, upon paying of a royalty to the patentee.\n  Some have argued that the courts can interpret the definition of \nsubstantial investment, and consequently, there is no need for \nlegislative guidance on that definition. I disagree. By retaining this \nlegislative ambiguity, we are ceding the legislative role to the \ncourts. We are also creating considerable costly litigation because of \nthis ambiguity which should be made clear in the statute. These are \nresources which could be better devoted to developing new products and \nmaking them available to the public.\n  I have discussed with Senator Pryor my willingness to work with him \nto correct this ambiguity and then accomplish his intended remedy.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I take a tremendous interest in this \nsubject, in part because I chair the Judiciary Committee, which handles \nall patents, copyrights and trademark legislation and problems. Since \nthe amendment would made changes in the patent code, the matter would \ncome before the Judiciary Committee as it has in the past.\n  In addition, I want to point out that my colleague from Arkansas was \nmistaken when he said the Judiciary Committee has never handled \nanything regarding FDA matters. In fact, I think he said, if I am \ncorrect, that the Judiciary Committee never looked at the Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act.\n  Perhaps he was not aware that the 1962 Drug Amendments, which \nestablished the safety and efficacy standards for drugs reviewed by the \nFDA, were written in the Judiciary Committee.\n  This is a result of the Kefauver hearings, which led to adoption of \nnew amendments providing the efficacy standards which are often \nheralded as the model standards for the world.\n  If there is any one thing you can point to at the FDA that protects \nhuman beings and makes sure that the medical products Americans use are \nsafe and efficacious, it comes from work done by the Judiciary \nCommittee. But that is not the point.\n  Before I go to the broader policy issue, which is much more important \nthan I think my colleagues would acknowledge, let me just call their \nattention to other Judiciary Committee work on the GATT intellectual \nproperty provisions. I am referring to a joint hearing in the 103d \nCongress before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual \nProperty and Judicial Administration and the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks.\n  Pharmaceutical industry representatives, including those representing \nbiotech organizations, and academic researchers appeared before these \ntwo combined committees.\n  I do not want to take too long on this, but let me just take a moment \nor two to read from this very important joint hearing transcript.\n  Representative William Hughes, who then was the chairman of the House \nSubcommittee said to Mr. Bruce Lehman, Commissioner of Patents and \nTrademarks:\n\n       There have been some concerns raised particularly by the \n     biotech industry, that grants of patents will be delayed \n     because of unreasonable requests from the PTO for human \n     trials which, as you well know, could take years for some \n     biotechnology products to prove utility, a requirement of \n     patentability. Is that a legitimate concern on their part?\n\n  PTO Commissioner Lehman said:\n\n       Well, to the extent that that is a legitimate concern, Mr. \n     Chairman, I think that is addressed in the Patents Term \n     Restoration and Drug Price Competition Act that extends \n     patent terms specifically to deal with regulatory delay. \n     Perhaps that act should be adjusted if it is not addressing \n     the concerns of industry.\n\n  By the way, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration \nAct happens to be the bill that Representative Henry Waxman and I wrote \nback in 1984, which is considered to be one of the finest pieces of \nconsumer legislation in the last 30 years, if not in the entire history \nof the country.\n  I am very proud of that law.\n  It is one of the reasons why I am saying this is not a question of \nwhether somebody is going to get a windfall profit or not.\n  This issue has very broad policy considerations. It is not just \nsomething that can be couched in terms of ``gouging the consumers,'' \nbecause there are two sides of this issue.\n  The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, the \nHatch-Waxman bill, brought the two sides together.\n  I know it. It was negotiated in my office over a 2-week period, 18 \nhours a day. One reason I remember it so well is because I had a root \ncanal during that time, and by the time we got near the end I \nthreatened to kill everybody in the room if they did get together and \nget it done.\n  We finally did.\n  It was a tense time. It was a tough time. When we got it done, almost \neverybody agreed that this is one of the finest pieces of consumer \nlegislation ever.\n  It has saved an average of $1 billion a year to consumers every year \nsince its enactment in 1984, as we predicted it would.\n  So, naturally, I am concerned when I hear that that act is going to \nbe amended in an unwise fashion.\n  If the USA, whose officials have asked heads of states all over the \nworld to live up to these hard-won international intellectual property \nagreements, changes this major treaty right off the bat by reducing \npatent terms just because we think some companies may benefit, then all \nthe intellectual property work we have done over all these years is \ngoing to go down the drain.\n  But let me talk again about the Hatch-Waxman bill.\n  There were two sides to it. There were those who were spending \nbillions of critical dollars in research that is going to help bring \ndown health care costs. These manufacturers are putting their money \nwhere their mouths are in order to find these breakthrough drugs that \nwill reduce the costs of medicine over the long run and help to relieve \nsome human misery.\n  But one of the problems these research-based companies face is that \nthe FDA approval process has taken so long. The agency is supposed to \napprove drugs in 180 days, according to the statute.\n  That has not happened in fact. It has taken so long that the patent \nterms are eaten up by the delays.\n  So, there were those on the side of the research companies who said--\nand I was one of them--that what we must do is restore some of the \npatent term lost through unnecessary regulatory delays. The other side \nconsisted of those representing the interests of the generic drug \nindustry.\n  I understand that those who support the Pryor amendment do so because \nthey are worried about consumer costs. What their arguments neglect \nhowever, are two simple questions:\n  What are consumers going to consume if we do not put money into \nresearch?\n  And what will consumers consume if there are not the incentives to \nproduce the products they need?\n  The thing that has made the United States the greatest research \ncountry in the world is that we protect patents as a property right in \nthe Constitution itself.\n  This, again, is another Judiciary Committee concern for those who do \nnot seem to appreciate that point.\n  There are those on the consumer side who legitimately asked why it \ntakes so long to get generic drugs approved after the innovator drugs \ncome off patent. They suggested the availability of an abbreviated new \ndrug application so they did not have to go through the whole safety \nand efficacy process.\n  It would have taken them 2 to 3 years to take a product like Zantac--\nwhich I mention since that product has been attacked here--and \nduplicate it so that they can reduce the price for the benefit of \nconsumers.\n  So what did we do? We worked hard to enable those generic companies \nto be able to do what would be called infringement in any other \nindustry.\n  As a consequence of this change, these generic manufacturing \ncompanies were able to borrow from the work of the research-based \ncompanies who are spending as much as half a billion dollars to produce \none marketable drug, and produce a bioequivalent of a \n\n[[Page S 18209]]\ndrug such as Zantac that becomes effective the day Zantac comes off the \npatent.\n  Or a better illustration might be Valium. When Valium's patent \nexpired, the Hatch-Waxman bill provided that all kinds of generic \ncompanies were able to produce their version of Valium that very day, \nrather than be delayed the 2 or 3 years through the whole process \nagain.\n  That is important, because what we did is bring both sides together \nto create the generic industry as we know it today. In fact, I am proud \nto have been called on occasion ``the father of the generic drug \nindustry.''\n  So I have a tremendous interest in making sure that the generic \nindustry is solid and producing lower-cost drugs.\n  But I also have a tremendous interest in seeing that research \ncompanies are given fair deals on their patents.\n  Now, when we came up with the Hatch-Waxman bill we knew there would \nbe winners and losers.\n  Both sides knew this.\n  They were willing to make trade-offs in order to accomplish a greater \ngoal.\n  We knew there were winners and losers with the Waxman-Hatch bill, and \nwe also knew that when GATT was finalized there would be winners and \nlosers.\n  Now, I think Dr. Koop's position has been misrepresented by the other \nside, some of whom do not think he understands what really went on. \nThere seems to be some confusion about Dr. Koop, our former Surgeon \nGeneral, who is probably the leading doctor in the history of this \ncountry.\n  I think Dr. Koop has a pretty good reputation in the field of public \nhealth. He was a most outstanding Surgeon General. I did not always \nagree with him, but I always respect his views.\n  Dr. Koop wrote a letter to clarify that those on the other side could \nnot misrepresent his position any more.\n  That letter is printed in today's issue of Roll Call. It makes, I \nbelieve, an eloquent case against the Pryor amendment.\n  I will submit for my colleagues' consideration this letter to Morton \nKondracke, Executive Editor of Roll Call, from Dr. C. Everett Koop, \nformer Surgeon General of the United States. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full letter be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Koop on Pharmaceuticals\n\n       To the Editor:\n       In your Food & Drug Policy Briefing (Oct. 9), an article \n     appeared concerning patent protection under the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I am of the firm belief that \n     any action on the part of the Senate to weaken the hard-\n     fought patent protections of GATT would imperil the future of \n     intellectual property rights and undermine the research \n     activities of pioneering pharmaceutical companies.\n       The right to claim ideas as property allows innovators to \n     invest their time and money bringing those ides to fruition. \n     It is the basis of our patent system that allowed American \n     ingenuity to prosper throughout the Industrial Age. Today, we \n     are at the dawn of an Information Age and now, more than \n     ever, the rights of intellectual property holders must be \n     protected.\n       Consider the enormous investment in time, money, and \n     brainpower required to bring a single new medicine to \n     patients: 12 years and more than $350 million is the average \n     investment. Only 20 percent of new compounds tested in a \n     laboratory ever find their way onto pharmacy shelves. Only a \n     third of those ever earns a return on the colossal investment \n     made to discover it.\n       Though risky and expensive, this process works. The U.S. is \n     the world leader in the development of innovative new \n     medicines. Proceeds from the sales of these medicines support \n     the work and research invested in new successful drugs, as \n     well as the thousands of drugs that never make it out of the \n     lab.\n       Patent protection makes that investment in research \n     worthwhile--and possible. Recently, patent protection around \n     the world was strengthened and harmonized by GATT, which \n     required changes that equalized intellectual property \n     protection in all participating countries. These changes are \n     important to encourage the risky, expensive research \n     necessary to provide new medicines to fulfill unmet medical \n     needs.\n       Now, some generic drug companies are challenging GATT's \n     advance in intellectual property protection. They are urging \n     Congress to amend the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act to give them an \n     advantage under GATT that no other industry enjoys.\n       A key provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act gives generic drug \n     companies a jump-start on marketing by allowing them to use a \n     patented product for development and testing before the \n     patent expires. This special exemption from patent law is not \n     allowed for any other industry.\n       In return for these special benefits, the Hatch-Waxman Act \n     requires generic drug companies to wait until the expiration \n     of the research companies' patents before they can begin \n     marketing their drugs. Now, the generic drug industry is \n     asking Congress to give it a special exemption from that \n     restriction as well.\n       In my opinion, that would be unwise. Treatment discovery \n     has already slowed; we should reverse that process, not \n     ensure it.\n       Generic drugs play an important role in helping lower the \n     cost of medicines. But it is the pharmaceutical research \n     industry that discovers and develops those medicines in the \n     first place, investing billions of dollars in research and \n     development that can span decades without any guarantee of \n     success--an investment made possible by our system of patent \n     protection.\n  Mr. HATCH. Preserve patent protection and you preserve the \nopportunity for the discovery of future cures and treatment for \ndisease. Undercut that protection and you undercut America's hope for \nnew and better answers to our health care needs.\n  It is for this reason that I must rise tonight in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senators Pryor, Chafee, and Brown.\n  Whenever Senator Pryor and I join in debate over pharmaceutical \nissues, I am sure some of our colleagues want to say, ``Here we go \nagain.''\n  Well, here we go again.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because the current statutory \nframework, as interpreted by several recent court decisions, reflects \nsound policy and should not be disturbed.\n  I am glad we are having this debate today, as I welcome the \nopportunity to put the issue in better perspective.\n  This is a debate that cuts across party lines.\n  Reasonable people may disagree about the best course of action to \ntake on this amendment, but it is still the same debate: Who is going \nto benefit, the research companies or the generic companies?\n  The generics have benefited greatly from what I have personally done \nfor them, and so have the research companies.\n  But our overriding goal here must be to make sure we keep in place \nthe incentives necessary for America to continue as the world leader in \ndeveloping innovative medical technologies that can be delivered at \ncompetitive prices. The bottom line is that the Pryor amendment would \nundermine that goal.\n  At the end of this debate, I am hopeful that my colleagues will share \nmy strong conviction that two relevant laws--the Drug Price Competition \nand Patent Term Restoration Act, sometimes known as Waxman-Hatch or \nHatch-Waxman and the GATT Treaty--act together to advance important \npublic health and trade policies.\n  I believe it is clear that the Senate must reject the Pryor amendment \nif we are to maintain that balance.\n  Let me summarize my three basic objections to this amendment:\n  First, many experts in international trade believe that the adoption \nof this amendment would send precisely the wrong signal to our trading \npartners, some of whom have had notorious track records of being \npatent-unfriendly.\n  A major gain we made with GATT was to win international harmonization \nwith a 2-year patent term. Adoption of the Pryor amendment could cause \nbacksliding on the part of foreign countries required to implement and \nenforce their obligations under GATT. Let us not steal defeat from the \njaws of victory.\n  Second, the Waxman-Hatch Act achieved a careful balance between the \ngeneric and innovator sectors of the pharmaceutical industry.\n  The proponents of the Pryor amendment urge that only one industry is \nsingled out for different treatment under the GATT implementing \nlegislation.\n  What is absent from that line of argument is the fact that only one \nindustry, the generic drug industry, is permitted by current law to \nengage in activities that in any other industry would constitute patent \ninfringement, as I have said before.\n  A recent Federal district court reviewed the relevant provisions of \nlaw and concluded, ``This was no more a windfall to the * * * [pioneer \nfirms] * * * than the windfall which benefited many patent holders when \nthe seventeen year term of patents was extended to twenty years.'' \n\n[[Page S 18210]]\n\n  Third, if the Pryor amendment is adopted, it may run afoul of the \ntakings clause of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. Patents are \nrecognized and protected by American courts and by our Constitution as \nproperty.\n  By repealing patent extensions granted under the GATT legislation and \nreducing vested patent terms, the Pryor amendment could trigger the \nguarantee that affected property holders receive just compensation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an October 24 ``Dear \nColleague'' letter signed by a bipartisan group of 11 Senators, and a \nDecember 6 ``Dear Colleague'' letter discussing these issues be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to indicate our bipartisan \n     opposition to an amendment which may be offered during Senate \n     consideration of S. 1357, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1995. That amendment would deny U.S. innovator \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers international patent protections \n     provided under key provisions of the GATT implementing \n     legislation.\n       The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) implemented the \n     United States' obligations under GATT by providing that the \n     term of any patent in force on June 8, 1995, be the greater \n     of 20 years from the applicable filing date or 17 years from \n     the date of grant. These critically-important patent \n     provisions benefit all industries and all patent holders.\n       Nevertheless, a handful of generic drug companies have \n     urged Congress to rewrite the law in effect to eliminate the \n     20-year term for certain prescription drug patents by \n     allowing generic companies to sidestep existing statutory \n     provisions under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act of 1984 (``Hatch-Waxman'') that preclude the \n     generic from entering the market until the full term of the \n     pioneer's patent has expired.\n       Repealing this provision of the URAA would: weaken the U.S. \n     position in negotiating and enforcing strong international \n     patent protection which was a major achievement of the GATT; \n     have a chilling effect on biomedical research in the \n     pharmaceutical industry; and be subject to legal challenge as \n     an unconstitutional taking of property.\n       It is inappropriate to consider a change of this magnitude \n     in the context of budget reconciliation. Both Hatch-Waxman \n     and the Uruguay Round were hard-won compromises which were \n     negotiated very carefully. The amendment has both trade and \n     intellectual property implications, as well as substantial \n     implications for food and drug law. Furthermore, this issue \n     is now before the Federal courts in ongoing litigation and \n     any action at this time would be premature.\n       For these reasons, as discussed in detail in the \n     attachments, we urge you to oppose consideration of the GATT \n     patent amendment during debate on budget reconciliation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Christopher J. Dodd; Orrin G. Hatch; Joseph I. Lieberman; \n           Alfonse M. D'Amato; Charles E. Gressley; Lauch \n           Faircloth; Mike DeWine; Carol Mosely-Braun; Ernest F. \n           Hollings; Jesse Helms; Dan Coats.\n\n\n      the gatt amendment would undermine america's trade position\n\n       Intellectual property rights were addressed on a \n     multilateral trade basis for the first time in the history of \n     GATT during the Uruguay Round. As a result of hard-fought \n     compromises, worldwide standards for protecting and enforcing \n     intellectual property rights were established, and \n     intellectual property protection was significantly improved.\n       The decision to tackle patent rights during the Uruguay \n     Round, despite the reluctance of some developing countries, \n     reflects the complexity of international trade and the \n     international significance of patent rights.\n       As the principal source of inventive activity, the U.S. \n     stands to gain substantially from the Agreement on Trade-\n     Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) improvements \n     in patent protection worldwide. In countries that previously \n     provided limited patent protection, a minimum 20-year patent \n     term must be granted immediately upon their acceptance of the \n     TRIPs obligations. Enhanced patent protection overseas will \n     have a significant impact on the commercial interests of the \n     United States and the resulting economic gains and job \n     creation in the United States will be considerable.\n       The Uruguay Round agreement was a landmark achievement, but \n     the real test comes when countries implement their \n     multilateral obligations under GATT. Since the U.S. insisted \n     on the inclusion of enhanced patent protections in the \n     Uruguay Round agreements and historically has been the \n     leading international advocate for broadening patent rights, \n     it is essential that the U.S. be a world leader on GATT \n     implementation.\n       Enhanced patent protection will be diminished abroad if the \n     United States itself violates the patent term embodied in \n     TRIPs. It is almost certain that such an action would provide \n     foreign-based pirates and patent infringers with potent \n     ammunition in seeking to have their domestic governments \n     devise measures that are inconsistent with TRIPs--thereby \n     denying U.S. patent holders their rights secured by TRIPs.\n       A report just released by two American Enterprise Institute \n     (AEI) analysts concludes that such ``weaken[ing] [of] the \n     patent system during this critical period of implementing the \n     TRIPs agreement could well give developing countries a \n     pretext for backing away from their GATT commitments to \n     strengthen the protection of intellectual property.'' They \n     point out several developing nations, including India, \n     Singapore, and Thailand, which are already attempting ``to \n     dilute and evade'' the patent protection commitments they \n     accepted during the Uruguay Round.\n       It is clear that, in this patent-unfriendly context, the \n     proposed amendment would be interpreted internationally as \n     encouraging a minimalist's interpretation of GATT's \n     improvements in patent protection. As the AEI analysts \n     conclude, America's trading partners will construe the \n     amendment as a green light to act inconsistently with GATT: \n     ``Thus, any signal that the United States itself is \n     contemplating weakening its TRIPs obligations will \n     undoubtedly be seized upon by these countries as a pretext to \n     resist pressure to put in place strong intellectual property \n     protections.'' Having redefined patent terms domestically in \n     order to secure enhanced patent rights overseas, it would be \n     imprudent for this Congress to send any such signal.\n       The international trade ramifications extend beyond \n     questions of intellectual property protection. The positions \n     advocated by proponents of this amendment ``are likely to be \n     turned against the United States in future trade \n     negotiations,'' according to the AEI analysts. The AEI report \n     concludes that arguments advanced in support of the amendment \n     ``will come to haunt U.S. negotiators'' and ``play rights \n     into the hands of developing countries who still maintain and \n     defend compulsory licensing.''\n       For all of these reasons, the AEI analysts conclude that \n     USTR Kantor's contention that the amendment would not \n     undermine America's position in international trade \n     negotiations ``would seem to come under the heading of `` \n     `whistling in the wind.' ''\n       Significantly, USTR Kantor's position has been strongly \n     countered by his predecessors, former-Ambassadors Clayton \n     Yeutter and Bill Brock. Ambassador Brock asserts that nations \n     which in the past have denied American investors patent \n     protection ``will see this retreat on our part as a ready \n     excuse to implement their own minimalist versions of \n     intellectual property protection.'' Thus, Ambassador Brock \n     concludes, we would be unable ``to force other nations to \n     adhere to the TRIPs agreement if we set this unfortunate \n     precedent.''\n       Similarly, the Emergency Committee for American Trade \n     (ECAT) concludes, ``A U.S. retreat from its own commitments \n     to increased intellectual property protection for all \n     patented products would be a destructive precedent that could \n     lead to an unraveling of hard-won gains.''\n       The European Community (EC) has expressed similar ``serious \n     concerns'' about any such precedent. The Vice-President of \n     the European Commission believes the amendment ``would \n     contradict our mutual aim of providing a reasonably high and \n     secure protection for the huge investments made by EC and US \n     research-based pharmaceutical companies'' and ``send a \n     negative and highly visible signal to those numerous \n     countries which are still in the process of preparing new \n     legislation on the protection of pharmaceutical inventions.''\n       As America's trading partners implement GATT, it is vital \n     that the U.S. be in a position to demand that they adopt \n     legislation consistent with the requirements embodied in the \n     Uruguay Round agreements. In order to do so, we cannot be \n     childed into adopting an ill-considered amendment that \n     vitiates patent protection for American patent holders.\n\n\n    the gatt patent amendment will chill r in research-intensive \n                               industries\n\n       Intellectual property rights are critical to all American \n     industries and should not be lightly disregarded. They are \n     particularly important to the pharmaceutical industry because \n     they fuel the engine that drives the biomedical research \n     enterprise and result in numerous therapeutic advances.\n       An amendment that eliminates the GATT patent benefits for \n     pharmaceutical products would undermine a critically \n     important incentive for research and development.\n       As with other research-incentive industries in the United \n     States, the pioneer pharmaceutical industry has benefited \n     significantly from America's patent system. Due to the high \n     costs and significant risks associated with developing and \n     marketing prescription drugs, patents have allowed \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers to attract the risk capital \n     necessary to develop and clinically test innovative new \n     therapies.\n       The results of such ground breaking biomedical research \n     flows directly to patients who have access to drugs for \n     complex and life-threatening diseases which are developed \n     only by pioneer pharmaceutical companies. We should continue \n     to reward their ingenuity and encourage their innovation.\n       If Congress encourages a curtailment of biomedical R by \n     limiting incentives, it inevitably will cause a downturn in \n     the rate at which biomedical inventions will become available \n     to the public. For this reason, an array of patient and \n     research groups--including the American Association for \n     Cancer Research, the Alliance for Aging Research, the Cystic \n     Fibrosis Foundation, the Allergy and \n\n[[Page S 18211]]\n     Asthma Network/Mothers of Asthmatics, and the Autism Society--oppose \n     the amendment.\n\n\n the gatt patent amendment could effect an unconstitutional taking of \n                                property\n\n       Legal analysis supports the view that the proposed GATT \n     amendment ``would clearly deprive the patent holders of their \n     property rights. . . .'' Patents have traditionally been \n     recognized and protected by American courts as property.\n       Based upon existing precedents, it can be argued that any \n     legislation affecting either the exclusive use of a product \n     to which a patent holder is entitled, or the time during \n     which the patent holder is entitled to that exclusive use, \n     affects core elements of the property right represented by a \n     patent.\n       By repealing patent extensions granted under the URAA, and \n     reducing vested patent terms to which existing patent holders \n     are currently entitled, this amendment could trigger the \n     Fifth Amendment guarantee that the property holders receive \n     just compensation.\n       In this era of fiscal constraints, and particularly in the \n     context of the budget reconciliation debate, it would be \n     ironic indeed for Congress to impose such financial \n     obligations on an already-strained federal budget. We should \n     carefully consider whether the amendment would have such an \n     effect.\n\n\n   it is inappropriate to consider the gatt patent amendment during \n                             reconciliation\n\n       Regardless of one's views about its merits, it is clear \n     that a GATT patent amendment would be inappropriate at this \n     point.\n       The proposed amendment is not a technical amendment as it \n     has been characterized by its proponents, who suggest they \n     are simply trying to correct a ``simple mistake in \n     legislative drafting'' that resulted in a ``legal loophole'' \n     in the URAA. The facts are quite different.\n       The amendment would result in substantial changes in two \n     statutes--the URAA and the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-\n     Waxman Act represents a careful balance between the interests \n     of innovator manufacturers and generic drug companies. It has \n     worked well for over 10 years and should not be amended \n     lightly. Even minor changes to Hatch-Waxman could have \n     profound effects on all segments of the pharmaceutical \n     industry.\n       Under Hatch-Waxman, generic drug companies are already \n     given significant advantages. They are allowed to begin \n     development of their generic drugs while the pioneer's patent \n     remains in effect, and they can rely on the safety and \n     efficacy data developed by the innovator. The proposed GATT \n     amendment would negate a complementary provision in the \n     Hatch-Waxman Act; that provision requires generic companies \n     to respect the pioneer's full patent term, and thereby upset \n     the balance codified in that statute.\n       The dramatic changes that would result from the proposed \n     amendment would occur without the benefit of prior \n     congressional consideration. The proposed amendment would \n     have a direct and significant effect on patent rights, which \n     fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       We should not rush to legislate in this area before all \n     Committees of relevant jurisdiction have had a reasonable \n     opportunity to hold hearings and give careful consideration \n     to all of the proposed amendment's potential ramifications.\n       Finally, questions relating to implementation of the URAA \n     are currently in litigation. One lawsuit addressing the \n     precise issue covered by the proposed amendment has been \n     expedited for consideration by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Federal Circuit (CAFC). The CAFC heard arguments in that \n     case just two weeks ago. An amendment on this issue would be \n     premature at this time.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to urge your opposition to \n     the Pryor amendment to H.R. 1833, the partial birth abortion \n     ban bill. This amendment would deny the benefits of GATT to \n     U.S. innovator pharmaceutical companies.\n       The Pryor amendment is bad policy. It undermines the \n     purposes of GATT, and it fundamentally upsets the delicate \n     balance we forged in 1984 upon adoption of the Drug Price \n     Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (``Hatch-\n     Waxman''). That Act was designed to ensure that innovator \n     companies continue to have sufficient incentive to invest the \n     billions of dollars necessary to produce new medicines while \n     at the same time allowing generic companies a quick and \n     inexpensive way to get their versions of the drugs on the \n     market after the patent has expired.\n       The Hatch-Waxman Act also gave generic drug companies an \n     advantage possessed by no other industry in either the United \n     States or the industrialized world. It specifically repealed \n     those provisions of patent and case law that forbade any \n     testing, plant construction, or investment in something which \n     is still under patent, thus enabling the generic industry to \n     conduct its bioequivalency tests and even produce a drug \n     before the patent expires. It is generally agreed that this \n     reduces the effective life of a drug patent about three \n     years. This is in addition to the fact that Hatch-Waxman \n     allows generics to avoid the lengthy, multiyear approval \n     process by using the safety and efficacy testing data of the \n     innovator company. This is estimated to save the generics \n     between $350 million and $500 million per drug.\n       We are enclosing a previous dear colleague letter which \n     provides you with information on this subject, as well as a \n     letter to the editor that will appear in tomorrow's Roll Call \n     from Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the \n     United States. We urge you to read this letter carefully as \n     it eloquently and persuasively argues our case. We are also \n     including a collection of statements from various patient \n     groups who also oppose the Pryor amendment because these \n     individuals know first-hand that intellectual property is the \n     key to new discoveries which mean life or death for millions \n     of people.\n       We urge you to join us in opposing the Pryor amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n                                            United States Senator.\n     Orrin G. Hatch,\n     United States Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                November 30, 1995.\n     Mr. Morton Kondracke,\n     Executive Editor,\n     Roll Call, Washington, DC.\n       In your special supplement on the FDA (October 9, 1995), an \n     article appeared concerning patent protection under the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). I am of the \n     firm belief that any action on the part of the U.S. Senate to \n     weaken the hard-fought patent protections of the GATT would \n     imperil the future of intellectual property rights and \n     undermine the research activities of pioneering \n     pharmaceutical companies.\n       A little-known revolution has taken place in my lifetime. \n     When I started practicing medicine, only a fraction of the \n     drugs that we now take for granted existed. Over the years, I \n     have witnessed great suffering endured by patients and their \n     families that, just a few years later, could have been eased \n     because of the advent of the latest ``miracle drug.'' These \n     breakthrough treatments have brought hope and, in many cases, \n     renewed health to thousands of patients. They are the product \n     of an increasingly important concept: the sanctity of \n     intellectual property.\n       The right to claim ideas as property allows innovators to \n     invest their time and money bringing those ideas to fruition. \n     it is the basis of our patent system that allowed American \n     ingenuity to prosper throughout the Industrial Age. Today, we \n     are at the dawn of an Information Age and now, more than \n     ever, the rights of intellectual property holders must be \n     protected.\n       Consider the enormous investment in time, money, and brain \n     power required to bring a single new medicine to patients: 12 \n     years and more than $350 million is the average investment. \n     Only 20% of new compounds tested in a laboratory ever find \n     their way onto pharmacy shelves. Only a third of those ever \n     earns a return on the colossal investment made to discover \n     it.\n       Though risky and expensive, this process works. the U.S. is \n     the world leader in the development of innovative new \n     medicines. proceeds from the sales of these medicines support \n     the work and research invested in new successful drugs, as \n     well as the thousands of drugs that never make it out of the \n     lab.\n       Patent protection makes that investment in research \n     worthwhile--and possible. Recently, patent protection around \n     the world was strengthened and harmonized by the GATT, which \n     required changes that equalized intellectual property \n     protection in all participating countries. These changes are \n     important to encourage the risky, expensive research \n     necessary to provide new medicines to fulfill unmet medical \n     needs.\n       Now, some generic drug companies are challenging the GATT's \n     advance in intellectual property protection. They are urging \n     Congress to amend the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act to give them an \n     advantage under the GATT that no other industry enjoys.\n       A key provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act gives generic drug \n     companies a jump start on marketing by allowing them to use a \n     patented product for development and testing before the \n     patent expires. This special exemption from patent law is not \n     allowed for any other industry. For example, a television \n     manufacturer who wants to market or use its own version of a \n     patented component must wait until the patent expires; \n     otherwise, it risks liability for patent infringement.\n       in return for these special benefits, the Hatch-Waxman Act \n     requires generic drug companies to wait until the expiration \n     of the research companies' patents before they can begin \n     marketing their drugs. Now, the generic drug industry is \n     asking Congress to give it a special exemption from that \n     restriction as well.\n       In my opinion, that would be unwise. Treatment discovery \n     has already slowed; we should reverse that process, not \n     ensure it.\n       While the generic drug industry continues to prosper as a \n     result of the benefits received in the 1984 Act, medical \n     research has continued to become more complex, more costly, \n     and more time consuming, further limiting the effective \n     market life for patented products.\n       Generic drugs play an important role in helping lower the \n     cost of medicines. But it is the pharmaceutical research \n     industry that discovers and develops those medicines in the \n     first place, investing billions of dollars in research and \n     development that can span decades without any guarantee of \n     success--an investment made possible by our system of patent \n     protection. Preserve protection and \n\n[[Page S 18212]]\n     you preserve the opportunity for the discovery of future cures and \n     treatments for disease. undercut that protection, and you \n     undercut America's hope for new and better answers to our \n     health care needs.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     C.

As the ``Dear Colleague'' letters point out, what is at \nstake here is not just the patent status of a few drugs, but also our \ninternational trade posture and the complex set of incentives and \nregulations that govern our Nation's biomedical research and \ndevelopment network.\n  Let me turn to a more detailed explanation of my position.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Uruguay Round Agreement Act--the \nURAA--is the statute that implements the GATT Treaty.\n  Some have said today that the GATT patent amendment merely corrects a \nsimple oversight made in drafting the GATT implementation bill.\n  This is simply not true.\n  And wishing will not make it so.\n  Negotiations on the GATT Treaty were exceedingly detailed and \ncomplex. They took place over many years--in fact, across the terms of \nfour American Presidents.\n  Given the ample opportunity for this issue to have arisen previously, \nit seems to me that those who argue we should adopt this after-the-fact \ntechnical correction amendment should face a heavy burden.\n  Their case is, and should be, severely undercut by the fact that the \nCongress made changes in the very sections of the relevant laws that we \nare now being told were not amended as a simple matter of oversight.\n  One of the chief benefits that the GATT Treaty can achieve for the \nAmerican people is to increase international protection of intellectual \nproperty.\n  These important agreements are set forth in the Agreement on Trade-\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property, the so-called TRIPS \nprovisions. A key aspect of TRIPS was to require that all 123 GATT \nsignatory countries adopt a minimum 20-year patent term, measured from \nthe date that a patent application is filed.\n  Strengthening international recognition of intellectual property \nrights such as patents was one of the most important gains we made in \nthe adoption of the GATT Treaty. These rights act to protect innovative \nAmerican firms, which all to often have been the victims of \nunscrupulous behavior by foreign competitors who have expropriated \nAmerican know-how.\n  Obviously, all World Trade Organization member countries must take \nseriously their obligations to respect intellectual property rights \nunder the GATT Treaty and ensure that there will be no back sliding.\n  It is vital that America must also be perceived as honoring its \nobligation as a World Trade Organization member.\n  I recognize that Ambassador Kantor has been identified as one who is \nsupportive of this type of Pryor amendment.\n  In a September 18 letter to Senator Pryor, Mr. Kantor takes a view \nthat the approach advocated by the Pryor amendment does not weaken the \ncampaign for stronger patent protection abroad and reflects the intent \nof the drafters of the URAA. I disagree with him, and I disagree with \nSenator Pryor on both scores.\n  First, I would like to point out that two former U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives, William Brock and Clayton Yeutter, have stated that \nthe recently adopted GATT Treaty is a major improvement that benefits \nthe American public.\n  They have explained that changing the implementing legislation now \nsends exactly the wrong message.\n  Mr. President, both of these international trade experts were active \nparticipants in the TRIPS negotiations during their respective \nstewardships at the U.S. Trade Representatives' Office as U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives.\n  As Mr. Yeutter wrote to the Finance Committee in September of this \nyear:\n\n       In the Uruguay Round, one of the principal objectives of \n     the United States was to strengthen international protection \n     of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and \n     semiconductor lay-outs. The United States leads the world in \n     ideas and innovation, particularly in cutting-edge \n     technologies such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Thus, \n     . . . TRIPS . . . was a major breakthrough for the United \n     States.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In my view, adding further preferential exceptions to the \n     Uruguay Round's 20-year minimum patent term, for the generic \n     drug industry or anyone else, would set an unfortunate \n     precedent and seriously undermine U.S. efforts to secure \n     stronger International IPR disciplines. Many developing \n     countries have long opposed effective patent protection for \n     pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals in order to \n     protect domestic industries engaged in illicitly copying \n     American products.\n\n  As Mr. Yeutter clearly indicates, there are strong trade policy \narguments for standing firmly behind this new 20-year rule. These \nconcerns were also shared by another former U.S. Trade Representative, \nWilliam Brock.\n  In a recent letter, Senator Brock explained the significance of the \nGATT intellectual property provisions:\n\n       When I first proposed international agreements to extend \n     intellectual property protection worldwide under the GATT, no \n     one believed it could be done. Yet it was the crowning \n     achievement of the recently successful Uruguay Round. . . Now \n     I hear that some pending proposals could imperil the \n     implementation of that agreement. I refer specifically to \n     legislation recently introduced by David Pryor. . . .\n       Proponents suggest that this legislation is only a \n     ``technical'' correction to the . . . URAA . . . and neither \n     weakens patent protection . . . nor diminishes the United \n     States' ability to fight for stronger international patent \n     protection. I disagree!\n\n  Senator Brock goes on to say as former Trade Representative:\n\n       It will be difficult, if not impossible for the United \n     States to force other nations to adhere to the TRIPS \n     agreement if we set this unfortunate precedent.\n       In sum, in exchange for the hope of short term savings, the \n     Pryor proposal could cost all U.S. firms and workers the \n     enormous long term gains we worked so hard to achieve in the \n     Uruguay Round. That is penny wise and pound foolish.\n\n  When the comments of these two former U.S. Trade Representatives are \ncontrasted with the views of Mr. Kantor, and my friend from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, it is clear that this is the type of issue upon which \nreasonable and honorable people may disagree.\n  I understand that the proponents of this amendment are motivated by \ngood intentions, but I think they are on the \n\n[[Page S 18213]]\nwrong side of both the law and the policy on this issue.\n  In further support of my viewpoint I point out that Ambassador \nKantor's counterpart at the European Commission finds the Pryor \napproach extremely troublesome. Now, if you know the British, when they \nsay ``extremely troublesome,'' that is about as strong a statement as \nthey can make.\n  Sir Leon Brittan has informed the current U.S. Trade Representative:\n\n       I am therefore concerned that the adoption of these \n     proposals (or for that matter, any other bill which aims at \n     achieving the same objectives) would send a negative and \n     highly visible signal to those numerous countries which are \n     still in the process of preparing new legislation on the \n     protection of pharmaceutical innovation.\n\n  This information should dispel the myth that there are no important \ntrade implications at stake in this debate.\n  It should dispel the myth that the Pryor amendment has no potential \nnegative impact on our efforts to enhance international respect for \nintellectual property laws.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Clayton Yeutter, Bill \nBrock, and Sir Leon Brittan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Right Honourable Sir Leon Brittan, oc, Vice-President \n           of the European Commission,\n                              Brussels, Belgium, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Mickey Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mickey: My attention has been drawn to draft \n     legislation recently introduced in the United States Senate \n     (S. 1191 and S. 1277), concerning the marketing of generic \n     pharmaceutical products. As I understand it, the effect of \n     these Bills would be to deprive the owner of a pharmaceutical \n     patent of the full benefits of the patent term provided for \n     in the TRIPs Agreement of the Uruguay Round.\n       This threat causes serious concern to the European \n     research-based pharmaceutical industry and to the Commission, \n     and seems to be in contradiction with the long-standing US \n     policy of providing strong protection for research-based \n     intellectual property rights, both at home and abroad.\n       The United States and the European Community combined their \n     forces during the Uruguay Round on patent questions. We \n     fought successfully together, for example, for the principle \n     that existing subject matter should benefit fully from the \n     reinforced standards included in the TRIPs Agreement. The \n     unqualified adoption of these provisions by our trading \n     partners, especially in the developing countries, is of great \n     importance for American and European industry alike. Any \n     deviation from these principles should therefore be treated \n     with utmost care. This also applies to the use of the \n     exceptions clause contained in Article 70(4) of the TRIPs \n     Agreement. In my view, these proposals have several \n     significant shortcomings, and the basic philosophy which they \n     translate into legislative language would contradict our \n     mutual aim of providing a reasonably high and secure \n     protection for the huge investments made by EC and US \n     research-based pharmaceutical companies.\n       I am therefore very much concerned with the potential \n     impact of the adoption of such legislation on third counties. \n     For several years both the US and the Community have made \n     major efforts, jointly in the GATT but also in the context of \n     our respective bilateral negotiations with third countries, \n     to improve the protection of intellectual property rights. \n     This effort has been successful, both in the GATT where the \n     TRIPs Agreement has now been adopted as part of the Uruguay \n     Round, but also in our relations with many third countries. \n     This includes not only significant improvements with respect \n     to the adoption of higher substantive standards for patent \n     protection but also so-called pipeline protection for \n     pharmaceutical and agro-chemical product inventions. \n     Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go before the \n     TRIPs Agreement is implemented by our WTO partners, and we \n     both have further objectives to pursue at the bilateral level \n     in terms of improved protection of our intellectual property \n     rights. I am therefore concerned that the adoption of these \n     proposals (or, for that matter, any other bill which aims at \n     achieving the same objective) would send a negative and \n     highly visible signal to those numerous countries which are \n     still in the process of preparing new legislation on the \n     protection of pharmaceutical inventions.\n       I very much hope that you share my worries and the United \n     States Administration will convey these concerns to the \n     United States Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leon.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Hogan & Hartson L.L.P.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1995.\n     Re amendment to shorten pharmaceutical patent terms under \n       Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing at the request of Glaxo-\n     Wellcome, Inc. to offer my views on the application of the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act (``URAA'') to certain \n     pharmaceutical patents. As I understand it, an amendment may \n     be offered by Senator Pryor in the Finance Committee to \n     extend the transition rules of Section 532(a)(1) of the URAA \n     to generic drug manufacturers that already receive \n     preferential treatment under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Pryor \n     Amendment (S. 1191) would in effect shorten the terms of \n     these patents in order to safeguard the activities of generic \n     drug manufacturers that would otherwise be deemed to be \n     infringing under U.S. law.\n       In the Uruguay Round, one of the principal objectives of \n     the United States was to strengthen international protection \n     of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and \n     semiconductor lay-outs. As you will recall, we fought long \n     and hard even to get this issue on the Uruguay Round agenda. \n     The United States leads the world in ideas and innovation, \n     particularly in cutting-edge technologies such as \n     pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Thus, the Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (``TRIPS''), which \n     established effective legal protection for patents (including \n     a minimum 20 year patent term), was a major breakthrough for \n     the United States.\n       In my view, adding further preferential exceptions to the \n     Uruguay Round's 20 year minimum patent term, for the generic \n     drug industry or anyone else, would set an unfortunate \n     precedent and seriously undermine U.S. efforts to secure \n     stronger international IPR disciplines. Many developing \n     countries have long opposed effective patent protection for \n     pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals in order to \n     protect domestic industries engaged in illicitly copying \n     American products. This is one reason the United States \n     finally agreed to extremely long transition periods in TRIPS. \n     The proposed amendment would provide further aid and comfort \n     to foreign pirates that want to continue infringing American \n     patents. It would be thrown back at U.S. trade negotiators \n     every time they complain that a foreign government is not \n     adhering to its TRIPS obligations.\n       In Section 532(a)(1) of the URAA, Congress made the right \n     choice by rejecting proposals to in effect shorten the 20 \n     year minimum patent term established in TRIPS. To reconsider \n     that decision now would be a mistake; the proposed amendment \n     would clearly undercut future U.S. efforts to enforce strong \n     international IPR disciplines.\n           Sincerely,\n     Clayton Yeutter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        The Brock Group, Ltd.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n     Senator William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: When I first proposed international \n     agreements to extend intellectual property protection \n     worldwide under the GATT, no one believed it could be done. \n     Yet it was the crowning achievement of the recently \n     successful Uruguay Round--thanks almost solely to the \n     persistent and active support of the U.S. business community \n     and U.S. governmental leaders.\n       Now I hear that some pending proposals could imperil the \n     implementation of that agreement. I refer specifically to \n     legislation recently introduced by David Pryor, called the \n     Consumer Access to Prescription Drugs Act (S. 1191). S. 1191 \n     creates special rules so that the generic pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers can take advantage of preferential treatment \n     under the Drug Price competition and Patent Term Restoration \n     Act of 1984 (``Hatch/Waxman Act'') without adhering to the 20 \n     year patent term negotiated during the GATT Uruguay Round \n     negotiations.\n       Proponents suggest that this legislation is only a \n     ``technical'' correction to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n     (URAA) and neither weakens patent protection under URAA nor \n     diminishes the United States' ability to fight for stronger \n     international patent protection. I disagree! This issue is \n     far too important to risk on the basis of hoped-for ``good \n     intentions'' in nations which have never favored intellectual \n     property protection.\n       Countries around the world are still in the process of \n     implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement. A number have \n     withheld their own action to wait and see what we do. We all \n     know those whose prior actions have cost American inventors \n     and entrepreneurs billions. The will see this retreat on our \n     part as a ready excuse to implement their own minimalist \n     versions of intellectual property protection. It will be \n     difficult, if not impossible for the United States to force \n     other nations to adhere to the TRIPS agreement if we set this \n     unfortunate precedent.\n       In sum, in exchange for the hope of short term savings, the \n     Pryor proposal could cost all U.S. firms and workers the \n     enormous long term gains we worked so hard to achieve in the \n     Uruguay Round. That is penny wise and pound foolish. The \n     United States must continue to be a leader on full \n     implementation of every aspect of the agreement on \n     intellectual property in both substance and in form.\n       One final additional point. Domestically, this legislation \n     would upset the delicate balance provided for in the Hatch/\n     Waxman Act, which already grants generic pharmaceutical \n\n[[Page S 18214]]\n     firms special treatment in the area of patents not available to other \n     industries. S. 1191 would further the bias against pioneer \n     pharmaceutical firms.\n       Please give careful consideration to the negative impact \n     this legislation would have. I would be delighted to give you \n     additional specifics if it would be helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William E. Brock.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I also take exception to those such as Senator Pryor and \nAmbassador Kantor who suggest this amendment achieves a result clearly \nintended by the URAA.\n  This is the position that was taken in a September 27 letter from the \nFDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy, William Schultz.\n  I must highlight with great skepticism the portion of the FDA letter \nthat states in part: ``the URAA does not address the effect of the URAA \npatent term extensions on the drug approval process under the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act * * *''\n  It may be true that the URAA does not address the question in a way \nthe FDA and proponents of the Pryor amendment would like, but let us be \ncrystal clear that the relevant statutes do, in fact, address this \nquestion.\n  I find the characterization in the September FDA letter particularly \ninteresting in light of the earlier May 25, 1995 FDA response to a \ncitizen petition filed by several innovator drug firms.\n  The May FDA statement of policy is quite explicit on what the law \naddresses. In that statement, the FDA acknowledged that the Supreme \nCourt's 1984 Chevron decision provides guidance in the area of \nstatutory construction. In Chevron, the Supreme Court instructed ``If \nthe intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the \ncourt, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously \nexpressed intent of Congress.''\n  Consider the following five direct quotes from the May FDA statement \nsigned by Deputy Commissioner Schultz:\n  No. 1:\n\n       The agency believes that interpretation of the \n     interrelationship between the transitional provisions of \n     section 532(a)(1) of the URAA and 35 U.S.C. is governed by \n     the plain language of the URAA.\n\n  The second direct quote from the FDA May statement signed by the very \nsame Deputy Commissioner Schultz:\n\n       The URAA is not `silent or ambiguous' on the question of \n     applying the transitional provision to the generic drug \n     approval process.\n\n  Let me give you the third:\n\n       Moreover, this apparently is not an example of Congress \n     having overlooked a statutory provision that might have been \n     changed had it been aware of its existence . . .\n\n  No. 4:\n\n       . . . the agency does not believe that it can assert that \n     Congress was unaware of the existence of these remedies for \n     infringement of patents on drug products, and, therefore, did \n     not include them among the unavailable remedies. . . of the \n     URAA.\n\n  And finally, No. 5:\n\n       In the present matter, therefore, the plain meaning of the \n     URAA is dispositive.\n\n  This is quite a contrast from the recent letter from Mr. Shultz which \ncan be called nothing less than political.\n  In the May letter, this FDA official makes some very compelling and \ncategorical findings which support my arguments about the proper \ninterpretation of the relevant statutes. A number of courts have issued \nrulings consistent with this interpretation.\n  For example, on August 8, 1995 the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit issued a ruling in the case of DuPont Merck \nPharmaceutical Company versus Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n  Upon reviewing the relevant statutes the court found that, ``* * * \nthe URAA does not clash with the Hatch-Waxman Act,'' and precluded the \ngeneric manufacturers from entering the market via the Waxman-Hatch \nroute until the expiration of the affected patent. Likewise, as I \nstated earlier, on October 16, the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Virginia issued an opinion in a group of four \nconsolidated cases that raised similar but not identical URAA/Hatch-\nWaxman issues.\n  In this case, Merck versus Kessler, the court was unpersuaded by the \narguments made by the generic drug industry and stated ``This was no \nmore a windfall * * * than the windfall which benefited many patent \nholders when the 17-year term of patents was extend to 20 years.''\n  I think the District Court got the law on the windfall issue exactly \nright.\n  Finally, I would note that on November 1, the Federal Circuit, the \ncourt that handles patents, copyrights, and trademark issues, \noverturned a decision rendered by the United States District Court for \nthe Southern District of Florida in the case of Bristol-Myers Squibb \nversus Royce Labs.\n  Although, as I have laid out, various officials in the current \nadministration and the proponents of the amendments now flatly assert \nthat Congress clearly intended the result they wish to achieve, it is \ninstructive that the Federal Circuit ruling--this is last November 1, \njust a little over a month ago--noted:\n\n       The parties have not pointed to, and we have not \n     discovered, any legislative history on the intent of \n     Congress, at the time of passage of the URAA, regarding the \n     interplay between the URAA and the Hatch-Waxman Act. \n     Therefore, we limit our inquiry to the wording of the \n     statute.\n\n  I wonder what tangible information that Ambassador Kantor and the FDA \npossess on this issue of intent and why neither the litigants nor the \nFederal Circuit appear to have it at their disposal?\n  In finding against the generic manufacturer the Federal Circuit makes \na number of points in the Bristol-Myers Squibb versus Royce Labs case \nthat I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention:\n  1. The decision notes the unique treatment afforded to new drugs by \nthe 1984 law. The Federal Circuit said:\n\n       Yet, as the Supreme Court stated in Eli Lilly Co. v. \n     Medtronic Inc., the Hatch-Waxman Act created an important new \n     mechanism designed to guard against infringement of patents \n     relating to pioneer drugs, with enforcement provisions that \n     apply only to drugs and not to other products.\n\n  2. The Court also observed, citing as authority the 1990 Federal \nCircuit decision in the VE Holding Corp. case: ``We presume `that \nCongress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to legislation \nit enacts.' ''\n  3. The Court went on to say that:\n\n       We believe that if Congress had intended that the URAA \n     affect the Hatch-Waxman Act's finely crafted ANDA approval \n     process in the manner urged by [generic manufacturers], at \n     the very least it would have referred to 21 U.S.C. 355(j) and \n     35 U.S.C. 271(e) in the URAA.\n\n  4. Finally, the Federal Circuit boiled down the situation as follows:\n\n       The statutory scheme does not say, as [the generic \n     manufacturer] argues . . ., ``If normally you would infringe, \n     you do not infringe during the Delta period.'' Rather, it \n     says, ``If normally you would infringe, you also infringe \n     during the Delta period.''\n\n  So let there be no doubt in anyone's mind about the clarity of the \nlaw or the intent of Congress in this area.\n  Having discussed the trade policy argument and the ``it-is-merely-an-\nunintended-technical- oversight'' argument, I would like next to \naddress this windfall issue since it goes to the heart of the argument \nadvanced by those behind this amendment.\n\n  Let me say to my colleagues that my involvement in the Hatch-Waxman \nAct of 1984 compelled me to think carefully about the need for \nbalancing incentives.\n  The American public should enjoy the benefits both of low-cost \ngeneric medications and breakthrough products developed by R \nfirms. I have worked hard to see that both sides are taken care of. Let \nme repeat that: Both lower-cost generic drugs and breakthrough drugs \nought to be available to American consumers.\n  The challenge is to devise incentives that foster the availability of \nboth breakthrough and generic drugs. That is precisely what Hatch-\nWaxman attempts to do and has done.\n  Let there be no doubt that I am a supporter of both the generic and \nthe innovator sectors of the pharmaceutical industry. One of my great \nregrets is that neither sector has as large a presence in my State of \nUtah as they do in many other States across the Nation. But both are \nthere.\n  Nevertheless, both of these players in the pharmaceutical market \nproduce products that have enormous benefit for citizens in Utah and \neverywhere. It is for that reason that we must weigh heavily any \nlegislation that would adversely affect their ability to deliver these \nproducts to the public.\n  The fact that I oppose this particular amendment does not change the \nfact that I am, and will remain, a devoted supporter of the generic \ndrug industry. Unlike my colleagues proposing this \n\n[[Page S 18215]]\namendment, however, I am convinced that it would be unwise to adopt \nthis measure.\n  The proponents of the Pryor amendment urge that only one industry is \nsingled out in current law for different treatment under the URAA \ntransition rules. What is absent from this line of reasoning is the \nfact that only one industry, the generic drug industry, is permitted by \ncurrent law to engage in activities that would ordinarily constitute \npatent infringement--and I am one of the people who helped them get \nthere.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that before we so hastily throw \naround the terms ``windfall'' and ``unjust enrichment'' let us clearly \nunderstand the laws and policies at issue and how they affect \nincentives for biomedical research.\n  One of the centerpieces of this debate is the operation of the so-\ncalled ``Bolar Amendment'' contained in the Hatch-Waxman Act and \ncodified at 35 U.S.C., section 271.\n  In the 1984 Roche versus Bolar case, the Federal Circuit held that \nthe manufacture or use of a patented product for the development of \ndata to submit to FDA constituted patent infringement.\n  It is this provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act that treats generic drug \nmanufacturers differently from every other industry in our economy.\n  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act generic drug firms may legally use a \npioneer product to help secure FDA approval and can gear up production \nto go on the market before the pioneer product patent expires. Normally \nsuch activities would constitute patent infringement, clear and simple.\n  There is nothing similar to the special treatment afforded the \ngeneric industry elsewhere in the patent code. This unique status is \nsufficient to justify treating generic drug products differently \ntreatment under the URAA transition rules.\n  One of the things that I find troubling about this amendment today, \nlike the previous amendment offered at the Finance Committee mark-up, \nis that the Senate floor--when debating a bill to ban partial-birth \nabortions--may not present the best time or place to reconsider the \ndetails of such carefully crafted bills such as the URAA and the Hatch-\nWaxman Act.\n  The FDA policy statement issued in May states:\n\n       The 1984 Waxman-Hatch Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act represent a careful balance between the \n     policies of fostering the availability of generic drugs and \n     of providing sufficient incentives for research on \n     breakthrough drugs . . . There is certainly a strong argument \n     to be made that such a compromise should not be upset without \n     hearings and careful deliberation as to the impact on the \n     twin interests served by the Waxman-Hatch Amendments.\n\n  As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I can say that the Committee \nhas an interest in any legislation, such as Senator Pryor's, that \naffects patent rights. As one of the authors of Waxman-Hatch and as an \nadvocate for both the generic and pioneer sectors of the industry, I \nhave a special interest in the legislation under debate.\n  But since this debate is taking place now, I believe that I have a \nresponsibility to provide perspective on some of the changing pressures \non the biomedical research and development that have occurred since the \npassage of Hatch-Waxman back in 1984.\n  Let me turn to some charts which I believe illustrate this, and I \nwill do this to try to move along. However, this is an important issue, \nwhich should not just be tossed aside. Nor should we act like this is \njust a simple little issue between consumers and gouging drug \ncompanies.\n  Let me turn now to some charts which I believe illustrate the broader \ncontext in which this amendment must be evaluated.\n  There are a number of complex factors that shape the environment of \nthe biomedical research enterprise in this country.\n  By placing their sole focus at the back end of the R pipeline and \non those few products that are successfully commercialized, the \nproponents of the amendment do not take into account the nature of the \nrisks involved in conducting the necessary research leading to \ndevelopment of new drugs.\n  If the United States is to remain the world's leader in health care \ntechnology and our citizens are to continue to receive the latest in \nmedical advances, it seems to me that the Senate has a responsibility \nto look at the factors that influence participation in the front end of \nthe development pipeline.\n  In my view, it is critical that we work to create the incentives \nnecessary to attract trained personnel and resources into biomedical \nresearch and development.\n  This first chart shows pharmaceutical research and development as a \npercentage of sales. As you can see, the electrical products industry \nspends 2.5 percent on research and development as a percentage of \nsales, the telecommunications industry 3.7 percent, the aerospace \nindustry 4.2 percent, the scientific instruments industry 5.4 percent, \nand the office/computer machinery industry 8.0 percent. On the other \nhand, in 1993 the pharmaceutical research and development companies \nspent 18.3 percent of their total sale on research and development.\n  That is what is involved here--research, research, research--the hope \nfor the future that we might solve some of these immense medical \nproblems.\n  As you can see, the ratio of R investment as a percentage of \nproduct sales is significantly higher than for other representative R \nindustries such as electronics, computers, aerospace, and \ntelecommunications.\n  As a result of this investment, the United States still enjoys a \npositive balance of trade in the area of pharmaceuticals. Between 1989 \nand 1994, the sum of these annual positive balances was over $5.2 \nbillion.\n  Maybe if other industries would invest as much in R as the drug \nindustry, the United States could once again have a favorable overall \nbalance of trade.\n  A favorable balance of trade means jobs for Americans, and that is an \nimportant consideration in today's economic climate.\n  Let me go to the next chart. This next chart shows how many research \nmisses it takes for pharmaceutical companies to find a hit that is \ncommercially viable. This shows how many chemically synthesized drugs \nthere are. The reason we have the break here is because the poster is \nnot large enough to show how high this bar would really go--5,000 drugs \nidentified. Of those 5,000, only 500 were tested in organ preparations. \nOf those, only 250 were tested in animals, 5 in human clinical studies, \nand only one was eventually approved for use in humans by the FDA. One \nout of 5,000 tries becomes a hit--one.\n  These companies take tremendous risks in trying to come up with a \nmarketable drug, one that will return what it costs for the research \nand development to develop it.\n  As you can see, for every successful drug that emerges out of the \npipeline, 5,000 potential products drop by the wayside.\n  One other fact to note as we go from activity to activity across the \nbottom of this chart is that these activities get costlier as we move \nfrom test tube to the patient's bedside.\n  Let me go to the next chart because these are things you should not \nignore. This chart shows that this is a bigger policy issue than the \nbelief by some that these companies are gouging.\n  This next chart shows the drug development cost rising over time. In \n1986, the cost to develop a new drug was $151 million. In 1990, the \naverage cost for the approval of a new drug was $359 million.\n  As you can see, it costs a lot of money to bring a new drug to \nmarket. In addition, these costs have risen since the passage of the \nHatch-Waxman law in 1986. And these costs continue to rise today.\n  Clinical and preclinical tests are costly. They are difficult. And \nthey are highly regulated activities.\n  As you can see, a significant amount in gross sales must be generated \nby each one of these research companies, like any one of the ones they \nare complaining about here, to recover the huge drug development costs. \nThere has to be in the billions of dollars of sales to recuperate their \nresearch and development companies.\n  If they do not recuperate those moneys at least a part of the time--\nand they do not a lot of the time--they are not going to stay in \nbusiness. If this happens, we will not have these blockbuster drugs, \nand we will not have the \n\n[[Page S 18216]]\nlife-saving pharmaceuticals that are saving people's lives every day.\n  We will not have a cure for AIDS, and we will not have a cure for \nAlzheimer's disease or any other number of diseases.\n  The next chart shows that there is a public/private partnership in \ndrug research and development.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator a \nquestion, if it is possible to reach a time agreement on this?\n  Mr. HATCH. There sure is. I will be through in a few minutes. I do \nnot think that I will have any more to say, unless somebody asks \nquestions. I am happy to reach a time agreement.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask the sponsor. We are all here. Can we arrive at a \ntime agreement?\n  Mr. HATCH. Why don't you get your side together, let me finish my \nremarks and then we will agree on a time agreement?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. You are in such flying form. You have all of your engines \nrunning.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is why I want to finish my remarks. This is an \nimportant issue. As the author of the Hatch-Waxman Act, I am very \nconcerned about it. However, I do not intend to take too much longer. \nWe are going through the salient points.\n  This particular chart shows R expenditures. NIH expenditures are \nthe blue bars. The private sector expenditures are the green bars. The \nprivate sector means the pharmaceutical research company.\n  In 1985 we spent more on research and development in the NIH --$4.8 \nbillion--than was spent by the pharmaceutical companies --$4.1 billion \non R\n  In 1988, R for the pharmaceutical companies started to surpass \nNIH--$6.3 billion for NIH, and $6.5 billion for the pharmaceutical \ncompanies.\n  In 1991, the NIH spent $7.7 billion, and the pharmaceutical companies \njumped to $9.7 billion.\n  In 1995, the NIH will spend $11.3 billion on research and \ndevelopment. The pharmaceutical companies will spend almost $15 \nbillion.\n  Pharmaceutical companies are doing the job. Do not undercut them. \nThis amendment undercuts them. This amendment appears to be a populist \namendment. It seems to have appeal to those who think they are on the \nconsumer side. But the consumer really is on both sides--one side would \nlead to lower drug costs on the short run, our side would lead to \ncontinued support of the research and development of drugs for the long \nterm.\n  Research and development benefit the generic companies because if \nthey do not get to blockbuster drugs, the generic companies will not be \nable to copy them.\n  I have already shown that the drug industry spends a relatively large \nproportion of its earnings in R and that the cost of bringing the \nsuccessful drug to market is high and rising.\n  That chart shows one of the most significant developments in the \nbiomedical research enterprise since the passage of Hatch-Waxman in \n1984.\n  The R expenditures by pioneer drug companies now--for the first \ntime in recent history--exceeds the funding of the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  One of the major reasons that the United States is the world's \nrecognized leader in biomedical research is the public investment made \nin NIH since World War II.\n  American citizens have enjoyed the benefits of the close partnership \nthat has developed among pharmaceutical and medical device firms, \nacademic medical centers, and the NIH.\n  The basic research conducted at and supported by the NIH is \ncomplemented by the private sector R efforts.\n  This is the type of public-private partnership that we can all take \npride in and should fight to retain in the future.\n  We do not want to take away the incentives of R That is what this \namendment does.\n  We all know of too many instances in which our foreign competitors \nhave exploited their close linkages between Government and industry to \nwrest away U.S. industrial leadership. If we Americans leverage \ntogether our public and private sector resources, we can compete \nagainst anyone in the world.\n  As we tighten our budget belt to put the Nation's fiscal house in \norder, I do not think it is realistic to expect that we will continue \nto see the growth rate in the NIH budget that is represented on this \nchart.\n  But I want to see this growth rate of the research companies \ncontinue.\n  Since 1988, the NIH budget has almost doubled.\n  If we are to retain our world leadership in biomedical research it \nwill be important to retain the incentives that will encourage drug \nfirms and the capital markets to invest their resources in this \nresearch.\n  This chart shows that industry is stepping up to the plate.\n  American citizens and families around the world will benefit from \nthis research.\n  What is the difference between the regulatory review requirements for \ngeneric versus pioneer drugs?\n  Let me show the difference for those of you who may not have a \nknowledge of FDA law. These are the steps to establish safety and \nefficacy for innovator drugs for these research companies, which take \n12 years to complete. In 1990, this process cost $359 million. Lab and \nanimal studies, 3.5 years; phase one safety studies, 1 year; phase 2, \ntesting effectiveness of studies, 2 years; phase 3, extensive clinical \ntesting, 3 years; FDA review, 2.5 years.\n  Under Hatch-Waxman, look at how the generic benefit. We provide a \nshortcut for generic drugs. All they have to do to take their drug to \nmarket is to complete a bioequivalency test and establish that their \ndrug is bioequivalent. That takes 10 to 18 weeks.\n  That takes 10 to 18 weeks, and an abbreviated new drug process which \nis 6 months. That is all they have to do. They do not have to spend \n$359 million. They can copy that drug the minute it comes off patent \nand eliminate the costs. This has made and built the whole generic \nindustry and has benefited consumers through saving billions and \nbillions of dollars since 1984.\n  Are we going to just make it even more difficult for these companies \nthat have made this whole industry by now, under Hatch-Waxman, and let \nthem just take these drugs and run with them? I fought to get this \ndone. I believe in generics. I think this ought to continue. Let us be \nvery, very clear about it. This is a privilege that we give no one else \nin patent law, and we do it for consumers.\n  Now, are we going to now to make it very, very difficult to produce \nthe drugs that these people have to have to be able to survive? I hope \nnot.\n  A study by the Tufts University Center for the Study of Drug \nDevelopment estimated that it takes on average $359 million and 12 \nyears to get a new drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. I \nknow that is insane, but that is what it takes.\n  A lot of time elapses in the laboratory just determining the best \ndrug candidates through test tube and animal studies. Three complex and \ntime-consuming phases of human clinical trials are required to develop \nthe necessary safety and efficacy data that must be submitted to the \nFDA. This testing takes time and money.\n  It is essential in this debate to understand that the generic drug \nmanufacturers are not required to undertake any of this extensive and \nexpensive testing.\n  Let no one undervalue the importance that this testing process has \nfor the health and safety of every American.\n  In contrast to the rigorous safety and efficacy requirements placed \non the pioneer drug firms--these up here that takes 12 years and $359 \nmillion to develop a drug,--the Hatch-Waxman law provides for a much \nsimpler and easier approval standard for generic drugs.\n  Generic drug manufacturers can rely upon the safety and efficacy data \nof pioneer firms and must only show that their product is bioequivalent \nto the pioneer product. That can be done in a matter of weeks, not \nyears, at a fraction of the cost and none of the risks that are faced \nby these pioneer firms.\n  According to a 1992 Frost & Sullivan study, after the passage of the \nHatch-Waxman Act, the average cost for a generic drug company to \nprepare and file an abbreviated new drug application is ``well below \nthe million mark.''\n  A large part of the reason why generic drugs can be sold for less \nthan brand-name products is that the generic companies do not have to \nperform the extensive research and clinical \n\n[[Page S 18217]]\ntrials required of innovator drug companies. Nor do generic drug firms \nhave to finance all the products that fall by the wayside.\n  Generic drug companies piggyback on the fruits of the pioneer's \nresearch. We permit that. We want that to occur. But we should not \nignore what a great thing the pioneer companies do for us.\n  There is a tremendous amount of appeal to an amendment which appears \nto provide consumers with the opportunity to greater access to lower-\ncost drugs. If Senator Pryor's proposal were that simple, I would be \nfor it. It is easy to get up and make it look like your approach is the \nonly approach for consumers.\n  But if the companies that go through these 12 years, $359 million, \n5,000 tries to get one drug are undercut, we are all undercut, and the \ngenerics will not have any drugs to copy so that they can keep their \nindustry going.\n  It is penny-wise and pound-foolish to treat this like it is some \nsimple little consumer versus gouger issue. It is a lot more than that.\n  Senator Pryor's proposal is not that simple. You cannot accept it on \nface value. You have to delve into all the facts and the case law. \nFailure to examine this information about the nature of these two \nindustries would be shortsighted at best.\n\n  In fact, there could be some short-term financial gains for some if \nwe did not provide full patent term for a whole range of products. By \nthat logic, however, we ought to just make everything generic--generic \nappliances, automobiles, electronics, everything. It would save the \nconsumers all kinds of money.\n  It would also dry up all research and development, all technology, \nall the investment in quality and efficient production, including jobs \nand the vast array of choices Americans have as consumers.\n  We would no longer have breakthrough drugs which are improving and \nsaving the lives of so many millions of Americans.\n  As I have said, I have a tremendous affection for both the brand name \nand generic industries. They are both important to our Nation's health \ncare.\n  In my view, it is clearly in the best interests of consumers that \nboth pioneer and generic drug companies exist harmoniously in our \ncompetitive drug and medical marketplace.\n  It serves neither the public nor this body well for us to berate \ncontinually the R pharmaceutical industry which is doing so \nmuch good in this world and ironically is the industry upon which the \ngeneric companies themselves rely.\n  I believe we have to defeat this amendment. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio has an amendment to this amendment. My \npersonal preference would be to defeat this amendment and to stand up \nfor American trade, American technology, American research and \ndevelopment, for the right to keep these products coming to these \ngeneric companies, for the right of all Americans to have access to \nreasonable and good and lifesaving drugs and to have the incentives to \nget us there.\n  By the way, just to choose Zantac as an illustration, Zantac is a \ntherapeutically important drug. It is one of the best antiulcer \nmedications in the world today. Of course, there are other drugs of \nthis class. Tagamet, for instance, is already subject to generic \ncompetition. It just so happened that the company that makes Zantac, \nGlaxo, had gone through this long, expensive research and development \nprocess, and they were left with an effective patent term of around \n12\\1/2\\ years after FDA approved this product. The URAA will extend its \npatent life for an additional 20 months or thereabouts.\n  The fact is that the drug Zantac came out in 1983, 1 year before the \nHatch-Waxman bill, and therefore had it been approved 1 year later it \nwould have qualified for, as I understand it, 2 full years of further \npatent protection under the transition rules of Hatch-Waxman.\n  In fact, Zantac was a loser under Hatch-Waxman. Well, it happens to \nbe a winner under the GATT Treaty and Uruguay Round Agreement, and if \nwe undercut that, yes, you might be able to say, well, they are going \nto make some additional revenues--I see your chart here--$3 billion, \nbut let me tell you something. They spent millions of dollars \ndeveloping this product, and they lost a substantial time of their \npatent term before the product was approved. Even with the time it \nreceives under the URAA, it still does not get a full 17-year patent \nterm.\n  There is another side to the coin. I do not want anybody to get an \nunfair windfall, but it is hardly a windfall when firms are investing \nbillions of dollars in research annually. I have to say that there were \nwinners and losers under Hatch-Waxman, and there will be winners and \nlosers under the GATT Treaty.\n  But the bigger policy concern is how not to undercut the treaty and \nsend the wrong message to the rest of the world. Undercutting \nintellectual property protection would be injurious to the whole world, \nor at least the 123 nations that agreed to GATT, and not undermining \nthe incentives for pharmaceutical research that enables our country to \nbe the leader in the world in this important endeavor.\n  I do not think there is any reason for the generic companies to come \nin here and complain since their whole industry was created by the very \nbill that they are now trying to amend and take even further advantage \nwhen, in fact, they have a tremendous advantage today and will have \nevery year that the Hatch-Waxman bill is in effect. So this is not some \nsimple little gouging issue or some simple little equity issue.\n  Mr. President, I have a number of concerns relating to the manner in \nwhich the language of the amendment is drafted. These concerns include: \nOn substantive grounds, as I have argued earlier, I am opposed to the \nmanner in which sections (a) and (b) of the amendment, respectively, \nact to overturn the 17 year from grant/20 year from filing choice of \nthe URAA transition rules and the elimination of section 271(e) of \ntitle 35, United States Code, as the sole and unique remedy provided by \nthe Hatch-Waxman Act.\n  I am also concerned about the operation of the equitable remuneration \nprovisions contained in section (c) of the proposed amendment. It \nappears to me that this provision puts the cart before the horse. Under \nthe Hatch-Waxman law patent rights are carefully determined before a \ngeneric drug product may be approved for marketing.\n  Section (c) of the amendment appears to reverse the operation of the \nURAA transition rules. Specifically, the amendment seems to allow a \ngeneric drug manufacturer to infringe and only allows a patent holder \nto seek equitable remuneration after the infringement has taken place. \nThis is opposite of current law which makes a potentially patent-\ninfringing ANDA applicant subject to an infringement action and an \nequitable remuneration determination prior to the commission of any \ninfringing act.\n  I also will seek clarification of whether this amendment would permit \nthe marketing of generic versions of products that vary slightly from \ninnovator products without triggering the equitable remuneration \nprovisions. Specifically, I will seek clarification of whether the \nphrase in section (c), ``an approved drug that is the subject of an \napplication described in subsection (a)'', refers to the innovator drug \nor the generic copy.\n  I am also concerned about the lack of guidance on the question of \nwhat constitutes a ``substantial investment'' under this amendment and \nwhether an innovator firm may contest such an assertion made be a \ngeneric firm. In addition, I will seek a better understanding of what \nstandards a court should apply when reviewing the apparently unilateral \nfinding on the part of a generic manufacturer that it has made a \nsubstantial investment.\n  So, there are many technical questions that can be raised about this \namendment.\n  At this point, I hope I have made the case for this side, and I \npersonally hope that Senators will defeat the Pryor amendment and that \nwe go about keeping the industry going the way it has been going in \nboth areas for the benefit of all mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, with the principals in the Chamber here, I \nwonder if it would be possible to set a specific time that we might \nvote.\n  I know a lot of Senators are out, so I do not think we are in the \nposition \n\n[[Page S 18218]]\nwhere we can go immediately to a vote in 15 minutes or so. I would \noffer the suggestion that we agree to vote at 8:30, while allowing time \nfor the Senator from Ohio and others to speak.\n  I defer to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I would say to the Senator from Rhode Island, we are \nworking on that. We are very close. We are not quite there. We need to \nconfer with Senator Hatch for a few moments. We may very well be able \nto come up with an agreement very similar to what the Senator just \nindicated, if he could give us a few more minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Fine. I am just I suppose a catalyst here. But I do know \nthat people are away, so that as much notice as can be given the \nbetter.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, Senator Dodd and my second-degree \namendment to the Pryor amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that \nthe Senate should, through the Committee on the Judiciary, conduct \nhearings to investigate the effect of these new patent provisions in \ntitle 35. I think it makes eminent sense to do this. Let me just, while \nI see my colleague from Utah on the floor, get his attention for a \nmoment and ask him if he could respond to a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The second-degree amendment Senator Dodd and I have \noffered provides that this issue would be referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee for hearings. And as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwonder if the Senator could give the Members of the Senate some \nindication of how he intends to conduct the hearing or what time there \nwould be in that event. There have been some questions on the floor. \nAnd I think we should respond to the Members before the voting in \nregard to that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not adverse to hearings. I think this is that \nimportant. In fact, I think it is an appropriate way to proceed. I have \nto tell the Senator that we have about all we can handle for the rest \nof the year on the Judiciary Committee. I do not think anybody doubts \nthat. We have the judges, the matters on the floor, and hearings \nscheduled.\n  So I would be very happy to agree to some sort of date certain, at \nleast within a time period. I think you ought to give us, I would say, \nat least 120 days in which to hold a hearing. But I will try to hold it \nas expeditiously as possible within that period. We will be fair to \nboth sides, because I think both sides need to be fully aired on this \nmatter.\n  If we hold such a hearing, if the Senator prevails on his amendment, \nI would do that expeditiously. It would probably be some time after the \nfirst of the year, but hopefully within 120 days.\n  The hearing will give both sides a real airing of this. We will treat \nthis issue--not like some demagoged issue, but treat it like it should \nbe treated, that is, as one of the most important issues in the history \nof trade negotiations.\n  So it is up to the Senator. It is his amendment. But I will be happy \nto put it within a certain timeframe. If the Senator will tell me what \nhe wants, I will be happy to try to do that. If the majority leader \ntells me, I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. DeWINE. It would be my understanding, from the statement made by \nthe chairman, that he would be willing to hold these hearings, and \nMembers of the Senate could be advised these hearings would take place \nsometime within the next 120 days. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I understand the distinguished Senator, I would be \nwilling to set it within 120 days, and notify all Members when it will \noccur, of course. I have no problem with that. I will give advance \nnotice about it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator very much.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me continue briefly in regard to \nthis matter.\n  Madam President, I think it is abundantly clear after we have \nlistened to this debate--my colleague from Rhode Island, my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, both have been very, very eloquent in regard to this \nissue--I think it is clear, after listening to my colleague from Utah, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that there are two sides to \nthis issue, that there is a very complicated, a very serious issue, and \nit is the type of issue, quite frankly, that we should have hearings.\n  We should, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just said, hold \nthose expeditiously. We should hear from both sides of the particular \nissue. And then I believe we will be in a much better position for this \nSenate to take a position and to actually hold a vote.\n  I think as we listen to this debate it is just abundantly clear that \nthere are legitimate issues, arguments on both sides of the debate and \nthat we should examine those. Frankly, the only way this Senate has to \nexamine them at length is not just by debate on this floor, but it is \nalso by actual hearings. So I think Members of the Senate should \nunderstand that the vote in favor of the DeWine-Dodd amendment would, \nin fact, guarantee that these hearings would take place and the Senate \nwould have the opportunity to have the benefit of hearings.\n  There are two sides to this. On the one hand opponents of the Pryor \namendment argue that shortening the patent term contained in the \nagreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, \nthat provision in the Uruguay round of GATT would have detrimental \neffects on both the development of new and innovative medicines and \nalso the global patent protections gained for United States \nmanufacturers in Uruguay.\n  In fact, Madam President, according to former Surgeon General Dr. C. \nEverett Koop, who my colleague from Utah has already quoted, to bring a \nnew single medicine to patients requires on the average an investment \nof 12 years and $350 million. Of the components tested in a laboratory, \nonly 20 percent ever make it onto pharmacy shelves, and only a third of \nthose ever earn a return on the investment made through the discovery.\n  Madam President, if we weaken patent protections on these products, \nwe will stifle innovation, and slow down further the discovery of new \ntreatments for diseases such as possibly AIDS or cancer.\n  Two former U.S. Trade Representatives, Clayton Yeutter and William \nBrock, argue that passage of the Pryor amendment would set a bad \nprecedent. It would cost all U.S. firms and workers the enormous long-\nterm gains that the Trade Representatives worked so hard for in \nUruguay. It would do this by making it nearly impossible for the United \nStates to force other nations to adhere to the intellectual property \nprotections of this agreement.\n  Robert L. McNeill, executive vice Chairman of the Emergency Committee \nof American Trade, said the following:\n\n       . . . enhanced protection of intellectual property rights \n     will be diminished abroad if the United States itself \n     violates the patent term contained in the [intellectual \n     property rights protections] agreement. It is almost certain \n     that such an action would provide foreign-based pirates and \n     patent infringers with potent ammunition in seeking to have \n     their domestic governments devise measures that are \n     inconsistent with [these protections.]\n\n  Madam President, on the other hand, supporters of the Pryor amendment \nargue that failure to amend the Hatch-Waxman Act would place a \nsubstantial burden on consumers. Moreover, according to U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Kantor, amending the act would ``in no way increase the \nability of our trading partners to justify their failure to provide * * \n* consistent patent protection [for intellectual property rights.]''\n  So clearly, Madam President, this amendment is not as \nstraightforward--the underlying amendment by my colleague from Arkansas \nis not as straightforward as it might appear on the surface. This is \nlegislation that should be debated fully and not thrown in as an \namendment to the partial-birth abortion bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Regardless of one's view about the merits of the issue, an \nabortion bill is not the appropriate place to take up the GATT patent \nissue. This amendment is complicated, involving issues of patent law, \ntrade, innovation and new drug therapies. This issue needs a full \nhearing, so that we can get past demagoguery and really look at the \nissues carefully.\n  That is why Senator DeWine and I are suggesting that we hold at least \none hearing on the issue before adopting an amendment that would deny \nthe \n\n[[Page S 18219]]\nbenefits of GATT to U.S. innovator pharmaceutical companies.\n  The underlying amendment would result in substantial changes in two \nstatutes--the GATT implementing statute and the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act. \nThe first is a trade treaty that we negotiated in good faith with many \nother countries who are relying on our commitment to abide by the \nstrong international patent protections that were a major achievement \nof GATT. The Hatch-Waxman Act provided special rules for generic drugs \nthat give the generic drug industry an advantage possessed by no other \nindustry in the United States or the industrialized world. These two \nstatutes were developed carefully to ensure that this country continues \nto lead the world in innovative drugs and new therapies.\n  These are not issues to be treated lightly. The proposed Pryor \namendment is not a technical amendment to the GATT law, though that's \nhow its been characterized. The GATT language was carefully negotiated \nand should not be amended without careful thought and consideration of \nthe implications.\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act represents a careful balance between the \ninterests of innovator manufacturers and generic drug companies. It has \nworked well for more than 10 years and should not be amended lightly.\n  The proposed amendment also would have a direct and significant \neffect on patent rights, which fall squarely within the jurisdiction of \nthe Judiciary Committee. The dramatic changes that would result from \nthe proposed amendment would occur without the benefit of prior \ncongressional consideration.\n  We should not rush to legislate in this area before we hold hearings \nand give careful consideration to all of the proposed amendment's \npotential ramifications. I urge my colleagues to support holding a \nhearing on this issue before voting on a measure that could send a very \ndangerous signal to our trading partners\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I now ask for the yeas and nays on the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, do I have the floor at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have been recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I do not know where the time agreement \nstands. We have been negotiating during the course of the evening. I \nknow Members of the Senate are at home for dinner and need at least 30 \nminutes notification.\n  I would like to say, and I think I can speak for Senator Chafee, that \nwe are reaching a point where we are ready to determine a time certain \nto vote. I would strongly encourage that. I do not know of any other \nspeakers we have on our side. I have a few more comments I would like \nto make about this subject. I wonder if the Senator from New Hampshire, \nthe manager of the bill, might have any comments on a time agreement, \nor a time certain?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe everyone on our side has spoken \nwho wishes to speak. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I might suggest that we vote at 8:35. If there are no \nspeakers on the other side, I would like to take the remaining time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, is it possible to consider--I \nguess it is a leadership decision--starting the vote at 8:25 and let \nthe vote extend, so that those of us who are trying to get \ntransportation out of the city on an 8:30 train could make the train? I \nwill not insist on that, but if it is possible, that would be nice--\nsince no one else wants to speak and we are worried about getting \npeople in here to vote. A couple of us want to get out of here. Is it \npossible to do that?\n  Mr. SMITH. Did the Senator say 8:30?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I only need 7 minutes to make it to the train.\n  Mr. SMITH. That depends on whether or not the Senator wants to miss \nthe vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I think, more importantly, is the Senator going to vote?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Arkansas asked for how much time?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Here is what our policy committee has requested. We think \nit is going to take at least 30 minutes to get our Members here. \nTherefore, I would like to respectfully suggest that we vote at 8:45 on \nthe motion to table the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, can we protect a few minutes on \nthis side? I understand Senator Helms may want to speak. I might want \nto say one or two things.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If we can divide the time equally, we can have 15 minutes \nand you could have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. We may yield back subsequent to that time if it helps our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the \nSmith amendment at 8:45 and the time between now and 8:45 be equally \ndivided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I think this has been a very educational \ndebate, to say the least. During the course of the evening, it has been \nproposed that we try to have a time certain placed on the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution offered by the Senator from Ohio and others. It has \nfurther been proposed that if this issue goes before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, there might be, for example, a 120-day period when \nthe report from the committee comes back to the floor of the Senate.\n  Madam President, with all due respect to that idea, let us just look \nfor a moment at what that would do. We have done a little calculation \nhere. If we extend 120 days of protection to Glaxo for Zantac alone--\nand this does not include the other dozen or so drug companies under \nthis umbrella-- 120 days of not resolving this problem will give them \nunlimited opportunities to charge the highest price for their drug. \nThey will have unlimited protection from any generic that wants to come \nto the market. Simply put, we are going to be depositing $720 million \nto the bank account of Glaxo, because by next Christmas of 1996, which \nis just about 12\\1/2\\ months from now, Glaxo will have made an extra \n$2.328 billion if we fail to close this loophole.\n  Madam President, I, as a U.S. Senator, am not a stockbroker. I will \nnever advise anybody to buy any stock or make investment because I have \nnever been very successful at that myself. But if we extend this for \n120 days, or even another 30 days, without closing this loophole, I \nsuggest that we all go out in the morning and buy Glaxo stock because \nthey are going to continue receiving an enormous windfall that they had \nno idea they would receive.\n  Madam President, second, I ask unanimous consent to add three \nadditional original cosponsors: Senator Bryan, Senator Leahy, and \nSenator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Next, Madam President, there has been a discussion this \nevening and quotes by my friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, and from \nSenator Hatch of Utah, about Dr. Koop. Well, Dr. Koop got drawn into \nthis issue in a very interesting way, and it appears to me, after \ntalking to Dr. Koop some days ago, that Dr. Koop may not have been \naware of--or the Glaxo people may not have presented the true case to--\nDr. Koop when they had him sign a particular advertisement which \nappeared in The Hill newspaper. It also appeared earlier in the \nWashington Post. This is the advertisement that Dr. Koop signed on \nOctober 25, 1995. The advertisement appears to have been purchased by \nDr. Koop to say that ``Senator Pryor's bill would weaken the patent \nprotection needed for the next generation of pharmaceuticals.''\n  I called him up and I said, ``Dr. Koop, I am probably your No. 1 fan \nin this country. I have supported you, I have revered you, and now you \nhave signed this advertisement in all these papers saying that you are \nopposed to my amendment.'' He says, ``What amendment?'' I said, ``The \namendment with which we are trying to close this loophole.'' He said, \n``I did not know that was what it was all about.'' \n\n[[Page S 18220]]\n\n  Well, on December 3, a Journal of Commerce appeared about Dr. Koop. \n``In a brief interview, Dr. Koop said he did not know the details of \nthe lobbying campaign by Glaxo-Wellcome when he agreed to lend his name \nto what was described to him as an effort to preserve patent drugs from \nforeign piracy.'' In fact, the lobbying was an effort by a British drug \ncompany to retain an inadvertent million-dollar loophole in last year's \ntrade bill at the expense of generic drug companies. Dr. Koop said he \nwas unaware that a general statement he had made on patent rights would \nbe used in the Glaxo campaign. When asked by a reporter if he had been \ndone a disservice by Glaxo officials, Dr. Koop responded, ``I would \nhave to say I was,'' and expressed regret that he had ever been \ninvolved in the fight over Glaxo's loophole.\n\n  Madam President, I have heard my very good friend from Utah talking \nabout all of the research dollars that are being expended to find all \nof these cures for all of the problems and ailments and diseases that \nwe have today. I want to compliment the pharmaceutical companies for \ndoing a wonderful job. They are second to none in the world.\n  But, Madam President, I do not think we need to shed any crocodile \ntears for the company Glaxo. One, it is the biggest drug company in the \nworld, and when the Glaxo research was done on Zantac alone, which was \nover two decades ago--and they have had patent protection, no \ncompetition whatever for a period of 17 years, no competition, Madam \nPresident--when that research was done, not only was most of it done by \nNIH and farmed out to universities throughout the educational system \nacross the land, but taxpayers' dollars helped dramatically in finding \nthe research and the answers that this particular drug/pharmaceutical \nwas intended to cure.\n  Let's don't shed too many crocodile tears when we are talking about \nresearch. First, Glaxo is probably much like the other drug companies. \nThey are spending more today to market and advertise their drugs than \nthey are to research the new--as they say, blockbuster--drug \nbreakthroughs. They are spending more now for marketing than they are \nfor research.\n  Let's look at Glaxo itself, and at the pretax profits for the last 12 \nmonths: $3.3 billion--not millions of dollars, but $3.3 billion. And \nmuch of this came from the best-selling drug in the world today, \nZantac, which, unless we close this loophole, we are going to provide \nfurther protection from competition.\n  Madam President, we have also heard a lot of discussion about patent \nrights and intellectual property rights. Let me once again refer, as I \nhave in the past and as Senator Chafee has, to a letter that I \nreceived, or actually Senator Chafee received.\n  I think I received an identical letter, dated September 25, in which \nour U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Mickey Kantor, said, ``This \nprovision [the transition rules] were written neutrally because it was \nintended to apply to all types of patentable subject matter, including \npharmaceutical products. Conforming amendments should have been made to \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 271 of the Patent \nAct, but were inadvertently overlooked.''\n  That is a direct statement, Madam President, from our trade \nAmbassador who negotiated the GATT Treaty and who is there to protect \nnot only our patent rights but also our intellectual property rights.\n  Madam President, I am going to reserve the balance of my time. I look \nforward to hearing additional statements from my colleagues.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield whatever time the Senator from Utah consumes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not know why some on the other side said that Dr. \nKoop said he was sorry he was ever involved. Dr. Koop's letter, dated \nNovember 30, makes it very clear he wants to be involved, that this is \nan important issue. Here is the letter he wrote.\n  I know Dr. Koop as well, if not better, than anybody in this body. I \nwas the one who, as ranking member on the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, fought for his nomination through a full 9 months, if my \nrecollection serves me correctly. I am very close to him.\n  I did not ask Dr. Koop to write this letter. He voluntarily wrote the \nletter. Anybody who reads that letter and thinks there is an argument \non the other side, just does not enjoy good reason. Dr. Koop is \nextremely clear. I think he probably would not appreciate being \nmisrepresented.\n  Now, with regard to congressional intent, the Federal Circuit Court \nof Appeals backs my position. It says:\n\n       The parties have not pointed to and we have not discovered \n     any legislative history on the intent of Congress at the time \n     of passage of the URAA regarding the interplay between the \n     URAA and the Hatch-Waxman Act. Therefore, we limit our \n     inquiry to the actual wording of the statute.\n\n  That is a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the court that has the \nexpertise to decide these issues. I do not think anybody can doubt for \na minute that the arguments I have made do not have legal backing, \nlegislative backing, and good, commonsense backing, because they do.\n  Recently, a Federal district court, as I mentioned before, reviewed \nthe relevant provisions of law and concluded, ``This was no more a \nwindfall to the''--and he names the pioneer firms which include Glaxo--\n``then the windfall that benefited many patent holders when the 17-year \nterm of patents was extended to 20 years.'' No more of a windfall now \nthan that was then.\n  I might add that it is not a windfall because, in all honesty, the \ngeneric drugs will benefit greatly and have benefited greatly from the \npioneer companies' development of these blockbuster drugs like Zantac.\n  Many believe this debate is prompted by the patent status of one \ndrug, Zantac. I do not know if that is true or not. It has certainly \nbeen a tremendously successful drug which has literally helped millions \nof people and would not have been developed if the logic of the other \nside had been adopted years ago.\n  One of the facts that has been obscured in this debate is that, \nironically, this patent has never been extended. Let me give the facts \non this drug. Keep in mind it takes up to 12 years, between $359 \nmillion and a half billion dollars to put a drug like Zantac through.\n  Here are the facts: the patent application for Zantac was submitted \nJuly 5, 1977. That patent was issued December 5, 1978 and an \ninvestigational new drug application was filed with FDA on December 3, \n1979. On June 9, 1983, 3\\1/2\\ years after initial submission to FDA, \nmore than 6 years after the patent application was made, the drug was \napproved.\n  Upon approval, this product only had an effective patent term of \nabout 12.5 years on the day that FDA approved this product.\n  Now, the concern that the regulatory review period at FDA was eating \nsubstantially into the patents of new drugs was a major motivating \nforce behind the Waxman-Hatch Act.\n  The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act specifies that the drug review period \nis 180 days. But this, as in the case of Zantac, is virtually never met \nby the FDA. In fact, to the contrary, it takes years to get these drugs \nthrough, at a tremendous cost.\n  Only because Zantac was approved about a year earlier than the Hatch-\nWaxman law was passed, it was not eligible for the patent term \nextension part of the bill.\n  In other words, it was an unfortunate fact that it did not benefit \nfrom the Hatch-Waxman bill. Had Zantac been approved after Hatch-Waxman \nwas enacted, it could have been qualified for patent extensions that \nthis law calls for and provides.\n  So, Zantac, a loser under Hatch-Waxman because it could not qualify \nfor the patent extensions that have been routinely granted as a matter \nof congressional policy since 1984, is now under sharp criticism for \ntrying to take advantage of the same benefit that millions of patent \nholders were accorded under GATT.\n  Not only is this ironic, it does not strike me as fair, that a \nproduct with only 12.5 years of effective patent life, which expected \nto have 17 years upon FDA approval, is being castigated as somehow \n``unfairly'' manipulating the patent system.\n  Even under the GATT transition rules, Zantac will receive much less \nthan the 17-year patent life that it was supposed to receive.\n  Yet, here we face suggestions that it is greedy for a patent holder \nto want to take full advantage of its patent. \n\n[[Page S 18221]]\n\n  The proponents of the amendments are circulating talking points that \nstate:\n\n       But the Waxman-Hatch amendments did a second thing: They \n     gave brand companies a 5-year patent extension. In other \n     words, Glaxo can receive up to 25 years of patent protection \n     under current law. And now this company receives the GATT \n     patent protection as well. It is trying to block the generic \n     competition Congress calls for in the GATT treaty.\n\n  Now, let us just be honest about it.\n  That information has been sent out to people here in Congress as \nthough it were true.\n  In fact, the statement is misleading in several ways.\n  First, let us be clear that Zantac, as a pre-Hatch-Waxman product, \ndid not qualify for any of the benefits of Hatch-Waxman.\n  Second, to suggest that a company can receive up to 25 years of \npatent protection under current law is not only misleading, it is \nfalse.\n  It would seem to me that the normal patent term will have to be a \nperiod of something less than 20 years, unless you make the unlikely \nassumption that the Patent Office approves the patent on the day the \napplication is submitted.\n  Also, since Hatch-Waxman time is only calculated after a patent \nissues, I do not see how you can ever reach 25 years, even \nhypothetically.\n  I would welcome an explanation of this 25-year period. I think every \npatent lawyer in the country would be just fascinated with it, if it \ncould be given.\n  It is also the case that many believe the biotechnology patents are \namong those that might actually routinely lose time under the new 20-\nyear-from-time-of-filing rule established by GATT.\n  This is because these products often present difficult, novel issues \nof patentability.\n  I cite with particularity that joint hearing between the two \nintellectual property committees of the House and Senate, where Lita \nNelsen, Director of the Technology Licensing Office of the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, said:\n\n       The 20-year-from-filing change proposed in the current bill \n     runs the risk of substantially reducing the patent protection \n     available for companies investing in university technology.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Any shortening of patent life most seriously impacts the \n     most forward-thinking technologies, which are the very types \n     of technologies which universities should specialize in and \n     which we believe will most benefit the country's future \n     technical and economic development.\n       The 20-year-from-initial-filing rule currently being \n     proposed offers a significant danger of shortening the time \n     available for patent protection and therefore may have a \n     detrimental effect on development of university technologies.\n\n  She also goes on to say:\n\n       Also, leading-edge technology patents, such as those in \n     biotechnology, software and microelectronics usually take \n     significantly longer than the so-called average patent to \n     issue.\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       Finally, no one should be led to believe the 20-year-from-\n     filing rule will lengthen effective patent life. Most of the \n     time, for high technology patents, it will shorten the life \n     and, more importantly, will shorten the remaining life of \n     patent protection after the long development period is \n     finally over and products are on the market.\n\n  The fact is this. Zantac has never had a patent extension until the \nGATT transition rules, because it did not--it simply did not--qualify \nunder the Hatch-Waxman statute.\n  So, to indicate that it is going to reap the benefits of some sort of \nwindfall is not only a misrepresentation, but it ignores several \nsignificant facts. It ignores all of the research costs which go into \nthe pharmaceuticals we use. It ignores all of the incentives for \nresearch which must be a part of our intellectual property laws. It \nignores all of the balancing we did in the 1984 law in order to \naccommodate the interests of these two great industries.\n  At the same time, it attacks our international agreements for which \nwe fought so hard for decades, as reflected in the GATT agreement and \nUruguay Round agreement. It does this in a way that sends a signal to \nall those countries that do not believe in patents or have difficulties \nwith our position on patents that they do not have to honor it. It \nshows that the United States is not serious about this agreement \neither.\n  The fact of the matter is this: There are winners, there are losers \nin the Hatch-Waxman Act. There are winners and there are losers in \nGATT, and everybody knew it.\n  Now we have one industry that has been given special privileges, \nprivileges that I personally have helped them to get, coming in and \nsaying we want more special privileges and we want to amend the very \nact that benefited them and created their industry.\n  Frankly, I do not think that what specific company benefits and what \ncompany does not should be our focus here. Our focus should be on the \nright thing to do, which is to uphold GATT and vote down the Pryor \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the quorum would be charged to \nboth sides equally? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, may I inquire as to how many minutes I \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, this debate is coming to conclusion at long last. We \nare about to make a tentative decision on this matter.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, Madam President, that somehow or \nanother, sooner or later, we have to correct this problem. We have to \nclose this loophole. If we fail to table the second-degree amendment, \nsometime or another I am going to be back. I want my colleagues to know \nthat this is not the last they will hear of this amendment and this \nissue, because I think it is so absolutely atrocious that this could \nhappen, is happening, and that we have yet not closed this loophole. \nLike MacArthur, Madam President, I shall return.\n  This has been a fascinating debate. It has lasted 2\\1/2\\ hours, about \nas long as a typical Senate hearing would last. And now, at the end, we \nsee the facts have not changed. They have not changed at all. Those \nfacts are as follows: the Congress made a mistake and we have a very \nrare opportunity to correct that mistake.\n  Let us look now at who is on the side who thinks that we made a \nmistake and who believes that we should rectify that mistake.\n  First, our U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, said that \nCongress made a mistake, that it was never intended that these drug \ncompanies would be given this extra amount of unearned protection to \nmarket without any competition. The Food and Drug Administration said \nthe Congress made a mistake. FDA tried to rectify the situation but \nthey failed, and it is too bad that they did. Our U.S. Patent Office \nsaid that a mistake has been made by implication, and their decision \nwas taken to court. Because of the technical aspects of the language, \nthe Patent Office was overruled.\n  If we review the Congressional Record we will find that at no time \nduring the debate on the issue of the GATT Treaty, leading to the \nadoption of the GATT Treaty, at no place do we find reference to this \nissue by anyone--not by any of the drafters or the debaters, nor by \nthose opposed to or in favor of that treaty. At no time did anyone even \nhint that we were going to carve out a special exception for a few drug \ncompanies in order to give them extra monopolistic opportunities to \ncompete unfairly in the marketplace, and to keep generic drugs from \ncompeting.\n  The State Medicaid directors, Madam President, have written in \nsupport of our efforts. They say that unless we correct this loophole, \nthe Medicaid programs in each of the 50 States are going to continue to \nsuffer and pay the highest price for these particular drugs, especially \nZantac, and will be kept from buying generic drugs for the poorest of \nthe poor population. \n\n[[Page S 18222]]\n\n  The elderly, the consumers--none will benefit from the efforts of the \ngeneric drug companies to reduce the cost of drugs like Zantac by as \nmuch as 50 percent or 60 percent. Yet, we may be about to vote and say \nthat we are going to continue to give these enormous profits, these \nwindfall profits, to a few pharmaceutical companies, and to take those \nprofits, to give them those profits at the expense of taking those \ndollars from the consumer and the taxpayers of America.\n  This amendment that we are about to vote on is very simple. It is an \nattempt to kill our desire to close this loophole. That is what it is.\n  I respect my colleagues who offer it. I realize that some may believe \nthat this particular issue is complex. But I must say, as my colleagues \nhave said, that this is, in fact, a very simple issue. We have made a \nmistake. And now it is time to rectify it.\n  Madam President, I have frequently used the following analogy: You \nare walking down the street on the sidewalk, or wherever, and find a \nbillfold, and you open that billfold up. And there is a $100 bill in \nthere, and there is also the name of the owner. Do you take that \nbillfold and the $100 to the owner? Do you try to find the lawful and \nrightful owner of that billfold that contains the $100, or, do you put \nit in your pocket?\n  In this case, these drug companies have found a billfold. It has a \nlot of money in it. Rather than returning it to the rightful owner--the \ntaxpayer and the consumer, in this case--Madam President, they are \ntaking that billfold, they are taking the money, and they are putting \nit right in their pocket.\n  I urge the defeat of the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, if we want a cure for Alzheimer's, or for \nAIDS, or for so many other dreaded diseases, we had better not undercut \nthe patent process.\n  We had better not undercut the GATT process.\n  If we want free and fair trade throughout this world, we had better \nmake sure that we do not undercut something we fought to obtain for so \nmany years.\n  If we want to keep America's medical research base premier among \nworld nations, and continue to bring forth promising technologies which \nhelp our senior citizens and so many others, this body should vote down \nthe Pryor amendment.\n  It would send our world trading partners the wrong message, and in \nthe end put a huge dent in what is already a well-functioning system \nthat benefits both the research company and the generic companies in a \nfair way.\n  That is what is involved here.\n  Let me just say one other thing.\n  I commit here and now that we will hold hearings on this should the \namendment of the Senators from New Hampshire and Ohio pass.\n  We will hold hearings on this issue before the end of 120 days. I \nwill commit to that as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I do \nnot think anybody doubts in this body that I will not live up to that \ncommitment, because I will.\n  I think that is the way we should handle it and I hope my colleagues \nwill vote against the motion to table.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 29 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, let me just say that no matter what the \npros and cons are of this amendment it is irrelevant to the issue at \nhand. Regardless of how you feel about GATT or the patent protections, \nlet us not load this historic bill up with this controversial unrelated \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to table.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDaschle, Senator Leahy, Senator Bryan, and Senator Feinstein be added \nas original cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I move to table the pending amendment, \nthe second-degree amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Arkansas to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 594 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pell\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Simpson\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Moynihan\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3088) was \nrejected.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3082 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may have just a few seconds, I know \nthis was a very hard vote, a very close vote. I want to compliment \nthose on the opposing side. They made a very, very strong argument, and \nthey prevailed this evening. But I will make it possible for the Senate \nto revisit this issue in the very, very near future, Mr. President. I \nwant to thank those who supported us, and at this time I withdraw my \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3085\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The question recurs on the \nBrown amendment No. 3085.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n\n\n                      unanimous-consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request here, \nand I think Members will be interested in hearing it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition \nof the Pryor amendment, the following be the only amendments remaining \nin order and limited to the following time restraints: The Brown \namendment No. 3085, 5 minutes equally divided; a Feinstein amendment, \nsupporting current law, 35 minutes, 20 minutes under the control of \nSenator Feinstein, 15 minutes under the control of Senator Smith; a \nBrown limiting liability amendment, 15 minutes equally divided; a Smith \naffirmative defense amendment, 5 minutes equally divided.\n  I further ask that the votes be stacked to occur on or in relation to \nthe above-listed amendments at the conclusion or yielding back of all \ntime, and that prior to the votes, there be 4 minutes equally divided \nfor closing remarks on the bill, with the votes occurring in the order \nin which they were debated, and following disposition of the \namendments, the bill be advanced to third reading, and final passage \noccur, all without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, to recap for all Members, we expect two \nadditional votes to occur within the next 40 minutes. That is the \nessence of it. \n\n[[Page S 18223]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3085\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the bill as it is now drafted creates a new \ncause of action and allows a variety of parties to bring suit against \nthose who have been involved in the restricted prohibited abortion \npractice.\n  Among those allowed to bring suit is the father. Unfortunately, the \nbill does not now restrict which father can bring suit. Literally, \nsomeone who is the father of the fetus but has not acknowledged the \nchild, has not married the woman, and has not supported the child in \nany way or any process can bring legal action and get a bonanza by \nsuing the physician.\n  In my mind, to provide a financial benefit to someone who has \nfathered a child and not acknowledged it nor married the woman is a \nmistake. I don't think we ought to be about providing a new avenue of \nfinancial reward for a man who does not live up to his \nresponsibilities.\n  The amendment is very simple. It restricts the fathers who can bring \nlegal actions in this case to ones who have married the mother.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a pretty straightforward amendment. I \nyield the floor. I believe this has been cleared on both sides. I think \na voice vote may well be appropriate.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Colorado is correct. As far as I know, \nthere is no objection on this side, and I do not believe there are any \nobjections on the other side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is right. I applaud the Senator for \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3085) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3090\n\n(Purpose: To limit liability under this act to the physician performing \n                        the procedure involved)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3090.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 6, strike ``Whoever'' and insert ``Any \n     physician who''.\n       On page 2, line 10 strike ``As'' and insert ``(1) As''.\n       On page 2, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       ``(2) As used in this section, the term `physician' means a \n     doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to \n     practice medicine and surgery by the State in which the \n     doctor performs such activity, or any other individual \n     legally authorized by the State to perform abortions. \n     Provided, however, That any individual who is not a physician \n     or not otherwise legally authorized by the State to perform \n     abortions, but who nevertheless directly performs a partial-\n     birth abortion, shall be subject to the provisions of this \n     section.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this particular amendment was allowed 15 \nminutes equally divided. I do not intend to take a significant amount \nof time with it. I do want to make it clear to the Members what is \ninvolved.\n  The current bill makes liable or potentially liable not only for the \nattending physician in this case but also, in reading the language of \nthe bill, the hospital where the procedure took place. Both could be \nsubject to civil and criminal actions. Also included could be the \nnurses, as well other people called in to help with other medical \nprocedures that may stem from the abortion procedure. In my mind, to \nhave hospital administrators, to have hospital trustees, to have \nhospitals themselves, to have nurses, to have other medical personnel \nwho may be called in to assist if something goes wrong, subject to \npossible prosecution and civil liability is a great mistake. This \namendment limits the liability, and limits the people who can have \nactions brought against them to the physician or to someone who takes \nthe place of the physician such as the person who directs the abortion \nprocedure.\n  Specifically, we are trying to get at the person who performs the \nabortion itself. The whole purpose of this is to make sure that nurses \nand other attending personnel who are not the decisionmakers here are \nnot subject to civil and criminal liability.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment is fairly clear. I believe it \nis cleared on both sides. My hope is at the appropriate time we could \nhave a rollcall vote on it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to my friend from Colorado I \nintend to support his amendment.\n  I believe it is tragic that we are about to criminalize a medical \nprocedure which many doctors say is necessary to save the life of a \nwoman or to protect her from serious adverse health consequences. I \nthink it is tragic we are going to put doctors through this Kafkaesque \nexpense of winding up in prison for saving the life of a woman.\n  However, what the Senator from Colorado is pointing out to us, as \ncurrently written, we might wind up putting other people in jail--other \npeople associated with the hospital, other people who clearly should \nstay clear of this.\n  Although I believe the underlying bill is leading us down a terrible \npath where we are going to haul doctors into prison for saving a \nwoman's life, I certainly believe what the Senator is doing to at least \nnarrow it to the doctor is something we should support.\n  I will be supporting his amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. We have no objection to the Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the Chair would advise the Senator the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nrequest for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3090) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3091\n\n              (Purpose: To strike the affirmative defense)\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from California who is \nwaiting to go on her amendment, briefly I will do the affirmative \ndefense amendment and then be ready for her amendment.\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3091.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 8 through and including 16.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in view of the fact that the Senate adopted \nthe life-of-the-mother exception amendment, the affirmative defense \nsection of the bill is no longer necessary and I had agreed that we \nwould remove that provision, providing the life-of-the-mother exception \nprevailed.\n  Since it did prevail, this amendment would strike the entire \nsubsection E of the bill which talks about the affirmative defense to a \nprosecution or a civil action.\n  So, it is my understanding that the Senator from California agrees \nwith this amendment, so unless the Senator wishes to speak, I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3091) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to reconsider the vote. \n  \n[[Page S 18224]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for \nSenator Simpson and myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Simpson, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Simon, and Ms. Moseley-Braun, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3092.\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the most advanced medical \n     training programs in the world;\n       (2) medical decisions should be made by trained medical \n     personnel in consultation with their patients based on the \n     best medical science available;\n       (3) it is the role of professional medical societies to \n     develop medical practice guidelines and it is the role of \n     medical education centers to provide instruction on medical \n     procedures;\n       (4) the Federal Government should not supersede the medical \n     judgment of trained medical professionals or limit the \n     judgment of medical professionals in determining medically \n     appropriate procedures;\n       (5) the Federal criminal code is an inappropriate and \n     dangerous means by which to regulate specific and highly \n     technical medical procedures; and\n       (6) the laws of 41 States currently restrict post-viability \n     abortions.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress should not criminalize a specific medical procedure.\n\n     SEC. 2. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in Federal law shall be construed to prohibit the \n     States, local governments, local health departments, medical \n     societies, or hospital ethical boards from regulating, \n     restricting, or prohibiting post-viability abortions to the \n     extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n20 minutes. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to make clear that this \namendment is presented as a substitute.\n  I am pleased it was read because it makes clear the following: First, \nthat it is the sense of the Senate that Congress should not criminalize \na medical procedure.\n  Second, that nothing in Federal law should be construed to prohibit \nthe States, local governments, local health departments, medical \nsocieties, or hospital ethical boards from regulating, restricting, or \nprohibiting postviability abortions to the extent permitted by the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  The U.S. Congress is not the appropriate place to be making decisions \nabout medical procedures, whatever they are. The bill before us would \ncriminalize one procedure, a procedure that does not appear in medical \nliterature, a procedure that is worded vaguely.\n  All I ask is that the Members of this body read the actual \nlegislation. Many Members who have spoken in favor of the legislation \npoint to the use of scissors, the cutting of tissue, the draining of \nfluid from the brain. Nowhere does the legislation itself specifically \nrefer to that kind of procedure. In its very vagueness, it affects more \nthan one procedure and it can affect more than postviability abortions.\n  So, my point is twofold. One, that this body is not the appropriate \nplace to be making medical decisions and that, two, under current \nFederal law, States can choose to regulate, restrict, or prohibit \npostviability abortions as 41 do now.\n  When physicians make a decision to use a particular treatment, they \nvery thoroughly evaluate a number of factors: evidence from scientific \nliterature, the risks and benefits for the patient--for example, \npossible side effects--future health, quality of life, the efficacy of \nthe treatment--what the outcome will be--the safety of the treatment, \nthe patient's preferences. These are often complicated decisions, \nrepresenting a systematic strategy developing from multiple decisional \nbuilding blocks. Medical decisionmaking is not simple and these are not \ndecisions we should or can make.\n  We should also understand that medical decisionmaking is \nindividualized. Every case is different. Every human body is different. \nEvery patient brings a unique medical history into the doctor's office. \nPhysicians have to evaluate every situation as it presents itself and \noften at the last minute.\n  The risks of a particular procedure depend, often, on the patient. \nFor example, a hip replacement that restores function in one patient \ncan be life-threatening to another, for example, to one who has heart \ndisease. Medical science and treatments are constantly evolving. \nMedicine is becoming increasingly specialized. Technology is advancing. \nToday's standard of practice can be out of date in 5 years. The human \nbody will always have some degree of mystery, as science stretches to \nunderstand how the body works and does not work. Congress cannot keep \nup with these changes. That is not our job.\n  Mr. President, physicians go to college for 4 years, to medical \nschool for 4 years, to residency training for 3 to 6 years. In some \nStates, to keep their licenses current, they are required to undergo \ncontinuing education annually. They get extensive training. Medical \ndecisionmaking, I believe, is a job for trained physicians.\n\n\n       an example of decisionmaking: medical practice guidelines\n\n  For almost 60 years, the medical profession in this country has been \ndeveloping medical practice guidelines. According to the Institute of \nMedicine, clinical practice guidelines are ``systematically developed \nstatement to assist practitioner and patient decisions about \nappropriate health care for a specific clinical circumstances.'' They \nare guidelines--guidance--not enforceable rules. There are over 24,000 \ndeveloped by over 75 organizations.\n  Medical practice guidelines are designed to improve patient outcomes. \nThey help medical practitioners and patients make decisions about \nprevention, diagnosis and treatment of specific clinical conditions. \nFor example, guidelines have been developed for the treatment of benign \nprostatic hyperplasia, pressure ulcers, and stroke rehabilitation.\n  Developing practice guidelines is a complicated process. To develop a \nguideline, panels of experts are convened. They review all available \nliterature, all available evidence of patient outcomes, a review that \ncan take up to 9 months. They are subjected to peer review for \nscientific validity and pilot testing. Development of one guideline can \ntake from 1\\1/2\\ to 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The point here is that there is an orderly, scientific, deliberative, \nprofessional, and balanced approach for making medical decisions. It is \ncomplicated. It is based on the patient's best interest.\n  Medical decisionmaking is not and should not be a legislative or \npolitical process.\n\n\n                             unprecedented\n\n  Congress has legislated medical benefits, reimbursement policies, \nquality standards, training requirements. But Congress has never banned \nor criminalized a specific medical procedure. This is the first time \nCongress has tried to outlaw a medical procedure.\n  My amendment is quite simple. It says, in essence, that Congress \nshould not be making medical decisions and that States can regulate \npost-viability abortions.\n  I can go on, but in the interest of time, and giving my cosponsors \nthe opportunity to speak, I want to just say one other thing. I have \nfollowed this debate very carefully. I want particularly to commend my \nfriend and colleague, the junior Senator from California. I think she \nhas been quite eloquent in defining what this procedure is, and what \nthis procedure is not, the enormous vagueness of the bill and the human \ntragedies involved.\n  Post-viability abortions can be banned by every State and 41 have \nchosen to do so. This legislation is not necessary. This legislation \nputs the Congress in the position of deciding medical procedures, and I \ndo not believe we can or should do this. This substitute amendment \nclearly states what I believe is right.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein \nsubstitute \n\n[[Page S 18225]]\nwhich is a reiteration of current law. Under the substitute, nothing in \nFederal law shall be construed to prohibit the States, local \ngovernments, local health departments, and medical societies from \nregulating, restricting, or prohibiting post-viability abortions to the \nextent permitted by the Constitution. Let me say it again, this is \ncurrent law and this substitute explicitly states what the law of the \nland is. Under Roe versus Wade, States may proscribe post-viable \nabortions except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of \nthe mother--41 States currently regulate post-viable abortions. We do \nnot need H.R. 1833 because we already have current laws which address \nthe central issue of the pending legislation.\n  I have been pro-choice throughout my entire public life, never \nwavered, never waited to take a poll, ever since that first wrenching \ndebate in the Wyoming State Legislature because our law was the same as \nMissouri's, which was struck down by Roe versus Wade. And so we had to \nchange it, and we did, and I shall never forget the debate. Abortion is \nsuch a deeply personal and, to some, a spiritual issue. It is not one \nthat belongs in the public domain. That is my view. It is not one that \nshould be in a legislative body, to me, as a man--not a legislator, but \na man, I cannot presume to limit the options of any woman who is \nanguishing over a crisis pregnancy. That is what I have always \nbelieved, and what I have always tried to state so clearly. And as a \nman, I do not think a man should even vote on this issue. That is how I \nfeel about this.\n\n  I do not advocate or promote abortion. It is obviously one of the \nmost difficult choices or options that any woman should ever, ever \nmake. I really do not know many folks who advocate or promote abortion, \nnor does anybody else in this land. That is not what people do--promote \nabortion. It is an alternative. It is an option. It is obviously one of \nthe most difficult choices or options that any man or women--sometimes \nmen must make--buy principally the woman. I have always supported \nalternatives to abortion--and think it is so very important to assure a \npregnant woman that there are many alternatives to abortion and that \nthere are many fine support systems available for those who may choose \nany of the alternatives. And yes, yes, abstinence is still the best, \nand Who would disagree with that? But that is not what we are talking \nabout.\n  And I respect and am acutely conscious of the fact that many persons \nwho grapple with the issue of abortion do so from very different moral \nor religious or philosophical differences, and I do not spend any part \nof my life trying to inflict--and that is the word I want to use--\ninflict my personal views on others. I see that happening here. Not \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire, a lovely friend, but from others, \nespecially in the hallways, who do it with steely-eyed zealotry that I \ntire of.\n  My respect for this very real facet of the human condition has led me \nto the conclusion that abortion presents a deeply personal decision for \nany woman--decisions which should not and realistically could not be \nprescribed or directed through the legislative process in any way.\n  We in the Senate should never be criminalizing a specific medical \nprocedure. That is what the substitute states.\n  So here we are overstepping court cases. There is a strong absence of \nGovernment interest in this legislation. It is not here. It purports to \nprohibit abortions using a particular procedure, and then says \nabortions will be performed only in a particular manner. There is no \nreasonable Government interest served by forcing a patient to undergo \none type of abortion instead of another, especially if the prohibited \nprocedure is safer for the health of the woman.\n  We in this Congress should not be legislating in this area. This is \noverreaching in every sense. Under this bill, it would remain legal. \nGet this--somebody has to really explain this to me. It would remain \nlegal for a woman to obtain this procedure only if she did not cross \nState lines. This seems to me too clever by half. I thought this was \nthe most horrendous, searing, murderous, vicious procedure that we have \nseen in modern times, and yet you are going to be able to do it in your \nown backyard, in your own State. That is absurd.\n  Now we have a new Federal court case, the Lopez decision. That is how \nthey got clever by half on this one.\n  This bill also uses a term I have never before seen in the statute, \nand I have been doing this for 30 years. Anyone who knowingly performs \na partial-birth abortion ``and thereby kills a human fetus.'' That is \nwhat it says. ``Abortion is thereby killing.'' On line 15 of the bill, \nthe language reads, ``partially vaginally delivers a living fetus \nbefore killing the fetus.'' I have never seen that in my life in a \nstatute. Where did it come from? It is a manifestation of a \nmanipulative group trying to desperately knock off Roe v. Wade. That is \nwhat it is. It is exceptionally unclear about the precise nature of the \nprocedure. Six doctors testified they never heard of the procedure \nbefore.\n  I sat and listened to that. I have seen all of the pictures before. \nWe are going to have all of them--one-eyed children, brains on the \noutside, compressed skulls. I have seen it all. I have seen the whole \nworks, always with the eternal difficulty of imposing restrictions on a \ndecision which must be made from one's only very unique position, and \nprincipally by a woman, from one's own culture, one's own history, and \none's own deep personal and spiritual viewpoint.\n  All through the years I have had the accolades sometimes of being \ncalled a baby killer. I really do not appreciate that. I handle it very \nwell now. I just say, I do not have to take that guff from you. So I \nhave been there.\n  In my fine State of Wyoming--and I am going to conclude my remarks \nwithin my limit--listen to what we have to do in this. It should not be \npartisan. And in our State, the Wyoming Republican Party passed a \nplatform plank in 1994 at its State convention that said this: ``The \nWyoming Republican Party welcomes individuals on each side of the \nabortion issue, encourages their open discussion, solicits their active \nparticipation in the party, and respects their positions and beliefs.''\n  Then, do you know what we did? We did a resolution because we had a \nNovember resolution on the ballot which was soundly rejected. Here is \nwhat it said: ``The Republican Party believes that Republicans are \npeople of principle on each side of the abortion issue who firmly and \nintractably hold their beliefs; by establishing a party position, we \nrecognize that a resolution will never change these beliefs, but it \nwill serve to divide the party on other issues, and we urge all \nRepublicans to firmly debate these beliefs.''\n  That passed unanimously by voice vote. We ought to do more of that in \nAmerica. And men, in my mind, should never be in this intensely \nintimate personal struggle for a woman.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the substitute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the Congress should not \ncriminalize a specific medical procedure, and that the States should \nnot be prohibited from regulating or restricting postviability \nabortions to the extent that the Constitution permits them to do so. I \nalso want to state again my firm belief in the wisdom of the Supreme \nCourt decision Roe versus Wade, which held that under the \nconstitutional right to privacy, a woman has a right of self-\ndetermination with regard to her pregnancy and reproductive health.\n  In November I spoke in support of referring this bill to the \nJudiciary Committee for a hearing, and I'd like to thank my colleagues \nfor joining me to support the passage of that motion. I think we \nlearned a great deal from the hearing. One of the things that struck me \nwas that the term ``partial birth'' is not a term that is clearly \ndefined in the medical profession. This bill purports to be a very \nnarrow measure that outlaws only one alternative to a woman who learns \nlate in her pregnancy that it is not possible for her to carry her \nchild to term. But we've learned that there is not a medical procedure \nknown as a partial birth abortion. I suppose you can argue that those \nof us on this side of the issue shouldn't have a problem criminalizing \na procedure that doesn't really exist. My response to that argument is \npredictable: why bother to criminalize a procedure that doesn't really \nexist? \n\n[[Page S 18226]]\nMoreover, rules of statutory interpretation will demand that the courts \nfind some meaning in this law, because Congress is assumed to do \nnothing in vain. Somehow, the courts will have to put some definition \non the term ``partial birth abortion,'' even though a clear \nunderstanding of what we're outlawing has eluded many of us.\n  I'd like to quote briefly Dr. J. Courtland Robinson, who spoke at the \nhearing a couple of weeks ago and highlighted this point:\n\n       I have to wonder what you are really trying to ban with \n     this legislation. It sounds as if you are trying to leave any \n     later abortions open to question.\n\n  Dr. Robinson continues:\n\n       I know that a number of physicians who have performed \n     abortions for years, who are experts in the field, look at \n     this legislation and do not understand what you mean or what \n     you are trying to accomplish. It seems as if this vagueness \n     is intentional, and I, as a physician, cannot countenance a \n     vague law that may or may not cut off an appropriate surgical \n     option for my patients. Sometimes, as any doctor will tell \n     you, you begin a surgical procedure expecting it to go one \n     way, only to discover that the unique demands of the case \n     require that you do something different.\n\n  Dr. Robinson highlights a point I've made many times before. We can't \nadequately define the procedure we mean to outlaw because we're not \ndoctors. I share Dr. Robinson's fear that because this law is so vague \nand because we are denying doctors the ability to use their best \nmedical judgment, physicians will be deterred from performing any late \nterm abortion procedure. Late term abortions will be unavailable and \nwomen will die.\n  This is an unprecedented intrusion into the practice of medicine. In \nmy view decency and common sense would require us to recognize that it \nis not the job of the Congress to come between physicians and their \npatients.\n  I also want to speak briefly in support of section two of Senator \nFeinstein's amendment. I think her amendment is entirely consistent \nwith the thinking in much of the legislation we have debated recently. \nOn a number of matters we are choosing to leave regulation to the \nStates; indeed, we are deregulating at the Federal level so that we may \nleave the States the flexibility to enact their own laws on welfare, \nMedicaid, and so forth. I must admit that it seems strange to me that \nin this area alone we are undertaking Federal regulation where there \nhas been none. In doing so we are taking away from the States the right \nto legislate on this issue as they see necessary. In fact, we know that \n41 of the States already have laws regulating access to post-viability \nabortions.\n  I have expressed before my support for the enduring wisdom of Roe \nversus Wade decision. I think Senator Feinstein's amendment is \nconsistent with that decision. In Roe, the Court found that under the \nconstitutional right to privacy, a woman has the right to make her own \ndecisions where her pregnancy and reproductive health are concerned--\nespecially, the Court said, ``when her right to life is threatened.'' \nThe bill we are now considering is a direct challenge to that historic \ndecision's protection of a woman's life and health. Concern about a \nwoman's life has been abandoned in the partial birth abortion \nlegislation we've been discussing, but Roe versus Wade requires that \neven where a state chooses to outlaw post-viability abortions, it may \nnot under any circumstances outlaw abortions necessary to preserve the \nlife or health of the mother.\n  I will say again that I believe doctors must be able to put the \nwelfare of their patients first. Doctors should be able to use whatever \nprocedure will, in their professional judgment, be safest for the \nmothers, their patients. Toward this goal, I wholeheartedly support the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that Congress should not criminalize a \nspecific medical procedure, and the rule of Construction permitting the \nStates to regulate post-viability abortions to the extent permitted by \nthe Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes and thirty seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing be added as cosponsors: Senator Boxer, Senator Simon, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, and Senator Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the remainder of my time to the junior \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be brief.\n  I want to thank the Senator from California for the amendment, and I \nam delighted to be a cosponsor of it.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents the first time, to my knowledge, \nthat the Congress has attempted to tell a doctor that he or she cannot \nperform a specific medical procedure.\n  Let us be clear about what Congress is proposing to do with this \nlegislation. We are proposing to criminalize a medical procedure \nagainst the recommendation of this Nation's OB-GYN's and against the \nrecommendation of this Nation's 2.2 million registered nurses.\n  This bill arbitrarily prohibits one type of procedure even when the \nprocedure best protects the life and health and fertility of a woman, a \ncitizen of this country. If a woman has a late-term abortion, her \ndecision relies on the best medical advice of the doctor, advice based \non years of medical training and service.\n  None of us, or few of us in this body, have spent years studying and \npracticing medicine. How many of the Members of this body are \nphysicians? We have only one doctor serving in the Senate, and he is \nnot an OB-GYN. Are we qualified to make a medical judgment--a medical \nrecommendation--that could leave a woman sterile, or severely ill, or, \nworse yet, dead? I think not.\n  I know, frankly, that if I were ill, or the Presiding Officer were \nill, his family would take him to a doctor, not to another Senator, \nunless, of course, that Senator was a doctor, and there is only one of \nthose.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that this is a medical decision, and the \ndecision here that a woman makes regarding her pregnancy should be made \nwith her family in consultation with her doctor and, of course, her \nfaith.\n  Yesterday, I talked about this as an issue of fundamental liberty for \nfemale citizens. Let me submit to you that it is not only a matter of a \nwoman's liberty and right to control her own body that is at stake with \nthis legislation; it is also a doctor's right to treat--to treat his \npatient, and to treat his patient under very difficult circumstances \nindeed.\n  It seems to me that as we dabble around we are in the process of \nlimiting the liberties of the unborn that have been spoken of will be \nborn to. I think, Mr. President, that is a grievous error for which we \nwill all have great regret.\n  I thank the Senator from California. The good news about this \namendment is that it can improve what is a bad bill. The bad news about \nit, or maybe the good news about it, is hopefully medical science will \novercome this situation. But, quite frankly, for the present we should \nnot be dabbling where we have no knowledge, where we have no expertise, \nand in a way that will injure and jeopardize the health, safety, and \nindeed even the lives of millions of American women.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if this letter has been made a part of \nthe Record. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. \nIt is a letter dated November 6 from the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists in opposition to this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Dole: The American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization \n     representing more than 35,000 physicians dedicated to \n     improving women's health care, does not support H.R. 1833, \n     the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. The College finds \n     very disturbing that Congress would take any action that \n     would supersede the medical judgment of trained physicians \n     and criminalize medical procedures that may be necessary to \n     save the life of a woman. Moreover, in defining what medical \n     procedures doctors may or may not perform, H.R. 1833 employs \n     terminology that is not even recognized in the \n\n[[Page S 18227]]\n     medical community--demonstrating why Congressional opinion should never \n     be substituted for professional medical judgment.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, so we all understand, the Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment is the killer amendment. It simply guts the bill. \nThe earlier amendment was the Boxer amendment, which was defeated.\n  This amendment, no less than the Boxer amendment before it a short \nwhile ago, is the partial-birth abortion-on-demand amendment. And this \namendment would totally eliminate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  So if you support the bill, and you voted no on the Boxer amendment, \nyou should vote no on the Feinstein amendment because it would replace \nthe bill with current law. Current law is partial-birth abortion on \ndemand--I might add, through all 9 months of pregnancy for whatever \nreason.\n  In other words, Mr. President, if you want to go back on what you \nvoted for, what you support, the partial-birth abortion ban, then you \nwould have to vote for Feinstein.\n  In essence and in conclusion, this is a gutting amendment. It goes \nback to current law. It just eliminates the entire bill.\n  For that reason, obviously, we oppose it, and I encourage all of \nthose who voted no on Boxer who want the partial-birth abortion ban as \ndescribed in our legislation to vote no on the Feinstein amendment.\n  At this point, unless my colleagues would like some of my time--I \nwould be happy to yield it--I have no further desire for time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I yield the time.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would just ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Brown and I be allowed to do a brief colloquy on a matter that \nI neglected to mention and then we will vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this bill would expose physicians to \ncriminal and civil liability for performing a partial-birth abortion, \nand I believe it is critical that we be very clear as to what is \ncovered by the bill. The bill defines a ``partial-birth abortion'' as \n``an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially \nvaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and \ncompleting the delivery.''\n  It is my understanding that ``partially vaginally delivers'' means \nthe person performing the abortion actively removes a portion of the \nfetus from the uterus, through the cervyx and into the birth canal. And \nI would ask the manager if this is his understanding as well?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Colorado is correct. ``Partially \nvaginally delivers'' means the physician delivers part of the baby \nthrough the cervyx and into the birth canal.\n  Mr. BROWN. At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Dr. Robinson, of the \nJohns Hopkins University, mentioned that it is possible for a portion \nof the fetus, such as a hand or foot, to slip accidentally through the \ncervyx and into the birth canal without active removal by the \nphysician. I assume the manager does not intend to include those cases \nin the definition of partial-birth abortion. Am I correct?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Colorado is correct. This bill would only \ncover those circumstances where someone intentionally delivers part of \na living baby through the cervyx and into the birth canal.\n  Mr. BROWN. The definition also states that it only applies to \n``partial vaginal delivery of a living fetus.'' In other words, if the \nfetus had died before being partially removed from the uterus, this \nmeasure would not prohibit a physician from safely removing the dead \nfetus from the mother. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is correct. That is correct.\n  Mr. BROWN. Finally, Mr. President, it is my understanding this bill \napplies only to those who knowingly perform a partial-birth abortion. \nIn other words, a physician must intentionally partially deliver a \nliving fetus and then deliberately kill the fetus to be subject to \ncriminal or civil liability. For example, under this bill, if a doctor \nfully intends to deliver a living baby but due to an accident during \ndelivery the fetus dies, the doctor would not be subject to criminal or \ncivil liability. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for his time and particularly for what \nI think will be a helpful colloquy in being very specific as to what \nthe words and terms used in the bill mean.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3092 offered by the Senator from California. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We now have 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues if they could give \nme their attention for 2 minutes of what has been a very difficult \ndebate. Just for 2 minutes.\n  I ask you to vote ``no'' on the final passage of this radical bill. \nIt outlaws an emergency medical procedure which doctors have testified \nis used to save the life of a woman or to avert serious adverse health \nconsequences.\n  A woman like this, Coreen Costello, who asks us to put aside our \nparty affiliation and remember her. Despite \n\n[[Page S 18228]]\nthe other side saying she did not have the procedure outlawed in this \nbill, she did. She wrote us and told us that today and she testified \nthat she did.\n  My colleagues, I am down to the last 60 seconds. This is what Coreen \nCostello said. Please listen:\n\n       When families like ours are given this kind of tragic news \n     the last people we want to seek advice from are politicians. \n     We talk to our doctors, lots of doctors. We talk to our \n     families and other loved ones, and we ponder long and hard \n     into the night with our God.\n\n  Coreen asks us to vote against this bill.\n\n       It will deny women a life saving and health saving option \n     in a tragic emergency situation. You would not do it to your \n     own wife. You would not do it to your own daughter. I ask \n     you, please, do not do it to America's wives and to America's \n     daughters.\n\n  There is no true life exception. It was a partial exception. It was \ndifferent than the normal Hyde language. So this is indeed a radical \nproposal. Please vote ``no'' on final passage. President Clinton will \nveto this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, the House of Representatives recently \nvoted overwhelming by a two-thirds majority to ban partial-birth \nabortion. The vote on the ban was 288-139.\n  This is not a radical extreme bill. It was supported by liberal \nDemocrats such as Patrick Kennedy; liberal Republicans, moderate \nRepublicans, such as Susan Molinari; pro-choice, pro-life. It is not a \nradical bill. Rich Gephardt supported it and others.\n  We have added a life-of-the-mother exception which was requested by \nsome of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We did that. I hope \nwe can get a similar, bipartisan overwhelming majority here in the \nSenate like we had in the House to stop what I believe is a very cruel \npractice.\n  Let me conclude on this point, because Senator Boxer and I have been \ndebating this on and off for several days now. The photograph that is \nbeing displayed here is of a woman who went through a terrible ordeal. \nWe all know that. We have great sympathy for what she went through. But \nshe did not have the partial-birth abortion. She did not have a \npartial-birth abortion. This would not have stopped the procedure that \nCoreen Costello had.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Madam President, I wish to state a couple of questions \nand ask for the majority leader's response, if I could, at this time.\n  Madam President, I know that there has been an agreement worked out \nwith regard to the voting on the nominations and on the START II \nTreaty. I know that yesterday we had another discussion on the Senate \nfloor, and the majority leader referred to his intention to, also in \naddition to the nominations for ambassadors, clear the rest of the \nitems on the Executive Calendar before we left.\n  I just wanted to once again ask for his assurance that that is his \ndesire and his intention before we adjourn this fall.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I will just \nsay, as I did yesterday, that it is certainly my hope that we can clear \neverything on the Executive Calendar before we leave this year.\n  I cannot give a 100 percent guarantee. Somebody might have a hard \nhold on something. They may not be able to get it up, and we might not \nbe able to get cloture. But my view is we ought to accommodate where we \ncan the executive branch, and I have always tried to do that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate that very much. I certainly agree that \nthat is an important thing to do.\n  The other issue I wanted to clarify is that the agreement calls for \nus to proceed to consider START II before we go out of session this \nyear. Yesterday, again the majority leader said that it was his intent \nthat we complete action on START II. I think it is very important that \nwe do that.\n  Again, I would just ask if it is his view that we can go ahead and \nget that treaty voted on and sent on before we go off on the holidays.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, let me indicate that I hope to take it up before \nChristmas. I would like to complete action before Christmas. If not, we \nwill do it as quickly as we can when we are back here.\n  But I think we need to take a look at the calendar. A week from today \nwill be the 15th. One week later is the 22d. Next week we have this \nState Department reorganization, Bosnia, and rangeland reform. Again, \nit is a question of whether we can do it.\n  I am advised by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that he does not know of any amendments to the START II \nTreaty. There may be amendments. But it may not take more than a couple \nof hours.\n  So, certainly, I would like to dispose of it before we leave from \nhere this year. We will make every effort to do so.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me just say that I appreciate the \nfact that we do have an agreement in this unanimous-consent agreement \nto bring it up before we conclude the session and move to the \nconsideration of it.\n  I am encouraged by the statement and by the indication of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthat he thinks we can move to it very expeditiously.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's very good work on the issues. I \nappreciate the Senator from North Carolina, and I also, of course, \nappreciate the Senator from Massachusetts, who I know has worked very \nhard to get this agreement and, of course, the Democratic leader as \nwell.\n  So thank you all.\n  I no longer object to proceeding on the flag amendment. I know the \nmajority leader intends to do that tomorrow.\n  I have no objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18228-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18228-S18229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 31\n\n  Mr. DOLE. If there is not, I ask at this time then that the cloture \nvote scheduled for Friday be vitiated, and I \n\n[[Page S 18229]]\nnow ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Friday, December 8, the \nSenate turn to the consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 31, the \nconstitutional amendment concerning the flag desecration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further add that there will not be any votes tomorrow. \nThere will be debate tomorrow. Then tomorrow, if we can reach an \nagreement for Monday, there may be two or three amendments to Senate \nJoint Resolution 31.\n  If we can agree on the amendments and final passage, then we could do \nthat on Tuesday morning. There would be no votes on Monday. If we \ncannot agree, then there will be no votes before 6 o'clock on Monday. \nBut I think we can agree. We have had a discussion between the two \nleaders.\n  Finally, I would say there are a couple of colloquys that Senator \nDaschle and I were going to enter into, and I think I pretty much \nresponded to the one on START. The others I think can be printed in the \nRecord at the appropriate point if we initial each.\n  Is that satisfactory with the managers?\n  I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. We have reached the point now this evening that we could \nhave reached back in August, but better late than never.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18228-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that if \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention has not been reported by the close of \nbusiness on April 30, 1996, that convention be discharged from the \nForeign Relations Committee and placed on the Executive Calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I understand the majority leader's \ndifficulty in long-term planning of the Senate schedule, but I ask the \nmajority leader if it would be his intention to schedule consideration \nof the Chemical Weapons Convention in a reasonable time after it has \nbeen reported or discharged from the Committee?\n  Mr. DOLE. It would be my intention that the Senate would consider the \nConvention in a reasonable time period once the Convention is on the \nExecutive Calender.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, it will be my intention to review for the \nrecord briefly the summary as agreed upon of the amendment to H.R. \n1561. Before I do, however, I would like to inquire of the chairman the \nfollowing.\n  Madam President, a number of Members from the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle have been very concerned, and the ranking member shares this \nconcern, about the disposition of the Chemical Weapons Convention which \nwas submitted to the Congress many months ago, and since that time it \nhas been pending before the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I would like to ask the chairman concerning the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. I am aware that the committee's consideration of this \ntreaty is not as far along as the consideration of \n\n[[Page S 18230]]\nSTART II and that several members of the committee have a number of \nquestions about it and its implications that they believe must be \nexplored more fully before they are prepared to act on the treaty.\n  I ask the chairman if he would describe his commitment to the \ncommittee and the Senate on action on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I am happy to respond to the inquiry by \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  He has correctly stated that I and several other members of the \ncommittee have what we believe to be critical unanswered questions \nconcerning the implications of the Convention on Chemical Weapons \ncoming into force and whether the treaty is in the best interests of \nour Nation. So it is not possible for us to move as expeditiously \nconcerning it as we can move on the START II treaty.\n  However, I would say to the Senator that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee will immediately establish a hearing schedule on the \nconvention which will begin hearings in February 1996. The committee \nwill complete its hearings on the convention by April 30, 1996. By \nApril 30, the committee will meet in a business session to consider the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  Prior to the final committee vote on whether to report the treaty to \nthe Senate, the committee could adopt any or all of the following: \nrecommendations to amend the treaty; reservations and understandings; \nmodifications of the resolution of ratification; or direction for the \nrenegotiation of the treaty. The final committee vote could allow that \nthe treaty be reported favorably, unfavorably, or without \nrecommendation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would ask the distinguished chairman--I \nbelieve at this point are the colloquies of Senator Daschle and Senator \nDole now a part of the record?\n  Mr. HELMS. They are now a part of the Record. I will ask the Chair to \nconfirm that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is as to both the Chemical Weapons Convention as well \nas the nomination of Katie McGinty to be Chairman of the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding that there is a further unanimous-\nconsent request with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention if it \nis not reported by the close of business. Or is that accomplished?\n  Mr. HELMS. Already done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18229-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18230-S18231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. In that case, Madam President, if I may, I would like to \nreview with the Senator very briefly those items as we understand them \nthat are summarized within H.R. 1561.\n  On Monday when we take up this issue we have agreed, have we not, \nthat as to the issue of consolidation, that we have agreed on \ncompromise language with technical changes which will propound a $1.7 \nbillion savings over 5 years with a baseline of fiscal year 1995 at the \nappropriated level, that there would be no mandatory abolition of \nagencies, there would be not more than 30 percent of the savings \nrealized for programmatic reductions, and there would be not more than \n15 percent of the savings realized from State Department administrative \naccounts.\n  Does the chairman agree with my summary of the consolidation?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct. And it will be made a part of the Record.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to other bill issues, there is agreement on \nlanguage reflected in a summary of changes in Division A which will be \nmade a part of the Record.\n  There is a deletion of section 168 based on Senator Dodd's request in \nwriting to have this dealt with in conference on the Cuban Liberty and \nSolidarity Act. There is a deletion of section 603 relating to coercive \npopulation control policies. And there is an addition of $10 million in \nfiscal year 1996 for the East-West Center pursuant to an agreement \nbetween the chairman and ranking member and Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to Iraqi claims, there is a compromise which \ncontemplates satisfying licensing for those people with letters of \nadvice while simultaneously expanding--compromise language which we \narrived at this evening which basically splits the difference between \nthe parties with respect to the concerns that have been expressed.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct, Madam President.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to the authorization levels, there is an \nagreement that those authorization levels currently set out in the bill \nwill be addressed in conference with an understanding among the parties \nthat we will make a good-faith effort and seek to increase the levels \nof operating accounts for the agencies affected by the bill.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to conference issues as to consolidation, \nthere is an agreement that the Senate conferees will operate under \nconsensus with respect to the consolidation proposal regarding \nmandatory cost savings, the abolition of the agencies, and the \nlimitations as to where those cost savings may be achieved?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to the foreign aid provisions, the population \nprovisions will be a Member issue in the conference. And there is \nagreement that foreign aid provisions of the U.S. Senate will be \nneither added nor dropped in conference without a mutual discussion, \ninvolvement by Senate conferees?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is customary.\n  Mr. KERRY. Similarly, any discussion or consideration of the foreign \naid provisions of the House bill will be by similar participation?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is customary. The Senator will be a member of the \nconference committee.\n  Mr. KERRY. Procedural, as to procedural issues that have now been set \nforth within the context of the unanimous consent agreement--and there \nis no need to repeat those. And the chairman has agreed to schedule \nhearings for early next year, with committee action on the convention \nin the early spring for the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is also the \nunderstanding that the committee will resume normal activities with \nrespect to the scheduling of hearings and committee actions on all \ncurrently pending nominees and other committee business.\n  Mr. HELMS. That was my intent all along, Madam President.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, Madam President, let me say that I want to thank the \ndistinguished chairman and his staff. This has been a complicated and \nlong negotiating process. But I think it has been one where both \nparties fairly attempted to try to work the best compromise possible to \neffect some very complicated changes within the structure of our \nforeign policy establishment.\n  I am convinced that what we have achieved here is a strong beginning \nfor a reevaluation of how we are doing business, of the \nresponsibilities of these various agencies and departments. I am \nconvinced that as the parties proceed in good faith into the conference \nitself, that we have an opportunity to make our delivery of the foreign \npolicy product of this country far more effective, far more efficient, \nand the taxpayers of this country will benefit significantly from the \nchanges which are promoted here.\n  The chairman has stood his ground on many issues and fought hard, as \nhave we. And I think, as in all efforts to make the compromise, this \nrepresents exactly that, a sound meeting of the minds and a sound \neffort to try to bring the parties together. I am convinced that it is \na good product.\n  There are still some issues that we need to work on. The chairman \nunderstands that. I understand that. Members understand that. But I \nthink what we have done, by breaking through here in the last week, is \nto bring the committee back together in an important way and to \nindicate that we are all intending to do our utmost to try to see to it \nthat there is a strong bipartisan effort to present the strongest \npossible future work product from this important committee. And I thank \nthe chairman for his continued efforts even when the road was difficult \nto keep the lines of communication open and to help to make this \nhappen. \n\n[[Page S 18231]]\n\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I \nam grateful for the opportunity to work for him and with him in \nreaching this agreement. And I have only the observation that this \ncould have been achieved many, many weeks ago if there had not been \nsuch intransigence. But that is behind us.\n  I hope from this point on that we can work together in good faith, \nnot question each other's good faith, and work for the American people, \nsaving money and improve the foreign policy apparatus of this country, \nwhich badly needs improving. And I pledge that I shall work with the \nSenator as long as he is willing to work with me. And I thank the \nSenator. And I thank the Chair.\n  I want to send to the desk, Madam President, a printed review of the \nitems that Senator Kerry has just discussed for the benefit of the \nreporter. I know he tried to take it down, but it is easier to have it \nin writing.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the review be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Checklist--Helms-Kerry Meeting on S. 908\n\n\n                    a. summary of managers amendment\n\n                            1.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, I would just like to say how fortunate the \nUnited States is to have in its setting an individual with the manner, \nnegotiating skill and tact, as that of the Senator from Massachusetts. \nHe has carried the load in a wonderful way. I feel guilty not having \nshared it more. And his willingness to compromise is the essence of \npolitics and the essence of progress. He and the Senator from North \nCarolina have conducted themselves ably. I would like to put in a word \nfor the assistant of the Senator from Massachusetts, Nancy Stetson. By \ncoincidence, she is from the State of Rhode Island.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished former chairman and now ranking \nmember of the committee for his very generous comments.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, it goes without saying that I am \ngrateful, as I always am, for the remarkable staff of the majority on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. Beside me is Steve Berry, who has \nworked arduously and continuously, and he still has a little bit of his \nhair left. And then there is Randy Scheunemann, who once was on our \nstaff and is now associated with Senator Dole. He has been of \ninvaluable help. I cannot go down the long list, but I am obliged to \nmention my Monroe, North Carolina colleague, the chief of staff of the \nForeign Relations Committee, retired navy admiral Bud Nance. He calls \nhimself ``Bud,'' but his name is James Wilson Nance. I must insert the \npersonal note that Bud and I were born 2 months apart, two blocks apart \nin the little town of Monroe. He served 38 years in the Navy, and after \nthat, he served Ronald Reagan as his foreign affairs advisor.\n  Mr. KERRY. If my colleague will yield before he closes, I join with \nhim in thanking his staff, also--Steve Berry, particularly, and Randy \nScheunemann have been extraordinarily helpful in working through the \nissues. We are grateful for their help.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is very kind of the Senator. I know they appreciate \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18230-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today with the support of Senators \nReid, Craig, Thomas, Bryan, and Inhofe, to introduce a bill that is \nvitally important to the heritage of the Western United States, the \nsport of rodeo. The Rodeo Freedom Act of 1995 is a bill that will \nprotect the interests of the sport of rodeo and the many small and \nlarge communities that host rodeos throughout the year.\n  Rodeo is the one true American sport--a sporting event watched by \nmillions of people yearly. It's a unique sporting event that tests the \nskills of both man and beast. Rodeo is a sport that traces its \nbeginnings to contests held between ranches in the West during the \nlatter part of the last century. Cowboys tested their skills in \nbreaking wild horses and the everyday jobs of roping and doctoring the \nanimals of the ranch owner's herds. Rodeo is one of the few sports \nwhich early on allowed women to compete and to share in the prize money \nthat is offered. Today thousands of men, women, and children hold \ndreams of winning a world championship buckle awarded to the top \nperformer in each event.\n  In recent months the continued good fortune of the sport of rodeo has \nbeen threatened by the administration, through the transfer of \nauthority for the control of products that sponsor both professional \nand local rodeos. The President has taken steps to give control to the \nFood and Drug Administration of the products that sponsor rodeo events \nthroughout the Nation. This agency has already stated that many of the \nproducts that sponsor both professional and amateur sports will have to \ngive up their right to advertise and support these events. This move \ncould send many entertainment events, like rodeo, to an early grave. \nThe cost to many of the small communities that host the hundreds of \nrodeos around the country could be the end of their involvement.\n  This is just one of the latest moves that have been made to regulate \nthe manner in which sporting events earn the money necessary to provide \ntop entertainment. The restrictions the Government is seeking to impose \nwould limit, if not destroy, the long standing relationship between \nrodeo and its many sponsors. This would threaten the economic viability \nof an important recreational and economic activity in Montana and \nthroughout the Western United States.\n  I doubt the agencies involved took into account the economic impact \nthat their decisions would have on small rural communities. In many of \nthe smaller communities in Montana, and I am sure in many Western \nStates, the residents eagerly anticipate the one annual event of the \nyear, the rodeo. The contestants come in from around the country, and \nfor that matter the world, to compete. Tourists traveling through the \narea many times extend their stay to catch the uniquely American sport.\n  This event may bring thousands of dollars into an already suffering \neconomy. In one particular city in Montana, an annual rodeo will mean \nthe addition of over $2 million to the local economy.\n  The additional money that sponsors provide to local rodeos makes \nrodeo one of the best family entertainment bargains today. Without the \nassistance of these sponsors, rodeo, if it could even continue, would \nneed to bring the price of its tickets up to a level that would \npreclude many families from the one entertainment event they wait for \nannually.\n  This is another example of Big Government tossing its weight around. \nThe enforcement of the sponsorship should be controlled at the local \nlevel by the State governments, most of which already have laws \nlimiting the distribution of products. If we don't call the Federal \nGovernment on this one, What will be next?\n  This is not a product issue. It is an issue of personal freedom, and \nthe right of westerners to enjoy our recreational pursuits. This \nlegislation is for all competitors, whether they are weekend cowboys or \ntop rodeo stars. Their participation in the sport of rodeo helps to \nensure the traditions and heritage of the West. The popularity of \nwestern movies and rodeo demonstrates the fascination that people the \nworld over hold for the cowboy tradition.\n  In closing I would like to commend all the competitors that have \nstruggled so hard in rodeos this year. This week marks the culmination \nof all that effort, as 15 of the top cowboys and cowgirls meet in Las \nVegas, NV to compete in the National Finals Rodeo. By this Sunday night \nthe world champions will be determined in the following events: \nBareback and saddle bronc and bull riding, team roping, calf roping, \nsteer wrestling, and barrel racing. I tip my hat to all the competitors \nand wish them a safe and good ride. And using a term known among the \ncowboy circles I say ``Bare Down and Cowboy up.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in protecting the future of \nrodeo.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rodeo Freedom Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) professional rodeo is an important and popular \n     spectator sport that is attended by an estimated 18,000,000 \n     American adults annually across the United States and \n     particularly in the Western and Southwestern regions;\n       (2) in the Western and Southwestern regions, the sport of \n     rodeo has a long and interesting history and therefore, is of \n     great cultural and social significance to such States;\n       (3) the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association has 10,000 \n     members and sponsors approximately 800 rodeos in 46 States \n     every year;\n       (4) because of its cultural associations with the Western \n     and Southwestern regions of the United States, the rodeo is \n     an important attraction for domestic and foreign tourism to \n     those regions;\n       (5) the professional rodeo and the support industries \n     associated with professional rodeo generate substantial \n     economic activity in host communities and are significant \n     sources of income, economic security, employment, recreation, \n     and enjoyment for Americans;\n       (6) the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association enjoys the \n     freedom to choose the sponsors or sponsorship programs \n     associated with the rodeos of the association;\n       (7) the sponsors or sponsorship programs associated with \n     the rodeos of the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association \n     assist in sustaining the sport of rodeo and in making such \n     sport affordable and accessible to millions of adult rodeo \n     fans across America;\n       (8) despite the enjoyment that millions of Americans derive \n     from watching rodeo events, and the importance of such events \n     to the economies of the Western and Southwestern regions and \n     of the United States, Federal agencies other than the Federal \n     Trade Commission have proposed restrictions upon the \n     activities of sponsors, sponsorship programs, or advertising \n     connected with rodeo events; and\n       (9) such restrictions, if adopted will--\n       (A) jeopardize the continued financial viability of \n     professional rodeos;\n       (B) result in a considerable financial loss to tourism and \n     other related industries;\n       (C) interfere with the enjoyment of rodeo events by \n     millions of American adults who attend rodeos annually; and\n       (D) impose unconstitutional limitations on both commercial \n     speech and the freedom of association of the membership of \n     the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION.\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall have no authority under \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et \n     seq.) to regulate--\n       (1) activities of sponsors or sponsorship programs \n     connected with--\n       (A) the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association or its \n     activities or events; or\n       (B) any other professional rodeo association or the agents \n     or affiliates of such association or the activities or events \n     of such association, agents, or affiliates; or\n       (2) advertising that is used or purchased by, or that is in \n     connection with--\n     \n[[Page S 18234]]\n\n       (A) the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association or its \n     activities or events; or\n       (B) any other professional rodeo association or the agents \n     or affiliates of such association or the activities or events \n     of such association, agents, or affiliates.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect as if enacted on August 10, \n     1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1458. A bill to amend the provisions of title 35, United States \nCode, to establish the Patent and Trademark Corporation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation, the Patent and Trademark Office Reform Act of 1995, that \nwould establish the Patent and Trademark Office as a Government \ncorporation and make significant improvements in its management.\n  These changes will free the Office from restrictive laws that have \nprevented it from becoming as efficient as its users and our economy \ndemand. Applications will be processed faster, top talent will be hired \nand retained, necessary state-of-the-art equipment will be purchased, \nand office space will be acquired or leased at more favorable terms.\n  Mr. President, the Patent and Trademark Office is in the business of \nexamining and granting patents and registering trademarks, a function \nimportant enough to warrant mention in Article 1 of our Constitution. \nThe protection of innovation provided by the PTO has helped create \nmillions of jobs and is one of the reasons our country is so \ncompetitive and the most productive in the world.\n  The services and products provided by the PTO are paid for entirely \nby user fees. Last year, the PTO received more than 185,000 patent \napplications and 155,000 trademark applications. PTO projects steady \nincreases in both types of applications into the next century.\n  Unfortunately, the processing and approval of applications has often \nbeen delayed. These delays are due in part to a shortage of examiners \nand out-of-date equipment. As a result of these delays, inventors are \nbeing denied protection of the fruits of their labor, and further \ninnovation is thus postponed.\n  My intent in offering this legislation is to enhance the PTO's \nability to process and grant patents and register trademarks in a \ntimely fashion. The legislation responds to various management problems \nnow facing the Office.\n  First, the Office is now burdened with unnecessary personnel \nregulations. As a component of the Department of Commerce, the PTO is \nsubject to the same personnel ceilings as other Commerce programs. \nWhile such ceilings may make sense for other agencies or departments, \nthey do not for the PTO. If the PTO is prevented from making necessary \nhires to keep up with the increase in applications, productivity will \ndecline and potential revenues will be lost.\n  A large amount of the work performed by the PTO requires specialized \nskills. The application of the Government-wide compensation and \nclassification systems has constrained PTO's ability to hire and \nmaintain the best talent. For example, the classification system is too \nrigid to adequately accommodate many of the PTO's unique positions. The \nresulting misclassifications can mean lower positions, making it more \ndifficult to attract experts from the private sector. Compounding this \nproblem is the General Schedule, restrictions on promotions, and the \ninability of the PTO to conduct its own personnel examinations.\n  The PTO also has had serious procurement problems. The Office is \nsubject to various restrictions on its procurement activities, as \nprovided in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, the \nBrooks Act, and the Public Buildings Act. These laws have forced the \nPTO to endure lengthy and expensive procurement delays. For example, a \nrecent computer procurement took 2 years to complete. When the PTO made \nthe request, the technology contained in this procurement was state of \nthe art. However, by the time the PTO finally received the equipment, \ntechnology in this area had advanced significantly.\n  It has been PTO's experience that the process of procuring items in \nthe $1 million range averages 12 to 18 months at a cost of $100,000 to \n$200,000. The private sector accomplishes such procurements in a few \nmonths at a fraction of the cost.\n  Another problem is that the PTO is spread throughout 15 office \nbuildings in Crystal City, VA, which are leased through the General \nServices Administration. This scattering of personnel and operations is \nnot only inconvenient, it is inefficient. Moreover, three times in as \nmany years, GSA appraised this space at amounts not supported by the \nmarket, and charged the PTO too much. Congressional action was \nnecessary in all instances, resulting in a savings of $22.3 million. \nWhen the PTO's lease expires in 1996, it will require about one-half \nmillion square feet more than it currently has. PTO has been \nnegotiating with GSA and OMB for almost 6 years trying to reach a \nresolution to this situation, but to no avail.\n  Mr. President, this bill is one more step to reinvent our Government, \nan important effort championed by the Clinton administration. My \nlegislation would enable the PTO to be run more like a business. \nHowever, unlike a private-sector enterprise, PTO's employees would \nremain Federal employees and the Office would remain in the Department \nof Commerce. This is an important distinction because the granting of \npatents and registering of trademarks is a necessary Government \nfunction and it would be imprudent to insulate this responsibility in \nan unaccountable autonomous body.\n  Under the bill, the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark \nCorporation, or the PTC, will report to the Secretary of Commerce for \ntrademark and patent policy matters only. The PTC will be free from \ndepartmental meddling in the management of its day-to-day activities, \nsuch as how many patent examiners need to be hired, which computer \nsystem the PTC should buy, and how many buildings the PTC should \noccupy. This firewall addresses many of the criticisms leveled at the \nPTO over the years, but ensures that attention to intellectual property \npolicy matters remains at the Cabinet level.\n  Mr. President, let me describe briefly what my bill will do. The \nCommissioner of the Patent and Trademark Corporation shall, with the \nassistance of two deputies, manage the 5,000-plus employees and run \nthis $600-plus million entity. They will be able to do this without the \nconstraints of the Brooks Act, the Public Buildings Act, and the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act. Like the private \nsector, the new corporation will be able to acquire computers, office \nspace, and furniture in a timely manner. All assets, liabilities, \ncontracts, property, unexpended and unobligated balances of \nappropriations, and other funds made available to the PTO will be \ntransferred to the PTC. This includes those unappropriated funds \ncontained in the Treasury Department's surcharge fee account.\n  The new PTC will be able to provide its employees competitive wages \nand benefits. It will not be subject to personnel ceilings, including \nthose established in the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. \nDuring the transition from the Patent and Trademark Office to the \nPatent and Trademark Corporation, all employees will be assured of work \nfor 1 year. I understand the concerns of PTO's employees who might view \nthis bill as an effort to downsize the Office, and want to assure them \nthat this is not my intent nor the intent of the administration. Our \nobjective is to give the Commissioner discretion over the \nclassification and compensation systems so the PTC can hire and keep \ntop talent, not slash the compensation of PTO's employees. To assuage \nthe concerns of the employees, and those who might object to the 1-year \ncarryover provision, I would again emphasize that PTO projects a steady \nincrease in both trademark and patent applications into the next \ncentury. Not only is this a healthy sign for our economy, it is a good \nsign that PTO's workers are still very much needed.\n  Mr. President, although the PTC needs freedom from unreasonable \nbureaucratic redtape and regulations, we also must be careful to ensure \nthat it remains accountable, and is not subject to abuse. My bill \ncontains sufficient safeguards to ensure the PTC will not \n\n[[Page S 18235]]\nbe moving into luxurious offices, paying outrageous sums to its \nemployees, or entering into sweetheart deals. These safeguards include \noversight by the Congress, an Inspector General, the General Accounting \nOffice, an advisory board, and users of the PTC's services.\n  Under the legislation, Congress will continue to set the user fees \nfor the PTC. I know some would have preferred to place this \nresponsibility with the Commissioner, and perhaps we can revisit this \nissue in several years after we see how well the PTC is operating. For \nnow, however, I thought it best to keep the fee-setting authority with \nCongress to ensure adequate oversight and accountability.\n  The PTC also will have its own Inspector General to investigate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. This person will be appointed by the Secretary \nto ensure a greater degree of independence. Additionally, audits will \nbe performed annually by either an independent CPA or the GAO. The \nresults of these audits shall be made public and will be sent to \nCongress. Finally, the PTC is required, by the Government Control \nCorporation Act, to submit annual management reports to Congress and \nbusiness-like budgets to the President. These reports and budgets must \ninclude statements on cash flows, operations, financial position, and \ninternal accounting and administrative control systems.\n  The Patent and Trademark Corporation Act would also have an advisory \nboard to represent the views of users and other interested persons. The \nSecretary would appoint members to the board for terms of 3 years as \nwell as select the Chair. The board would review and advise the \nCommissioner on the PTC's performance, budget, and user fees. \nFurthermore, the Commissioner is required to consult with the board \nprior to changing or proposing to change fees or regulations. The board \nwill submit an annual report containing its review of the PTC to the \nPresident, Congress, and the Commissioner.\n  Mr. President, I have drafted this bill in consultation with the \nPatent and Trademark Office, the administration, the National Academy \nof Public Administration, the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation, the International Trademark Association, the Intellectual \nProperty Owners, Inc., the intellectual property section of the \nAmerican Bar Association, and the National Treasury Employees Union. \nThe benefits resulting from this legislation should be immediately \napparent to the PTC's users. Not only will their applications be \nprocessed and awarded at a quicker rate, they will have input into how \nthe corporation should be run. Furthermore, I believe that the PTC's \nincreased productivity will have a direct beneficial effect on our \neconomy.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I look forward \nto working with Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nand others as the process of reforming the Patent and Trademark Office \nmoves forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1458\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to \nsupport the International Dolphin Conservative Program in the eastern \ntropical Pacific Ocean, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n   the international dolphin protection and consumer information act\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, nearly 6 years ago, as a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, I introduced legislation to establish a \ndolphin safe label for tuna sold in the United States. The companion \nSenate bill was introduced by my colleague the distinguished junior \nSenator from Delaware, Joe Biden. In 1990, our bill--the Dolphin \nProtection Consumer Information Act--became law.\n  This year, on October 4, the United States and 11 other nations--\nBelize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Panama, Spain, \nMexico, Vanuatu, and Venezuela--signed the Declaration of Panama, an \ninternational agreement to manage tuna fishing in the Eastern Tropical \nPacific. That agreement calls for changes in U.S. dolphin protection \nlaws--including in our 1990 Dolphin Protection Act.\n  Today, Senator Biden and I are introducing legislation--the Dolphin \nProtection and Consumer Information Act of 1995--that will implement \nall of the positive aspects of the Panama Declaration, while \nmaintaining the current labelling requirements that allow only truly \ndolphin safe tuna to be sold in the United States.\n  The signers and supporters of the Panama Declaration want other \ncountries to be able to sell tuna in the United States market. We \nagree--as long as they catch that tuna by dolphin safe methods as \nprescribed by the 1990 Act. Our bill will lift the U.S. country-by-\ncountry tuna embargo to give all tuna fishermen the opportunity to \nexport to the United States market as long as they use dolphin safe \npractices. We believe this will open United States markets and comply \nwith international trade agreements without gutting U.S. dolphin \nprotection laws.\n  As defined in the 1990 Act, dolphin safe tuna fishing means that \ndolphins were not chased or encircled with nets during a tuna fishing \ntrip. The $1 billion U.S. canned tuna market is a dolphin safe market \nand consumers know that the dolphin safe label means that dolphins were \nnot harassed or killed.\n  We believe that the definition of dolphin safe should not be changed \nuntil we know for sure that setting purse seine nets on dolphins and \nthen freezing them is dolphin safe. It would be consumer fraud to \nchange the label. Let us continue to encourage those who fish tuna \nusing the best dolphin safe methods to get the label.\n  Let me briefly explain other major provisions and outcomes of our \nbill:\n  First, it requires that the Panama Declaration and its 5,000 cap on \ndolphin mortality be enforceable and binding. Our bill makes it clear \nthat if the limit is exceeded, all sets on dolphins allowed by the \nPanama Declaration would stop for the rest of the fishing year.\n  Second, it requires that the Panama Declaration establish an \nenforceable timeframe for the reduction of dolphin mortality from the \ncap of 5,000 to zero. Our bill requires that dolphin mortality be \nreduced by a statistically significant amount each year.\n\n[[Page S 18241]]\n\n  Third, it will result in the protection of U.S. canners--who 5 years \nago made a commitment to the American public to process and sell only \ndolphin safe tuna--from unfair foreign competition and from the dumping \nof stockpiled dolphin unsafe tuna in the U.S. market.\n  Fourth, it ensures that countries will enforce their obligations \nunder the International Dolphin Conservation Program--established in \nthe Panama Declaration and fully reflected in our bill--to protect \ndolphins and the Eastern Tropical Pacific ecosystem by requiring that \nan embargo be reestablished for any country which consistently fails to \ntake enforcement actions. Countries must show that they are acting to \npunish fishermen who do not comply with the requirements of the Panama \nDeclaration--the embargoes could be reestablished.\n  Fifth, it requires the establishment of a research program to \ndetermine (1) the effect of harassment by chase and encirclement on the \nhealth and biology of dolphins and its impact on dolphin populations \nencircled by purse seine nets in the ETP and (2) the extent to which \nthe incidental take of non-target species, including juvenile tuna, \noccurs when fishing for yellowfin tuna using dolphin-safe methods and \nthe impact of that incidental take on tuna stocks.\n  Sixth, it ensures that Congress is informed of progress in the \nfishery by requiring that the Secretary of Commerce report to Congress \nwithin 3 years on the results of the dolphin stress and bycatch \nresearch.\n  Seventh, it directs the Secretary of Commerce to make recommendations \non how U.S. law should be modified according to what the research \nresults show.\n  Our bill is supported by 70 organizations, including the Sierra Club, \nthe Humane Society of the United States, Earth Island Institute, Public \nCitizen's Global Trade Watch, American Society for the Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals, Friends of the Earth, International Dolphin \nProject, and Defenders of Wildlife.\n  While U.S. canners have not taken a formal position on this \nlegislation, they have stated their firm support for the current \ndolphin safe label. Bumble Bee Seafoods for example stated that it is \n``firmly committed'' to it's policy of ``marketing only dolphin safe \ntuna''. In a statement Bumble Bee Seafoods said ``We share our \ncustomers concern about this issue and are proud of the fact that all \nBumblebee tuna is verifiably 100 percent dolphin safe. . .  We believe \nthat Bumblebee's dolphin safe policy is right and we will not \ncompromise it''.\n  I firmly believe that our bill is a responsible alternative to the \nbill recently introduced by our colleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator \nBreaux, which redefines ``dolphin safe'' to allow dolphins to be chased \nand encircled with purse seine nets as long as there is no observed \nmortality. Observed mortality is a tricky issue that leaves room for \nerrors and a lot of judgement calls. What if the dolphin isn't quite \ndead yet? Injury to dolphins often occurs and can lead to eventual \ndeath. We don't know for sure that dolphins don't suffer from the \nconstant chasing and encircling that they are subjected to.\n  What Senator Biden and I, and the 70 environmental and other \norganizations who support us, are saying is: Look at the science \nfirst--then make changes to U.S. law. We say: Let's encourage and help \nthose who are fishing dolphin safe and canning dolphin safe by opening \nthe U.S. market to them. We say: Let's not weaken our commitment to \nsave the dolphins for the sake of a little more foreign trade.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``International Dolphin Protection and Consumer Information \n     Act of 1995''.\n       (b) References to Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.--\n     Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act \n     an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment \n     to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \n     shall be considered to be made to a section or other \n     provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The nations that fish for tuna in the eastern tropical \n     Pacific Ocean have reduced dolphin mortalities associated \n     with that fishery from hundreds of thousands annually to \n     fewer than 5,000 annually.\n       (2) The provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of \n     1972 that impose a ban on imports from nations that fish for \n     tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have served as an \n     incentive to reduce dolphin mortalities.\n       (3) Consumers of the United States and Europe have made \n     clear their preference for tuna that has not been caught \n     through the killing, chasing, or harming of dolphins.\n       (4) Tuna canners and processors of the United States have \n     led the canning and processing industry in promoting a \n     dolphin-safe tuna market.\n       (5) The 12 signatory nations to the Declaration of Panama, \n     including the United States, agreed under that Declaration to \n     require that the total annual dolphin mortality in the purse \n     seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical \n     Pacific Ocean not exceed 5,000, with a commitment and \n     objective to progressively reduce dolphin mortality to a \n     level approaching zero through the setting of annual limits.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize that nations fishing for tuna in the \n     eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have achieved significant \n     reductions in dolphin mortality associated with that fishery; \n     and\n       (2) to eliminate the ban on imports of dolphin-safe tuna \n     from those nations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Republican plan would have resulted in \na balanced Federal budget in 2002, a plan that would have finally \nrestrained the growth of Federal spending to a manageable level. And \nyet, President Clinton felt compelled to veto our plan. He felt \ncompelled to protect his priorities.\n  President Clinton's statements regarding protecting his priorities \nbelie one sad truth buried in his rhetoric: The only thing that is not \na priority to this President is balancing the budget. There is only lip \nservice one day, a speech another, a third budget plan this week. If we \nare to believe that President Clinton is serious about his commitment \nto balancing the budget, why is he now submitting a third budget? Why \ndid he first submit two budgets that resulted in deficits of over $200 \nbillion in the year 2000 and beyond?\n  The only logical conclusion to be drawn from the President's actions \nis that he is trying to deal in the most politically popular way he can \nwith a Congress that is unwavering in one commitment, a commitment to \nthe American people to, once and for all, put the U.S. Government on \nthe road to fiscal health.\n  The future could be so bright if the President would only join us in \nagreeing to a balanced budget. We will compromise, but not on the \nprinciple that the budget must be balanced using credible, honest \nprojections. There is a growing consensus among respected economists \nthat interest rates will drop significantly, 1, maybe 2 percent, if a \nbalanced budget is reached. This would mean cheaper home mortgages, \nless to pay for student loans, lower credit card payments. American \nfamilies will save again. Without a balanced budget agreement, though, \nthere will be profoundly negative consequences. Chairman Greenspan of \nthe Federal Reserve predicts a ``quite negative'' reaction in the \nfinancial markets if no deal is reached, and a sharp increase in long-\nterm interest rates.\n  And yet we are mired here in a disagreement that is disheartening to \nall of us, especially those of us who were elected just last year, \nthose of us who heard from thousands of citizens across our respective \nStates, those of us who heard, ``balanced the budget'' above all else.\n  The disagreement between Congress and the President comes down to one \nissue: the difference between credibility and something for nothing. \nSyndicated columnist Ben Wattenberg makes a compelling case in \nyesterday's edition of USA Today that the country's social ills boil \ndown to one fundamental shift in the Nation's attitude: The attitude \nthat it is possible to gain something for nothing. Whether it is crime, \npoor education, or even the epidemic problem of illegitimacy, Mr. \nWattenberg traces the cause of these ills to the lack of personal \nresponsibility and the lack of effort, hard work, and even sacrifice \nthat is necessary to gain anything worth having. Unfortunately, the \nWhite House's phony numbers are the means to appear to balance the \nbudget, without making any adjustments or imposing any discipline on \nGovernment spending.\n  The Republican plan, on the other hand, recognizes the need for \nadjustment, reform, and downsizing of the Federal Government. It \nreforms Government programs in a sensible way and provides tax relief \nfor hardworking American families and to spur investment. It will \nresult in long-term benefits--a stable and growing economy, lower \ninterest rates, greater investment, higher incomes, millions of new \njobs. The benefits of the Republican plan are not unlike the \ngratification of earning one's own way in the world, completing an \neducation, or staying married for 40 years. Hard work, but definitely \nworth it.\n  So, I close with these thoughts, Mr. President. The American people \nwill rise to any occasion, and if we ask them to help us address this \nfiscal crisis, they will. What they won't do is allow this generation \nto burden the next with an impossible debt. I am disappointed that the \nPresident chose not to sign the historic Balanced Budget Act of 1995, \nbut I remain hopeful that the administration will trust the American \npeople and agree to a balanced budget. We must.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18246-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18246-S18247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR. THOMAS E. BELLAVANCE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDr. Thomas E. Bellavance as he retires as the president of Salisbury \nState University.\n  In 1980, when the Board of Trustees of State Universities and \nColleges unanimously selected Dr. Bellavance to be the new president of \nSalisbury State College, Thom arrived on campus with \n\n[[Page S 18247]]\na specific mission: to provide, as he expressed it, ``an education of \nthe whole person within the context of a value-oriented curriculum--an \neducation that is not merely training in a specialty, but a matter of \nnurturing individuals to be civil, articulate, and productive members \nof society.''\n  For the past 15 years, Dr. Bellavance has focused on his vision, \ntransforming the institution from a small State college, primarily \nattended by students from Maryland's Eastern Shore, to a highly-\nrespected regional university that is nationally recognized as one of \nthe best among American colleges and universities.\n  During Dr. Bellavance's tenure, applications for admission have more \nthan doubled and average SAT scores have increased from 848 to 1085. \nWhen faced with the reality of difficult economic times, Dr. Bellavance \nsought private funding, establishing three endowed schools, the \nFranklin P. Perdue School of Business, the Richard A. Henson School of \nScience and Technology, and the Charles R. and Martha N. Fulton School \nof Liberal Arts. Also established were scholarships for deserving \nstudents, and a foundation strongly supported by the community. \nUniversity assets have dramatically increased from $32,261 in 1980 to \nover $16 million. Today over $800,000 is available to assist students \nwith financing their education.\n  In his pursuit of academic excellence, Thom Bellavance has helped \ncreate a true academic community--a community of scholars with an \nabundance of opportunities to learn and grow and a strong sense of \nfamily among the students, faculty, and administrators. In the process, \nhe has earned the love and respect of the entire university community.\n  In a nation which believes that a person's merit and talent should \ntake them as far as they can go, we are indeed fortunate to have \neducators like my friend, Thom Bellavance, who have fostered a path \nwhich allows our young people to maximize their potential. When this \nhappens, we gain a person who contributes to society at a higher level. \nThis is best exemplified by the fact that Salisbury State students \ncontributed over 300,000 hours of community service in the 1993-94 \ncalendar year.\n  On the occasion of his retirement, I join with the Salisbury State \nUniversity community in saluting Dr. Bellavance and expressing deep \nappreciation for his exceptional leadership. As stated in a \nproclamation recently presented to Dr. Bellavance by the University \nForum, ``He leaves Salisbury State University immeasurably better than \nhe found it.''\n   Mr. President, I know that you and all of our colleagues will join \nme in wishing Dr. Thomas Bellavance the very best in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18246-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROMANIA'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, on December 1, Romania celebrated \nthe 75th anniversary of its founding as a modern country. While its \nroots as a nation actually go back as far as the Roman Empire, its \nmodern history began on December 1, 1918, when Romania, as we know it \ntoday, was created.\n  Seventy-seven years ago, there were roughly 50 nation states in the \nworld. Half of these were considered democracies. Today more than 180 \nnations in the world are democracies, with this number on the rise. \nRomania, I am pleased to note, is not only a member of the \ninternational community but of the community of democracies.\n  Since its revolution in 1989, Romania has made strides in democratic \nreform and the development of a free-market economy. Difficult \ndecisions have been to bring down inflation, bring in foreign \ninvestment, and privatize government. GDP which had dropped initially \nhas been growing over the last 3 years. Inflation has been reduced from \n300 to 60 percent in 1994 and is expected to be less than 30 percent \nthis year. Unemployment is down to 10 percent. Foreign investment has \nbeen greater in the last 6 months than in the previous 4 years. There \nare more steps which must be taken to strengthen democratic \ninstitutions, further economic growth, and develop rule of law. I \nencourage Romania to keep its commitment to these goals.\n  Romania has actively pursued improving relations with the West. It \nwas the first of the former Eastern bloc countries to sign the \nPartnership for Peace Program. In 1994 it became a member of the \nCouncil of Europe. Romania has even sent troops and medical staff to \nparticipate in peacekeeping efforts in Angola. On September 26 \nPresident Iliescu made his first official visit to Washington, DC, \nmeeting with the President, Cabinet members, and Congressmen.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in congratulating Romania on \nits national day and extending to the people of Romania best wishes as \nthey celebrate the founding of their nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18247-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSA PARKS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 40 years ago this month--December \n1955--in Montgomery, AL, the modern civil rights movement began when \nRosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. \nThe strength and spirit of this courageous woman captured the \nconsciousness of not only the American people but the entire world.\n  Rosa Parks' arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the \ncatalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day \nin 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle \nfor equality and justice. Twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa Parks had \nbeen arrested for violating another one of the city's bus-related \nsegregation laws requiring blacks to pay their fares at the front of \nthe bus then get off of the bus and reboard from the rear of the bus. \nThe driver of that bus was the same driver with whom she would have her \nconfrontation years later.\n  The rest is history, the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the \nbeginning of an American revolution that elevated that status of \nAfrican-Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader \nwho would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  Mr. President, on the occasion of this important 40th anniversary, I \nwant to pay tribute to Rosa Parks, the gentle warrior who decided that \nshe would no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of \nracial segregation on a bus.\n  We have come a long way toward achieving Dr. King's dream of justice \nand equality for all. But we still have work to be done. Let us \nrededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18247-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18247-S18248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nsection 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough December 6, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $13.5 billion in budget authority and above the budget \nresolution by $17.3 billion in outlays. Current level is $43 million \nbelow the revenue floor in 1996 and $0.7 billion below the revenue \nfloor over the 5 years 1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit \nfor purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $262.9 \nbillion, $17.3 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of \n$245.6 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated November 17, 1995, the President signed \nthe Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act \n(P.L. 104-52), the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-53), \nand the Alaska Power Administration Sale Act (P.L. 104-58). Congress \nalso cleared, and the President signed, the second (P.L. 104-54) and \nthird (P.L. 104-56) continuing resolutions. Congress also cleared the \nDefense Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-61); pursuant to article 1, \nsection 7 of the Constitution, this act became \n\n[[Page S 18248]]\nlaw without the President's signature. These actions changed the \ncurrent level of budget authority and outlays. In addition, the revenue \naggregates have been revised to reflect the recommended level in House \nConcurrent Resolution 67. My last report had revised the revenue \naggregates pursuant to section 205(b)(2) of House Concurrent Resolution \n67 for purposes of consideration of H.R. 2491.\n  The report follows:\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 1995.\n     Hon.

Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The attached report for fiscal year 1996 \n     shows the effects of Congressional action on the 1996 budget \n     and is current through December 6, 1995. The estimates of \n     budget authority, outlays and revenues are consistent with \n     the technical and economic assumptions of the 1996 Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 67). This report is \n     submitted under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act, as amended.\n       Since my last report, dated November 16, 1995, the \n     President signed the Treasury, Postal Service and General \n     Government Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-52), the Legislative \n     Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-53), and the Alaska Power \n     Administration Sale Act (P.L. 104-58). Congress also cleared, \n     and the President signed, the second (P.L. 104-54) and third \n     (P.L. 104-56) continuing resolutions. Congress also cleared \n     the Defense Appropriation Act (P.L. 104-61); pursuant to \n     Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution, this act became law \n     without the President's signature. These actions changed the \n     current level of budget authority and outlays. In addition, \n     at the request of the Senate Committee on the Budget, the \n     revenue estimates shown for the concurrent resolution have \n     been changed pursuant to Section 205(b)(2) of H.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my \ncolleagues my great concern about the actions of the House \ntelecommunications conferees.\n  Despite what appeared to be some movement away from the regulation of \nconstitutionally protected speech, I understand that the conferees \nadopted an amendment yesterday which would subject adult Internet users \nto criminal penalties for so-called indecent speech. Rather than \nfocusing on materials that are truly harmful to minors, the language \nagreed to yesterday would prohibit great works of literature from being \nmade available on line. It would make subject to criminal penalties \nfrank discussions between adults about the prevention of AIDS. This \namendment will extinguish many on-line support groups dealing with \nissues such as child abuse and sexual assault. It will likely place \nsevere limitations on the materials discussed on many online scientific \nforums. In the ultimate irony, the amendment does virtually nothing to \naddress the problem of the already illegal victimization of children \nover computer networks. Rather than focus on real issues and real \nconcerns, this amendment focuses on indecency. It places blame on a \ntechnology rather than on the perpetrators of crimes against children.\n  Mr. President, despite the fact that the materials and communications \non the Internet that are of the greatest concern to many parents, such \nas obscenity, child solicitation, and child pornography, are already \nsubject to criminal penalties, and despite the fact that technologies \nalready exist to allow parents to control what their children have \naccess to on the Internet including indecent materials, the House \nconferees chose to take this unwise step towards censorship.\n  Mr. President, there is still time to reverse this action and for the \nconferees to direct their efforts towards providing parents with even \ngreater ability to protect their children using tools offered in the \nmarket place. I urge my colleagues to recognize just what this \namendment will mean if it remains in the telecommunications bill. I \nurge them to recognize that indecency is not the same as obscenity or \npornography. The distribution of obscene materials on the Internet is \nalready illegal and those crimes are already being aggressively \nprosecuted.\n  Indecent speech, on the other hand, is far different than obscenity \nand is protected by the constitution. Indecency includes four letter \nwords that many adults use routinely in their everyday speech. Indecent \nwords include those that are among the first words many children speak, \nnot because they learned them from the Internet, but because they heard \nthem in the school yard, in child care settings, and in some cases, in \ntheir own homes. While it is unfortunate that children are exposed to \nsuch speech at young ages, it is not a reason to censor \nconstitutionally protected speech between adults on the Internet. \nCreating criminal penalties for indecency as stringent as those imposed \non traffickers of obscenity is extreme, unwarranted, and unnecessary.\n  As I said earlier this week in this Chamber, this type of law will \nhave a tremendous chilling effect on speech over the Internet. What two \nadults can say over the phone to one another, they will not be able to \nsay over the Internet for fear a minor might read their words. The fact \nthat America Online censored the word ``breast'' on their service, \nalbeit temporarily, should forewarn members of things to come. \nScreening by online service providers will be necessary if they wish to \n\n\n[[Page S 18249]]\nprotect themselves from criminal liability. It is quite conceivable \nthat discussions involving scientific terms for other bodily parts will \nno longer be allowed for fear they might offend a user and land the \nservice in court.\n  Guaranteeing the Internet is free of speech restrictions, other than \nthe statutory restrictions on obscenity and pornography which already \nexist, should be of concern to all Americans who want to be able to \nfreely discuss issues of importance to them regardless of whether \nothers might view those statements as offensive or distasteful.\n  Shifting political views about what types of speech are unsuitable \nshould not be allowed to determine what is or is not an appropriate use \nof electronic communications. While the current target of our political \nclimate is indecent speech--the so-called seven dirty words--a \nweakening of First Amendment protections could lead to the censorship \nof other crucial types of speech, including religious expression and \npolitical dissent.\n  I believe the censorship of the Internet is a perilous road for the \nCongress to walk down. It sets a dangerous precedent for First \nAmendment protections and it is unclear where that road will end.\n  I urge the conferees to reject restrictions on constitutionally \nprotected speech when the full conference committee votes on this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/07/senate-section/article/S18248-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATIONS RE-REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 198 \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Lott and McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 198) to make certain technical \n     changes to S. Res. 158.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Under current Senate rules, a Member, officer, or \nemployee may accept travel reimbursement from a foreign government or \nforeign educational or charitable organization. Will a Member, officer, \nor employee be permitted to continue participating in such programs \nunder the new gift rule?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes. The new gift rule, effective January 1, 1996, will, \nhowever, change the current approval process. Now, a Member, officer, \nor employee must receive prior approval of the Ethics Committee in \norder to participate in such travel. After January 1, the Member, \nofficer, or employee will no longer be required to seek authorization \nfrom the Ethics Committee. An employee, however, must obtain \nauthorization from the Member or officer for whom he or she works.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the absence of a separate section in the new gift \nrule addressing foreign-sponsored travel does not mean foreign-\nsponsored travel has been prohibited?\n  Mr. LEVIN. To the contrary, foreign-sponsored travel is treated like \nany other travel: so long as it is in connection with the duties of the \nMember, officer, or employee; it is not substantially recreational in \nnature; it is not provided by a registered lobbyist or foreign agent; \nand it is properly disclosed, and authorized, in the case of an \nemployee, reimbursement for expenses connected with such travel may be \naccepted.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Section 1(c)(9) of the new gift rule creates an exception from the \ngift limitation for informational material sent to a Senate office. The \ncurrent practice in the Senate also permits the receipt of \ninformational material with some limitations. First, the material must \nbe provided by the person or entity which produces, publishes, or \ncreates the informational material. Second, current practice also \npermits those who produce, publish, or create the material to provide a \nset of books, tapes, or discs. For example, several years ago PBS \nprovided each Senator with a set of video tapes of its series, ``The \nCivil War.'' However, the Senate does not permit a Senator to accept a \ncollection of materials, such as a specialized reporting service or \nother collections issues periodically. For example, a Member could not \nreceive a set of encyclopedias, or the U.S. Code Annotated. Is it the \nintent to incorporate these limitations within the new gift rule?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, the exception for informational materials is intended \nto foster communication with the Senate. Items such as books, tapes, \nand magazine subscriptions may continue to be received in the office, \nso long as they were provided by the author, publisher, or producer and \nso long as the informational materials did not constitute a specialized \nreporting service or other collection of the type you have described.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator for the clarification. The new \ngift rule contains an exception for employments benefits, such as a \npension plan. It permits a Member, officer, or employee to participate \nin an employee welfare and benefits plan maintained by a former \nemployer. Current Senate rules and practice also permit such continued \nparticipation, with one limitation. To the extent a Member, officer, or \nemployee participates in such a plan of a former employer, the \nparticipant may not accept continued contributions from that former \nemployer. Is it intended that the new gift rule incorporate this \ncurrent Senate practice?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, I say to the Senator. It is our intent that a Member, \nofficer, or employee be permitted to maintain his or her participation \nin a plan, but not to receive continued contributions from a former \nemployer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I rise to clarify that the resolution we \nare about to pass contains only technical \n\n[[Page S 18250]]\nclarifications of the Senate gift rule and would not in any way alter \nthe substance or the intent of that rule.\n  This technical corrections measure would correct an erroneous cross \nreference in the text of the gift rule and make three minor corrections \nto the text of the Brown amendment on reporting of income and assets.\n  It would also clarify that the personal friendship exception, which \nby its terms applies to ``anything'' accepted on the basis of personal \nfriendship under the circumstances described, would cover personal \nhospitality provided by a friend. This clarification is being made \nbecause of confusion over the relationship between the personal \nfriendship exception and the personal hospitality exception. In my \nview, the exception for ``anything'' provided on the basis of personal \nfriendship already covers personal hospitality, so this clarification \nwould not change either the substance or the intent of the rule.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate all of the work of the \nEthics Committee staff and others to ensure that the tough new gift \nrestrictions scheduled to go into effect January 1, 1996, will not have \nany technical problems associated with their implementation. The Ethics \nCommittee has provided very useful technical guidance, and I believe \nthat its effort to clarify questions now will generally improve the \neffective implementation of the new rule.\n  I do, however, have a concern about one interpretation described by \nSenator McConnell and Levin, and wanted to outline that concern for the \nrecord. In one of the several colloquies between Senator Levin and \nSenator McConnell designed to provide interpretive guidance to the \nEthics Committee, a question is raised about the exception regarding \ninformational materials provided to Senators and staff. This exchange \nis designed to ensure that acceptance of sets of books, such as \nencyclopedias or the annotated U.S. Code, would continue under the new \nrule to be prohibited--as is true under current Senate practice. This \nexchange is an effort to apply a tough, narrow interpretative standard \nto this provision, and I support its intent.\n  However, it might be inferred from the statements in the colloquy \nthat the provision of all videotape--or even CD or audiotape--sets \nshould be exempted from the new rule. An example is offered by Senator \nMcConnell of a series of videotapes produced by the Public Broadcasting \nService--its much-acclaimed series on the Civil War--which years ago \nwas permitted, under current rules, to be given to Members of Congress. \nOne can imagine other examples of such videotape sets being offered to \nSenators, such as the recent PBS series on baseball, which might be \ntreated similarly under current rules.\n  It is true current Senate rules would not prohibit members from \nreceiving such taped sets. However, I have always understood the intent \nof the informational materials exception in the new rule to be to \nfoster free and unfettered communication with Members of the Senate and \nstaff, allowing them to accept information that is generally designed \nto inform their legislative or other policy work.\n  In my judgment, a television entertainment series on the Civil War, \nor on the history of baseball, or on a similar topic, should generally \nbe considered in a different light than other informational material \nthat might, for example, help legislators form judgments about OSHA \nreform, the EPA, or some other topic. Thus such sets of videotapes \nshould be considered gifts subject to the limits contained in the new \nrule. I believe the Ethics Committee should make judgments about how to \ninterpret and apply this provision on a case-by-case basis, considering \na number of factors in its interpretation, including most importantly \nthe public policy nature of the informational material and its \nusefulness in informing legislators on appropriate issues.\n  While the technical amendments do not address this issue, this \nquestion has been raised now and I thought it would be useful to offer \nmy own views for the further guidance of the Committee. I urge the \nCommittee to consider carefully its interpretation of this provision. I \nwill monitor closely the implementation of the rule in this area to \nensure that it does not allow a loophole to develop that may be subject \nto abuse. If such abuse were to take place, I intend to move quickly to \nstop it.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 198) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 198\n\n       Resolved, That (a) paragraph 1(c) of rule XXXV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate (as added by section 1 of S. \n     Res. 158, agreed to July 28, 1995) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (3) by striking ``section 107(2) of title I \n     the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-521)'' \n     and inserting ``section 109(16) of title I of the Ethics \n     Reform Act of 1989 (5 U.S.C.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs be discharged from further consideration of \nS. 1431 and further that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n       A bill (S. 1431) to make certain technical corrections in \n     laws relating to Native Americans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to urge the Senate to pass S. \n1431, a noncontroversial, no-cost bill whose sole purpose is to extend \nstatutory deadlines for completing two Indian water rights settlements \npreviously enacted and funded by the Congress. The authorizations for \nthe Yavapai-Prescott and San Carlos Apache Water Rights settlements are \nset to expire on December 31, 1995.\n  This bill's two sections are identical to two of the 22 provisions in \nS. 325, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent on October 31, \n1995. Because it appeared doubtful that the House and Senate could \ncomplete action on S. 325 by the end of the year, I introduced this \nseparate bill on November 28, 1995, when it was referred to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. I believe it is necessary to pass these \ntwo time-sensitive provisions as separate legislation so that the House \ncan act before the end of this session.\n  Section 1 of S. 1431 would extend by 6 months the deadline for \ncompleting the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement \nAct of 1994. Under the original Act, the Secretary of the Interior is \nrequired to publish in the Federal Register by December 31, 1995, a \nstatement of findings that includes a finding that contracts for the \nassignment of Central Arizona Project water have been executed. Due to \nseveral unforeseen developments, the Department of the Interior, the \nYavapai-Prescott Tribe, the City of Prescott and the City of Scottsdale \nhave concluded that additional time is necessary to finalize agreements \nand publish the Secretary's findings in the Federal Register. \nAccordingly, the amendment extends the deadline for completion of the \nsettlement to June 30, 1996.\n  Section 2 of the bill amends the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1992 to extend by one year the deadline for the \nsettlement parties to complete all actions needed to effect the \nsettlement, in particular to conclude agreements between the San Carlos \nApache Tribe and the Phelps-Dodge Corporation, and between the Tribe \nand the Town of Globe. This amendment would extend the deadline for \nsettlement to December \n\n[[Page S 18251]]\n31, 1996. The Department of the Interior, the San Carlos Apache Tribe \nand the other settlement parties all support this extension.\n  Madam President, it is extremely important for Congress to provide \nadditional time to complete these historic settlements. The San Carlos \nApache and Yavapai-Prescott agreements are the product of years of \npainstaking negotiation and effort by many parties. No one, and \nespecially not the United States, would benefit from a lapse in the \nstatutory authority for completing these settlements. Without the time \nextensions contained in S. 1431, the many fruits of these collective \nefforts could be lost. We simply cannot permit that to happen. I urge \npassage of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (S. 1431) was deemed read the third time, and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1431\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.
