We mourn \nfor the victims, especially the children, of this senseless crime and \nreach out with profound empathy to their families. We ask You to \nstrengthen them as they endure incredible suffering. Graciously grant \nphysical and emotional healing to those who survived. Most of all, \ncomfort the children who ask ``why?'' and give wisdom to parents as \nthey search for words to answer. We all need help in understanding an \nignominious act of tyranny like this.\n  We only can imagine the agony of Your heart, Father. If our \nindignation burns white-hot, it must be small in comparison to Your \njudgment. You have given us freedom of will and made us responsible for \nthe welfare of our neighbors. Our hearts break with Your heart over \nthose who willfully cause suffering. Therefore, we boldly ask for Your \ndivine intervention for the speedy capture and punishment of these \ntraitors against our Nation and the sacredness of human life. As You \nhave given us victory in just wars, now give us a strategy to defeat \nthe illusive and dangerous forces of organized terrorism.\n  Lord God of this Senate, we are never more of one mind and heart than \nwhen dealing with a threat to our national security or in responding to \na catastrophe in any one of our States. We rally in support of Senators \nNickles and Inhofe as they continue to care for their people.\n  We press on to the issues of this day with the strong inspiration of \nthe 40 years of leadership of John Stennis in this Senate. May the \nmemory of his faith in You and his courage in conflict give us \ndetermination to seek, as he did, to do our best. In the Lord's name. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5561-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The criminal investigation has been \nthorough and swift, and the tone set by the President right on the \nmark: Those who have perpetrated this unspeakable evil are cowards. \nThere is absolutely no justification, no excuse, for what took place \nlast Wednesday in Oklahoma City. Killing innocent children and other \ndefenseless citizens is the depraved act of depraved minds.\n  I also want to commend Attorney General Reno for publicly stating \nthat \n[[Page S5562]] she will seek the death penalty.

Mr. President, I will just take a moment to talk about our \ndeparted friend who served here for many, many years, Senator John \nStennis. When he left the Senate in 1989, he had served in this Chamber \nfor 41 years--nearly one-fifth of the Senate's history. And those of us \nprivileged to serve with him knew that he was one of the true giants of \nthat history.\n  Senator Stennis passed away yesterday at the age of 93, and I join \nall Senators in expressing our condolences on the death of our former \ncolleague and in extending our sympathies to members of his family.\n  Senator Stennis and I came from different regions of the country, \nfrom different political parties, and we had different views on many \nissues. But no one could know or serve with John Stennis without \nadmiring his character, his integrity, or his patriotism.\n  John Stennis loved the Senate and worked to make it a better place. \nHe was the first chairman of the Senate Committee on Standards and \nConduct and was the author of the Senate's first code of ethics.\n  John Stennis also loved America, and as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, he never wavered from his belief that America's \nnational defense should be second to none.\n  John Stennis was also a man of remarkable courage. In his seventies, \nhe was shot and left for dead by robbers outside his Washington home. \nAnd in his eighties, he lost a leg to cancer. On both occasions, he not \nonly recovered, but he was also back at work long before anyone thought \npossible.\n  Those of us who were here at the time will always remember the days \nwhen Senator Stennis returned to the Chamber and the outpouring of \nrespect and admiration that he received.\n  Mr. President, during his final years in this Chamber, Senator John \nStennis was asked in an interview how he would like to be remembered, \nand he responded: ``You couldn't give me a finer compliment than just \nto say, `He did his best.'''\n  Today, his family, friends, and former colleagues can take solace in \nthe fact that he will be remembered exactly how he wished--as a man who \nalways gave nothing less than his best.\n  Mr. President, if no other Senator is seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5562-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the majority \nleader for allowing us to consider a resolution condemning the acts of \nviolence and terrorism that occurred in Oklahoma City last Wednesday.\n  Also, I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Dole, for his \nsupport of this resolution and for his help in putting it together, as \nwell as his personal friendship in calling me and offering whatever \nsupport he could do to assist the families and the victims of this \nterrible, violent and criminal act. Senator Dole is not the only \ncolleague who has offered his support. I have had several of my \ncolleagues who have called to express their outrage over this violent \nact as well as their concern for those affected.\n  I appreciate the fact that President Clinton called me early on and \nexpressed his support for whatever could \n[[Page S5563]] be done to assist the victims of this terrible tragedy. \nHe stated that in his speech to Oklahoma City at the prayer service \nthat we had yesterday. I appreciate the President doing that, as well \nas the Reverend Billy Graham who also participated in the service.\n  It was a time for coming together. We had over 20,000 people in the \nState of Oklahoma--many people came from outside the State as well--who \nwished to express their sympathies and condolences to the families, to \nthe victims, but also their outrage at such a violent and terrible \ntragedy.\n  This is the deadliest terrorist attack on our Nation's soil in our \nhistory. The death toll continues to climb. The latest figures I heard \nwere 81 that are confirmed dead, 150 still missing and now presumed \ndead, and over 400 injured.\n  I visited some of those injured people. I visited Children's Hospital \nand saw some of the children who were very significantly maimed. \nHopefully and prayerfully they will recover and recover fully.\n  Mr. President, this becomes very, very personal when you tie it down \nto families. When you talk to a couple and they lost both children, it \nbecomes very, very personal. Or when you talk to a couple and they lost \ntheir daughter, it becomes very personal. Or when you talk to an \nindividual and they see their daughter or their son maimed almost \nbeyond recognition, it becomes very, very personal. And it certainly \nalmost takes adjectives to where they are not significant because you \ncan use the word ``terrible'' and you can use the word ``outrage,'' but \nthey really do not describe the horror that happened in Oklahoma City \nto some individuals.\n  So, Mr. President, shortly we will be submitting a resolution \ncondemning this act of violence, condemning it in the strongest manner \npossible, and also expressing our support and our sympathies and our \nprayers for the families of the victims of this terrible crime.\n  Mr. President, maybe one of the blessings that might help us overcome \nthis very difficult tragedy is the outpouring of love and support that \nwe have seen from thousands and thousands of people, not only in \nOklahoma but all across the country. I have had individuals call me and \noffer support--dollars, prayers and comfort--for those families. We \nhave seen gifts that are very large and gifts that are very small but \nvery, very precious. We have seen children donate their lunch money. We \nhave seen individuals and corporations donate a million dollars. We \nhave had people say, ``I'll do anything I can do to assist the \nfamilies.''\n  It does make you feel good, and it is so striking to think that out \nof such a tragedy you can see so much generosity, so much love, so much \nsympathy invoked by Oklahomans and by Americans everywhere. It does \nmake you feel good. Reverend Graham, in his comments yesterday to not \nonly the families but really to the American people, when he called for \na time of healing, was exactly right. Mr. President, I want to \ncompliment not only Reverend Graham but also Governor Keating and Cathy \nKeating for their outstanding leadership at this time of crisis.\n  I want to compliment the organizations who have done such a \nresponsive, outstanding job in helping to assist those people who \nreally needed help. The volunteers that have come together--I am \ntalking about the firefighters and the policemen, the Red Cross \nvolunteers, the people to assist people who are hungry--have just been \nphenomenal.\n  I was in Dallas when I heard this fateful news and caught the first \nplane I could back and was sitting next to three firefighters who were \nflying up from Dallas on their own time on their own money to assist \nthe victims. My guess is they are still there crawling through the \nrubble. And this is extremely difficult.\n  It is estimated something like 150 people are still trapped in that \nbuilding, in all likelihood deceased. There is very little hope of \nsurvival at this late point, and yet you have volunteers coming from I \ndo not know how many different cities who are crawling over the rubble \nand, in some cases, doing it by hand to recover those victims.\n  I have had the pleasure of meeting some--not all. But I just want to \nsay thank you to them because they not only work 10 hours a day or 12 \nhours a day, they are working 24 hours a day. They are working all \nnight long. They are working in the rain. They are working in the wind. \nThey are working in the cold. We just want to say thank you.\n  It has really been a blessing to see the outpouring of love from so \nmany people, not only the rescue workers, but so many other people \nthroughout this country, and for that we are very, very grateful. All \nOklahomans say thank you for, indeed, the generosity and the love we \nhave seen in the last few days.\n  Mr. President, we condemn this act of violence, this act of terrorism \nin the strongest possible language, and that is what this resolution \nwill do.\n  That is what it states. We compliment the President for taking his \nswift action to lend the law enforcement personnel, and they have \nresponded with a great deal of expertise and professionalism--to date, \nwith some real success--although, there is still a lot of work to be \ndone. So my compliments to the FBI, to the Drug Enforcement Agency, to \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Oklahoma Highway \nPatrol, and the city police, because they have worked together. This \nhas probably been one of the largest and best coordinated efforts both \non the rescue side and also on the efforts to apprehend those people \nwho were responsible for this terrorist act. I compliment all the \nFederal, State, and local officials for putting this effort together.\n  Mr. President, there is still a lot of work to be done. \nUnfortunately, there are still a lot of bodies to be recovered. There \nare buildings to be repaired. There is a lot of damage, a lot of \ndamage, not just in one building. I might mention there are several \nbuildings that have significant damage and, unfortunately, there were \npeople that worked in other buildings that also lost their lives or \nwere severely injured.\n  So, Mr. President, I pray for those victims and for the families of \nthe victims. This resolution states that we support them, that we are \ngoing to do everything within our power to help them, that we are going \nto do everything within our power to apprehend those people who are \nresponsible and that they should be punished to the maximum extent of \nthe law.\n  As the President, Attorney General and Senator Dole stated, they also \nshould pay the maximum price. The death penalty is warranted in this \ncase, and this resolution states that as well.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's willingness to let us bring this \nup at the first possible moment. I appreciate the fact that he is \nwilling to let the Senate vote tomorrow at 12 o'clock on this. I \nappreciate the support of our colleagues.\n  This resolution also says that the Senate should act as expeditiously \nas possible in enacting antiterrorism measures, both domestic and the \ninternational. I know Senator Hatch has scheduled hearings later this \nweek on this subject. I hope the Senate and House will concur and pass \nthat legislation as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my colleagues from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles and \nSenator Inhofe. I know they have been under a great deal of stress. \nThey have performed outstanding service for their constituents. All of \nus in this Chamber appreciate that very much.\n  We do have permission to go to the liability bill at 1 o'clock. I \nindicated earlier there would be no votes before 3. I am now advised \nthat there are a great number of Senators who are not here. Because of \nthat, I will say that there will be no votes today.\n  I urge my colleagues that we have to catch up with the House. We are \nnot going to be able to do that if we come back after a 2-week vacation \nand only half of us show up. It is pretty hard to have much meaningful \nhappen. This time, OK; next time we will have votes. I want to give \neverybody advance notice on both sides of the aisle that when we say no \nvotes before 3, it means probably votes after 3. But, also, there might \nbe an amendment that might take the rest of the day. I do not like to \nhave Sergeant at Arms votes to see who is in town and who is not at \ntown. I know many of my colleagues are at work wherever they may be. We \nneed \n[[Page S5564]] to finish this bill as quickly as we can and move on to \neither telecommunications, or maybe because of the urgency, the \nantiterrorism bill will be ready by next week. I think we can move very \nquickly on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we in the Senate were shocked to hear \nthe news of the passing of a cherished friend and a former colleague: \nformer Senator John Stennis from Mississippi.\n  Senator Stennis served in this Senate Chamber for 40 years--from the \ntime of his election to the Senate in 1947, through his retirement in \n1989. During that time, he dedicated himself to giving our Nation the \ngift of wisdom and leadership.\n  Senator Stennis was greatly admired by all who had the honor to serve \nwith him. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, he served with \nseveral Presidents; during that time he led the committee through the \ndarkest days of the Vietnam war. Although he often saw his position on \nthat war opposed by some of his fellow Democrats, he always did what he \nbelieved to be correct and in the best interest of our Nation.\n  For many years, Senator Stennis and I were neighbors in the Russell \nBuilding. I recall with great fondness the kindness and good cheer he \nshowed to me and my office staff on the many occasions he stopped in to \nsay hello. Senator Stennis completed his Senate career by serving with \ngreat distinction as President pro tempore of the Senate.\n  I had the honor of serving with Senator John Stennis for almost my \nentire Senate career. Throughout the years, I came to appreciate and \nrespect his qualities of integrity, ability, and dedication.\n  Mr. President, John C. Stennis was a great American. He was a \ndedicated Senator who proudly represented the people of Mississippi \nwith great distinction. We have lost a colleague, we have lost a \nleader; but most of all, we have lost a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5564-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last week, when most of us were home \nvisiting our constituents, our two colleagues from Oklahoma faced a \nterrible disaster in their State. A 4,000-pound bomb detonated outside \nthe Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City, not only \ndestroying that structure and killing dozens of innocent men, women, \nand children, but taking a tremendous toll on the psyche of all \nAmericans as well.\n  For years the United States has largely been spared the indignity of \nterrorist acts within its borders, but all that seems to have changed \nrecently. In the last 2 years, we have suffered two deadly bombing \nattacks in the United States, one in New York City and last week's in \nOklahoma City. While the images of injured and shocked people stumbling \nthrough the streets of Manhattan were disturbing, there was perhaps no \nsight as unsettling as seeking the near lifeless body of a young baby \nthat was caught in last week's blast being passed from a police officer \nto a firefighter. Tragically, the child died and with it died a piece \nof our innocence. For the bomb that destroyed that building was not \nbuilt by the hands of cold-hearted, calculating, and well financed \nforeign terrorists. Quite the contrary, the man who authorities believe \nis responsible for the bombing is a young American.\n  How, we all wonder, could an American do this to his fellow citizens? \nWhile we despise those responsible for bombing the World Trade Center, \nthe attack in Oklahoma City, America's Heartland, seems so much more \ndisturbing. When we think of terrorist actions against the United \nStates, we think only those outside our borders would wish to do us \nharm. It is inconceivable to us that a fellow countryman would possess \na hatred so deep and inflamed that he would be motivated to act against \nour Nation. How could one American commit an act that equates with \npremeditated, mass murder against other Americans? There is no answer \nand perhaps that is what is so disturbing to us.\n  The events of the last several days have happened at a breakneck pace \nand it is sometimes hard to maintain a focus and perspective on just \nwhat has occurred. We must remember, that as of this morning, 78 \npeople, many of them Government servants, too many of them children, \nlost their lives for no logical or explicable reason. That thanks to \ntireless efforts of hundreds of Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement officials, suspects in this crime were quickly identified \nand are being rapidly brought to justice.\n  We discovered that there is a whole subculture of people who are \nfearful of their lawfully elected representatives. Some of these people \nbelieve that the Government is involved in the conspiracy to go to war \nagainst the citizens of the United States, and that they must protect \nthemselves from their own Government.\n  While we truly do live in a world that is filled with dangerous \npeople, it is also a world where the good outnumber the bad. Volunteers \nand relief supplies continue to pour into Oklahoma City, and people \nthroughout the United States have banded together in shows of faith and \nsympathy for those who died or lost loved ones.\n  Most of all, we were reminded that America is still a very unique \nplace, and it is a shame we must literally fear one of our neighbors \nmight wish to destroy what is so special to all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's kindness in \nthis matter. I just have a few words to say here this morning following \nthe Oklahoma bombing.\n  Today, we all continue to mourn the senseless loss of life in \nOklahoma City. My heart and my prayers go out to the families and loved \nones of those killed and injured in this tragic bombing. This vicious \ndestruction of human life, particularly of the lives of so many \ninnocent children, is tragic beyond belief.\n  We must not rest until all of the perpetrators are discovered and \npunished. I have full confidence in the ability of Federal law \nenforcement officials to bring the perpetrators to justice. The \n[[Page S5565]] Judiciary Committee will support the President, the \nAttorney General, Director Freeh, and the hundreds of law enforcement \nofficials involved in this effort. We will provide them with any \nassistance, legislative or otherwise, that they may need in that \nregard. I want to compliment each and every one of them, especially \nDirector Freeh and the FBI, for their leadership in the work they have \ndone in uncovering all the things they have, thus far.\n  President Clinton was correct when he described the terrorists who \ncommitted this act as ``evil cowards.'' If the barbaric individuals \nresponsible for this venomous, wicked act believe they could \nintimidate, punish, or coerce the United States of America, they were \nwrong. Dead wrong. We must and we will guarantee that any terrorist, be \nhe domestic or international, know that our Nation's policy will be one \nof swift and effective retribution.\n  For years, many in Congress have been fighting for passage of \nlegislation aimed at enhancing our domestic and international \ncounterterrorism efforts. I have been one of those. Much of this \nlegislation is embodied in the Dole-Hatch crime bill that was \nintroduced on the first day of this Congress. Recently, the \nadministration forwarded to Congress its own counterterrorism bill that \nis similar to the Dole-Hatch proposal.\n  Since the tragic incident of last week, Senator Dole and I have been \nworking with Senators Nickles and Inhofe on a comprehensive bill that \nwill combine the better provisions from both the Dole-Hatch and \nadministration bills into a single vehicle. Although this legislation \nis ready, we will delay its introduction until we can incorporate the \nadditional provisions the President referred to last evening in his 60 \nMinutes interview. We will also hold hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee later this week to determine what can be done to fight \nterrorism.\n  The heinous attack on innocent men, women, and children underscores \nthe need for tough, effective laws to fight the scourge of terrorism. \nWe must ensure that Federal law enforcement officials have the tools to \nprevent and detect future terrorist attempts. Legislation is needed, \nand it is needed now, to give them those tools.\n  In addition to whatever recommendations the President may promulgate, \nour bill will certainly do the following:\n  It will increase the penalties for committing terrorist acts here in \nthe United States;\n  Our legislation will add the crime of conspiracy to terrorism \noffenses, thus, permitting the Federal law enforcement agencies to stop \nterrorist organizations at their formation rather than waiting until \nafter they have committed their terrorist acts;\n  Although the tragedy in Oklahoma appears to have been committed by \nindividuals who are from the United States, it is important that we \nprotect our citizens from foreign terrorists as well. Our bill will \nprovide law enforcement and courts the tools they need to quickly \nremove alien terrorists from our midst without jeopardizing national \nsecurity or the lives of law enforcement personnel;\n  Our legislation also seeks to prevent individuals who support or \nengage in terrorist activities from ever entering the United States. \nThe bill would permit the Secretary of State to withhold visas from \ncertain individuals who come from nations that sponsor terrorism, or \nfrom individuals who are members of organizations suspected of \nterrorist activities;\n  Our bill further includes provisions making it a crime to knowingly \nprovide material support to groups designated by a Presidential finding \nto be engaged in terrorist activities;\n  Finally, our bill provides for numerous other needed improvements in \nthe law to fight the scourge of terrorism. I would note that many of \nthe provisions of this bill enjoy broad bipartisan support, and in \nseveral cases, have passed the Senate on previous occasions.\n  We must, however, resist the urge to leap to conclusions and unfairly \ntar certain political minorities with recriminations for last \nWednesday's tragic events. As President Clinton said last evening, ``We \nmust be careful not to stereotype people from other groups.'' Once all \nof the perpetrators of this act are apprehended, there will be time \nenough to ensure that justice is done.\n  As a final note, I want to commend President Clinton for his \nleadership that he has exhibited in the face of this tragedy. He and \nhis administration have done a superb job in responding to this \ntragedy. The Department of Justice, the FBI, and all of the police and \nrescue workers in Oklahoma must be acknowledged for their efforts to \ndate.\n  In closing, what is shocking to so many is the apparent fact that \nthose responsible for this atrocity are U.S. citizens. To think that \nAmericans could do this to one another, it is unbelievable.\n  Yet these killers are not true Americans, not in my book. Americans \nare the men, women, and children who died under the sea of concrete and \nsteel. Americans are the rescue workers, the volunteers, the law \nenforcement officials and investigators who are clearing up the chaos \nthat has occurred in Oklahoma City. The genuine Americans are the \noverwhelming number who will forever reel at the senselessness and \nhorror of April 19, 1995. It falls on everyone as Americans in heart \nand spirit, to condemn this sort of political extremism. Anarchistic \nradicalism of this sort--be it from the left or the right--will not \nprevail in our freedom-loving democracy.\n  The rule of law and popular government will prevail. We intend by \nthis legislation to see that it prevails, and that it prevails with the \nforce that really should be behind the rule of law.\n  There are a lot of other things I will say about the bill we will \nfile in the future, but suffice it to say these are some of the matters \nI wanted to cover in these few short remarks here.\n  Again, my lasting prayers, and that of my family, go out to those who \nhave suffered so much through this ordeal, those who have suffered the \nloss of loved ones, those who have been maimed, and those who are \nrelated to those who have died or been maimed.\n  My love goes out to our Federal workers, too, for they are hard-\nworking people who try to do the best they can. We want to make sure \nthe Federal installations, as well as all other installations in this \ncountry, are secure from terrorism, terrorist activities, and from \nthose who would subvert the very freedom fabric of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5564-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me join my colleague, Senator Dole \nfrom Kansas, and my colleague, Senator Nickles from Oklahoma, and \nothers, I am sure, who will today speak of the nearly unspeakable \ntragedy that occurred in Oklahoma City.\n  It is very hard to even describe the horror that has been visited on \nso many families, so many innocent victims. My hope is that in this \nperiod of national discussion and reconciliation dealing with this \ntragedy that we will find ways, again, as Americans, to speak of how we \nresolve differences and how we deal with grievances in our country \nwithout resorting to violence.\n  We have been offered as a people far too many sights and sounds on \ntelevision of acts of terror visited on people living in foreign lands. \nOften it passes before the television screen and does not make much of \nan impact.\n  Obviously, this tragedy is more immediate. It occurs in the heartland \nof our country. It is the worst tragedy of its type in the history of \nour country. It comes at a time when there is a great deal of debate \nand unsettled feelings in our country about a lot of things. I hope it \nwill require all of us again to decide that in our country, we make \ndecisions in a process by which we debate and discuss and then \npeacefully resolve our differences in a democratic way and in a \ndemocratic system.\n  So my heart and prayers go to those in Oklahoma City, those who have \nlost family members, those victims who lost their lives, and those many \nothers who devoted their lives in recent days and nights--often 24 \nhours a day--trying to help their fellow man and woman.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5565-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5565-S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the 80th anniversary of one \nof the most tragic events in world history--the genocide that brought \ndeath \n[[Page S5566]] to more than 1\\1/2\\ million Armenian men, women, and \nchildren at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. As we honor the memory of \nthese individuals, we renew our commitment that the world will never \nforget their tragic suffering.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, officials of the Ottoman Empire carried out a \nsystematic campaign to eradicate all Armenians. Innocent Armenians were \nmurdered and those who survived were forced to flee their homeland and \nlive in exile. Many of the survivors later made their way to the United \nStates.\n  The campaign of genocide began with the execution of the Armenian \nleadership and proceeded with the targeting of the entire male \npopulation. It continued with the persecution of Armenian women, \nchildren, and the elderly, who were sent on forced death marches to be \nraped, tortured, and murdered. During this brutal 8-year period, over \n1\\1/2\\ million Armenians died through massacres, disease, and \nstarvation.\n  Unfortunately, even today, the Armenian people face continued \nviolence and ethnic hatred. Since 1988, the conflict between Christian \nArmenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis for control of Nagorno-Karabakh has \nresulted in over 10,000 deaths and almost 1\\1/2\\ million refugees. \nDespite the May 1994 cease-fire and the armistice agreement signed the \nfollowing month, a permanent solution to the conflict has yet to be \nfound.\n  The United States has provided substantial humanitarian assistance to \nArmenia, but it has become increasingly difficult to deliver this \nassistance because of the continuing blockade by the Governments of \nAzerbaijan and Turkey. As a result, Armenia suffers from a long-\nstanding shortage of food, fuel, and medical supplies. We need to \nredouble our efforts to end the current crisis and promote peaceful \ndevelopment of the region.\n  I commend the tireless efforts of the Armenian-Americans for their \nefforts to promote a peaceful solution to the conflict, and for keeping \ntheir Armenian heritage alive in the United States.\n  As we commemorate and honor the victims of the Armenian genocide, we \nrenew our commitment to combat ethnic hatred and to end injustice and \nconflicts throughout the world.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5565-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today marks the 80th anniversary of the \nArmenian genocide, the first great crime of the 20th century. Over 1\\1/\n2\\ million Armenians were murdered by the Ottoman Empire and its \nsuccessor between 1915 and 1923. Many in this country and throughout \nthe world still mourn the relatives they lost in the Armenian genocide. \nIt is important that we take a moment to remember this terrible crime \nagainst humanity.\n  The 20th century has been not only a century of mass murder, but also \na century of culpability in which the nations of the world have failed \nto act to prevent or halt genocide. The slaughter of Armenians was \nignored. The international community was too slow to act when the Nazis \nbegan killing Jews and Gypsies. Our response to the ethnic cleansing in \nBosnia and Rwanda has been feeble.\n  However, on this day, we not only mourn the losses sustained by \nArmenia, we also celebrate the contributions of Armenians to our \ncivilization and culture, such as fellow New Jerseyans Christopher \nBabigian, a prominent physician and community leader, Krikor Zadourian, \na leading businessman and community leader, and Haigaz Grigorian, a \ncommunity leader active in relief work in Armenia, to name a few. \nIndeed, the American-Armenian community has done much to enrich New \nJersey and the United States.\n  Armenia itself, Mr. President, has now reemerged as an independent \nstate in which Armenians can control their own destiny for the first \ntime in centuries. Tragically, though, Armenia is a country which has \nthus far been forced to devote its resources to war rather than to \nbuilding a peaceful, prosperous, life for its people.\n  It is our responsibility to educate future generations about the \ndangers of intolerance and to fulfill the pledge of ``never again.'' \nRemembering the horrors of 1915-23 is one way of rousing ourselves to \ngive meaning to this pledge.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5566-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5566-S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating one of this century's most tragic events. Today marks the \n80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 1915-23, recognized by \nsome as the first genocide of this century when 1\\1/2\\ million Armenian \nmen, women, and children lost their lives as a result of the brutal \nmassacres and wholesale deportations conducted by the Turkish Ottoman \nrulers.\n  Mr. President, on this day 80 years ago began one of the great \nmartyrdoms of modern history, a systematic and methodical campaign to \nexterminate an innocent people. An entire nation was uprooted from its \nhomeland scattering thousands of survivors around the world. Thus this \nhuman tragedy, having left few families unaffected, and its anniversary \nhave special meaning to Armenians everywhere.\n  The 1915 genocide represented the culmination of decades, and the \ndevelopment of an insidious pattern, of persecution against the \nArmenian community living in the Ottoman Empire. During the period \n1894-96 and again in 1909, thousands of Armenians lost their lives at \nthe hands of their ruthless persecutors. On April 24, 1915, Armenian \nintellectual, religious, and political leaders, were rounded up by \nOttoman authorities, taken to remote parts of Anatolia and murdered.\n  At least 250,000 Armenians serving in the Ottoman Army were expelled \nand forced into labor battalions where executions and starvation were \ncommon. Men, women, and children were deported from their villages and \nobliged to march for weeks in the Syrian Desert where a majority of \nthem perished.\n  There was no shortage of contemporaneous newspaper accounts in the \nUnited States of the Ottoman Turkish atrocities--a simple review of \nheadlines appearing in the New York Times in mid-1915 yields the \nfollowing: ``Wholesale Massacres of Armenians by Turks,'' ``Tales of \nArmenian Horrors Confirmed,'' ``800,000 Armenians Counted Destroyed,'' \n``Thousands Protest Armenian Murders.'' In fact, through a \ncongressionally chartered organization called Near East Relief, \nAmericans contributed $113 million in humanitarian assistance from 1915 \nto 1930 to help the surivors. In addition, 132,000 Armenian orphans \nwere adopted in this country.\n  Perhaps America's most notable observer of the Armenian genocide was \nits distinguished ambassador to Turkey at the time, Henry Morgenthau, \nwho published an article in the Red Cross magazine in 1918 describing \nthe wide-scale and deliberate orchestration of Ottoman atrocities \nagainst the Armenian people as ``the Greatest Horror in History.'' \nMorgenthau has also written the following about the Armenian genocide \nin this now famous passage:\n\n       Whatever crimes the most perverted instincts of the human \n     mind can devise, and whatever refinements of persecutions and \n     injustice the most debased imagination can conceive, became \n     the daily misfortunes of this devoted people. I am confident \n     that the whole history of the human race contains no such \n     horrible episode as this. The great massacres and \n     persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when \n     compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915. The \n     killing of the Armenian people was accompanied by the \n     systematic destruction of churches, schools, libraries, \n     treasures of art and of history, in an attempt to eliminate \n     all traces of a noble civilization some three thousand years \n     old.\n\n  Indeed, Morgenthau and other diplomats who witnessed and reported in \ngreat detail the enormous devastation of the Armenian community by the \nOttomans would be astonished to learn today that the abundant evidence \nthey collected, much of which is held in our own National Archives, and \nthe testimony of survivors who are still with us, continue to be \nchallenged without a trace of contrition. Despite the irrefutability of \nthe documentation and testimony, including extensive accounts from \nsurvivors, witnesses, and historians, there are those who refuse to \ncome to grips with the past, blame the victims, and deride \nreconciliation.\n  Remembrance and understanding, however, are universal imperatives \nessential to all decent people an decent \n[[Page S5567]] societies. To be sure, Armenians themselves are \ncommitted to the proposition that their experience has meaning for all \nof us--it must not remain the special province of the survivors. In \nother words, to ignore or forget the past is to remain its captive, and \ncoming to terms with the past is an indispensable part of building for \nthe future.\n  Elie Wiesel, speaking at a Holocaust memorial service here in the \nCongress during the early 1980's, expressed eloquently the importance \nof recognizing the Armenian genocide when he said:\n\n       Before the planning of the final solution, Hitler asked, \n     ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' He was right. No one \n     remembered them, as no one remembered the Jews. Rejected by \n     everyone, they felt expelled from history.\n\n  From the darkness of this experience, Armenians have risen to \ndemonstrate great courage and strength in their pursuit of human \ndignity and freedom. After enduring years of struggle under Soviet rule \nthe Armenians gained independence at last. They now face the effects of \na devastating earthquake in 1988, an inhumane economic blockade which \ncontinues to hamper the delivery of needed humanitarian assistance, and \nthe hostile forces arrayed against them in their volatile area of the \nworld.\n  Perhaps the Armenian-American community is one of the best examples \nof this indomitable human spirit of the Armenian people. The \ncontribution of the Armenian community to the cultural, social, \neconomic, and political life of America is a source of great strength \nand vitality in our Nation. Americans of Armenian origin have kept \nalive, and not let tragedy shatter, the rich faith and traditions of \nArmenian civilization.\n  Mr. President, in keeping with our country's highest principles and \nideals, we pause and pay tribute today to the survivors and the victims \nwho perished in the midst of a deliberate attempt to rid the world of \nthe entire nation. As we recall the events that began on the night of \nApril 24, 1915, we are reminded yet again of the fundamental importance \nof freedom and respect for human rights, and of the terrible \nconsequences of their abuse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent column appearing in the New \nYork Times entitled ``For Old Armenians, April is the Cruelest Memory'' \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 19, 1995]\n\n            For Old Armenians, April Is the Cruelest Memory\n\n                        (By Michael T. Kaufman)\n\n       The forsythia at the Armenian Home in Flushing are blooming \n     cheerily and the dandelions wink from the lawn, but for the \n     old people who live there, April remains a time of heavy \n     sorrows. They sit silently in sunny rooms, keeping to \n     themselves what they saw and heard and smelled 80 years ago \n     when their people were scattered and killed in the first of \n     the century's many genocides.\n       ``We don't talk to each other about it because everybody \n     has their own terrible stories,'' said Alice Dosdourian, who \n     is 89 years old. They also no longer go to the commemorative \n     gatherings, such as the one to be held this Sunday in Times \n     Square, where younger people mark the years of Armenian agony \n     that began when the Turks killed 235 intellectuals on April \n     24, 1915. The home's administrators say the memorials were \n     too upsetting for the residents.\n       ``But I never forget,'' Mrs. Dosdourian said. ``I think \n     about what happened all the time. Sometimes I dream about it \n     and I wake up and I hold myself and tell myself, `No, you do \n     not have to worry, now you are in America.''' Mrs. Dosdourian \n     has been in America since 1924.\n       But if the old Armenians discreetly avoided making each \n     other cry, they eagerly took advantage of a stranger's visit \n     to tell what they had seen and endured as children. They are, \n     after all, among the last ones alive who had seen the horrors \n     with their own eyes. They need to reveal their recollections \n     to those who were not there, not to seek redress or make \n     politics, but simply to have the facts acknowledged. And so, \n     one after another, the Armenians clasped a stranger's arm and \n     testified.\n       Mrs. Dosdourian had been born in Mazhdvan, a village in \n     that part of Turkey where the Armenians had lived for many \n     centuries. She was 6 years old in 1915 when soldiers came and \n     took away her father, a shoemaker. She never saw him again. \n     ``My mother took me and my brother, who was 12, and we \n     walked. We went from village to village. We went to the \n     mountains. I do not know how many months we walked. Once we \n     were in a village where all the men were Armenian heroes, big \n     men who fought until they died. But then the soldiers came \n     and made us walk again.''\n       There were more than a million who walked, mostly women, \n     children and old men forced across Mesopotamian deserts into \n     Syria. Many drowned and died of hunger. Some, like Mrs. \n     Dosdourian's brother, were shot to death during the exodus. \n     In all, the estimates of the dead ranged between 600,000 and \n     1.5 million. Until World War II and the destruction of the \n     Jews, it was the sufferings of the Armenians, well documented \n     by journalists and writers, that set standards of horror and \n     contemporary barbarism.\n       ``Every night,'' Mrs. Dosdourian said, ``I heard people \n     shouting that they were robbed by the gendarmes. We were \n     always hungry. People were dying and we had no shovels to \n     bury them. People stayed up at night to protect bodies from \n     dogs and wild animals. People sang out to God, `How could you \n     let this happen to us?''' The woman spoke unhesitatingly, \n     sitting erect and keeping her clear blue eyes on her \n     listener.\n       ``One day we came to a river. There were many dead around \n     but in the water there was the body of a young woman \n     floating. I could see her long black hair spread out like a \n     beautiful fan.'' She shuddered and her clear blue eyes filled \n     with tears.\n       Annahid Verdanian also remembers. She was 4 years old when \n     she was forced from her home with her mother and her father. \n     She and her nurse became separated from the others. At one \n     river she watched as a ferry full of people was turned over. \n     She thinks her family may have been on the boat and drowned. \n     She was adopted by people, some good, some exploitative. She \n     worked as a maid, as a seamstress. She went to Greece and \n     then to Marseille, and then in 1934 she came to \n     Massachusetts, where she worked in textile mills.\n       Hagop Cividian, who is 86, did not come here until 1990. In \n     French and German he explains his story. With difficulty he \n     talks about a woman named Diana, saying it is important to \n     remember her because she was a real hero. He has written her \n     story but only in Armenian. ``Americans should know,'' he \n     said with passion. ``She was an American.'' She was married \n     to his cousin and they had a 7-year-old boy who was a prodigy \n     on the piano. ``The authorities told her that because she was \n     American she could go but she would have to leave the boy,'' \n     Mr. Cividian said. ``She stayed and died with her husband and \n     son.''\n       Mr. Cividian managed to live. ``For four years I was \n     hungry, and beaten,'' said the stocky and still muscular man. \n     Later he made his way to Romania, where he became a chemical \n     engineer. ``As a child I saw the Turks kill the Armenians, \n     later I saw Hitler and then Ceaucescu,'' Mr. Cividian said. \n     ``The only time I knew freedom was when I came to America \n     five years ago. Only here I can do what I want. I can think, \n     speak and remember.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5566-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

FOX\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to an \noutstanding South Dakotan and good friend, Father Robert J. Fox of \nAlexandria, SD. Today, April 24, 1995, marks the 40th year of his \ndedicated service to the Catholic church and the people of South \nDakota.\n  It has been my personal pleasure to work with Father Robert over the \npast 6 years in establishing National Children's Day. As national \nchairman of National Children's Day activities for the Catholic church, \nhe has tirelessly promoted this special day for our children. As a \nresult of his efforts, I expect to see National Children's Day \nsuccessfully celebrated on the second Sunday of October for many years \nto come.\n  Father Robert Fox began his pastoral career at the age of 27 after \ngraduating from St. Paul Seminary school. A little over a year later, \non April 24, 1955, he was ordained into the priesthood, and gave his \nfirst sermon soon afterward at \n[[Page S5568]] the Immaculate Conception Church in his hometown of \nWatertown, SD.\n  Over the years Father Robert has faithfully served the Catholic \nchurch in many different parishes across eastern South Dakota. He has \nbeen ministering in Alexandria since 1985. During his career Father \nRobert has authored 20 books and numerous articles in Catholic \npublications. He also has taken pilgrimages with 3,000 youth. \nCertainly, South Dakotans of all ages have benefited from his very \nactive career of service.\n  I am just one of many South Dakotans who have profited from Father \nRobert's wisdom. His valuable advice will always be greatly \nappreciated. He is loved and respected by many. I am honored to join in \nobserving this very special occasion for Father Robert.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5567-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE DEATH OF JOHN F. BLAKE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the CIA, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee and our country lost a loyal servant on March 27 when Jack \nBlake passed away after a long illness. Jack was an OSS veteran who \nbecame one of the CIA's premier managers, serving as its director of \nlogistics, Deputy Director for Administration and acting Deputy \nDirector of Central Intelligence. He also served as president of the \nAssociation of Former Intelligence Officers.\n  In 1981, when Senator Barry Goldwater became the first Republican to \nchair the Select Committee on Intelligence, he chose Jack Blake to be \nstaff director of the committee. Together, Senator Goldwater and Jack \nBlake established the principle that the transfer from a Democratic to \na Republican majority would not mean an end to the Senate's bipartisan \noversight of sensitive national security matters. They also made the \npoint that the intelligence community's best friends were capable of \nexamining its activities with a critical eye, for the sake of improving \nthis vital function and safeguarding the liberties of our citizens.\n  Jack Blake went on to become a professor at the Defense Intelligence \nCollege and frequently brought his classes back to the Hill to meet \nwith congressional overseers and see for themselves that we were not \nmonsters, but people of good will. His tremendous good humor and \nperseverance served him and his country well. We will miss Jack Blake, \nbut we will also continue to profit from his life of good works.

CURL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, our Nation lost a valuable member of its \nnational security team recently, when Richard E. Curl died at the age \nof 77. Dick Curl was Director of the Office of Intelligence Resources \nin the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He was \nnot the former Director, not the retiring Director, but very much the \nactive Director of that office, even at the age of 77.\n  Dick Curl devoted his life to intelligence. He served as a naval \nintelligence officer in both World War II and the Korean war, and with \nthe State Department between those wars. And Dick began his work for \nINR in 1952. Overall, he gave his country over half a century of \nservice.\n  Mr. Curl's obituary states that his work ``involved contact with \nvarious foreign intelligence services as well as U.S. intelligence \nagencies.'' Suffice it to say that his role was often that of a \nmediator between the two different cultures, explaining the uses of \nintelligence to policymakers and Foreign Service officers while also \nensuring that the risks and benefits of intelligence operations were \nweighed in light of broader U.S. policy interests that might be \naffected if something went wrong. Much of Dick Curl's career was spent \nteaching the policy and intelligence communities to listen to each \nother.\n  The staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence knew Mr. \nCurl since at least the early 1980's. They found him a valuable source \nof information and good counsel. Dick Curl will be missed by both the \ncommittee and his country.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5568-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5568-S5569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              RURAL SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor for a different \npurpose today, however. I want to describe something that is happening \ntomorrow in Ames, IA, and something that happened last Friday in \nBismarck, ND.\n  Some many months ago, I and Congressman Dick Durbin, from Illinois, \nasked President Clinton to host a rural summit in our country prior to \nthe writing of the new 5-year farm bill in Congress this year. The \nPresident took our suggestion and set December 1 of last year as a date \nfor a rural summit. It would be the first ever of its kind held in this \ncountry prior to the writing of a new farm bill.\n  On December 1, it turned out that the Senate was going to reconvene \nand vote on the GATT treaty, and the result was the rural summit had to \nbe postponed. The President was required to remain in Washington, and \nothers who were to participate were to remain here as well. A new date \nwas set, and that new date is tomorrow.\n  The President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Agriculture, and \nother Cabinet Members will go to Ames, IA, and they will convene a \nrural summit. The purpose of that is to discuss, before the new farm \nbill is written, what works and what does not in rural America, what \nkind of a farm program works to save family farmers, to try to provide \nan injection of economic life into rural economies; how can we improve \non it, how can we change it, how can we offer more hope to rural \nAmerica?\n  I give great credit to President Clinton for his willingness to do \nthis. It is long overdue that we take a fresh look at all of the \nprograms and all of the initiatives and all of the efforts that are \ndesigned to try to help rural America. This is, after all, one country, \nnot many countries, and the one country includes, yes, some of the \nbiggest cities but also some of the smallest counties.\n  In my home county in rural North Dakota, as an example, where fewer \nthan several thousand people live in the entire county, they lost 20 \npercent of their population in that county in the 1980's. In the first \n5 years of the 1990's, from 1990 to 1995, the new census report shows \nthey lost another 11 percent of their population.\n  The flip side of economic stress, that we register in the cities by \ntaking a look at poverty and unemployment, for rural America is out \nmigration, people getting in their car and leaving because there is no \nopportunity, they feel, in rural counties. What is happening in rural \nAmerica is that many rural counties and rural areas are shrinking like \nprunes. The lifeblood is leaving these rural counties.\n  And so the question is what works and what does not, what kind of a \nfarm plan, what kind of a rural economic development policy should we \nhave in rural America to give everybody in this country a chance; yes, \neven those who live in sparsely populated areas.\n  Prior to the summit that will be held in Ames, IA, tomorrow, the \nPresident asked the new Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, to hold \nsix regional forums around the country, and he has done that. I believe \nthe last one is today in Illinois. He held one of those six forums in \nBismarck, ND, last Friday.\n  At that forum, the Secretary of Agriculture brought along most of the \nAssistant Secretaries, and they were all there as a team from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to listen to family farmers. About 700 to 800 \npeople crowded into this facility, the Farmers Livestock Exchange, to \nspend 3 hours at this forum. Another probably 200 people could not get \ninto the facility, but because it was broadcast on a couple of radio \nstations, there were people sitting in the parking lot listening to \ntheir radios to hear the discussion during these 3 hours about rural \nAmerica, about the farm bill, and about what works to try to rescue, \nrevive, and breathe some life into rural America.\n  I know this subject would not sound very interesting or important to \na lot of Americans. Most Americans take a look at rural America or \nfarmers and they do not think much about them. They go to the store and \nbuy elbow macaroni, and it is in a carton. Well, elbow macaroni does \nnot come in a carton. That is the way it is sold, but it comes from \nsemolina flour. You get that by grinding durum wheat that comes from \nthe wheat field of someone who, most often, is a family farmer who \nrisks all of his economic strength \n[[Page S5569]] and crosses his fingers and hopes he will not get rained \non too much, or that it will not be too dry, or that insects do not \ndestroy the crop. They hope to harvest it, and when they harvest it, \nthey hope the price will not be so low that they lose a ton of money. \nThose are the risks and uncertainties they face.\n  Why did anywhere from 800 to 1,000 people show up Friday in Bismark, \nND, to meet Secretary Glickman and talk to him for 3 hours about what \nthey think ought to be done? Because it is their livelihood, their \nfuture. This is not a case of it being inconvenient if things do not \nwork out. This is a case of losing everything you have if you are on a \nfamily farm and things do not work out.\n  The basic message Friday in North Dakota by all of those family \nfarmers and others speaking to the Agriculture Secretary was a message \nthat the current farm program is not enough and does not work very \nwell. That does not mean that we need more in order to make it work \nbetter. The resources we now spend on the farm program in this country, \nbetter applied, could provide a better life for family farmers by \nproviding a safety net to give family farmers a chance to make a decent \nliving.\n  We do not need to provide farm price support to the biggest corporate \nagrifactories in America for every bushel of grain they produce; yet, \nwe do--a loan rate for everybody in the program for every bushel of \nwheat they produce, no matter how large they are.\n  We have all seen reports that the Prince of Liechtenstein was getting \nbenefits for farming in Texas, and a group of Texans who concocted a \nconsortium or amalgamation partnership of sorts and they farm in \nMontana, section by section, by dropping seeds out of the helicopters. \nThey are not farming the land; they are farming the farm program. We \nhave seen those abuses. We ought to eliminate them.\n  We ought to change the farm program so that we have a farm program \nthat is actually able to spend less money but provide more help to \nfamily-sized farmers. I have submitted a proposal, and I have entered \nit into the Record, and I have written about it, and I will provide a \npiece I have written on the subject.\n  This proposal is substantially different than the current farm \nprogram. It says let us retain a basic safety net of support prices, \nand do it in a way that provides the strongest support for the first \nincrement of production, which has the ability to provide the most help \nfor family-sized farms. Above that, you do not need price supports. If \nyou want to farm the whole county, God bless you. But the Federal \nGovernment does not have to be your financial partner. You can assume \nthose risks alone.\n  Second, in addition to a better price support for production designed \nto help family farmers, let us get government off farmers' backs and \nstop having government describe what they can plant, when they can \nplant, and where they can plant it. Let us get family farmers better \nprices for the output of their production, and let the rest of the \npeople above that--if you want to plant above that--get their signals \nfrom the marketplace. More help, less government, at less cost. That is \nwhat I want to see from a farm program.\n  If the purpose of the farm program is not to help family farmers, if \nthat is not the first sentence or preamble of the farm program--we \ndesign a farm program because we want the farm program to try to \nprovide a safety net under family farmers, because for social and \neconomic reasons it is important for America to have a network of \nfamily farms, and family farmers do not have the financial strength to \nwithstand price depressions that are international price swings; they \ndo not have the financial strength to withstand crop failures and price \ndepressions, so that is why we have a safety net.\n  If that is not the first line of the farm bill, saying this farm bill \nis designed to provide a safety net for family-sized farms, then scrap \nthe whole farm bill. We do not need a farm bill to help corporations \nplow. They will do fine. They are big enough, strong enough, and they \ncan plow enough land to farm the whole country. That is fine. I do not \nhappen to think that is good for the country, but if that is who is \ngoing to plow the ground in America, they do not need the farm program.\n  If it is about helping farmers get a decent price support, make that \nthe first line in the farm bill and make the bill comport to that.\n  In the early 1860's, President Abraham Lincoln created a U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. By the way, he had nine employees in the \nDepartment of Agriculture in the 1860's. One and a third centuries \nlater, we have a USDA, but it has 100,000 employees, that is adding the \nForest Service to it. It is a behemoth organization. My central premise \nis that it is either going to help family farmers, or we do not need \nany of the USDA.\n  The President has done the right thing in having regional farm \nforums. They are having a rural summit at Ames, IA, tomorrow to listen \nand hear what farmers are saying in this country and then write a new \nfarm plan that does real good for family farmers.\n  Let us not just do what we have done for the past couple of farm \nplans and say we will have the same farm plan but a little less. I do \nnot support that. Let us change it in a way that says this farm program \nrelates to the needs of family farmers, and do it in a way that costs \nless money to the Federal Government and also has less Government \ninterference in the lives of our farmers.\n  I am not going to be able to be in Ames, IA, tomorrow. The President \ninvited me to go. He invited Congressman Durbin to go. Since the House \nof Representatives is not in session, I expect that Congressman Durbin \nwill be there. I was not able to take advantage of the President's \ninvitation because it appears we are going to have votes in the Senate \ntomorrow.\n  I was pleased to participate in the regional forums, and I am \ndelighted to have been a small part in doing what I think we should do \nin this country--having the President convene a rural summit and start \nthinking and talking about what works and what does not, what can work \nto breathe economic life into our rural counties and towns, what can \ngive people in those areas an opportunity for the same kinds of jobs \nand hope and future that many others in our country now have.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that I appreciate the indulgence of the \nSenator from Washington. I will be coming to the floor to speak on the \nsubject that is on the floor--product liability--at some point in the \nfuture. I am on the Senate Commerce Committee and am interested in the \nsubject. I appreciate his allowing me to speak in morning business on \nanother matter.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5568-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5569-S5571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   IMPLEMENTATION OF USDA DISASTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was a strong supporter in the last \nCongress of the bill passed and signed into law by President Clinton \nregarding the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture and \nFederal crop insurance reform. I would like to again extend my \ncongratulations to Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy for their \noutstanding efforts on the passage of this very important legislation.\n  A driving force behind crop insurance reform was to make basic crop \ninsurance obligatory in an effort to avoid ad hoc disaster bills in \nCongress. Under crop insurance reform, crops that are not eligible for \ninsurance will qualify for disaster relief under the newly created Non-\nInsured Assistance Program [NAP]. We are not sure how the NAP Program \nwill work and how effective it will be in helping farmers of \nnoninsurable crops who have suffered a natural disaster. The NAP \nregulations are still being drafted by the Department of Agriculture.\n  California agriculture has recently experienced devastating floods. \nCalifornia Food and Agriculture Secretary Henry J. Voss has estimated \nthat damage resulting from the March winds, rains, and flooding in \nCalifornia is over $665 million.\n  Commodities suffering severe losses statewide include almonds, $208 \nmillion; strawberries, $63 million; plums and prunes, $53 million; \nlettuce, $40 million; and apricots, $20 million.\n  One of the hardest hit counties is Monterey County, which has \nsuffered over $240,000 million in damages. Over 70,000 acres of \nagricultural land have been lost or damaged. I share Congressman Sam \nFarr's grave concern about \n[[Page S5570]] how the Department of Agriculture will help these \nfarmers get on their feet again.\n  My purpose in raising this issue today is to ensure that \nimplementation of crop insurance reform is successful, that it achieves \nthe goal of helping farmers recover quickly, and that it avoid the need \nfor another ad hoc disaster bill.\n  The Department of Agriculture, in implementing the new Non-Insured \nAssistance Program and other disaster relief programs, should do so in \na way that appropriately meets the needs of California agriculture.\n  We have the situation in California, especially in the case of \nspecialty crop growers, where farmers may not qualify for the Non-\nInsured Assistance Program, due to various criteria. Note that of the \n250 crops grown in California only about 10 are covered by crop \ninsurance.\n  There are two specific issues which I hope, with your help, and with \nthe ongoing efforts of Congressman Farr, we can urge the Department of \nAgriculture to resolve administratively.\n  At this point, I would like to ask my colleagues Senator Lugar and \nSenator Leahy several questions regarding the implementation of the \nagriculture disaster assistance programs by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Would the Senators agree with me that we must urge the Department of \nAgriculture to ensure that ``area'' is defined in a fair and equitable \nmanner?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I agree that the Department of Agriculture must \nensure that ``area'' is defined in a fair and equitable manner, \nconsistent with the need for fiscal responsibility and program \nintegrity. The issue should be resolved administratively so that the \ndefinition of ``area'' is sufficiently flexible and sensitive to the \nagronomic practices of the area that has suffered the disaster.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I concur.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another issue of critical importance to farmers in \nCalifornia and their ability to recover from the disastrous floods they \nare experiencing is the issue of crop losses in cases where a grower \nplants and harvests multiple crops in 1 year. To qualify for the Non-\nInsured Assistance Program, a farmer must lose 50 percent of the crop \nin a crop year. Loss is counted differently depending on whether a \nfarmer plants the same crop over and over again--as in the case of \nlettuce growers--or whether a farmer grows and harvests different crops \nin 1 year.\n  In the case of a lettuce producer who raises multiple crops of \nlettuce in 1 year, for example, the producer won't be eligible for non-\ninsured assistance based on losses for a single harvest even if he \nloses 100 percent of his crop. In comparison, a producer who raises \nwheat followed by soybeans--which commonly occurs in the south--would \nbe eligible if the grower lost 50 percent of the wheat crop. The grower \nwould again be eligible for his soybeans if he had significant losses. \nIn contrast, the lettuce producer who suffered 100 percent loss of his \ncrop would receive nothing.\n  Would the Senators agree with me that we must urge the Department of \nAgriculture to ensure that the multiple planting issue is dealt with in \nan equitable manner?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree that we must urge the Department of Agriculture to \nensure that the ``multiple planting issue'' is dealt within an \nequitable manner, consistent with the need for fiscal responsibility \nand program integrity.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I concur.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank very much Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy for \ntheir support on this issue. I hope that our statements today will help \nguarantee that farmers are treated equitably.\n  There is another issue I am very concerned about regarding the \nimplementation of agriculture disaster assistance programs by the USDA \nin California. Many small- and medium-sized farmers may not qualify for \nlow-interest loans because they may not be considered a family farm, \ngiven the working administrative definition regarding ``the substantial \ncontribution of labor.'' Many specialty crops, including strawberries, \nby there very nature require intensive labor. It is simply not fair to \nexclude them from disaster assistance.\n  We seem to have a disaster assistance policy that is not equitable \nwhere small- and medium-sized farmers are concerned. I believe that \njust as the Federal Government steps in to help small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses with disaster relief low-interest loans to help business men \nand women rebuild, so too it should step in to help families who have \nstaked out their business interests in agriculture. Why should a shop \nowner who sells fruits and vegetables be eligible for help from the \nSmall Business Committee and not the farmer who planted and harvested \nthose fruits and vegetables?\n  I urge the Department of Agriculture to ensure that family farm is \ninterpreted to take into account the cultural practices in the area \nwhere the damaged crop is being grown, as well as the common \nagricultural practices of the particular crop in question. I also urge \nthe Department of Agriculture to be as flexible as possible with the \nworking administrative definition regarding ``the substantial \ncontribution of labor'' to ensure that growers of crops that by their \nvery nature require intensive labor not be excluded them from disaster \nassistance.\n  I would like to reiterate that the issues I have raised today can be \nresolved easily if the Department of Agriculture were to carefully \nconsider and take into account the cultural practices in the area where \nthe damaged crop is being grown, as well as the common agricultural \npractices of the particular crop in question. On the issue of the \ndefinition of ``area'' I would like to add the following:\n  As I previously mentioned, we have the situation in California, \nespecially in the case of specialty crop growers, where farmers may not \nqualify for the Non-Insured Assistance Program, due to various \ncriteria. Note that of the 250 crops grown in California only about 10 \nare covered by crop insurance.\n  To qualify for the Non-Insured Assistance Program, there has to have \nbeen a loss in 30 percent of an ``area.'' The term ``area'' was not \ndefined in the legislation and the Department of Agriculture is \ncurrently looking into just how this will be implemented. There is talk \nof ``area'' being defined as a county, or as 250,000 acres or as 35,000 \nacres. We have crops in California where this definition would \nautomatically exclude many of our farmers. For example, in the counties \nof Monterey and Santa Cruz, about 45 percent of the strawberry crop for \nthe Nation is grown on a total of 10,000 acres. We must ensure that \n``area'' is defined equitably in a way that does not exclude California \nfarmers.\n  On the multicrop issue I would like to add the following:\n  To be fair to California farmers, the Department of Agriculture \nshould consider each harvest as a separate crop for the purposes of \neligibility for disaster assistance. It is my understanding that this \nwas the policy until 1994 and that the 1995 floods will be the first \ntest case of the new policy. Although it may appear that all crops are \ntreated equitably, this is not the case in reality, given the fact that \nmost program crops are not planted over and over again; they are always \nintermixed; that is, soybeans after corn, and so forth. Again, I \nstrongly urge the Department of Agriculture to take into account the \ncommon agricultural practices of farmers when looking at how crop loss \nis counted for eligibility to the Non-Insured Assistance Program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I understand and applaud the Senator's \nconcern for her constituents. However, I must also urge the Department \nto be cautious in approaching the definition of ``family farm.'' In \nyears past, the Farmers Home Administation made emergency loans to \nlarge farmers in California and other States that led to millions of \ndollars in individual indebtedness and enormous losses to taxpayers. On \nMarch 31, a hearing in the Agriculture Committee pointed up the \nsubstantial losses that we are still likely to incur on these loans and \nmade it clear that the Department has continued to write off debt owed \nby million-dollar borrowers, despite statements of outrage at past \nlending practices.\n  Given this unfortunate history, I believe the Department should move \nwith extreme caution and should act to avoid a repetition of past \nabuses. The Farmers Home Administration--now a part of the Consolidated \nFarm Services Agency--was intended to serve family \n[[Page S5571]] farmers, and the agency's experience in lending to farms \nof extremely large size is not a happy one.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5569-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO STATE SENATOR LES KLEVEN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last week South Dakota lost a great \npublic servant, State Senator Les Kleven. Les lost a brave and \ncourageous fight against cancer. His leadership and innovation will be \ngreatly missed.\n  A native of North Dakota, Les moved to Sturgis, SD, in 1962 to start \nKBHB radio station. Under his direction and leadership, KBHB grew to \nbecome one of the premier radio stations in western South Dakota. To \nthis day, it remains an important source of news, information, and \nentertainment to thousands of listeners in western South Dakota and \nnearby States. Over the years, Les often had his station broadcast live \nthe meetings I held in the Sturgis area on agricultural disasters, the \nfarm bill, and other important issues. I always appreciated his \nvaluable advice on issues important to the South Dakota broadcast and \nradio industry, as well as many other issues.\n  Les was a past president of the South Dakota Broadcasters \nAssociation. His love for South Dakota and service to the State did not \nbegin and end with radio. He served three terms in the South Dakota \nState House of Representatives in the 1970's. In 1992, Les was elected \nto the South Dakota State Senate. Of course, much as he did on the air \nwaves, he significantly affected South Dakota political currents. \nThroughout his career as a member of the South Dakota State \nLegislature, Les distinguished himself as a leader and fiscal \nconservative. His constituents and his colleagues knew him to be \nindependent, straightforward, and fair. Indeed, his contributions to \nthe State of South Dakota will long be remembered.\n  Most important, Les was a family man. Though all who knew Les held \nhim in high respect and admiration, none could be more proud of him \nthan his mother Alice, his lovely wife, Marguerite, and his two \nchildren, Andy and Jazal.\n  Les Kleven's honesty and integrity will be greatly missed. His \naccomplishments as a radio innovator, a State legislator, and a proud \nfather provide an inspiring example of the South Dakota spirit--a man \nwho gave to his profession, his community, his State, and to his \nfamily. Les was a family man, a pillar of the community, and a good \nfriend.\n  We will all miss him.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5571-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  The Armenian genocide marks an ignominious chapter in world history. \nIt reminds us how low unchecked hatred can drag the human spirit, \nunleashing cruelty and brutality. As we memorialize the Armenians who \ndied needlessly in the genocide, we must resolve never to forget how \nthey suffered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.\n  Nor can we forget how the Armenian people continue suffering today as \nthe country struggles to cope with the devastating impact of \nAzerbaijan's blockade. The blockade has put a strangle-hold on the \nArmenian people. Necessities--like food and heating oil--are in scarce \nsupply. Such shortages endanger the lives of many in Armenia, \nespecially during the harsh winter months.\n  While humanitarian assistance provided by the United States can help \nalleviate the suffering, it cannot lift the blockade. Only the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan can do that. That is why we must continue to \napply pressure. We should not provide United States foreign assistance \nto Azerbaijan as long as it maintains its blockade of Armenia. The \nblockade should be lifted without delay.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in commemorating \nthis anniversary. It is important that we remember the atrocities of \nthe past, and support efforts to allow the Armenian people an \nopportunity to live in peace in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5571-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 956, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 956) to establish legal standards and \n     procedures for product liability litigation, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as the Senate begins its debate of H.R. \n956 I wish, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation, to discuss the provisions of S. 565--the Product \nLiability Fairness Act--as reported by our committee. S. 565 as \nreported will be offered as a substitute for H.R. 956, therefore I \nshall discuss the Senate bill as we begin this debate. Earlier this \nmonth, the Commerce Committee conducted extensive hearings over 2 days \nand then voted 13 to 6 to report the legislation with an amendment on \nApril 6. S. 565 as reported is a fair and balanced bill.\n  Mr. President, as we begin I cannot help but point out: Here we are \nagain--product liability reform being debated by the Senate of the \nUnited States. Do not get me wrong. As chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, I am proud to bring S. 565 to the floor. So why do I say, \n``Here we are again''? It is not that I do not think this is an \nimportant issue. Far from it. This bill is vital. It is vital not just \nto America's businesses but also to our Nation's workers and consumers. \nIt also is vital to the victims of injuries caused by products.\n\n\n                              the history\n\n  It is just that we have come this far before. Indeed, since 1981, the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has held 23 \ndays of hearings on product liability reform. S. 565 marks the seventh \npiece of product liability reform legislation reported by the Commerce \nCommittee over that 15-year period. It is my fervent hope this time we \ncan achieve meaningful results.\n  Mr. President, I see no reason why we cannot. This year's bill is \nbalanced and reasoned. I consider it superior to legislation debated in \nthe last Congress in that it does not include a provision to disallow \npunitive damage awards in lawsuits for certain manufacturers receiving \npre-market certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  As my colleagues know, that section of last year's bill made this \nSenator extremely uncomfortable, so uncomfortable as to put me in the \nequally uncomfortable position of voting against cloture on legislation \naddressing other legal reforms I have supported and voted for many \ntimes over the years.\n  I personally have been involved in the product liability reform \nmovement since the early 1980's. I am proud of that. I was an original \ncosponsor of the Risk Retention Act that became law in 1981 and \nprovided for liability insurance pools--or risk retention groups--for \nbusinesses. Throughout the 1980's I cosponsored numerous uniform \nproduct liability bills with Senators Kasten, Danforth, and Gorton. The \nearly bills were supported strongly by the business community but \nlacked bipartisan support in Congress. I chaired Small Business \nCommittee field hearings in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, SD, on this \nissue in 1985.\n  I commend the efforts to Senators Gorton and Rockefeller with regard \nto S. 565. They are, indeed, tireless advocates for meaningful reform \nof America's product liability system. They demonstrated serious \nleadership in the committee on this issue and the bill reflects their \ncommitment.\n\n\n                             key provisions\n\n  I would now like to take a few minutes to briefly highlight some of \nthe key provisions of S. 565 as reported.\n\n\n                     alternative dispute resolution\n\n  This legislation provides either party in a product liability suit \nmay offer to participate in a voluntary, nonbinding state-approved \nalternative dispute resolution [ADR] procedure. If a defendant in a \nproducts suit is asked to participate in ADR and refuses and later a \n[[Page S5572]] judgement is entered for the plaintiff, the defendant \nwill be required to pay the claimants reasonable legal fees and costs \nif the court determines the defendant acted unreasonably or not in good \nfaith in refusing to participate in ADR. There is no penalty for \nclaimants who refuse to participate in ADR.\n  The bill's ADR provisions should be particularly helpful to those who \nexperience injuries the system considers minor--generally speaking, \ninjuries that amount to less than $100,000. These individuals often \nhave difficulty finding a lawyer to take their case on a contingency \nbasis due to the expense of preparing for trial. The section also puts \nclaimants squarely in control of whether to choose ADR procedures as a \nquicker and cheaper mechanism of handling their claim.\n\n\n                            punitive damages\n\n  Although you would not know it to listen to those on the other side \nof the issue, S. 565 does not remove a plaintiff's ability to recover \npunitive damages. It does, however, make their imposition more \nrational.\n  Punitive damages are not designed to compensate those who have been \ninjured. They are punishment, punishment of defendants found to have \ninjured others in a conscious manner. They are used much as fines are \nused in the criminal system. However, there are two big differences. \nFirst, unlike the criminal law system, there are virtually no standards \nfor when punitive damages may be awarded. Second, when they are \nawarded, there are no clear guidelines as to their amount.\n  Under this bill, punitive damages can be awarded if a plaintiff \nproves, by ``clear and convincing evidence'' that his or her injuries \nwere caused by the defendant's ``conscious, flagrant indifference to \nthe safety of others.'' Thus, S. 565 provides a meaningful standard for \nwhen punitives may be awarded.\n  In addition, the legislation before us allows punitive damages to be \nawarded in the amount of 3 times economic damages or $250,000, \nwhichever is greater. This provision provides a measure of certainty as \nto the amount of punishment a wrongdoer will suffer.\n\n\n                   statutes of limitations and repose\n\n  The bill also establishes a statute of limitations of 2\n   years from when the claimant discovered or reasonably should have \ndiscovered both the harm and its cause. This is another example of how \nthis legislation will benefit those injured by products. Under current \nlaw, some States establish the ``time of injury'' as the point at which \nthe time for bringing a claim begins to run. Often this is not a \nproblem. However, where the harm has a latency period or becomes \nmanifest only after repeated exposure to the product, the claimant may \nnot know immediately he or she has been harmed or the cause of that \nharm.\n\n  S. 565 will reduce the number of plaintiffs who, having otherwise \nmeritorious claims, would be denied justice solely on the basis of the \nstatute of limitations in the State in which they choose to file a \nclaim. The bill also establishes a statute of repose of 20 years for \ndurable goods used in the workplace. After such goods have been in the \nworkplace 20 years or longer, no suit may be filed for injuries related \nto their use unless the defendant makes an express warranty longer than \n20 years.\n  The need for a Federal statute of repose was presented well by one of \nmy fellow South Dakotans, Art Kroetch, chairman of Scotchman \nIndustries, Inc., a small manufacturer of machine tools located in \nPhilip, SD. Earlier this month, he told the committee how vital product \nliability reform is to the ability of American manufacturers to compete \nin the global marketplace. Art told me that under the current patchwork \nof liability laws, his company pays twice as much for product liability \ninsurance as it does for research and development.\n\n\n                      Joint and Several Liability\n\n  The doctrine of joint and several liability provides that any \ndefendant in a lawsuit may be required to pay all damages, regardless \nof the degree of fault or responsibility. What are the consequences? \nOne person is held responsible for the conduct of another. True \nwrongdoers are not always punished. Indeed, the average citizen \nultimately pays the claim--either through higher prices, loss of \nservice, or higher insurance premiums.\n  S. 565 would abolish joint liability for noneconomic damages such as \npain and suffering and emotional distress. Thus, each defendant would \nbe liable for noneconomic damages only in proportion to the defendant's \nshare of responsibility for the harm. This section goes a long way in \ncorrecting many of the inequities of the joint and several liability \ndoctrine and is essential to any tort reform effort. This section would \nprovide some relief. It is an issue in which I have been particularly \ninterested for many years.\n  In 1986, I attempted to strengthen proposed product liability \nlegislation, S. 2760, with an amendment regarding joint and several \nliability. My amendment, which passed the Commerce Committee, would \nhave curtailed the joint and several liability abuse that is all too \ncommon in our current system. The amendment abrogated joint and several \nliability for noneconomic damages in product liability cases. As such, \ndefendants would be held liable based only on their degree of fault or \nresponsibility, not the deepness of their pocket. Unfortunately, that \nbill was never enacted. I am proud the concept underlying my amendment \na decade ago is part of the bill before us today.\n\n\n                           alcohol and drugs\n\n  S. 565 also provides a defendant will have an absolute defense if the \nplaintiff was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or illegal \ndrugs and as a result of this influence was more than 50 percent \nresponsible for his or her own injuries.\n  I think across the country this is something that is much \nmisunderstood. We see the use of alcohol or drugs by a person operating \nequipment causing that person to be injured. In these cases, the \nmanufacturer can be held liable, which seems ridiculous. This bill will \ncorrect that and will put greater responsibility on everybody to avoid \nthose situations.\n\n\n                     biomaterials access assurance\n\n  During markup of S. 565, the committee accepted an amendment I \noffered. In addition to making technical corrections to the \nlegislation, my amendment added a new title to the bill. This title II \nis identical to S. 303, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995 \nintroduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman.\n  This title would allow suppliers of raw materials--so called \nbiomaterials--used to make medical implants, to obtain \ndismissal, without extensive discovery or other legal costs, in certain \ntort suits in which plaintiffs allege harm from a finished medical \nimplant. Specifically, it would allow raw material suppliers to be \ndismissed from lawsuits if the generic raw material used in the medical \ndevice met contract specifications, and if the biomaterials supplier \ncannot be classified as either a manufacturer or seller of the medical \nimplant.\n  During its hearings, the committee heard compelling testimony that \nwithout such changes in the law, the millions of Americans who depend \nupon a variety of implantable medical devices will be at risk. \nSuppliers of biomaterials have found the risks and costs of \nresponding to litigation related to medical implants far exceeds \npotential sales revenues, even though courts are not finding such \nsuppliers liable.\n  Indeed, three major suppliers of raw materials used in the \nmanufacture of implantable medical devices recently announced they will \nlimit, or cease altogether, their shipments of crucial raw materials to \ndevice manufacturers. All three companies have indicated these were \nrational and necessary business decisions given the current legal \nframework.\n\n\n                  product liability and small business\n\n  Mr. President, from my comments it should be apparent product \nliability reform is essential to the future health and success of \nAmerica's businesses. This is particularly true for our small \nbusinesses. According to a 1992 Small Business Administration [SBA] \nstudy, small firms may be affected more negatively than large firms by \nnonuniform product liability laws.\n  This is because small businesses do not enjoy economies of scale in \nproduction and litigation costs. In addition, they are less able to \nbargain with potential plaintiffs. Finally, their limited assets make \nadequate insurance much more difficult to obtain. The cost of product \nliability insurance in the United States is 15 times higher than that \nof similar insurance in Japan and 20 \n[[Page S5573]] times higher than in European countries.\n  America's small businesses need rationality and uniformity in the \nproduct liability system if they are to compete effectively in the \nglobal marketplace. As I explained previously, this point was at the \nheart of the testimony given by Art Kroetch of Scotchman Industries in \nPhillip, SD at the Commerce Committee hearings earlier this month.\n  It also was the point made to me by Jim Cope of Morgen Manufacturing \nin Yankton, SD. Jim calls product liability reform a jobs issue for our \nState. Morgen has had to lay off workers and has been unable to give \nraises to other employees because of losses due to product liability \nclaims, claims that never resulted in a verdict against his company. \nNevertheless, Morgen was forced to spend tens of thousands of dollars \ndefending itself. To Jim Cope, tort reform means more jobs for South \nDakota.\n\n\n                 product liability reform and consumers\n\n  Aside from the jobs issue, product liability reform also benefits \nconsumers in other ways. It would lower the cost of U.S. goods. The \ncurrent product liability system accounts for 20 percent of the cost of \na ladder, 50 percent of the cost of a football helmet, and up to 95 \npercent of the cost of some pharmaceuticals--up to 95 percent of the \ncost of some pharmaceuticals arises from product liability.\n  Reform of our product liability system also would foster competition \nand provide consumers with a greater selection of products from which \nto choose. Studies tell us 47 percent of U.S. companies have withdrawn \nproducts from the market and 39 percent have decided not to introduce \nproducts due to liability concerns. As a result, Americans depend on \nsingle companies to provide such vital needs as vaccines for polio, \nmeasles, rubella, rabies, diphtheria, and tetanus.\n  Finally, S. 565 would encourage safety improvements. The current \nsystem encourages companies to discontinue research. Many companies \nfear research to improve an existing product will be used against them \nin court to demonstrate they knew the product was not as safe as it \nmight be. Certainty in the system would reduce this counterproductive \neffect.\n  In addition, the bill would encourage wholesalers and retailers to \ndeal with responsible and reputable manufacturers. This, in turn, would \nlead to better products for consumers. Under our bill, product sellers \nwould be legally responsible for products manufactured by companies \nthat are insolvent or do not have assets in the United States. This \nshould increase the quality of the products found on the shelves of \nU.S. businesses.\n  Mr. President, I have quickly outlined five ways in which this bill \nwill benefit consumers. First, it will mean more jobs. Second, it will \nlower the cost of the goods they purchase. Third, it will mean a \ngreater selection of goods from which to choose. Fourth, it will \nencourage testing to make goods safer. Finally, it will help to \nmaintain and, in some cases, improve the quality of products available \nto consumers.\n                product liability reform and the injured\n\n  The present product liability system is unfair to those injured by \nproducts in at least two ways. The system is full of delay, and \ncompensation that eventually is received, often is inequitable.\n  Product liability suits take a very long time to process. A General \nAccounting Office study found, on average, that product liability cases \ntook 2\\1/2\\ years to move from filing to trial court verdict. Most \nproduct liability cases are settled before trial, but even these cases \nsuffer from delay. One plaintiff's attorney explained that ``most \nsettlement negotiations get serious only a week or so before trial is \nscheduled to begin.''\n  Delay can result in undercompensation of victims. Many injury victims \nare forced to settle their claims for less than their full losses so \nthey can obtain compensation more quickly. These individuals often are \nforced into this decision because of inadequate resources to pay for \ntheir medical and rehabilitation expenses.\n  Another way in which the current system inequitably compensates \nvictims concerns proportionality. Numerous studies have found the tort \nsystem grossly overpays people with small losses, while underpaying \npeople with the most serious losses.\n  Mr. President, this provides a brief overview of S. 565 and the \nvariety of ways in which it will help business--both large and small--\nconsumers, and those injured by products. In short, product liability \nmeans jobs for American workers. It means innovative products for \nAmerican consumers. It means swifter and more equitable compensation \nfor victims. It means international competitiveness for American \ncompanies.\n  This is why I strongly support S. 565. It is good for small business. \nIt is good for their workers. It is good for consumers. It is good for \nthose injured by products. In other words, Mr. President, it is good \nfor America.\n  I might add, I have been in my State these past days and many people \nhave come up to me saying we need to end frivolous lawsuits. That is a \nterm that is understandable. We need to preserve people's right to sue \nwhen something is really wrong. But everybody is suing everybody. It is \na sort of lottery out there. The average person is beginning to \nunderstand this increases the costs of goods and services. We do want \nto preserve people's rights to sue. Certainly when there has been a \nwrong done, there should be punishment, but we want to try to improve \nour legal system, and this bill is a step in that direction.\n  I want to commend Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller and others, \nwho have worked so long and hard on this. We are very blessed to have \ntheir leadership. I stand in strong support of S. 565.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the issue of product liability reform \nis well known to many Senators. I look forward to the debate we begin \ntoday because I believe that the bill that we will be considering, S. \n565, the Product Liability Fairness Act, builds upon past deliberations \nof this body to achieve reform in the moderate, bipartisan manner that \nhas characterized this effort in recent years.\n  Let me pause a moment to thank my colleague and friend, Senator Slade \nGorton, for all his efforts and counsel in crafting the bill that we \nhave introduced. In addition, Senator Lieberman, Senator Dodd, Senator \nHatch,  and Senator McConnell have played critical roles in writing \nthis legislation and bringing us to the point of floor deliberation.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has considered the topic of product \nliability reform for over 14 years, and six times the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee has reported bills favorably to \nthe floor. Most recently, the committee reported out the current bill, \nS. 565, by a vote of 13 to 6 on April 6.\n  We have persisted in our efforts to reform the laws governing product \nliability because we believe that the current system is broken and that \nwe can make changes that will benefit both consumers and makers of \nproducts. We have tried, and I think succeeded, in achieving balance in \nour effort to streamline the law in this area. We have simultaneously \nreduced costs and delays for both plaintiffs and defendants.\n  In 1985, when I first came to the Senate and joined the Commerce \nCommittee, I voted against a product liability reform measure. The \ncommittee vote was tied at that time, and I felt strongly that the \nversion of the bill then being considered aided manufacturers at the \nexpense of safe products for American consumers.\n  Since then, the product liability effort has changed 180 degrees. The \nlegislation has evolved into the even-handed, moderate approach we are \nconsidering today. Senator Gorton and I have worked diligently over \nrecent months to hone the bill we are looking at today to ensure that \nit strikes the right balance between the interests of both consumers \nand business. Adjustments were made to reflect substantive and other \nconcerns which we concluded were obstacles to the enactment of this \nbill. We believe we have significantly improved the legislation from \nearlier drafts and have been responsive to the issues which prevented \nearlier enactment of this legislation.\n  Let me draw my colleagues' attention to the substantive changes made \nin this year's bill compared with the version introduced in the last \nCongress. The most significant change addresses concerns that have been \nraised about excessive punitive damages-- \n[[Page S5574]] damages that are awarded to punish and deter wrongdoing. \nThis year's bill establishes a standard for awarding punitive damages \nthat is essentially unchanged from last year's bill. We have, however, \nadded a provision that requires punitive damages to be awarded in \nproportion to the harm caused at a ratio of three times a claimant's \neconomic loss or $250,000, whichever is greater. Our rationale for this \nratio is the goal of bringing to punitive damages some relationship \nbetween the size of the harm and the punishment, a goal supported by \nthe American Bar Association, the American College of Trial Lawyers, \nthe American Law Institute, and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Also concerning punitive damages, we eliminated the Government \nstandards defenses in last year's bill, referred to as the FDA and FAA \ndefenses, which would have prevented punitive damages for instances in \nwhich certain classes of products, such as drugs, medical devices, or \ncertain types of aircraft had been certified by the Federal Government \nas safe. While I remain supportive of the concept of a Government \nstandards defense, a number of Senators expressed reservation during \nlast year's debate about this provision, and we have accommodated those \nconcerns by removing the provision.\n  Another change in this year's legislation concerns the statute of \nrepose, which we have slightly modified to include a category of \nproducts known as durable goods used in the workplace. Last year's bill \nwas restricted to workplace capital goods, a slightly narrower \ncategory. Workplace durable goods are defined as having an economic \nlife span of 3 years or greater or being depreciable under the Tax \nCode. The workplace distinction, identical to last year's bill, \npreserves the intent of increasing incentives for employers to maintain \nthe safety of equipment used in a place of employment, rather than \nshifting that responsibility off to a manufacturer even after the \nuseful life of the product in question has expired. In addition, we \nhave moved the statute of repose period to 20 years from 25 years in \nlast year's bill, which is still longer than any State statute of \nrepose, the longest of which is 15 years.\n  The third significant change made prior to introduction of this \nyear's bill concerns the addition of a provision that had been part of \nlast year's House companion bill that requires a reduction of a \nclaimant's award due to unforeseeable misuse or alteration of the \nproduct. For example, if someone purchases a hair dryer that has \nattached to it a large warning label stating, ``Do not use in the \nbathtub,'' and the purchaser immediately uses the hair dryer in the \nbathtub with adverse consequences, it does not make sense to hold the \nmanufacturer liable for such misuse, and this provision would prevent \nthat.\n  In addition to the changes made prior to introduction, several \nsubstantive changes were made in the Commerce Committee markup of the \nbill. First, we incorporated a bill, S. 303, the Biomaterials Access \nAssurance Act, introduced by Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain, as \ntitle II of our committee-reported product liability bill. This title \nof the bill is designed to ensure that needed raw materials are \navailable to the manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the \nliability for firms that supply biomaterials. The title only limits \nliability for suppliers who have done nothing wrong; the ability of \nconsumers to recover from negligent device manufacturers is preserved.\n  We made several other substantive changes in the committee markup. We \nmodified our product seller provision to extend protection to blameless \nrental and leasing companies. This will address the fact that in 11 \nStates car rental companies can be forced to pay for damage caused by \npeople who rent their cars, even though the car rental companies did \nnothing wrong. We made a change to the statute of repose that will \nensure that manufacturers keep their promises by enabling injured \nworkers to sue for damage caused by products over 20 years old if the \nmanufacturers guaranteed their products' safety for a longer period.\n  Finally, we modified our alternative dispute resolution provision, \nwhich gives States an incentive to create proplaintiff, voluntary, \nnonbinding arbitration mechanisms. This provision contains a penalty \nfor defendants who ``unreasonably refuse'' to participate in the \narbitration, and a criticism was raised during hearings on the bill \nthat greater specificity was needed for the definition of \n``unreasonable refusal,'' so a set of factors was added to address that \nconcern.\n  Mr. President, I will have a lot more to say about the substance of \nthe bill as debate unfolds, but I know that other Senators wish to \nspeak, so I would like to keep my remarks brief. Let me conclude by \nrestating the reasons that we must pass national product liability \nreform this year.\n  Under our current system, injured consumers often find it impossible \nto get a just and prompt resolution, and just as frequently, blameless \nmanufacturers are forced to spend thousands of dollars on baseless \nlawsuits. The system frequently allows negligent companies to avoid \npenalties and even rewards undeserving plaintiffs.\n  Product liability law should deter wasteful suits and discipline \nculpable practices but not foster hours of waste and endless \nlitigation.\n  The adverse effect of having a hodge-podge of rules is severe for \neveryone. Injured persons and those who make products alike face a 55-\nunit roulette wheel when it comes to determining rights and \nresponsibilities. The results hurt everyone. Injured persons have \ntestified that they may be unable to obtain needed medical devices for \ntheir continued health and well-being. Manufacturers have indicated \nthat good and useful products are not placed on the market. The \nBrookings Institution has documented many instances where safety \nimprovements were not made because of fear about uncertainties in our \nlegal system. Included in their discussion were built-in child seats \nand air bags.\n  As I have studied this complex area, I have found that incentives for \npreventing accidents are often not in the right place. In formulating \nour bill, we have striven to place incentives on the person who can \nbest prevent an injury. This is a matter that has not been given \nadequate attention during past debates, but given the opportunity to \ncarefully study our bill, Senators will see that care and thought has \nbeen invested to assure that no wrongdoer goes unpunished and that \npositive prosafety behavior is encouraged.\n  For all of these reasons, I look forward to our debate, and I welcome \nthe criticisms, insights, and suggestions for improvements that I'm \nsure our colleagues will contribute during this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n                           Amendment No. 596\n\n  (Purpose: Substitute reported committee language of S. 565 for H.R. \n                                  956)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 596.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what I have sent to the desk to be treated \nas the matter before the Senate is the text of S. 565 as it was passed \nby the Senate Commerce Committee just over 2 weeks ago. H.R. 956 is, of \ncourse, the text of the bill which was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I hope that we will debate the bill and the report that was passed by \nthe Commerce Committee and will use that as our text. It is for that \nreason that I have offered this substitute.\n  Mr. President, the debate over product liability legislation, which \nbegins here this afternoon, is both important and controversial.\n  It has both of those qualities because it deals with two elements of \nour life as Americans that are vitally important to everyone. The first \nof those qualities is the openness of our courts for the redress of \ngrievances to individuals or to groups of individuals by other \nindividuals, groups of individuals, or corporations doing business in \nthe United States. That is a value and a set of rights cherished, of \ncourse, by all Americans.\n  [[Page S5575]] The other good--sometimes a conflicting one--is the \ndesire of the American people for a growing and a prosperous society, \nfor the development and marketing of new goods and services, and for \nthe creation of economic opportunity to our young people, indeed beyond \nour young people, to all Americans.\n  At its base, of course, the economic prosperity and viability of our \ncountry. So, we here in the two Houses of the Congress of the United \nStates are constantly faced with the necessity, in a dynamic economy \nand a dynamic society, of balancing these goals with other goals in our \nsociety. And it is the restoration of that balance, a balance often \ndistorted to one side of the equation, which is the goal both of H.R. \n956, a bill on the subject that has already passed the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and S. 565, which now is before this body.\n  This is far from the first occasion on which we have debated product \nliability, either on a broad scale or a narrow scale, in the U.S. \nSenate. At least since 1982, bills on this subject have been before the \nCommerce Committee of this body and frequently before the Senate \nitself. Already in the course of this debate, however, at its outset, \nwe have gone farther down the road toward reform than in any Congress \nsince the early 1980's. On some occasions, bills have been recommended \nby the Commerce Committee but never taken up on this floor. On at least \ntwo occasions, including the last Congress, bills have been reported \nfavorably by the Commerce Committee. The following motions to proceed \nto the debate, however, were debated and in fact debated successfully, \nunder the guise of a quasi-filibuster, and cloture was not attained on \nthe motion to proceed. So never have we been in a position to debate \nthe merits of product liability reform itself or, indeed, to offer \namendments to those bills which have been reported by the Senate \nCommerce Committee.\n  In the last Congress, my friend and colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller, and I had a bill not dissimilar from this reported \nfrom the Commerce Committee by a not dissimilar vote and debated here \non the floor for the better part of a week. Before, on two occasions, \ncloture on the motion to proceed was defeated in spite of having \nreceived a substantial majority of the votes of the Members of the \nSenate. So I know I speak both for the primary sponsor of the bill, the \nSenator from West Virginia, as well as for myself, in expressing our \ngratification at the fact that, for the first time in the career of \neither one of us, we are literally discussing a bill on this subject, \nand of this importance.\n  The last Congress, however, did succeed in passing a bill which \nultimately became law on one narrow element of product liability. The \nlast Congress created a 1-year statute of repose with respect to \nproduct liability actions concerning small private aircraft. And I \nsubmit that Members of this body should carefully consider the debate \non that proposal, which also lasted over the period of several \nCongresses, the arguments made on either side, and the results of the \npassage into law of that aircraft statute of repose.\n  It had been the claim of small aircraft manufacturers in the United \nStates that their business had effectively been destroyed by product \nliability litigation. Several famous manufacturers of small aircraft \nhad literally gone out of business. Others were no longer engaged in \nthe manufacture of such aircraft. And those who stayed in the business \nhad their business very significantly reduced, to the point at which, \nif my memory serves me correctly, the production of such aircraft in \nthe United States over a 20- or 30-year period had declined by close to \n90 percent. The industry, in other words, was almost dead in this \ncountry.\n  The opponents of the statute of repose argued, among other things, \nthat litigation had nothing to do with that loss of business. The \nproponents, including the manufacturers, argued that even this \nrelatively minor relief would result in a substantial recovery of that \nbusiness. Ultimately, after several Congresses, less than 2 years ago \nsuch legislation passed and was signed into law, and already that \nrecovery has begun. Already some of those manufacturers have opened up \nlines of production, have begun new assembly lines and are back in \nbusiness.\n  Has litigation against negligence in the manufacture of private \naircraft been terminated by that bill? Of course not. All that Congress \npassed was a simple statute of repose of 18 years. Already, however, we \nhave seen the creation of jobs, the beginning of the renaissance of an \nindustry, and the return of American companies manufacturing in America \nto a business out of which they had been almost totally driven. Yet, as \nMembers of this body will learn during the course of debate on this \nlegislation, there are many States with no statutes of repose at all. \nFor other products or equipment, we still face the actuality and the \npossibility of product liability litigation involving equipment and \nmanufactured items manufactured and originally sold in the 19th \ncentury, over 100 years ago.\n  So in this case we are attempting, on a broader basis, to restore a \nbalance between the fundamental and undoubted right of people to sue \nwhen they have been injured by faulty products and the protection of \nmanufacturers and sellers against unwarranted litigation. We will show \nhow this imbalance has caused perfectly good products had to be \nwithdrawn from the market and caused manufacturers to go out of \nlegitimate and important businesses, businesses important to the people \nof the United States. In turn, this has discouraged research into many \nimportant areas and has discouraged the development of products \nresulting from that research.\n  So, Mr. President, when Members of this body listen to the kind of \ndoomsday scenarios, threats about the end of justice in our legal \nsystem, they may wish to reflect on similar arguments made by many \nMembers of this body less than 2 years ago with respect to the aviation \nindustry, and look at the actual results of such legislation.\n  I believe that there is a carefully balanced proposal equalizing the \nright to sue with the encouragement of the American economy and a right \nto be free from frivolous suits and huge legal bills in connection with \nmatters that do not arise out of any degree of negligence, or which are \novercompensated.\n  So, Mr. President, I am especially pleased to support the Product \nLiability Fairness Act of 1995. Legislation carefully crafted to \nreflect a bipartisan spirit that takes a moderate and sensible approach \nin reforming the product liability system of United States.\n  What are our goals? Our goals are a system that is fair and \nefficient; a system that is, to the greatest possible extent, yields \npredictable results; one that awards damages both proportional to the \nharm suffered as a result of negligence and in a timely manner, and one \nwhich reduces the overwhelmingly wasteful transaction costs associated \nwith the present product liability system.\n  Finally, this is a bill which builds on the genius of those who wrote \nthe Constitution of the United States, those who placed plenary \nauthority in the hands of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. No \noccupation can be more intimately involved with interstate commerce \nthan the system by which liability is adjudged with respect to the \nimpact of products manufactured, sold and utilized in every one of the \n50 States of the United States.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair).\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there are in fact few valid arguments \nagainst a greater degree of uniformity and a greater degree of \npredictability with respect to impacts of such transactions. Estimates \nof total court costs of litigation and assorted transactional costs \nrange from $80 to $117 billion a year to manufacturers and sellers in \nthis country. It goes without saying that these costs are immediately \nforced back onto consumers through higher prices for products which \nAmericans use every day.\n  The current product liability system accounts for approximately 20 \npercent of the cost of the simple ladder and one-half of the cost of a \nfootball helmet. Injured parties receive less than half of the money \nspent in product liability litigation. More than half goes to the \nlawyers, and those who work with them in prosecuting and defending that \nlitigation. Nearly 90 percent of all manufacturers and many retailers \nand wholesalers in the United States can expect to become a defendant \nin a product liability case at least once. The cost of product \nliability insurance is 15 times greater in the United States \n[[Page S5576]] than it is in Japan, and 20 times greater here in the \nUnited States than it is in Europe.\n  As I have already said, manufacturers can still be sued today for \nproducts manufactured in the 1800's, simply because the present \npotential defendant purchased, at some time or another, the company \nthat was engaged in manufacturing in that century.\n  As I have just pointed out, the product liability system in the \nUnited States is the world's most costly. The editors of a book \nentitled ``The Liability Maze'' published by the Brookings Institute in \n1991 notes:\n\n       Regardless of the trends in tort verdicts, most studies in \n     this area have concluded that, after adjusting for inflation \n     and population, liability costs have risen dramatically in \n     the last thirty years, and most especially in the last \n     decade.\n\n  Mr. President, the cost of litigation, court proceedings, attorney \nfees, and expert fees--in other words, transaction costs associated \nwith the current system--are absolutely outrageous. A 1992 study \nindicates that for every $10 paid to claimants by insurance companies \nfor product liability cases, another $7 is paid for lawyers and other \ndefense costs. That is defense costs only. If the contingent fee of \nplaintiff's attorneys is factored in, lawyers' fees account for more \nthan 60 percent of the funds expended on product liability cases.\n  Obviously, liability insurance costs reflect these increased \ntransaction costs, and insurance rates rise accordingly. Over the past \n40 years, general liability insurance costs have increased at more than \nfour times the rate of growth of the national economy. One small \nmanufacturer in my own State of Washington, Connelly Water Skis, Ltd. \npays $345,000 a year for liability insurance, even though that company \nhas never lost a product liability case.\n  Paradoxically, the victims of this system are very often the \nclaimants, the plaintiffs themselves, who suffer by the actual \nnegligence of a product manufacturer, and frequently are unable to \nafford to undertake the high cost of legal fees over an extended period \nof time. Frequently, they are forced into settlements that are \ninadequate because they lack resources to pay for their immediate \nneeds, their medical and rehabilitation expenses, their actual out-of-\npocket costs.\n  In 1989, a General Accounting Office study found that on average, \ncases take 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years to be resolved, and even longer when there \nis an appeal. One case studied by the GAO took 9\\1/2\\ years to move \nthrough our court system. In an insurance industry study, it was found \nthat it took 5 years to pay claims with an average dollar lost and that \n``larger claims tended to take much longer to close than smaller \nclaims.''\n  An early insurance offices product liability study found that injured \nplaintiffs with losses of between $1 and $1,000 received on average 859 \npercent of their actual losses, while those with losses over $1 million \nreceived on average 15 percent of their losses, even before attorneys \nfees were paid.\n  This is to be contrasted with the results of those lawsuits we often \nsee in the newspapers, or hear about on television, in which a \nparticular plaintiff has received a bonanza, a lottery style set of \nwinnings.\n  In today's system, consumers, manufacturers, and product sellers are \ntrapped in a product liability litigation system that is essentially a \nlottery. Identical cases in two different States often produce \nstrikingly different results. And, of course, here in the United States \nwe have 51 separate product liability systems--in 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, while the European Economic Community, Australia, \nand Japan each have adopted a uniform, predictable product liability \nstatute. In one of the many hearings held on this issue over the years, \nUniversity of Virginia law professor Jeffrey O'Connell explained, and I \nquote him:\n\n       If you are badly injured in our society by a product and \n     you go to the highly skilled lawyer, in all honesty the \n     lawyer cannot tell you what you will be paid, when you will \n     be paid or, indeed, if you will be paid.\n\n  Three distinguished judges: Chief justice, Richard Neely, of the \nsupreme court of West Virginia; Federal district court judge, Warren \nEginton, author of the ``Product Liability Journal;'' and New Jersey \nCourt of Appeals judge, William Dreier, author of the ``Product \nLiability Journal of New Jersey,'' have presented congressional \ntestimony attesting to the need for uniformity. While they state that \nthere will naturally be different interpretations of any law, \nconflicting interpretations will obviously be fewer with a single law \nthan with 51 different ones.\n  Uncertainty in the present system is a reason for change. Plaintiffs, \nthose injured by faulty products, need quicker, more certain recovery--\nrecovery that fully compensates them for their genuine losses. \nDefendants, those who produced the products, need greater certainty as \nto the scope of their liability.\n  Mr. President, under the current system, consumers are required to \npay increased and unnecessarily high prices on necessary goods. Here \nagain the excessive costs of an out-of-control tort system fall on the \nshoulders of consumers through increased prices.\n  An example. Lederle Labs, the lone maker of diphtheria, pertussis, \nand tetanus vaccine, raised its dose from $2.80 to $11.40 simply to \ncover the costs of lawsuits. According to Prof. George Priest of Yale \nLaw School in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee this \nmonth, excessive punitive damages awards have increased the general \nprice level for products and services provided in the United States \neconomy, harming consumers--and low income consumers most of all.\n  In addition to higher prices, Americans suffer from the current \nsystem because of the lack of choice. At the present time, for example, \nonly one company is willing to supply vaccines for polio, measles, \nmumps, rubella, rabies, and DPT. In 1984, two of the three companies \nmanufacturing the DPT vaccine decided to stop production because of \nproduct liability costs. Can it seriously be asserted that we should \nabandon that vaccine?\n  Later that same year, the Centers for Disease Control recommended \nthat doctors stop vaccinating children over the age of 1 in order to \nconserve limited supplies of the DPT vaccines for the most vulnerable \ninfants.\n  Next, product development is hindered in many ways by the existing \nsystem. The unpredictability of the product liability system \ndiscourages the development of innovative products and cutting edge \ntechnology. Innovation is frequently stifled because scientific \nresearch essential for advanced product development is foregone or \nabandoned, due to the excessive costs of product liability.\n  In 1984, a closed claims study by the ISO found that United States \nindustries spent more on product liability defense costs than on buying \nequipment to boost productivity.\n  In an American Medical Association report titled ``The Impact of \nProduct Liability on the Development of New Medical Technologies,'' we \nread, and I quote:\n\n       Innovative new products are not being developed or are \n     being withheld from the market because of liability concerns \n     or inability to obtain adequate insurance. Certain older \n     technologies have been removed from the market, not because \n     of sound scientific evidence indicating a lack of safety or \n     efficiency, but because the product liability suits have \n     exposed the manufacturers to unacceptable financial risks.\n       Rawlings Sporting Goods, Mr. President, a leading \n     manufacturer of competitive football equipment for more than \n     80 years, announced in 1988 that it would no longer \n     manufacture, distribute or sell football helmets. Joining \n     Spalding, McGregor, Medalist, Hutch, and others who have \n     stopped manufacturing helmets, Rawlings was the 18th company \n     in as many years to give up the football helmet business \n     because of increasing liability exposure. Two manufacturers \n     out of the 20 that existed in 1975 remain in the helmet \n     business today.\n\n  A recent article in Science magazine reported that a careful \nexamination of the current state of research to develop an AIDS \nvaccine, and I quote, ``Shows that liability concerns have had negative \neffects.'' It points out that Genentech, Inc., halted its AIDS vaccine \nresearch after the California Legislature failed to enact State tort \nreform. Only after a favorable ruling did that company resume its \nresearch.\n  And consider--perhaps because of its history this is the most \nimportant quotation of all--the comment by Jonas Salk, inventor of \npolio vaccine:\n\n       [[Page S5577]] If I develop an AIDS vaccine, I don't \n     believe a U.S. manufacturer will market it because of the \n     current punitive damage system.\n\n  Think of where we would be had we had the present system when Dr. \nSalk developed the polio vaccine. Would it not have been marketed? \nWould we still be faced with that scourge?\n  Not only does the present system hurt medical innovation, it also \ninhibits small companies from producing everyday goods.\n  Again, in my own State, for example, Washington Auto Carriage of \nSpokane distributes various kinds of truck equipment throughout the \nUnited States. Here is what its owner, Cliff King, says. And I quote \nhim:\n\n       We have been forced out of selling some kinds of truck \n     equipment because of the exorbitant insurance premiums \n     required to be in the market. As a result, this type of \n     equipment tends to be distributed only by a few very large \n     distributors around the country, who can afford to spread the \n     cost over a very large base of sales. Ultimately, there is \n     much less competition in those markets.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, as tough as the present system is on \nlarge corporations, it is even tougher on small companies--companies \nwho can be driven out of business by a single lawsuit.\n  Mr. President, I spoke a few moments ago about the undoubted \ninterstate nature of our product manufacturing and distribution system \nand the overwhelming justification for a greater degree of uniformity \nthan we have today, and for the obvious constitutional basis in the \ncommerce clause for such legislation.\n  One would expect, however, that many of those connected with State \ngovernment would oppose any further limitation of their control over \ntheir tort systems. Yet, the representatives of the top organization of \nState elected officials, the National Governors Association, recognizes \nboth the need for product liability reform and the necessity of such \nreform at the Federal level. A resolution adopted by the National \nGovernors Association last January summarizes both the need and the \nsupport of State Governors for change in the product liability system \nhere by the Congress of the United States. In part, the resolution \nadopted by the NGA reads:\n\n       The National Governors Association recognizes that the \n     current patchwork of U.S. product liability laws is too \n     costly, time-consuming, unpredictable and counterproductive, \n     resulting in severely adverse effects on American consumers, \n     workers, competitiveness, innovation, and commerce.\n       The issues of product liability reform has increasingly \n     pointed to Federal action as a way to alleviate the problems \n     faced by small and large businesses with regard to \n     inconsistent State product liability laws. This lack of \n     uniformity and predictability makes it impossible for product \n     manufacturers to accurately assess their own risks, leading \n     to the discontinuation of necessary product lines, reluctance \n     to introduce product improvements and a dampening of product \n     research and development. American small businesses are \n     particularly vulnerable to disparate product liability laws. \n     For them, liability insurance coverage has become \n     increasingly expensive, difficult to obtain, or simply \n     unavailable. Further, the system causes inflated prices for \n     consumer goods and adversely affects the international \n     competitiveness of the United States.\n       Clearly, a national product liability code would greatly \n     enhance the effectiveness of interstate commerce. The \n     Governors urge Congress to adopt a Federal uniform product \n     liability code.\n\n  It should be noted at this point, Mr. President, that this resolution \nreflects the position that former-Arkansas Governor, William Clinton, \nsupported during his many terms as Governor.\n  Mr. President, I believe it appropriate, briefly at this point, to \noutline for Members the chief reform features of this proposal. While \nit makes more uniform laws related to product liability in many fields, \nit continues to defer to the States in many other areas. As such, it \nretains a balance between Federal and State concerns over this branch \nof interstate commerce. It does so, however, in a thoughtful and sober \nfashion by eliminating those elements of the present system that cause \nthe greatest degree of uncertainty and have the most adverse impacts on \ninterstate commerce, on productivity, on the creation of jobs, and on \nthe competitiveness of American business.\n  First, Mr. President, we reform the almost uniform system of joint \nand several liability. In most States, when there are multiple \ndefendants in a product liability action, a deep-pocket theory applies. \nUnder the joint and several liability rule, any defendant who has \ncontributed in any way, to an injury can be held responsible for the \nentire amount of the damage award. Such a deep-pocket rule encourages \nplaintiffs and their lawyers to target the wealthiest defendant in each \ncase, even if that defendant can be, and has been found, by the jury to \nbe only minimally at fault.\n  S. 565 provides for only several liability and not for joint \nliability on noneconomic damages. This means that each defendant is \nliable only for his, hers or its portion by reason of its proportion of \nthe fault in causing the injury. This is currently the law in the State \nof California.\n  It does, however, apply only to noneconomic damages, those that \ninclude pain and suffering and emotional distress. Under this bill, \nStates will be permitted to retain joint liability, if they wish to do \nso, for economic damages--medical costs, lost wages, and so forth--so \nthat an injured plaintiff can be assured of recovering fully, no matter \nwho the source of that recovery, for those actual out-of-pocket damages \nthemselves.\n  Pain and suffering and other noneconomic losses under this bill will \nbe tied to the concepts of both fault, and also responsibility.\n  Mr. President, it is unfair and highly unproductive to make \ndefendants pay for damages of a nature that are literally beyond their \ncontrol or beyond their fault. In California, it has been found, under \nthis new law, that juries are much more likely to apportion liability \nfairly according to each defendant's fault.\n  Mr. President, the particular kind of damages about which we read \nmost frequently are punitive damages. Punitive damages, of course, are \ndamages awarded to punish the defendant, rather than to compensate the \nvictim either for the victim's economic or noneconomic emotional \ndamages. As such, they are a troubling concept in our system of law.\n  Generally speaking, we punish for criminal activities through the \nCriminal Code, a code which provides a multitude of protection for \nthose accused under it--proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a right \nagainst self-incrimination, limited sentences designed to fit the \ncrime.\n None of these concepts, however, applies to the imposition of punitive \ndamages. A handful of States, my own included, do not generally permit \npunitive damages in civil litigation at all. And, Mr. President, there \nis nothing to indicate that justice is denied in those States, that \nrecoveries on the part of the injured plaintiffs are inadequate, or \nthat companies operate in a less safe and responsible fashion.\n\n  I can express a personal preference, dating from the time at which I \nwas admitted to the bar for such a system, for the use of nonpunitive \ndamages only, in civil litigation. But because the vast majority of the \nStates utilize such a system, this bill continues to permit it in \nStates that allow it at the present time, but with a number of \nlimitations.\n  Under this law, claimants would be required to provide, by clear and \nconvincing evidence proof, that a defendant engaged in egregious \nmisconduct and there would be a degree of proportionality in punitive \ndamages--a cap of $250,000, or three times the economic damages \nawarded, whichever is greater. A separate jury consideration of \npunitive damages would also be required from the determination of the \njury for compensatory damages.\n  Reforms of this nature are supported by mainstream academic groups in \nthe American Bar Association and the American College of Trial Lawyers. \nMore recently, these reforms were recommended in a 5-year report \nstudied by scholars of the prestigious American Law Institute.\n  Third, this bill deals in general terms with exactly the subject of \nlast year's aviation product liability bill, a statute of repose. Under \nthe current product liability system, manufacturers are liable for \ninjuries caused by products without regard to the age of these \nproducts, even when the equipment has been rebuilt, altered, or used \nimproperly. Mr. President, it is clearly unreasonable to hold a \nmanufacturer liable for a product that may have been made 30 or more \nyears ago, particularly when it has no control over the use or \nmaintenance of that product.\n  [[Page S5578]] S. 565 adopts a 20-year statute of repose for \nworkplace durable goods, or less if State law provides a lower statute \nof repose. By this provision, we inject a degree of predictability in a \nsystem, which literally at the present time calls for endless \nliability.\n  One example, Mr. President. Since 1830, the firm of Davis & Ferber \nwas one of the largest textile machinery manufacturers in the world. \nRecently, that company was required to defend itself against a claim \ninvolving a machine that left its plant in 1895 and had been modified \nagain and again by different owners for 88 years. In 1982, Davis & \nFerber was forced out of business because of the high cost of \nsettlement in this case.\n  There is one other element of this bill notable for this opening \ndebate, and that element arises out of the fact that at the present \ntime, consumers can sue, not only the manufacturer of an alleged faulty \nproduct, but also the retailer who sold it or the firm that rented or \nleased the product. In over 95 percent of all such actions, the \nmanufacturer ultimately pays any judgment that is awarded, but the web \nof litigation adds to spiraling unnecessarily legal costs to the \nwholesaler or the retailer that are ultimately paid for by the \nconsumer.\n  Under S. 565, product sellers, as well as those who engage in the \nleasing and renting of products, will be liable for their own \nnegligence or failure to comply with an expressed warranty but not for \nthe negligence of the manufacturer. These provisions will reduce \nlitigation among retailers, wholesalers, distributors, lessors, renters \nand manufacturers saving legal costs that, at the present time, are \npassed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. Unless they are \ndirectly responsible for product failure due to negligence or \nmisrepresentation, a seller, lessor, or renter shall not be held liable \nfor injuries caused by a product. If the manufacturer is negligent, \nthat manufacturer should be liable.\n  Mr. President, in summary, this proposal is aimed at a very real \nchallenge and a very real problem in our society today. It is aimed at \nspiraling costs of litigation, far more often than not, on the part of \nmanufacturers and sellers in successful litigation, but costly and \nrisky nevertheless.\n  It is aimed at limiting recovery to those who are responsible by \ntheir own negligence for injury to a far greater extent than is the \ncase today; to providing an end to that responsibility after two \ndecades, in the case of certain manufactured equipment; to limiting the \narbitrary nature of punitive damages, as the Congress has been invited \nto do by the Supreme Court of the United States and fundamentally to \nseeing to it that a greater share of the recovery in litigation of this \nsort gets to the injured party and less to transactional costs, the \npresent division of which is a disgrace.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the beginning, I am gratified that for \nthe first time in a debate, which has lasted in the Congress of the \nUnited States for almost two decades, we are actually discussing the \nmerits of this kind of legislation. I look forward to a spirited and \ncontested debate, but I also look forward to a conclusion, which \ncreates a greater degree of balance and restores a degree of fairness, \ncompetitiveness and common sense to American industry and to its \nemployees.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the words of our fearless leader, \nPresident Ronald Wilson Reagan, ``Here we go again.''\n  As we begin the proceedings, Mr. President, the issue is whether the \nMembers of this body will agree to have an open and full debate on this \nlegislation.\n  Each time this legislation has been brought before the Senate, the \nproponents have offered up one anecdote after another to justify the \nbill. We have attempted to ensure that, at a minimum, this bill is \nfully examined and debated.\n  I am particularly concerned about the manner in which the current \nbill has been rushed through without much time for review. The \nlegislation was introduced on March 15. A couple of weeks later, the \nCommerce Committee held 2 days of hearings and then a markup a day and \na half later. The substitute offered at markup--which was not received \nuntil 6 p.m. The preceding evening--contained a number of changes and \namendments. None of the changes was ever considered by the committee, \nat the hearings or before the markup. Now, less than a week after the \nbill was reported, the bill is up for consideration on the floor.\n  I am not certain what is driving this process. I understand that \nthere may be a desire by some to act in accordance with the House \nRepublicans' Contract With America agenda. However, I did not sign the \nso-called contract, and as far as I know, neither did any other \nSenator.\n  The sole purpose of this bill is to erect barriers regarding the use \nof the civil justice system for redress of injuries caused by dangerous \nproducts. However, I would like to remind the supporters of this bill \nthat unlike the judicial systems of other countries, the American \njudicial system is rooted in democratic principles of individual \nredress, the right to a jury trial, and reliance on the people to \nresolve disputes. These were principles established by the Founding \nFathers when they proposed the adoption of the 7th and 10th amendments \nto the Constitution. Surely, issues such as whether to limit access to \ncourts, limit redress remedies, or penalize citizens for merely \nbringing suits were considered by the Founding Fathers, as well as the \njudges and State officials that have administered our system of justice \nfor over 200 years. But they decided against such measures, and opted \ninstead to maintain a system that features free access to the courts, \ncommon law, and giving the people the ultimate authority to resolve \nconflicts. The supporters of this bill, however, are seeking to \noverturn this longstanding American history and judicial precedent.\n  I am, in fact, confounded by the fact that the Senate is even \nconsidering this legislation. At the beginning of this Congress, Member \nafter Member came to the floor during consideration of S. 1, the \nunfunded mandates bill, to declare that this would be the Congress of \n``States rights,'' where government would be returned to the people. \nThe Jeffersonian\n democracy of government was revived. If I heard it once, I heard it a \nmillion times, that State and local governments know best how to \nprotect the health and safety of their citizens, and that they do not \nneed Congress telling them what to do. How many times did I hear that \nthe one clear message sent by the voters last November was that the \npeople wanted to get the Federal Government off their backs and out of \ntheir pocket?\n\n  The 10th amendment, lost in the shuffle for many years, was given new \nlight. The majority leader himself, in his opening address to the new \nCongress, proclaimed:\n\n       America has reconnected us with the hopes for a nation made \n     free by demanding a Government that is more limited. Reigning \n     in our government will be my mandate, and I hope it will be \n     the purpose and principal accomplishment of the 104th \n     Congress.\n       We do not have all the answers in Washington, DC. Why \n     should we tell Idaho, or the State of South Dakota, or the \n     State of Oregon, or any other State that we are going to pass \n     this Federal law and that we are going to require you to do \n     certain things.\n\n  The majority leader went on to say:\n\n       Federalism is an idea that power should be kept close to \n     the people. It is an idea on which our nation was founded. \n     But there are some in Washington--perhaps fewer this year \n     than last--who believe that our States can't be trusted with \n     power. If I have one goal for the 104th Congress, it is this: \n     That we will dust off the 10th Amendment and restore it to \n     its rightful place.\n\n  Those are the words of the majority leader himself. These words, \nspoken so eloquently, make it clear why the Congress should stay out of \nthe business of the States.\n  During consideration of the balanced budget amendment, Senator Byrd \nmade a compelling argument with respect to the need and obligation of \nthis body to give thorough deliberation to bills that impact our \nNation's constitutional structure. He spoke of the need of Members to \ncarefully read and study legislation.\n  I ask, Mr. President, how many Senators have carefully read this \nbill? How many are aware of how this bill will affect their \nconstituents?\n For example, how many Members know that this bill will result in \ndisparate treatment of working-class Americans? How many \n[[Page S5579]] Members know that this bill stands to perpetuate \ndiscrimination against women and children? How many Members know that \nthis bill will make it much more difficult for workers who suffer \nproduct-related injuries to recover for their injuries?\n  How many Members are aware of how this bill will affect the comfort \nlevel we have in the drugs we buy, and the health and safety devices we \nuse? How many are aware of how it will impact their State laws, \njudicial order, and constitutions? These are the important questions \nthat must be answered, and deeply debated before we consider passing \nthis bill.\n  The proponents claim that this is a modest bill, one that is \ndifferent from the House bill, and more reasonable than previous Senate \nbills. First, Mr. President, this is not an accurate statement. This \nbill actually has reincorporated many provisions of previous Senate \nbills that many sponsors of the current bill once opposed. Second, we \nall know that, if a Senate bill goes to conference with the House bill, \nHouse Members will be pushing their version of the bill.\n  The proponents have offered a number of explanations regarding the \nneed for this legislation. However, every claim that has been made \nabout the need for this bill has been refuted.\n  The proponents initially lamented that the legislation was needed \nbecause of a liability insurance crisis. The alleged crisis became the \nimpetus for the entire tort reform movement. According to Prof. James \nHenderson, a major supporter of tort reform, and Prof. Theodore \nEisenberg of Cornell University, tort reformers were concerned mostly \nabout convincing the American public that there was a crisis and \nlinking the alleged crisis to product liability. They showed less \nconcern over the reality of the crisis itself. The idea was to tie the \nproduct liability system to the crisis in a way that reshaped public \nopinion. Efforts were forcefully made to link the so-called crisis to \nbasic American activities, such as Little League baseball and the Boy \nScouts--almost literally motherhood and apple pie. To quote Professors \nHenderson and Eisenberg, ``using every technique of modern media-\nshaping, tort reform groups sought to insure that the public believed \nthat products liability law was the cause of this threat to their way \nof life.''\n  This, Mr. President, is according to Prof. James Henderson, a \nsupporter of tort reform. Numerous studies have shown, however, that \nproduct liability had nothing to do with the availability or \naffordability of insurance. In fact, during the midst of the so-called \ncrisis, the director of government affairs for the Risk and Insurance \nManagement Society--an association\n of corporate risk managers which includes more than 90 percent of the \nFortune 1000 companies--himself expressed concern about linking tort \nreform and the insurance availability crisis. Studies by the GAO, and \nnumerous other studies, have shown that to the extent there was a \ncrisis, it was caused by insurance companies themselves, not product \nliability.\n\n  But what is conspicuously missing from this bill, Mr. President, is \nany requirement that insurance companies submit data to justify the \npremiums charged to businesses. Former Texas Insurance Commissioner \nRobert Hunter has stated clearly that unless the insurance problem is \nresolved, the whole matter concerning legal or transaction costs will \nnot be addressed by this bill.\n  Next, the sponsors contended that the bill was needed because of a \nlitigation explosion. Some continue to make this claim, despite ample \nevidence that there never was, and is not now, any litigation \nexplosion.\n  A recent study by the Rand Corp. found that less than 10 percent of \nthe people who are injured by products ever even consider filing a \nlawsuit, and only 2 percent actually go forward with filing a suit. \nAccording to recent statistics published by the National Center for \nState Courts, product liability cases are only 4 percent of State tort \nfilings, and a mere thirty six-hundredths of 1 percent of all civil \ncases.\n  Throughout this debate, there has been an inordinate degree of \ncontempt toward the American jury system. Some have even characterized \nthe system as an open lottery. However, this is part of a well \norganized misinformation campaign. The evidence unequivocally \ndemonstrates that our Nation's jury system has not run amok. Last June, \nthe New York Times featured a front page story on how juries are \ngrowing tougher on plaintiffs. Citing the latest research by Jury \nVerdicts Research, Inc., the Times states that plaintiffs' success \nrates in product liability cases have dropped from 59 to 41 percent \nsince 1989.\n  Professors James Henderson and Theodore Eisenberg of Cornell \nUniversity released a study in 1992, which showed that product \nliability filings had declined by 44 percent by 1991. They concluded \nthat by ``most measures, product liability has returned to where it was \nat the beginning of the decade,'' beginning in the 1980's.\n  A 1991 New York University Law Review article by Prof. James \nHenderson, along with Brooklyn Law School Prof. Aaron Twerski--another \nmajor supporter of tort reform--stated that:\n\n       With sharper focus and fewer distractions, American \n     products liability may be better equipped than ever to \n     provide appropriate incentives for product manufacturers and \n     distributors to act\n      responsibility in the public interest. But the days of \n     wretched excess are over, very probably for the indefinite \n     future.\n\n  Where is the real litigation explosion, Mr. President? It is in the \ncorporate board rooms. According to Prof. Marc Galanter of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin Law School, the real litigation explosion in \nrecent years has involved businesses suing each other, not injured \npersons seeking redress of their rights. He found that business \ncontract filings in Federal courts increased by 232 percent between \n1960 and 1988, and by 1988 were the largest category of civil cases in \nthe Federal courts.\n  Reports by the National Law Journal show that since 1989, of the 83 \nlargest civil damage awards nationwide, 73 percent have involved \nbusiness suits. Between 1987 and 1994, just 76 of the top business \nverdicts alone have accounted for more than $10 billion. In 1993, the \ntop 13 business verdicts alone amounted to approximately $3 billion. \nThey included: Litton Systems versus Honeywell, a patent infringement \ndispute--$1.2 billion; Rubicon Petroleum versus Amoco, a breach of \ncontract dispute--$500 million, including $250 million in punitive \ndamages; Amoco Chemical versus Certain Lloyds of London, a breach of \ncontract dispute--$425 million, including $341 million in punitive \ndamages; Avia Development versus American General Realty Investment, a \nbreach of contract--$309 million, including $262 million in punitive \ndamages. Of course, this does not include the greatest verdict of\n them all--the $10.5 billion awarded in 1985 in the Pennzoil versus \nTexaco case. According to the testimony of Jonathan Massey, an expert \non punitive damages, the total punitive damage awards since 1965 come \nto only a fraction of the $3 billion punitive award in Pennzoil versus \nTexaco. However, the proponents of S. 565 refuse to even discuss that \nbusinesses themselves might be the primary reason for increasing \nlitigation--which leads me to their new claim that product liability is \nstifling competitiveness.\n\n  Like the refutation of the insurance crisis and litigation explosion, \nit has been clearly proven that product liability has nothing to do \nwith American business competitiveness. According to a survey of 232 \nrisk managers of the largest corporations in the country, product \nliability for most businesses is less than 1 percent of the final price \nof products, and has little, if any, impact on larger economic issues, \nsuch as market share or jobs.\n  The Office of Technology Assessment conducted an extensive study of \nthe competitiveness of American businesses and did not, among its \nfindings, list product liability as a primary problem or concern. The \nGAO recently stated that it ``could find no acceptable methodology for \nrelating product liability to competitiveness, and that businesses \nrefuse to release the information needed to conduct such an analysis.'' \nMr. President, we should not be debating this bill without having the \ninformation necessary to make an informed decision, information that \nbusinesses and insurance companies are unwilling to provide.\n  To the extent that American businesses are having competition \nproblems, it has nothing to do with products liability. It could, \nhowever, have a lot to do with our Nation's trade and \n[[Page S5580]] economic policy. In fact, I am somewhat surprised that \nwe are even discussing competitiveness after the passage of GATT and \nNAFTA. It was my understanding that the these were the so-called \npanacea to our trade dilemma. The fact of the matter, Mr. President, is \nthat if we are going to have a discussion about trade policy, then let \nus have that debate, and quit wasting time with these nonessential \nissues.\n  The proponents have had ample time to make their case, and have yet \nto produce any evidence to justify the passage of this legislation. It \nis for these reasons that I believe that this legislation must be \ndefeated.\n  It would be irresponsible of us as Members of Congress, to consider a \nbill that has such serious consequences for American consumers, \nwithout, at the very least, requiring the sponsors of such a bill to \nprovide factual data--not anecdotal arguments--to support their claims.\n  Mr. President, as we talk about ``Here we go again,'' and in \nlistening to my distinguished colleague from Washington, he has a very, \nvery reasonable demeanor, and as he pleads how this, after years, has \nbeen worked out and is so reasonable, I would not want my colleagues to \nbe misled.\n  First, this is not a more reasonable bill and the distinguished \nSenator knows it.\n  For the past three Congresses, we have not had caps on punitive \ndamages. But now we do have caps in this particular bill. In the past \nCongresses, we never had misuse, the failure to follow directions. Now \nwe have a provision in here for misuse. I could go right on down the \nlist. The argument is that years of having this idea turned back is the \nreason now to come forward; however, the very reasons for having been \nturned back persist even more strongly.\n  It persists more strongly, Mr. President, because that is the theme \nof this particular Congress. Whether we like it or not, we have the \nContract With America. Whether we like it or not, we have what they \ncall a revolution. And the theme of that revolution and contract, Mr. \nPresident, is that the Government here in Washington is the enemy; the \nGovernment is not the solution, the Government is the problem. And \nwhether we like it or not, the only way to do it is tear it down and \nget rid of it and maybe some day rebuild. But for now, get rid of the \ndepartment of Congress; get rid of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment; abolish the Department of Energy; abolish the Department \nof Education; cut out the revenues, give everybody a tax cut. Of \ncourse, we are operating at over a $300 billion annual deficit. We do \nnot have any revenues to cut. But in this pollster exercise behind \npolitical reelection, cut the revenues, cut the taxes, increase the \ndeficit, get rid of the departments, and send it all back to the \nStates. That is the very old theme--Jeffersonian.\n  I have never heard so many Republicans fall in love with Jefferson. \nThey all say that the best government is that closest to the people. \nGet it back there. When it comes to crime, the bill that we passed \nreally should be reduced to block grants. We debated it and we had \nRepublican support for that crime bill. But now, all of a sudden, that \nsame crime bill that we debated for some 3 years before it was passed \nneeds to be block granted to get it away from the Washington \nbureaucrats. With respect to welfare reform, get that back to the \nStates. The States know better how to handle these things. Housing--get \nthat back to the States. Whatever it is, abolish the entity up here at \nthe Washington level and get it back to the States and the local level.\n  That is the theme of the contract save, Mr. President, this fix--and \nthis is a fix. This is a fix. They ought to get my friend down there \nwho has been fixing it for years, Victor Schwartz. That is who O.J. \nneeds. He has taken a little time to get it fixed, but Victor Schwartz, \nrepresenting this small little manufacturing entity is fixing it. The \nchambers of commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nBusiness Roundtable, all of those are not interested in injured \nparties; they are interested in injured pocketbooks.\n  Of course, they are making more profits than they ever made in their \nlives. That is what we heard on the GATT: Do not worry about it, we are \ncompetitive now, and we have to get a mindset for global competition. \nAnd do not worry about the pharmaceutical companies which, they pointed \nout, with truth and distinction, are making their biggest profits.\n  But now, under this bill here, we are told that the pharmaceutical \nindustry cannot produce a drug at all on account of product liability. \nThe chemical industry, the biotechnology industry, all of the \nindustries that have been leading in wealth and corporate profits, they \nhave reached higher ceilings than you have ever seen in the history of \nthis land. But now, to justify this bill, we are told America's \nindustry has gone broke, and we finally have found a real solution here \nin product liability. If we can only get this Federal fix, can you \nimagine that? With all of the things going on in this town. The tax cut \nwas given the very same day they had the circus out on the east front, \ntrampling around. After that, they want to finally come and ask, ``Who \ncan do it better than the States and the people that sent us here?\"\n  That is a sort of interesting thing to this particular Senator. The \npeople back home are so wise, so studied, so alert, so sensible with \nthe issues of the contract, and the very same people that sent us here \nto Washington all of a sudden have lost their minds when it comes to \nproduct liability. They do not really know how to make a judgment. Of \ncourse, they are the only ones who heard the sworn testimony; they are \nthe only ones who are familiar with the facts. But irrespective of the \nfacts, and particularly the English law, the tort system, adopted by \nthe several 50 States over the 200-some year history of this land, all \nof a sudden we do not single out herein and say automobile accident \ncases, we do not single out and say, well, there are contract cases \nexploding. They talked about a litigation explosion. That is where it \nis, not here. We do not single that out. But we single out this unique \nfix. And, as I say, here we go again, because nothing has changed.\n  The American Bar Association, Mr. President, appeared and testified \nagainst this bill despite this quick fix because they just had summary \nhearings before our Commerce Committee that reported the bill out, just \nas we were leaving town, and we were told it was going to be the first \nthing called. You can bet your boots they will file cloture tomorrow. \nThey do not want to debate this and understand the law. Just a bunch of \nbusiness Senators on the Commerce Committee with this fix are going to \ntake care of manufacturers. Just at a time that what we really need to \ndo is get the welfare recipients more responsible, we want to make the \nmanufacturer more irresponsible.\n  It is the darnedest experience I have ever seen in a mature group. It \nshows how controlling pollster politics has become, because if you have \nbeen in a recent race back home, they are obviously conducted in \naccordance with the polls. The candidates have too many things to say \ngrace over, and when it comes to product liability, when the chamber of \ncommerce comes, and the business group comes, and they all seek to see \nthe particular candidates, it shows up in the polls. It makes the \ncandidate say it is a terrible problem and, yes, I am for product \nliability at the Federal level.\n  Well, how did we start this? We started this under President Ford, \nand our distinguished President Ford had the good, common sense to \nrealize that it was an onrush of business nonsense, because we have the \nsafest products and we have business booming, and we have, as they talk \nabout, lack of competitiveness. I have foreign industries just diving \ninto my State and saying: We want to come under your product liability \nlaw, South Carolina. We love it. One hundred German industries and over \n50 Japanese industries have come in--I could go right on down the list.\n  I have worked in the field now almost 40 years, working and bringing \nindustry in. Never once--never once--have I heard a business leader or \nindustrialist say, ``Representative or Governor or Senator, what about \nthis product liability? We are worried about juries and runaway \nverdicts,'' and that kind of talk that you hear up here at this level.\n  We never heard that, and we do not hear it today. When they had the \nhearing, it was an actual embarrassment, \n[[Page S5581]] having worked in the vineyards over these many years, to \nsee the witnesses that they brought in to try to give credence to their \nhearing. They had some makeshift, unnamed organization, and they came \nwith what? They came with statistics about businesses suing businesses \ndown in Alabama.\n  We could go on over to Texas. We have the business of Pennzoil suing \nTexaco, and I remember that was a $12 million verdict. That is more \nthan all the product liability verdicts put together over the history \nof product liability in this land. Add them up. One business verdict, \nPennzoil. But the sponsors of the bill started out first saying there \nwas a litigation explosion. Again, we studied it out and we find that \nactually in tort cases, in civil filings in the courts of the several \nStates over this land, tort only represents 9 percent of all civil \nfilings, and that 4 percent of the 9 percent, or .36, is product \nliability.\n  The trend, in the State's justice system, it was firmed up again in \nour hearings, is lowering, going down. There has been one exception \nthat has held constant, and that is the asbestos cases. Other than \nthat, tort filings and product liability are diminishing rather than \nincreasing. They are receding rather than exploding.\n  What has exploded is business suing business--and we will have plenty \nof time, I am sure, with the amendments we will have at hand, to cite \nthe various verdicts. If they are really worried about money, if \nbusinesses are worried about money, they better stop suing each other \nand keep their contracts.\n  So we had first the litigation explosion. Then they said that they \ncould not get insurance. They were using these little vignettes, \nanecdotal examples. They use that Little League and some babble, that \nsame nonsense, about the cost of insurance being more than the bats and \nthe uniforms and everything else.\n  I guess kids do get hurt. Mine played in the Little League, but we \nnever had any trouble with the Little League in my town of Columbia, \nSC, at that time, and later on in Charleston, SC, we have not had any \nreal problem with the Little League. It is a very viable, wonderful \ngroup. I guess in certain instances they take out insurance, but they \nhave not been denied on account of product liability.\n  They tried, more recently, to update it into the McDonald's coffee \ncase, saying what a terrible thing, this lady who had been burned by \nthe coffee ought to have known better. She really did not have a claim.\n  I was very much interested, Mr. President, in that treatment given by \nNewsweek magazine for product liability. In the Newsweek magazine, in \nthe account of the juror in the McDonald's coffee case, she said she \nthought at first it was a frivolous claim. Thereafter, on listening, \nshe found out there were 700 cases of individuals being burned by the \ncoffee.\n  Of course, the question that this Senator asked was, ``Why?'' It \ncomes to my attention now, of course, if the heat of the water is \nincreased inordinately over the coffee beans, you get more coffee. \nMoney--money--is the answer here. It is the answer in this particular \ncase.\n  The Conference Board questioned 232 particular risk managers. These \nrisk managers overwhelmingly said product liability was less than 1 \npercent of the cost of the operation. Even the business study showed it \nwas not a litigation explosion.\n  The availability of insurance problem was studied and found to be bad \nreal estate investments they made in the early and mid-1980's. Like our \nS crisis, the savings and loan industry principally based in the \ninvestment in homes, real estate, shopping centers, and what have you--\nthe insurance companies in their real estate portfolio had similarly \nused bad judgment. The result was that the cost had gone up, but more \nrecently the availability has been there and everything else of that \nkind.\n  Then they said we should be more like the European system, the EEC, \nso we could compete with them. During 1988, 1989, 1990, we found out \nthe European system became more similar to ours, and we put those \ndocuments in the record, with joint and several liability moving toward \nthe American system rather than the other way around.\n  Now they say ``compete''--we want Government to compete. If they had \nlistened to our debates with respect to NAFTA and GATT, we would have \nfound out how this Government can compete, because this is what it is: \ngovernment-to-government competition in international and global trade. \nForget David Ricardo and Adam Smith and comparative advantage and free \nmarket. We will discuss in this debate where the Japanese approached \nAlexander Hamilton--incidentally, the approach of using the Government \nto determine what decisions can be made in the theory of free market, \nbut whether or not it strengthens the economy or whether it weakens the \neconomy.\n  On that governmental approach with business, immediately you say, \n``Wait a minute. That is industrial policy.'' Well, you are right. I \nthink after 45 years of trying for free market, free market, free \ntrade, free trade, we finally learned our lesson. We cannot do as we do \nor do as we say; we have to find out the predominance. The global \ncompetition is the Japanese model. The Japanese model has been emulated \nnot only throughout the Pacific rim but by Germany and countries in \nEurope and particularly now the East European countries.\n  The Japanese have schools. They have instructors in the system, as \nSouth Korea has done, Taiwan and Singapore, Malaysia, and the others \nhave done. That is why we just had our Secretary of the Treasury in \nBali on an economic summit and monetary conference and they cannot seem \nto understand why they are not going for free trade, free trade, free \ntrade.\n This crybaby whining about opening up your markets--the fact is, we \nare losing our industrial and manufacturing backbone.\n\n  I was at a conference not many years back with Akio Marita, of Sony, \nin Japan. He came, and Marita at that time, talking of emerging \ncountries, said that you had to have a strong manufacturing sector if \nyou were going to be a nation-state. Then he went on to say, ``Look, \nthat country that loses its manufacturing power ceases to be a world \npower.'' And that is what has happened with merry old England. They \ntold the Brits some years back, rather than a nation of brawn we are \ngoing to be a nation of brains. Instead of producing products we are \ngoing to provide services, ``service economy, service economy.'' We \nhave heard that same chant here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \n``Instead of creating wealth we are going to handle it and be a \nfinancial center.'' And England has gone to hell in an economic \nhandbasket. They have two levels of society there. And that is exactly \nthe road your country and my country is on at this present time.\n  So, with respect to competing on product liability, being a \ndeterrent, let me invite you to any State in America, and particularly \nmine, where you will find foreign entities, as a result of the lack of \na competitive trade policy, have come in now and bought up, with gusto, \nthe American entities and are now producing those Japanese cars and \nother products here in the United States, like gangbusters. They are \ndown right now, with the devaluation of the dollar, into Miami. I read \nthat in the Wall Street Journal, where they are buying it up down there \nright and left, because the dollar has lost 20 percent of its value \nagainst the mark since the first of January.\n  The sponsors of the bill have used every argument that they could \npossibly think of. And again and again and again the States involved \nsay, ``No, we don't need this.'' Again and again and again that \nbipartisan group, the American Bar Association, has said, ``No, this is \nbad legislation.'' And, again and again and again, the Conference of \nState Supreme Court Justices has come in and testified that, as a \ngroup, they oppose this.\n  Then the sponsors come in and say, with a straight face, that what \nthey are trying to do is get uniformity. Now, now, now--uniformity. \nUniformity. It is very interesting that this particular bill provides \nno uniformity; no uniformity when it comes to holding the manufacturer \nresponsible. Oh, yes, we want uniformity for the customer, the \nconsumer, the user of the particular product, but not for the \nmanufacturers themselves.\n  There is no better example of an unfunded mandate than this \nparticular \n[[Page S5582]] bill. Everyone has attested to the fact that, because \nthe bill has not given a Federal cause of action, you leave it at the \nState level, with words of art enunciated by this high and almighty \nCongress up here that knows best, exactly what to do and what caps \nthere are and what tests there are, all to be interpreted by the 50 \nsupreme courts of the 50 States. And then, if there is a further \nappeal, up to the U.S. Supreme Court. So what is started, is a surge \nagainst lawyers, ``Get rid of the lawyers.'' Now more lawyers are going \nto be hired under this particular bill just for product liability, \nwhich is not a national problem whatever. But they manufacture it and \nrig it so, even in contradiction to their own theme of trying to give \nmeaning and cause to the 10th amendment that those things not delegated \nunder the Constitution to the Federal Government shall be reserved to \nthe several States.\n  No, no. They do not want this one reserved to the States. In spite of \nthe legislatures, in spite of the attorneys general, in spite of the \nSupreme Court Justices, in spite of the American Bar Association, and \nin spite of--oh, heavens above--the list of different groups here that \nwe have who oppose this so-called product liability bill--they, all of \na sudden, are being so reasonable. They do not really care what passes. \nThey are going to get into conference with that House crowd and that \nHouse crowd has gone amok now. Look at what's going on over there--I \nmean they can really sell them on voting to cut revenues that they do \nnot have. They have a $300 billion deficit but they say we have to buy \nthe vote, we have to get to the middle class. Unfortunately, I do not \nspeak in a partisan fashion, the President of the United States says \nthe same thing. There are a group of Senators here, in a bipartisan \nfashion, who say we cannot afford tax cuts. But here it is.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this list of entities be \nprinted in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Who Opposes the ``Contract With America's'' Liability Reform?\n\n       Action on Smoking and Health.\n       AIDS Action Council.\n       Alabama Citizen Action.\n       Alaska Public Interest Research Group.\n       Alliance Against Intoxicated Motorists.\n       Alliance for Justice.\n       American Association for Retired People (AARP).\n       American Association of Suicidology.\n       American Bar Association.\n       American Board of Trial Advocates.\n       American Coalition for Abuse Awareness.\n       American Council on Consumer Awareness.\n       American Public Health Association.\n       Americans for Democratic Action.\n       American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n     Organizations.\n       Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n       Arizona Citizen Action.\n       Arizona Consumers Council.\n       Arkansas Fairness Council.\n       Association of Trial Lawyers of America.\n       California Citizen Action.\n       California Crime Victims Legal Clinic.\n       California Public Interest Research Group.\n       Center for Public Interest Law at University of San Diego.\n       Center for Public Interest Research.\n       Center for Public Representation, Inc.\n       Center for Women Policy Studies.\n       Children NOW.\n       Citizen Action.\n       Citizen Action of Maryland.\n       Citizen Action of New York.\n       Ctizens Action Coalition of Indiana.\n       Citizen Advocacy Center.\n       Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.\n       Citizens Coalition for Chiropractic.\n       Clean Water Action Project.\n       Coalition for Consumer Rights.\n       Coalition of Labor Union Women.\n       Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n       Colorado Public Interest Research Group.\n       Command Trust Network.\n       Connecticut Citizen Action Group.\n       Connecticut Public Interest Research Group.\n       Consumer Action.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       Consumer Federation of California.\n       Consumers for Civil Justice.\n       Consumers League of New Jersey.\n       Consumer Protection Association.\n       Consumers Union.\n       Cornucopia Network of NJ.\n       Democratic Processes Center.\n       DES Action of New Jersey.\n       DES Action USA.\n       DES Sons.\n       Empire State Consumer Association.\n       Essex West Hudson Labor Council.\n       Fair Housing Council of San Gabriel Valley.\n       Families Advocating Injury Reduction (FAIR).\n       Federation of Organizations for Professional Women.\n       Florida Consumer Action Network.\n       Florida Public Interest Research Group.\n       Fund for Feminist Majority.\n       Georgia Citizen Action.\n       Georgia Consumer Center.\n       Gray Panthers.\n       Handgun Control, Inc.\n       Harlem Consumer Education Council.\n       Help Us Regain the Children.\n       Hollywood Women's Political Committee.\n       Idaho Citizens Action Network.\n       Idaho Consumer Affairs, Inc.\n       Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence.\n       Illinois Public Action.\n       Illinois Pubilc Interest Research Group.\n       Institute for Injury Reduction.\n       International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n     Workers.\n       International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n       International Ladies Garment Workers Union.\n       International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.\n       Iowa Citizen Action Network.\n       Judge David L.

Mr. President, there are over 100 of these \norganizations all over the country, not only the trial advocates, of \ncourse, but the consumer organizations, the AFL-CIO, the working people \nand everything else of that kind.\n  I will dwell, later on, on what good has really come of product \nliability. We never hear that. We act like it is one of the most \ntorturous things in the world. The truth is that under product \nliability the using public here in the United States of America can \npretty well count on the safety of particular products. What happens in \nrare cases, and they are rare ones, is that something goes wrong--with \nrespect to medical devices, the Dalkon shield and the different other \ndevices of that kind; the Pinto case. I can tell you, the other day 4 \nmillion Chrysler minivans were pulled off the market to change the back \ndoor switch. That multimillion-dollar effort on behalf of the traveling \npublic in America was certainly not brought about by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers or the chamber of commerce or the Business \nRoundtable. It was as a result of the product liability system that we \nhave in America.\n  The sponsors could not produce a Governor. I was waiting at the \nhearing for a Governor to come in and say we need a national law. The \ntruth is that 46 of the 50 States over the last 15 years have treated \ntheir particular problems. In my State they debated it. They got \ntogether, not only with the chamber of commerce and the trial lawyers, \nbut the insurance companies and all other business groups, consumer \ngroups, and they worked out upgrading, as they thought needed to be \ndone, the State law on product liability in South Carolina.\n  Now we are going to come and say, ``Well, you did not know what you \nwere doing. We know best up here. In fact we do not have any work to \ndo. We are going to meddle into your State entity under the 10th \namendment here that which has historically been under the States. We \nare going to want it handled still by the States, but with our \nguidelines.''\n  Heavens above, to come at this particular hour here, right at the so-\ncalled climax of the Contract With America, based upon the idea that \n``that government closest to the people is the better government,'' to \ncome now and say, ``no, no, no'' with respect to this matter, product \nliability, we have to get it up to the Federal level--I want to see \nthat Governor who comes and says so, because he is just politically \nanswering the Contract With America and political polls.\n  I have been a Governor. You go before your legislature and you change \nthings that need changing, whatever they are. If you have a good enough \ncase, that legislature, that is very close to the people, is going to \nrespond. But this has been a national fix for over 15 years.\n  President Ford had a study commission. The result of that study \ncommission said to leave it to the States. They did not like that. So \nthey come in year in and year out, nibbling here and there, ``Well, can \nI get your vote if I change this? Can I get your vote if I change \nthat?'' There's a fix on this side of the Capitol to get together with \nthe House crowd to move forward with the English system, with caps, \nwith all the other particular interests that they may be able to tag \non.\n  Like the sheepdog that has tasted blood now with that contract, they \nare going to turn to product liability and gobble up the rest of the \nflock while they can. Maybe so. Maybe so. But I hope my colleagues in \nthis supposedly most deliberative body would stop and look and listen \nand understand that this is not any fairness act whatever. Everyone who \nhas really treated with this, as lawyers--I will have to make a talk \nlater on about the lawyers.\n  We can go to Shakespeare where he said the first thing we do is kill \nall the lawyers. That was because the only thing standing between \ntyranny and freedom were lawyers. Jefferson was a lawyer. All these \nothers, we could go down and mention these forefathers, outstanding \nlawyers, and, of course, they really drew that Constitution and they \nreally had a feel for individual freedoms and the right of trial by \njury under that seventh amendment. There are not any restrictions on \nthat seventh amendment--until now. But now we are going to put on a \nnational restriction that says a trial by jury should conform to these \nparticular guidelines that we on high have decided, because you do not \nhave sense enough at the local level to listen to the judge that \ncharges that jury.\n  I am going to yield because I see the distinguished chairman of our \nJudiciary Committee, who I am sure is proud of lawyers and is ready to \nspeak.\n  We could take murder cases like the O.J. Simpson case, and federalize \nthat. I can give them some guidelines where they can move through in a \njudicious and expedited fashion rather than the theater that they have \ngoing on out on the west coast. No one would really dream of putting in \na bill to federalize murder and murder cases with Federal guidelines.\n  One big interest I have had as an attorney is: Give me a Federal \ncause of action. Let us get some uniformity amongst the 50 States.\n  The 50 States, incidentally, do not mind taking some 50 to 75 \ninsurance policies--and I have been in the insurance business--the 50 \nStates do not mind going before the 50 State commissions and filing \ntheir particular policies. They say with insurance they have a very \ndifficult time trying cases under different jurisdictions. Well, they \ndo it with respect to all business and contracts. We have certain \nuniformity under the Restatement of Torts. But with respect to \ninsurance itself, they will not give the Judiciary Committee or the \nCommerce Committee the facts as to how they have been losing money. \nThey came in the mid-1980's and said there was a big insurance problem. \nWe had an amendment which we will propose again--requiring information \nthat they file.\n  We have the Senators from the insurance State of Connecticut who are \ngoing to be heard later on. That crowd up there, Aetna, Hartford, the \ndifferent insurance companies that are benefiting and making even more \nmoney will not tell you where they have had their losses. We have tried \nto get that information. I have been chairman of that committee for \nyears on end, and now ranking member at this moment. But you cannot \nfind the facts about insurance because they file them separately in the \n50 States and they tell you they do not have a correlation. I know you \nhave to have an actuary if you are going to have good insurance. I can \ntell you there are actuaries in those particular outstanding companies. \nThey know whether they are winning or losing. They know where their \ncosts are. But they will not give them to the National Congress.\n  So, we are flying blind without the truth in a very abbreviated \nhearing with the arrogant assumption that the people who sent us here \nto Washington had the good sense and judgment to make you and I a \nSenator but all of a sudden they have lost their minds when it comes to \ntrying a little law case in the courtroom back home. They are the only \nones who have heard the sworn testimony. We have not heard any sworn \ntestimony. All we have heard is from the fixers downtown. When we get \nto the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to talk about lawyers, we \nare going to have a good heyday. They have 60,000 downtown in the \nDistrict of Columbia--60,000 lawyers. I doubt if many of them have ever \nbeen in the courtroom. They are all hired to fix you and fix me. They \nall are lobbyist lawyers to take anything they can for someone. I never \nheard of such fees around here. A poor fellow gets charged under \nethics, and he has to hire a lawyer for $400 an hour to peruse all of \nhis records and start looking at this and what happened 15 years ago, \nand all of that kind of nonsense.\n  They do not come cheap. Billable hours is their theme. I practiced \nlaw for 20 years and never had a billable hour. If we won the case, we \ngot a fee. If we did not win, that was my responsibility. That is the \nretainer system. We have many an injured party that is out of work. \nThere is no salary, large medical bills, and everything else. Yes. \n[[Page S5584]] I have taken those under a one-third contingent basis. I \ntell that poor client not to worry about it. I am going to pay for the \ninvestigation. I am going to pay for the court costs. I am going to pay \nfor the interrogatories. I am going to pay for the depositions. We are \ngoing to pay for the trial. I am going to pay for my time. If it goes \nup on appeal, I am going to pay for the printing of the record. I will \nappear before the Supreme Court. And, unless we prevail, you do not owe \nme one red cent.\n  That worked in America for the poor folks, middle-class America. That \nwould not work for the middle class, if they had to come under billable \nhours at $200, $300, $400. I think we maybe ought to have an amendment \nthat we limit billable hours for defense lawyers, not put caps on \npunitive damages, but let us put caps on billable hours to, let us say, \n$50 an hour. If we had that, they would be making over $100,000, making \nas much as a Senator. That is just 40 hours a week for 52 weeks. But if \nthey worked overtime like trial lawyers have to do, then they would \nmake even more money. But they do not want to talk about caps on \nbillable hours.\n  That is the group of lawyers that are moving this thing. Nobody that \nrepresented an injured party is coming to this National Government and \nsaying we have a national problem. They know differently. It is not \neasy. You have to get all 12 jurors to agree. The defense side has the \ninvestigative staff. When the plaintiff prevails, they are not runaway \njuries. In my State of South Carolina, the trial judge can look and \nsay, such as recently was done in a case in Greenville, ``I do not like \nthat finding under punitive damages. I am ruling out all punitive \ndamages with respect to the actual verdict. Actual damages, I do not \nbelieve you should get but so much. You can take this much or get a new \ntrial. One or the other. You can count on that.'' We have responsible, \nconservative jurors in my State. And I do not know where in the Lord's \nworld the business community thinks this Congress is going to be more \nconservative and responsible than my State of South Carolina. That is \nwhy I feel so keenly about this.\n  They might have the Gingrich leadership and the contract and the \nconservative bunch at this particular hour. But give it time. Give it \ntime. This crowd is way more liberal than what we are back home. That \nbusiness crowd, in the years to come, are going to find that you will \ntrip up on the carpet and go over to the window and get your money. You \nwatch how they move in on you when you get these national trends.\n  This is not in the interest of business. It is not in the interest of \nconsumers. It is not in the interest of good, sound law, and certainly \ndoes not respond to any need other than the political fix that has been \nworked in here. We have thwarted it time and again, by thoughtful \nSenators looking at it and understanding. We have a lot of work to do \nup here in the National Government. But certainly tort reform is not \none of the great needs in this land.\n  We have investors coming from all over the world because they like \nour system here as compared to the systems they have in their own \ncountries. The particular industries involved, whether chemical, \npharmaceutical and all, just under GATT were making profits, their \nbiggest return, and they were being able to compete. Now the purposes \nof this particular bill is to try to allow them to put on the market \ncertain pharmaceuticals that they are being prohibited from putting on \nthe particular market because of product liability.\n  It is a false chant and claim that should not be honored in this \nparticular bill before us. The Commerce Committee members, I know them \nintimately. They know better but they are caught up in this particular \njam, and we will have a good debate as we move along.\n  I do thank my colleagues for their attention here this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is here to speak on this bill and I want to allow him to do \nso. I simply have a mechanical motion to make at this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the other sponsors of S. \n565 be added as cosponsors to my substitute amendment: Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. McConnell, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nExon, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Chafee, and also added as \ncosponsors of the substitute amendment Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. \nFrist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I always enjoy hearing my colleague from South Carolina. \nHe is one of the more intelligent people in this body. He is certainly \na great lawyer, and I agree with many of the things he says. In fact, I \nconsider him one of my dearest friends in the Senate and I learned how \neffective he was many, many years ago as a brandnew, freshman Senator \nwhen we worked together on a variety of issues. Nothing would please me \nmore than to always be together, on every issue.\n  So I just want to say that I have a lot of respect for him. I know \nthat he believes in what he is doing, and that is very important to me.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to speak in support of the \nProduct Liability Fairness Act of 1995. As an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation, it has been my pleasure to work with Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton, and many others, in addressing the significant \nissues underlying product liability litigation reform.\n  I particularly commend Senator Rockefeller and Gorton for the hard \nwork they have gone through in trying to being people together on this \nvery significant bill, and for their longstanding leadership and their \ndogged pursuit of meaningful product liability reform. It is long \noverdue. It is my hope that we in the 104th Congress will finally be \nable to pass some of the needed reforms that the American people have \ndemanded for years.\n  This act represents a bipartisan effort to correct what many \nobservers have long recognized to be serious malfunctions in our \nproduct liability system. This act aims to help American business to \ngrow, to provide more jobs and more affordable consumer goods, to \nreduce unnecessary and outrageous insurance and litigation costs, and \nto encourage the medical and technological breakthroughs that benefit \nthe people of Utah and all Americans.\n  If passed, this act will do that at the same time it ensures that \nthose who are wrongfully harmed by trule defective products are \ncompensated through a prompt, effective system in which the bulk of \ntheir compensation will not be eaten up by court costs and attorneys' \nfees.\n  Under the current system, however, American manufacturers and others \nhave been forced to devote far too many resources to the costs of \nproduct liability actions. Too often those actions have been frivolous \nattempts to vex and harass American businesses into unwarranted and \nunjustified settlements. American consumers in all States have had to \nbear those costs.\n\n\n                            Punitive Damages\n\n  I have studied these problems and listened to experts, including \nthose who testified at a tort reform hearing I chaired in the Judiciary \nCommittee in early April. I am particularly concerned about the effect \narbitrary punitive damage awards have on our economy and civil justice \nsystem. They are sought with an alarming frequency that adversely \naffects our manufacturers, distributors, and retailers with threats of \npotentially unpayable damages.\n  Arbitrary punitive damage awards adversely affect consumers. George \nL. Priest, professor of law and economics at Yale Law School, testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee on April 4. He has taught in the areas \nof tort law, products liability, and damages for 21 years and has \ndirected the Yale Law School Program in Civil Liability since 1982. He \ntestified as a private citizens, not on behalf of any client. He said, \n``The reform of punitive damages alone even reforms that would cap\n punitive damages or introduce a proportionality cap--will help \nconsumers * * *.'' He added, ``Where punitive damages become a \ncommonplace of civil litigation * * * or even where they become a \nsignificant risk of business operations, \n[[Page S5585]] consumers are harmed because expected punitive damages \nverdicts or settlements must be built into the price of products and \nservices.''\n  We have all heard about astronomical punitive damage awards for \nspilled coffee and other horror stories. The dollar amounts of those \nawards have rapidly grown to reach the mind-numbing highs we hear about \ntoday. In California, for example, the largest punitive damage award \nupheld on appeal in the 1960's was $250,000. In the 1970's, the largest \naward of punitives upheld climbed to $750,000. But in the 1980's, the \nlargest punitive damage award upheld in California soared to $15 \nmillion.\n  It is not simply the amount of the awards that have been granted that \nis a problem, however. It is the alarming frequency with which punitive \nand other damages are sought that has a distorting impact on our \neconomy and our civil justice system. Plaintiffs who feel they may hit \nthe litigation jackpot will hold out for large settlements, prolonging \nlitigation and its attendant costs. The mere threat of punitive damage \nawards raise the settlement value of a case, regardless of its merits.\n\n\n                      Joint and Several Liability\n\n  Often, this problem is compounded when parties are joined as \ndefendants in the hopes that those parties--as deep pockets--can be \nforced to cough up a settlement.\n  I think most Americans have heard about the McDonald's coffee case, \nin which the jury awarded a tremendous amount of punitive damages to a \nwoman who spilled hot coffee on herself. But how about the McDonald's \nmilkshake case?\n  In a 1994 New Jersey case, Carter v. McDonald's Corp., (640 A.2d 850, \nN.J. 1994), the plaintiff was injured when his car was hit by another \ncar driven by a motorist named Mr. Parker.\n Mr. Parker had purchased a milkshake at McDonald's and had placed the \nmilkshake between his legs while he was driving. He inadvertently \nsqueezed his knees together and popped the top off of the milkshake. \nThis spilled the milkshake all over his legs. He became distracted and \ndrove into the plaintiff's car.\n\n  I would not argue with the fact that the plaintiff was injured or the \nfact that Mr. Parker played a key role in that car accident. I would \nnot argue that Mr. Parker should not be liable for any injuries he \ncaused to Mr. Carter through his negligence.\n  However, in that case, the plaintiff not only sued Mr. Parker, but he \nalso sued McDonald's. You might ask on what theory? He sued McDonald's \non a product liability theory. He alleged that McDonald's had sold Mr. \nParker the milkshake, knowing that Mr. Parker would consume it while \ndriving and without warning Mr. Parker of the dangers of eating and \ndriving.\n  Now I do not think anybody would disagree that that is ridiculous. It \nsimply flies in the face of common sense.\n  Of course, as a matter of law, ultimately McDonald's was legally \nvindicated and won the case. The New Jersey trial court granted \nMcDonald's a summary judgment and reached the unsurprising conclusion \nthat McDonald's did not owe a duty to its customers to warn them not to \neat and drive.\n  Even that did not satisfy the plaintiff, however, who forced \nMcDonald's to endure an appeal. Again, and not surprisingly, the \nappellate court agreed with the trial court. But even that still did \nnot satisfy the plaintiff. He sought review in the New Jersey Supreme \nCourt, which eventually denied review.\n  In the end, and after nearly 3 years of litigation, three levels of \ncourts passed on the case. None of them concluded that McDonald's could \nbe held responsible on that far-fetched theory. But was McDonald's \nreally vindicated?\n  As that case unfortunately shows, in product liability lawsuits it is \ntoo often the case that even a so-called win is a loss. McDonald's had \nto endure almost 3 years' worth of legal proceedings under a cloud of \npotentially high damages and had to bear its legal costs. If a corner \nice cream shop had sold the allegedly offending milkshake rather than \nMcDonald's, it is highly likely that the milkshake seller would not \nstill be in business today. Does that make sense? Does that benefit \nconsumers? Does it satisfy justice?\n  Now, it is not unsafe to conclude that the cost to McDonald's of \nthose three levels of trial and appeals was in the thousands and \nthousands of dollars, all passed on, of course, to you and me as \nconsumers.\n  The problem with the current product liability environment is that \nthe law actually fosters such abuses by encouraging trial lawyers to \nfile suit against various parties who have little real responsibility \nfor whatever harm is caused. Those trial lawyers do so because they can \nextract settlements from parties who may not be at fault at all but who \nmay be unable or unwilling to endure the cost and uncertainty of legal \nproceedings. Those trial lawyers have their own economic incentives to \nenter these suits: their share will be in the neighborhood of 30 \npercent or more of whatever they can force the defendants to pay.\n  Now, I have to say, these are matters that concern me greatly. \nFrankly, these abuses are encouraged. In fact, it has gotten so \nwidespread that it would almost be malpractice for a lawyer not to \nclaim punitive damages in these cases, because juries have been giving \npunitive damages, I guess not realizing that all those costs, even \nthough some of them may be paid by third parties, are passed on to \nconsumers in this society. All of those costs are part of the reason \nlitigation is so expensive.\n  I might add, that same type of reasoning is what is demoralizing \nAmerica as we watch the O.J. Simpson case go on for months and months \nof ridiculous histrionics, with attorneys playing PR people outside of \nthe courtroom and with jurors telling the judge what to do. This is \nridiculous. I do not know of any other State in the Union that would \nallow that kind of travesty to continue.\n  Yet, those are only two things I would mention at this time.\n  Take another case. This one comes from New York State.\n   [Kerner v. Waldbaum's Supermarket, Inc., 149 A.D. 2d 411 (N.Y. App. \nDiv. 2d Dep't 1989)]. In that case, a woman cut her hand while using a \nknife to separate frozen hors d'oeuvres. She had not allowed them to \nthaw and was cutting into them when they were frozen. What did she do? \nShe brought a lawsuit. Whom did she sue? She sued the supermarket and \nthe manufacturer and packager of the frozen hors d'oeuvres.\n\n  Yet again, all the defendants were ultimately vindicated as a matter \nof law. The trial court issued a judgment for the defendants, saying in \neffect that they were not responsible, and that judgment was upheld on \nappeal.\n  Again, however, legal vindication was not necessarily justice. It \ncame only after a costly legal defense and lengthy legal proceedings \nwere foisted on the defendants. That is not fair, and it is not just. \nHow can that possibly be called a win?\n  Cases like these demonstrate the power that can be wielded over \nindividuals or companies who may have at best a tenuous connection to \nthe cause of an injury. Once those parties are named in a lawsuit, they \nwill face significant costs even if they win on the legal merits.\n  This specter of large and potentially unlimited liability has fueled \nirresponsible litigation in our country again and again. That is an \ninjustice that we must correct. It is a needless expense our economy \ncannot afford to bear.\n  The fact is--whether the terrific sums expended in such litigation \ncome from large awards imposed by juries, from settlements that have \nbeen extracted from parties, or from attorneys' fees and costs that are \nexpended in successfully defending lawsuits--those amounts impose a \ntremendous cost on our economy and that cost crosses State lines.\n  That cost ultimately hits us most in the impact it has on where those \ndollars could be going. The moneys spent on litigation are not funds \nbeing invested in new research, expanding inventory, hiring employees, \nrewarding employees, building new facilities, acquiring new equipment, \nor paying dividends to shareholders. These huge sums are coming from \nthe budgets of small business, individuals, insurance companies, and \nothers every day. If not spent on irresponsible litigation, those \ndollars could create jobs and spur innovation and research. But, by \nforcing the reallocation of those dollars away from productive, job-\ncreating uses, product liability lawsuit abuse has created serious \ninterstate economic damage.\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\n  The crux of the problem is that all of this harms our economy and our \nconsumers. It removes companies' incentives to invest and discourages \nthem from engaging in research and development of newer and safer \nproducts. The threat of expensive and dragged-out litigation raises the \nrisk of innovation.\n  Moreover, not only does our current tort system limit the amounts \ncompanies can spend on wages. research, and technology by increasing \nthe amounts companies must spend on liability insurance and litigation \ncosts, that is, it imposes high opportunity costs, but it also raises \nthe direct costs necessary for a person or company to protect against \nlitigation. In short, the increasing demand for liability insurance and \nthe increasing amounts of the settlements raise the price of the \npremiums.\n  The costs that companies must pay to cover their expected liability \nare passed on to consumers.\n  Of the price of a simple ladder, for example, a shocking 20 percent \ngoes to paying the costs of product liability litigation; equally \nappalling, one-half of the price of a football helmet goes to liability \ninsurance. Unnecessary litigation and insurance costs impact the prices \nwe pay for those and all sorts of other goods and services that we need \nand use everyday.\n\n\n                  what should be the role of congress?\n\n  Critics of this legislation have pointed out that this is an area in \nwhich the States should be involved. I do not disagree with that, and I \napplaud State innovations to curb excessive\n litigation. However, it has become clear that some of these problems \ncannot be addressed comprehensively without a uniform, nationwide \nsolution to put a ceiling on at least the most abusive litigation \ntactics.\n\n  This bill addresses a national need and the regulation of interstate \ncommerce. James Madison observed in Federalist No. 42 that the ability \nof the Federal Government to protect interstate commerce was one of the \ncentral facets of the Federal Government's authority and its reason for \nbeing. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 11, agreed with that \nsentiment when he noted that one of the key purposes of the \nConstitution was to prevent interstate commerce from being ``fettered, \ninterrupted and narrowed'' by differing State regulation.\n  I agree that national power has overreached in some areas and has \nbeen overly involved in areas in which it cannot be justified. I agree \nthat in many areas the Federal Government has imposed excessive \nregulatory burdens on the American people.\n  That is why we are working so hard on a regulatory reform bill that \nwill end that.\n  It has become evident over the years, however, that Federal action is \nneeded here precisely to protect citizens of some States from the \nlitigation costs imposed on them by other States' legal systems.\n  For example, the fact that a company may be subject to huge punitive \ndamage awards in one State--say, Texas or Alabama--and none in another \nState--say, Massachusetts, which outlaws punitive damages unless \nexpressly authorized by statue--has led to a troubling result. The cost \nof those differing State standards will not be borne solely by those in \nthe respective States.\n  Plaitiffs' trial lawyers cross State boundaries to bring suits in \ncertain States rather than other States. They seek to join certain \ndefendants just to bring suit in a given State. The higher costs pass \ndirectly across State lines in those cases to harm those businesses \nthat are dragged into another State's courts. The fact is that \nMassachusetts or Utah or any other State may be unable to protect its \nbusinesses from suit in other States.\n  Moreover, in a more pervasive effect, the insurance and litigation \ncosts that are forced on the system by the laws in some States will be \npassed on to consumers and workers in other States. These harmful \neffects cannot be contained in one State, nor can the costs be passed \non to consumers only in one State or another. Both unpredictability of \nlitigation and the interstate character of markets--whether for \ninsurance, products, or services--has prevented that.\n  Critics of this legislation are also wrong in contending that the \nStates can address these problems adequately. A number of States have \nattempted reforms, only to be thwarted by State courts.\n  Many States have enacted statutes of repose similar to the one \nincluded in our product liability bill. Our bill sets a 20-year statute \nof repose for durable goods. It prevents manufacturers from being sued \nfor old equipment or machinery, and ensures that after a sufficiently \nlong period of time after which the manufacturer has no longer \ncontrolled a particular machine or piece of equipment, responsibility \nwill lie with those who are responsible for its use and upkeep.\n  Unfortunately, State efforts in this area have been thwarted. State \nstatutes of repose have been struck down in at least 14 States based on \nState constitutional grounds. [See Berry v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 717 \nP.2d 670, 677-678 (Supreme Court of Utah 1985) (citing cases)].\n  More sweeping efforts have been equally frustrated. In Alabama, tort \nreform legislation passed by the Alabama State legislature in 1987 \nrequired independent court review of punitive damage awards, and placed \na $250,000 flat cap on punitive damages for most civil cases. However, \nin 1991, the Alabama Supreme Court struck down the provision requiring \nindependent court review of punitive damages [Armstrong v. Roger's \nOutdoor Sports, 581 So.2d 414 (Ala. 1991)]; and, in 1993, the Alabama\n Supreme Court ruled that the Alabama Legislature does not have the \nauthority under the State constitution to impose any cap on punitive \ndamages [Henderson v. Alabama Power Company, 627 So.2d 878 (Ala. \n1993)].\n\n  Given the inability of State legislatures to carry through on reforms \nthat they conclude are necessary, Federal action in the area is the \nonly viable course through which to attack lawsuit abuses.\n  The bill corrects a variety of problems, and it does so in a \nreasonable, modest manner. This is not a radical bill. In fact, it is a \nvery modest bill. It has been criticized for being too modest.\n  As for the details of how this bill works, the specific provisions of \nthe bill correct certain inequities in the law as it stands and makes \nthose corrections uniform nationwide. At the same time, it allows \nState-to-State variation of the law within certain protective \nboundaries so that, for example, States will be free to prohibit \npunitive damages altogether or take other steps to toughen the law. In \nthat way, the bill seeks to balance and accommodate the State and \nFederal roles.\n  The alternative dispute resolution section of the bill, for example, \nencourages resort to alternative dispute resolution--so-called ADR--by \nproviding procedures through which parties can arrange to go through \nADR and by providing for some fee-shifting to any defendant that \nunreasonably refuses an offer to proceed through alternative dispute \nresolution.\n  I have strongly favored using means outside the court system for \nresolving disputes. This bill encourages the use of those procedures, \nbut leaves it to the States to experiment with providing various sorts \nof ADR, such as mediation or arbitration, to determine what works best \nfor their citizens.\n  Other provisions of the bill encourage responsible litigation. For \nexample, the bill contains a 2-year statute of limitations provision. \nUnder that provision, a product liability action must be filed within 2 \nyears of the date on which the injury occurred or on which the \nplaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered \nthe injury and its cause.\n  This requires parties to take action within a reasonable time after \nthey know of an injury and its cause. It will prevent late-in-the-day \nlawsuits, like one that was filed in my own State of Utah.\n  In that suit, the plaintiff purchased a Cannondale bicycle from the \nBicycle Center on Salt Lake City in July 1986. In August 1986, the \nplaintiff fell off the bicycle when, he claimed, it suddenly stopped. \nNow, at that point, he knew he was injured and knew that his injury was \ncaused by falling off the bike. However, it was not until 3 years \nlater, in August 1989, that he filed suit against Cannondale and \nagainst the bike shop.\n  The plaintiff acknowledged in court papers that he did not think of \nfiling \n[[Page S5587]] suit at the time of the accident. He admitted that he \nonly became interested in litigation after seeing a report on \ntelevision about a successful personal injury lawyer from San \nFrancisco. That was the sole reason explaining why the lawsuit was \ndelayed for so long.\n  I have nothing against parties seeking representation of counsel and \ngetting legal advice so they know what their legal rights are. And I \nhave nothing against the plaintiff being compensated for his injuries \nif the bicycle manufacturer and the bicycle shop really were at fault.\n  However, I do have a problem with lawsuits driven solely by \naggressive trial lawyers rather than by real people who face real \ninjuries for which they deserve compensation. Potential defendants \nshould not be forced to wait for a prolonged period of time with no \nidea that an injury may have occurred involving a product they made or \nsold. When that happens, key employees with relevant facts may have \nmoved on, memories may have faded, and records may be lost or \ndiscarded.\n  Even if defendants can successfully defend such suits on the merits, \nas occurred in the Utah case, substantial litigation costs are once \nagain incurred.\n  This product liability bill includes numerous other provisions to \nencourage responsible litigation and to ensure that liability is \nimposed only on truly responsible parties rather than on whatever deep \npocket a plaintiff's attorney thinks can be picked successfully.\n  To that end, for example, the bill imposes liability on product \nsellers--rather than manufacturers--only under certain circumstances in \nwhich the product seller actually is responsible for the safety of the \nproduct it sells. If, for example, the seller fails to exercise \nreasonable care with respect to a product and in so doing causes an \ninjury, then the product seller may be liable. A product seller should \nnot be able to be held hostage to a lawsuit, however, where the damage \nis the responsibility of the manufacturer and where the plaintiff can \nand should be suing the manufacturer.\n  Along similar lines, the bill provides that those who rent or lease \nproducts should only be liable in situations similar to those in which \nproduct sellers can be liable--that is, where they themselves have \nactually been negligent or otherwise\n responsible for the harm and not where they are simply in the chain of \nsupply and have done nothing wrong.\n\n  Likewise, liability against biomaterials suppliers--who supply raw \nmaterials for use in life-saving and life-enhancing medical devices--is \nalso limited to apply only in circumstances where the raw material \nsupplier should be responsible for the ultimate end use of the \nmaterial, for instance, where it supplied material in accordance with \ncertain specifications and the material did not meet those \nspecifications.\n  The bill also provides a defense if the injured party was intoxicated \nor under the influence of drugs at the time of the accident and if the \nintoxication or drug-use was more than 50 percent responsible for the \nharm caused.\n  The bill reduces damages if harm is caused by any misuse or \nalteration of the product. And, the bill provides that an employer may \nnot be able to recover from a manufacturer any workers compensation \nbenefits that the employer paid out to an injured employee if that \nemployer was, in fact, responsible for the harm--for example, if the \nemployer encouraged the worker to operate a machine improperly.\n  In another provision that places responsibility where responsibility \nshould lie, the bill limits joint and several liability. Under joint \nand several liability law as it stands in many States, manufacturers \nand others in the chain of production can be held responsible for \nstriking amounts of damages for harm that they did not cause--just \nbecause another defendant cannot or will not pay its fair share.\n  How is it fair that a party judged to be only 30 percent at fault \npays 100 percent of the damages? This bill strikes a fair balance by \nproviding that joint and several liability in product liability cases, \nin State or Federal court, is limited only to economic damages. Thus, \nan injured person will always be ensured of receiving full compensation \nfor economic loss so long as some defendant who is legally liable is \ncapable of paying that loss.\n  As to noneconomic loss, the bill provides that responsible parties \nwill be responsible for covering that share of the loss for which they \nare responsible. This fairness approach means that defendants will for \nthe most part be responsible for the harm they cause rather than the \nharm of other defendants.\n  As one final point, I note that the threat of having to bear \nresponsibility for harm caused by another party is not the only threat \nthat has skewed the incentives in our legal system. The possibility of \nexorbitant punitive damages awards has grown so that it effectively \namounts to legalized extortion.\n  The threat alone of excessive punitive damages forces parties to \nsettle under conditions in which they otherwise would not. We need to \nput an end to extortion by litigation and curb practices further \nharming our economy and threatening our small businesses with claims \nthat exceed their net worth.\n  In my own view, limitations on punitive damages should apply to all \ncivil actions--not just product liability actions. Volunteer \norganizations, blood banks, restaurants, and everyone else subject to \npunitive damages deserve these commonsense safeguards. And, whether \nbusinesses face product liability lawsuits or some other civil \nlawsuits, the same harm is done to our economy, our interstate \ncommerce, and to our society.\n  If businesses face outrageous punitive damage awards in some States, \nthey must impose the increased litigation and insurance costs on \nconsumers in all States. Likewise, the costs to workers are passed on \nthroughout the Nation when a company must defend outrageous claims in \none State and then has correspondingly fewer resources to spend on \nexpansion and growth in other States. That occurs whether the lawsuits \nare product liability actions or are fraud, breach of contract or other \ntypes of civil lawsuits.\n  I intend to join Senator Dole and others in seeking adoption of an \namendment to address these matters.\n  Similarly, I believe the joint and several liability reform in this \nbill should be extended to all civil actions.\n  I hope that we will soon consider addressing those problems as debate \non this legislation progresses. Again, I thank Senators Rockefeller and \nGorton for their leadership and commend them for their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to thank and congratulate my friend \nfrom Utah not only on his support, but on his eloquence and on his \nunderstanding of the values involved in this debate and for his \neloquent statement of the case for this bill.\n  I believe that we will have several other opening statements during \nthe course of the afternoon. And my friend and colleague, the primary \ncosponsor of the bill, the Senator from West Virginia, will be here \nmomentarily. I believe the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] wishes \nto speak.\n  I will make only one brief comment with respect to the position \nstated by my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, and that has to \ndo with the alleged inconsistency of believing that it is appropriate \nto delegate some responsibilities on which Congress has done a poor job \nto the States, while to a certain extent providing for uniform rules \nwith respect to product liability. If the position of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is that it is appropriate to delegate those other \nresponsibilities and inappropriate to federalize these and that had \nbeen the position of those who wrote the Constitution of the United \nStates, I suppose we would still be operating under the Articles of \nConfederation.\n  But, Mr. President, those who did write our Constitution expressly \ngave to Congress control over interstate commerce. That is an express \nline, an express section in the Constitution of the United States. It \nis up to the Congress to determine the degree to which interstate \ncommerce is so implicated in a particular business or profession as to \nnot only authorize but perhaps to require legislation at this level. \nAnd it is very difficult, Mr. President, to think of a single field in \nwhich interstate commerce is so important as it is \n[[Page S5588]] in the manufacture and distribution of actual hard goods \nin our national economy.\n  It really does not matter in the American system whether or not goods \nare manufactured in South Carolina and sold in the State of Washington \nor in the State of Minnesota, or manufactured in the State of Minnesota \nor Washington and sold in South Carolina. Almost every significant \nmanufacturer sells its goods in every State in the country. As a \nconsequence, the burden of a legal system which encourages litigation \nin which results are likely to be dramatically different in one State \nthan in another--a fact, incidentally, known to most trial lawyers who \nsee, obviously, the most favorable forums for their litigation--calls \nfor a degree of uniformity. The desire that American industry be more \ncompetitive, the desire that American industry spend freely on \nresearch, the desire that American industry develop products as a \nresult of that research, the desire for the kind of competition which \ncauses lower prices to consumers is obviously in the national interest. \nWhen it has been demonstrated so dramatically that the present system \ndiscourages research and development, it causes many manufacturers that \nabandon particular fields, sometimes totally and sometimes leaving them \nto monopolies or quasimonopolies. When consumer prices in certain areas \nare so adversely affected, it is appropriate that we seriously consider \nwhether or not we cannot consistently, with justice, provide for a more \nuniform system than we have at the present time.\n  Does this bill entirely nationalize it? No, of course not. It would \nbe inappropriate to do so. Does it make it more uniform? Yes, Mr. \nPresident, it does. That has no more relevance to whether or not we \nshould continue to maintain a nationalized welfare system or perhaps a \nmyth that it has been a failure and that we need State experimentation. \nThere is no relevance between the two. Each should be judged on its own \nmerits. This should be judged on its own merits. And to say that there \nare somehow or another seventh amendment of the Constitution \nimplications, again, Mr. President, seems to me to be an equally \nbizarre argument.\n  Every jury is subject to the law. Every jury is instructed as to what \nthe law is. Juries are instructed on the degree of the burden of proof \nand the like, and juries determine facts. Nothing, not one line, not \none phrase of this bill, deprives any jury of the right to determine \nmatters of fact which come before it. It sets up a framework--we \nbelieve a just and balanced framework--for one relatively small but \nvitally important field of litigation, perhaps the single field of \nlitigation in which interstate commerce is most implicated. It does \nthat, and it does that in a way which does not deny justice or full \ncompensation for any injury subject by reason of the negligence of a \nmanufacturer, Mr. President.\n  There are no caps in this bill on compensation, on compensatory \ndamages of any kind. But it does make somewhat more predictable the \ncourse of litigation, somewhat lowers the cost of litigation. And, Mr. \nPresident, I suspect that no actual victim is likely to suffer at all. \nBut I am convinced that the transaction costs for lawyers and expert \nwitnesses and the like, which now eat up way more than half of all of \nthe money that goes into the product liability system, that those \ntransactional costs will be significantly lessened by the passage of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5571-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5588-S5591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that the privilege of the floor \nbe granted to the following members of the Senators staffs. I send the \nlist to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what you have is, as the Senator from \nWashington just talked about, punitive damages. You have a procedure \nwhereby you might have willful misconduct, but under this particular \nsection, 107(2):\n\n       Inadmissibility of evidence relative only to a claim of \n     punitive damages in a proceeding concerning compensatory \n     damages. If either party requests a separate proceeding under \n     paragraph (1), in any proceeding to determine whether the \n     claimant may be awarded compensatory damages, any evidence \n     that is relevant only to the claim of punitive damages as \n     determined by applicable State law, shall be inadmissible.\n\n  That tells you they have really worked this measure over, and they \nwant to keep out the evidence in the regular trial of a case of willful \nmisconduct. They want to keep that out of the attention of the jury \nhearing the case.\n  Right to the point of punitive damages, Mr. President. I have \nlistened to Jonathan S. Massey, an attorney who testified in our recent \nhearings as having handled punitive damage awards before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I asked him, ``You know, I was just thinking that the \naward of punitive damages in the Pennzoil versus Texaco case of $3 \nbillion in punitive damages, how did that compare to all product \nliability cases?''\n  Just go back 30 years to 1965 and see what we really can find out. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me, \nalong with punitive damage awards from 1965 to the present.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: At the hearing on April 4, 1995 \n     before the Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce, and Tourism \n     Committee of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation on S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act \n     of 1995, you asked me to compare the $3 billion in punitive \n     damages awarded in the Pennzoil v. Texaco case with the sum \n     of punitive damage awards in all product liability cases \n     since 1965.\n       The attached pages show that punitive damage awards in \n     products liability cases since 1965 come to a fraction of the \n     $3 billion figure. For products liability cases in which the \n     punitive damage award is known, the total comes to \n     $953,073,079. There are 109 additional cases in which the \n     punitive damage award was not reported by the court or either \n     party, most likely because it was not large. If one were \n     extrapolate for those 109 cases by taking the average award \n     in cases in which the punitive award is known--which would \n     err on the side of inflating punitive damage awards in \n     products liability cases--the total of punitive damage awards \n     in all products liability cases--the total of punitive damage \n     awards in all products liability cases since 1965 would come \n     to only $1,337,832,211--less than half the award in Pennzoil \n     v. Texaco.\n       I hope this information is of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jonathan S.

Mr. President, that goes right to the heart of what \nthey are really concerned about. They are concerned about these \nmanufacturers making more money. They are not concerned about punitive \ndamages. If they were concerned about punitive damages--and we will \nlist, when we have more of the Senators in town here that are not \npresent here on this Monday afternoon, we will list the punitive damage \nawards with respect to these corporations suing corporations.\n  My understanding of punitive damages is willful misconduct. But if \nthere is an abuse of the awards of punitive damages to justify this \nnational concern, it would be at the manufacturer or the business or \nthe contract level, not that of individuals injured on account of the \ndefective product bringing their cases in tort for product liability. \nThere is no question about it.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator points out how he is concerned about \nconsumers. He says this money goes to consumers, consumers, consumers. \nI refer to the distinguished chairman of our Judiciary Committee, the \nSenator from Utah, my good friend, for whom I have the greatest regard.\n  We have listed and already put into the Record certain organizations, \nand among those organizations opposing S. 565, is the American Council \non Consumer Awareness, the Arizona Consumers Council, the Coalition for \nConsumer Rights, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumer \nFederation of California, Consumers for Civil Justice, Consumers League \nof New Jersey, Consumer Protection Association, Consumers Union, \nFlorida Consumer Action Network, Massachusetts Consumer Association, \nMichigan Consumer Federation, the National Consumers League, the New \nYork Consumer Assembly, the Oregon Consumer League, Pennsylvania \nCitizens Consumer Council, and it goes right on down to Virginia \nCitizens Consumer Council. I can keep reading on and on.\n  Every responsible consumer organization in this country opposes this \nbill. So we should not say that we are trying to protect consumers with \nthis particular measure. The sponsors are trying to make more money for \nthe manufacturer. They are not looking after consumers. Consumers know \ndifferently.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Utah points out in his studied \npresentation, in the prepared comments--I know, as the Senator knows, \nhow we get these prepared comments. Senators tell the staff--and he has \na Judiciary Committee staff and a personal staff--``Get out and find \nthe most horrendous cases. I want to take these trial lawyers and put \nthem to rout, and I want to find the most egregious kind of claims that \ncan be thought of so in my prepared remarks I can show there is a \nnational need.''\n  Heavens above, look what he comes up with. If I try a law case I \nwould win before a fair jury.\n  This is a fixed jury, the U.S. Senate, Mr. President. This jury is \nfixed. We have 60,000 lawyers downtown here--billable hours--they come \nin and lobby for fixes. But if I had an unfettered jury and found out \nthat the best of the best, the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, \nthat conducted hearings, came up with the milk shake case of 1994 and \nfound out it went all the way to the Supreme Court of New Jersey \nagainst McDonald's, and they were vindicated, that tells me that there \nis an incompetent lawyer or he has nothing else to do. I know unless I \nhave a pretty good, strong case, I am not going to be bringing suits \nand appealing all the way about ``a milk shake that popped the top open \nas I put it between my legs as I drove off from McDonald's.'' I have \nreal work to do.\n  That case is in my favor. That shows the law is working, and it is \nworking in the State of New Jersey. One other case he had, and that was \na New York State case in 1989, and again the defendant was vindicated.\n  Now, is that the best they can bring to the U.S. Senate on a national \nneed? Come on here, we can cite cases like contracts, if we want to. We \nwill list a few of them. We have that, if that is the basis on which \nthey want to argue.\n  Here in 1989 Uncle Ben's sued General Foods over advertisements \nclaiming that Minute Rice outperformed Uncle Ben's in the slotted spoon \ntest.\n  In 1989, Walt Disney Co. sued to force a public apology from the \nAcademy of Motion Pictures, Arts, and Sciences, for an unflattering \nrepresentation of Snow White in the opening sequence of the 1989 \nAcademy Awards ceremony.\n  In 1987, Kellogg filed a $100 million suit against General Mills \narguing that Post natural raisin bran was not natural as advertised \nbecause it is coated with coconut oil and that comparative television \nads were misleading because ``extraneous material that would cling to \nthe raisins had been cleaned off.''\n Here is Kellogg suing General Mills. People here are talking about \nindividuals bringing ridiculous suits--look at these cases here. I \nthink we ought to look at these manufacturers.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In 1986, the producer of Minute Maid Orange Juice, \nCoca-Cola, sued Procter & Gamble, charging that ads for Citrus Hills \nSelect falsely claimed that the juice was made from the heart--heart--\nof the orange.\n  In 1982, McDonald's sought a temporary restraining order to prevent \nthe airing of ads comparing McDonald's Big Mac unfavorably with the \nBurger King's Whopper.\n  Come on. Is that what we are going to consider? We have work to do up \nhere. The plea here about the interstate commerce clause, taken at the \nSenator's insistence, just repeals the 10th amendment and the \nresponsibility of the several States for tort litigation. I agree with \nhim. I agree with him. Let us extend the interstate commerce clause. \nBut let us extend it to insurance companies which are, all of them, \nengaged in interstate commerce. I had one, an insurance company before \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. I guess the year was around \n1960 or 1961. I know Manny Cohen was the Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission. And I asked that that company be able to operate \nin several States. I got it approved in 13 days. I know about \ninterstate commerce and insurance.\n  I can tell you here and now, you put in a bill--if you want to see \nthe insurance lawyers all fill up that hall outside, put in there, \nunder the interstate \n[[Page S5590]] commerce clause, an Insurance Commission for the United \nStates of America, and say, ``Quit having to file your policies and \nhire lawyers racing around to the capitals of 50 States, every one of \nyour policies must be justified and administered in that particular \nState under that particular law; what we are going to have is \nuniformity. We are going to have a Federal Insurance Commission.'' Oh \nboy, talk about acting under the interstate commerce clause--you will \nsee them fight it.\n  We have to expose this fraud that has been going on for 14 to 15 \nyears. Jerry Ford was right. President Ford put it to the study \ncommission and he said leave it to the States. In the 15-year period, \nthe States have all acted and they have revised their laws and come up \nwith responsible provisions as time evolves with respect to the conduct \nof product liability litigation. But it is certainly not a national \nproblem. This thing about competitiveness, it is just totally out of \nwhole cloth.\n  I have been in the game, and we can name the industries, one after \nthe other. Not long ago, I was at Bosch, which is a German company that \nis located just outside of my hometown of Charleston, SC. They have a \n10-year contract to make the antilock brakes for all the General Motors \ncars. They make the antilock brakes for the Toyota; they make the \nantilock brakes for the Mercedes-Benz--foreign cars as well as \ndomestic.\n  When you go in to inspect their plant, they put covering over your \nshoes and a smock all the way around that you have to wear over your \nclothing, and a headpiece to make sure no dust or any kind of solutions \ncome from your hair into their particular product. In fact, it is much \nlike going through a pharmaceutical company, or film. Incidentally, I \ngot Fuji Film in South Carolina, and Fuji Film from Japan is now \ndoubling the size of their plant. They have had one there for the last \n10 years. Now they are doubling the size. They are not worried about \nproduct liability.\n  But I turn to the Bosch man--because we are awfully proud. I put in a \nsystem for technical training and have expanded upon it by sending my \nteams, having graduated, to Munich, Germany, where they--in this \nparticular case, Stuttgart--go over the German apprenticeship system \nand then instruct the employees in the German apprenticeship system in \nmy own backyard.\n  I know about productivity. I said to the gentleman who is the head of \nBosch there, ``What about product liability?''\n  He said, ``Senator, what is that?''\n  I said, ``Product liability claims; have you had any claims against \nany of these antilock brakes for defective brakes?''\n  ``Oh, no, no,'' he said. ``We have never had a claim.''\n  He said, ``If we did--'' he reached over and pulled one off the line. \nHe said, ``Do you see this little number?'' He said, ``We mark every \none of those brakes on every wheel on a car. We have a number. We would \nknow immediately, if there was a defect, where it comes from.''\n  That, Mr. President, is the quality production that has been brought \nabout by trial lawyers. They can cuss them; they can fuss. They can \ntalk about getting the fees. These cases read by the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, the two cases he had, one in New York, for the \nsupermarket; and in New Jersey, for McDonald's--those lawyers did not \nget a red cent. They wasted 3 years in time. Lawyers do make mistakes. \nI guess they made a mistake. But do not put that down as a reason for \nnationalization of product liability up here at the Washington level.\n  What happens here is that we have quality production. Companies have \ncome south to my State, having learned you have to really be outgoing \ntoward your employee force--I have watched with a certain amusement \nover the years, where we called them workers; then we called them \nemployees; now we have to call them associates. You do not dare refer \nto the work force other than as associates. Rather than the head of the \nplant parking right up at the front door, they have the Associate of \nthe Month. He parks up at the front door, or she parks up at the front \ndoor, and the manager of the plant parks way down in the boondocks. \nThey know how to do it.\n  When they eat--and I have eaten in these restaurants; they do not \nhave a Senators' eating place, and the regular folks eating otherwise, \nlike we have here. Oh, no; this is not on productivity up here. They \nall eat in the same restaurant. Yes, we know about productivity.\n  All of that has come about by not only the treatment of the work \nforce on the one hand, but the absolute care that has come about in \nrelation to the Occupational Safety and Health Act: safe machinery; \nsafe working place; and, yes, the assumption that the product, for \nwhatever particular use it is designated, is going to be a safe \nproduct. We can count on that. That housewife does not have to run home \nand test it on her children and see if it is going to blow up in their \nfaces or make them sick or any of those other things. We count on it in \nour society and it has worked and is working, and is working well.\n  To come now with this charade here that has been going on for 14 \nyears, because they can grab us Senators up in campaigns and say, ``Are \nyou for or against product liability?'' and get 15 organizations, the \nBusiness Roundtable, the chamber of commerce, and they are all coming \nin and saying, ``Are you going to be for that product liability?'' \nProduct liability? You are interested in votes, and trying to move on \nand get something done. And so, yes, you say so, and that ends that. \nAnd I am having to talk against a fixed jury.\n  But I hope some of them are listening and someone will engage in the \ndebate as we have over the past 15 years so that we can hold up this \nbad mistake. Because if we make this mistake relative to product \nliability, then we should federalize medical malpractice; we should \nfederalize automobile wreck cases; we should federalize the whole \nthing. Then we will have to build some more courthouses.\n  I think we just cut the construction money for courthouses. But let \nus--in the name of trying to bring down the size of the Government here \nin Washington, and the bureaucracy--let us build some more courthouses. \nLet us get some more Federal judges. We can all give them a lifetime \njob, we Senators. And we can have more clerks of court. Man, I am \ntelling you, we have a growth industry up here. The best way I know to \nget this growth industry going is to federalize product liability.\n  It is a sham. It is a bad mistake. The American Bar Association \nopposes it absolutely. They came up again and testified against it. All \nthe different consumer organizations are against it. Yet the sponsors \ncome here and act like they are for the consumers. They know \ndifferently. The State legislatures that handle this problem, the \nConference of State Legislatures, testified against it; the Conference \nof State Supreme Court Justices is against it.\n  Later on I will include in the Record more than 100 deans and law \nprofessors from over the entire country who will go into detail and \nanalyze this particular bill, and show how instead of this really \ngiving uniformity it gives complexity, and how, instead of saving money \nand the procedures and the bureaucracy, it increases it. And if they \nhave such a thing as the lawyers' full employment act, this would be \nthe one because you have all kinds of motions to make now under this \nparticular bill and meetings to be had, and everything else of that \nkind at the Federal level and at the State level. It is just \nfundamentally flawed; bad law. They know it, and they try to doctor it \nup so they can get this into a particular conference committee. And \nthen, of course, go right into what they call the English rule that \nthey have over in the House bill.\n  That really shows how garish this Congress can get; to take a system \nwhere people without means can have their day in court in civil \nlitigation and now are going to be denied, which I myself have taken on \nas a trial lawyer. Let me divert for a second.\n  Let me say I represented the bus company or the South Carolina \nElectric and Gas. So I represented the defendant in numerous cases of \ntort claims as well as plaintiff. But tell the average citizen who \ncannot pay for billable hours, and tell them they have no claim? And, \nyes. We had the contingent basis whereby, as I reiterated and I \nreiterate because I cannot emphasize it too much, I take on the cost as \na \n[[Page S5591]] trial lawyer. I assume that for the investigation, for \nthe interrogatories, for the discovery proceedings, for the actual \ntrial, the settlement, conferences that we had, the actual trial of the \ncase, the appeal, the printing of the briefs, the appearances, the \nentire time spent. Yes. These cases take--in serious cases--2 or 3 \nyears to get them finally determined. This trial lawyer assumes all of \nthose costs. If I win, I get a third. If I lose, I get nothing. I paid \nthose costs. That is the system that has worked.\n  If you are going to have the loser pay all, I am going to say, ``Now, \nwait a minute. I have a wife and children. Now I have grandchildren. I \nlike to help. But unless you can get me a bargain and assume the cost, \nI cannot go totally broke in this business. I have to have you take \ncare of the costs in case we don't prevail. I think you have better \nthan an even chance to prevail.''\n  However, I never can tell in the draw of a jury. That is what Judge \nIto is having to deal with now, the mindset of jurors. I cannot tell \nthe mindset. They could come in with selection of a jury, and I not \nknow it and they have some peculiar feel or prejudice, and I get 11 but \nI do not get that 12th juror. I end up losing the case, and I have to \npay it all. I think that at least you ought to be able to take care of \nyour costs if you believe in your case that much. Yes. That is the day \nin court, the trial jury.\n  The distinguished Senator from Washington says they all get their \ntrial by jury. But you read this bill based on what evidence can be \nsubmitted, you read the test to be used and the thrust that they have \nand how they allocate some of these provisions not to manufacturers. \nYou can read on page 36, line 7, ``actions excluded.'' Here is the \nunmitigated gall of this draftsmanship.\n\n       Actions for damage to product or commercial loss, a civil \n     action brought for loss of, or damage to, a product itself, \n     or for commercial loss, shall not be subject to the \n     provisions of this title governing product liability actions \n     but shall be subject to any applicable commercial or contract \n     law.\n\n  The States have their volition as to the Uniform Commercial Code and \nhow much and how they interpret it. They have their volition in the 50 \nStates as to contract law. Yes. When it comes to manufacturers under \nthis particular section, yes. We believe in States' rights there. But \nwhen it comes to injured parties, you do as we say to do. They talk \nabout a fair and balanced reasonable bill. Come on. They know better. \nThey can read. We pointed this out at the hearings. They had no excuse \nfor it. We pointed it out at the markup. They continue to insist upon \nit, and we will have amendments. We will have to come along I guess, if \nthey get cloture because they do not want to have debate. They will \nhave to have these amendments and we will have to vote on them.\n  But I think the original document itself is a pretty good example of \nwhat they have in mind. It is not a balanced bill. They had no caps \nheretofore in previous Congresses on punitive damages. They have it in \nthis one. They say they are going in a reasonable fashion, a more \nrestrictive fashion. They have the misuse provision in here now that \nthey never had before in the three previous Congresses. We will be able \nto go down on those things and see if they want to insist upon them.\n  But I can tell you what we ought to do, in this Senator's opinion, is \ntable this bill and move on to those problems that are national \nproblems. The State of Idaho is looking out for its people. It has a \nGovernor. It has a legislature. It has juries that are sworn to listen \nto the facts and bring in a verdict in accordance with the facts. It \nhas the option of the trial judge to set aside punitive damages, to \nrestrict the actual damages.\n  I am sure the States of Idaho, South Carolina, and Washington would \nmuch rather have its law than a national law up here wherein they \nthink, yes, with the Contract With America crowd in town, that we are \ngoing to start being conservative. I can tell you here and now, that \nmight last for a little while. But after a few years go you are going \nto find the liberal National Government--which has been persistent \nthroughout the years as compared to the State government, State law, \nand State practices in tort, and with respect to criminal law and \notherwise--you are going to find there is a much more conservative \ngovernment at the State level, and more responsible in my opinion, than \nthe National Government.\n  We do not have a national problem. That is the point. Yet. They have \nreally been on a roll up here for big industry and against the \nindividuals.

Mr. President, every year at this time, people of Armenian \ndescent throughout the world commemorate the anniversary of the \ngenocide perpetrated against the Armenian people between 1915 and 1923. \nThis tragedy is one of the most horrible in the history of humankind, \nyet it is often overlooked.\n  Eighty years ago today, on April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire \nlaunched a systematic campaign to eradicate the Armenian people from \nOttoman territory. In that year, hundreds of Armenian religious, \npolitical, and intellectual leaders were rounded up, exiled, and \nmurdered. During the next 8 years, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians \nwere killed through executions, during death marches, or in forced \nlabor camps. Many women, children, and elderly people were raped, \ntortured, or enslaved. In addition to those killed, an estimated \n500,000 Armenians were exiled from the Ottoman Empire, many of whom \nfound their way to freedom in the United States.\n  Recently, the campaigns of ethnic slaughter in the former Yugoslavia \nand Burundi have focused much attention on crimes against humanity. \nSilence in the face of genocide effectively encourages those who would \ncommit such atrocities in the future. As the horrors in Bosnia and \nBurundi demonstrate, ethnically based campaigns of murder are still \npossible, even as the world approaches the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, despite a long history of persecution and tragedy, the \nArmenian people have demonstrated remarkable moral strength, \nresilience, and pride, as demonstrated by the successes of Armenian-\nAmericans and the great contributions they have made to our society. \nThese qualities are also evident in the effort of the newly independent \nstate of Armenia to build a prosperous and democratic country after \ndecades of Soviet oppression, and despite the ongoing conflict with \nAzerbaijan--an effort which I personally witnessed when I visited \nArmenia in January 1992.\n  During the last year, there have been some hopeful signs with regard \nto the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan--most notably the \nimplementation of a cease-fire. I hope that the memory of the Armenian \ngenocide, as well as the sight of the suffering of the Armenian and \nAzeri peoples, will spur a peaceful resolution to the dispute.\n  The legacy of the Armenian genocide has not succeeded in deterring \nsubsequent acts of genocide. However, it is \n[[Page S5592]] only by continuing to remember and discuss the horrors \nwhich befell the Armenian and other peoples that we can hope to achieve \na world where genocide is finally relegated to the realm of history \nbooks, rather than newspaper headlines. I hope my colleagues and \nleaders throughout the world will join me in commemorating the \nanniversary today, and thus ensure that the tragedy of the Armenian \ngenocide will not be forgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5591-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  DIMINISHING PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN THE BALKANS--A FOREIGN RELATIONS \n                         COMMITTEE STAFF REPORT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, during the recess, two members of my Foreign \nRelations Committee staff traveled to Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia to \nexamine the wide range of issues related to the conflicts in the \nregion, and their implications for United States policy.\n  The situation in Bosnia is unraveling quickly, and with the Senate \nlikely to consider legislation concerning Bosnia in the coming weeks, I \nthink it is important for my colleagues to be aware of the staff's \nfindings.\n  Among other things, the staff found that as the situation in Bosnia \ndeteriorates, the United Nations may be forced to withdraw from Bosnia \nand Croatia for any number of reasons, including: a worsening security \nsituation, a shortage of world food stocks, a loss of local employees \nto the draft, or a lifting of the arms embargo.\n  The United States has pledged to participate in a NATO effort to \nwithdraw U.N. troops. According to the staff report, a NATO operation \nin Bosnia would be costly, would require a long lead time, and would \nlikely occur under hostile circumstances. The report finds that NATO is \nnot prepared to extract U.N. troops immediately should that become \nnecessary.\n  The report also raises some serious questions about the federation \nagreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems as well as about \nCroatia's intentions. It questions the prospects for peace negotiations \nregarding the Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia.\n  Finally, the report finds that Serbia is continuing to fuel both the \nKrajina and Bosnian Serb war machines. Despite this fact, last Friday, \nthe United Nations voted to extend sanctions relief for 75 days. The \nreport recommends that the United Nations resist further sanctions \nrelief until Serbia ends all assistance to the Bosnian and Krajina \nSerbs.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, we may be asked next month to vote to \nlife the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government. I believe that \nthe staff report may be a useful resource as we move into the debate. \nAccordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the key findings of the \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms and Senator Pell: On behalf of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, we travelled to Croatia, \n     Bosnia, and Serbia from April 7 through 15 to examine the \n     wide range of issues related to the conflicts in the region, \n     and their implications for U.S. policy.\n       In Croatia, we visited Zagreb, Osijek, and in Sector East, \n     Vukovar, the border crossings at Batina Bridge, Lipovac, and \n     other areas. We visited Mostar, the largest city in the part \n     of Bosnia controlled by the Muslim-Croat federation. We were \n     unable to visit Sarajevo as planned due to the closing of the \n     Sarajevo airport as our plane was enroute to the city. The \n     airport remained closed throughout our visit to the region. \n     In Serbia, we visited Belgrade and the Sremska Raca border \n     with Bosnia.\n       We met with Croatian and Serbian government officials, \n     opposition leaders, religious leaders, foreign and local \n     journalists, academics, local citizens, military and civilian \n     representatives of the United Nations Protection Force \n     (UNPROFOR), the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees \n     (UNHCR), NATO, and of international and local non-\n     governmental organizations. We also met representatives of \n     U.S. and foreign embassies, the European Community Monitoring \n     Mission (ECMM), Sanctions Assistance Monitors (SAMs), and \n     monitors of the International Conference on former Yugoslavia \n     (ICFY).\n       We are grateful to Ambassador Peter W. Galbraith and his \n     staff in Zagreb as well as to Rudolph Perina, the U.S. Chief \n     of Mission and his staff in Belgrade. Their cooperation was \n     instrumental to this report. We would particularly like to \n     thank Foreign Service officers Rick Holtzapple, Andrew \n     Hamilton, and Madeline Seidenstricker as well as Tim Knight, \n     of the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), for their \n     able assistance.\n       The conclusions in this report are our own, and do not \n     necessarily reflect the views of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its Members.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edwin K.

The Bosnian Serbs \n     are responding to recent limited Bosnian Government military \n     gains with brutal attacks against civilians and U.N. \n     peacekeepers.\n       The United Nations may be forced to withdraw from Bosnia \n     and Croatia for any number of reasons, including: a \n     deteriorating security situation, a shortage of world food \n     stocks, a loss of local employees to the draft, or a lifting \n     of the arms embargo.\n       The United States has pledged to participate in a NATO \n     effort to withdraw U.N. troops. A NATO operation in Bosnia \n     would be costly, would require a long lead time, and would \n     likely occur under hostile circumstances. NATO is not \n     prepared to extract U.N. troops immediately should that \n     become necessary.\n       Croatia is supporting a federation between Bosnian Croats \n     and Muslims as a means to retake Serb-controlled territory by \n     force and to annex Hercegovina.\n       Croatia's military strategy, if continued, will make \n     impossible the successful conclusion of peace negotiations \n     and lead to full scale war in the Serb-held Krajina region of \n     Croatia.\n       The agreement bringing an end to fighting between Bosnian \n     Muslims and Croats was a tremendous achievement for U.S. \n     diplomacy. That being said, however, Croats and Muslims have \n     made no progress in implementing a political and economic \n     alliance. Despite significant U.S. and European financial and \n     political support for the Bosnian federation, prospects for \n     such an alliance appear dim.\n       Serbia is continuing to fuel both the Krajina and Bosnian \n     Serb war machines. The land border between Serbia and Bosnia \n     may be ``effectively closed'' as called for by U.N. Security \n     Council Resolutions 943 (1994) and 970 (1995) but oil, \n     military equipment, and other sensitive material pass daily \n     from Serbia through Croatia's Sector East and into other \n     parts of Serb-held Croatia and Bosnia. The United Nations \n     recently voted to extend sanctions relief for 75 days. It \n     should resist further sanctions relief until Serbia ends all \n     assistance to the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs.\n       International sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro are \n     not working. Belgrade is awash in consumer goods; gasoline \n     costs less than it does in Germany; and Serbia's basic \n     infrastructure continues to function.\n       Sanctions against Serbia appear to have strengthened rather \n     than weakened President Slobodan Milosevic, who effectively \n     uses the state-controlled media to blame Serbia's economic \n     conditions on the West. Even if sanctions are not having \n     their desired impact, Serbia should not be rewarded with a \n     lifting of sanctions unless it recognizes the borders of all \n     the states of the former Yugoslavia and ends its support for \n     the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs.\n\n  Mr. PELL.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the Product Liability Fairness Act this week. The time for \nlegal reform is long overdue. I am anxious, as one Senator, to get this \ndebate underway. I particularly want to congratulate the bill's chief \nsponsors, Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller, for guiding the bill \nswiftly through the Commerce Committee, and I applaud Senator Dole's \nleadership in bringing the issue promptly to the floor.\n  I might say, having been involved in this issue for now 11 years, \ngoing back to a prior period of Republican majority as chairman of the \nCourt Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, we listened to lots of \nhearings and \n[[Page S5593]] lots of talk, and I am glad we may finally have a \nrealistic shot at civil litigation reform in this country.\n  Mr. President, while I am a cosponsor of S. 565, I also support the \neffort that will be made this week to broaden the scope of this bill. \nThe American people are frustrated with our legal system. Everywhere I \nturn, I read and hear about terrible experiences people have when they \nfind themselves inside the liability maze. People with real injuries \ntoo often do not get fairly treated. Meanwhile, too many frivolous \ncases clog the courts. The truth is the litigation system is like a day \nin Las Vegas or Atlantic City: Sometimes you can win big, but more \noften the house--that is the system, the lawyers and the courts--win \nthe biggest profits. And the money that goes to the lawyers and the \ncourt system is significantly more than the money received by the \ninjured parties. According to the Rand Corp., a full 57 cents of every \ndollar spent in the liability system is eaten up by the system itself. \nThe injured get less than half, only 43 cents, Mr. President, of every \ndollar.\n  What does this mean for the American people? It means they pay more \nfor the goods and services they buy in the economy, and it also means \nthat businesses develop fewer new products, pursue less innovation and \ncreate fewer jobs.\n  The tort tax, Mr. President, is real, and reforming our legal system \nwould mean a real tax break for the American people, a tax cut that \nwill not require an offset and will not risk the Social Security System \ntrust fund. One firm, Tillinghast, estimates that the litigation system \ncosts every individual in our Nation $1,200 annually.\n  In a recent study, the Rand Corp. looked at the overuse and abuse of \nour health care system which is driven by the litigation system. In \nexamining only the auto tort system--just for automobiles, Mr. \nPresident--Rand found that excess medical claiming, driven by the \nprospect of reaping a windfall from the legal system, consumed $4 \nbillion worth of health care resources in 1993 alone. That is the same \nyear Mrs. Clinton's task force proposed a restructuring of our health \ncare system. Evidently, the real answer is right here in our legal \nsystem. That same Rand study estimated consumers paid in 1993, $13 \nbillion to $18 billion in excess auto insurance premiums because of the \nlitigation craze.\n  So, make no mistake about it. This debate is about the economy and it \nis about taxes. If we are serious about tax relief for the middle-class \nfamily, let us reform our legal system. Let us cut the cost of an 8-\nfoot ladder by 20 percent or the doctor's fee for a tonsillectomy by 33 \npercent. We can do it by reforming the legal system.\n  The American people want us to change our civil justice system. \nSurvey after survey show the frustration of the American people with \nour legal system. For example, a couple months ago, U.S. News & World \nReport wrote that 69 percent of Americans find that lawyers are only \nsometimes or not often honest. Can you imagine? Honesty in the legal \nprofession is not seen as normative behavior. As a lawyer myself, I \nhave to say that I am horrified that such a huge majority of the \nAmerican people have reached that conclusion. Yet, the organized bar \nresists any serious or meaningful changes to the legal system.\n  Last month, the Luntz Research Group found that an overwhelming 83 \npercent of the American people think our liability lawsuit system has \nmajor problems and needs serious improvement. Sixty-four percent of the \npeople believe the liability system is out of control, costing everyone \na lot of money and doing a whole lot of damage to our economy. And 79 \npercent to 83 percent of Americans support specific reforms, such as \nreasonable limits on punitive damages, abolishing joint liability for \nnoneconomic damages, and loser pays where the judge finds the case to \nbe completely frivolous.\n  Two generations ago, lawyers acted as statesmen who moderated their \nclients' behavior. In that bygone era of the 1950's, there was 1 lawyer \nfor every 695 people. Today, there is 1 lawyer for every 290 people; \nand since lawyers thrive on conflict, they operate as gladiator-\nlitigators, ``ransack[ing] the legal cupboard for nostrums to rectify \nevery wrong, to ward off every risk and to cure every social and \neconomic ill,'' as Harvard Professor Mary Ann Glendon has written in \nher new book, ``A Nation Under Lawyers: How the Crisis in the Legal \nProfession Is Transforming American Society.''\n  The result is a sue-happy America, destructive to our democratic \nculture of debate, persuasion, accommodation, and tolerance.\n  So, make no mistake about it. We have embarked on a fundamental \ndebate about the nature of American society. The legal system, and law \nin general, is too pervasive a force in people's lives. The reforms \ndebated this week will be about returning the legal system to its \nappropriate place and to restoring fairness and certainty to the \nliability system.\n  The product liability arena is a good place to start. This bill will \ngive some relief to those who sell goods but have no role in their \nmanufacture.\n  The injured party will be able to recover, but only from the company \nthat caused the injury, that is, the company that made the product. \nSellers will only be liable for those warranties they make, or if they \ncommit some act of negligence regarding the product, or in the rare \nsituation that the manufacturer cannot be sued or has no money to pay \nthe damages.\n  This bill also relieves defendants of liability where the plaintiff \nwas primarily responsible for his or her own injuries due to the use of \nalcohol or drugs. And, the manufacturer will have limited liability if \nthe plaintiff has misused or altered the product. The bill also \nrestores the element of punishment to punitive damages, by linking them \nto the economic harm caused.\n  And, it will eliminate the deep pocket lawsuits, where a defendant \nwith a remote connection to the injuring event is held responsible for \nall the harm caused. For noneconomic damages, the bill provides for \nseveral, not joint, liability.\n  This bill also includes an important title on biomaterials access, an \nissue championed by Senator Lieberman and one which we included in our \nmedical malpractice reform bill.\n  Excessive litigation is causing important suppliers of raw materials \nused in medical devices to withdraw their raw materials from the \nmarketplace. The result is that individuals with rare medical disorders \nfind themselves without access to lifesaving medical implants.\n  The bill will shield these raw materials suppliers from liability, \nwhere they can establish they had no involvement in the design or \nproduction of the medical device. Without this reform, the litigation \nsystem will bear the responsibility for the death and injuries of \ncountless Americans. We cannot allow our runaway liability system to \nharm innocent people.\n  So, this is a good place to start the debate. We will have a number \nof amendments, including the addition of medical malpractice reform to \nthis bill, as well as amendments to broaden the punitive damages and \njoint and several liability provisions, and some provisions from a bill \nI introduced earlier this session with Senator Abraham, on attorneys' \nfees and an early offer or rapid recovery mechanism.\n  This will be a watershed debate in the Senate. There will be many \naccusations thrown at the reformers this week. The opponents will \ncharge that we reformers just want to deprive injured people of fair \ncompensation. Nothing could be further from the truth. The proponents \nof reform want to give the American people what they deserve: a legal \nsystem that is rational and fair, one that is available when they need \nit to resolve disputes, and that has some predictability and certainty \nto it, affording the injured in our society fair and adequate \ncompensation, and holding those truly responsible for the injuries \nproperly accountable.\n  The American people will be watching us and waiting for results.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Gorton, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham, who has also been heavily \ninvolved in this issue and thank them for the contributions that they \nhave made and to say I look forward with great anticipation to the \nweek's debate on this most important subject.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  [[Page S5594]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the issue of product liability reform \nis very well known now to Senators after many years. I look forward to \nthe debate that we begin today and in these coming days, because I \nbelieve the bill we are going to be considering, S. 565, Product \nLiability Fairness Act, builds upon past deliberations of this body to \nachieve reform in the moderate, bipartisan fashion which has been the \nnature in which we have approached this problem.\n  I want to pause for a moment to thank my remarkable colleague and \nfriend, Slade Gorton, for all of his efforts and counsel in crafting \nthis bill and for setting a feeling about it which is efficient, \ntemperate, wise, unemotional and lends itself to the collection of \nvotes.\n  In addition, Senator Lieberman, Senator Dodd, Senator Hatch, Senator \nMcConnell, have played really critical roles in rating this legislation \nand bringing us to this point in our deliberation. The Senate has \nconsidered the topic of product liability reform for over 14 years. And \nsix times the Commerce Committee has reported bills favorably to the \nfloor. Most recently, the committee reported out the current bill, S. \n565, by a vote of 13 to 6 on April 6. We have persisted in our efforts \nto reform the laws governing product liability because we believe that \nthe current system is broken and that we can make changes that will \nbenefit both consumers and makers of products. We have tried and, I \nthink, succeeded, in achieving balance in our effort to streamline the \nlaw along these lines. We have simultaneously reduced costs and delays \nfor both plaintiffs and defendants.\n  In 1985, when I first came to the Senate--that was my first year in \nthe Senate--and joined the Commerce Committee, I in fact voted against \na product liability reform measure pending at that time. The committee \nvote, because of my vote, was tied and the vote, therefore, failed. I \nfelt strongly that the version of the bill then being considered aided \nmanufacturers at the expense of safe products for American consumers. \nThat was my view.\n  Since then, the product liability effort has changed 180 degrees. The \nlegislation has evolved gradually into an evenhanded, moderate approach \nthat we are considering here today. Senator Gorton and I have worked \ndiligently over recent months to hone the bill that we are looking at \ntoday to ensure that it strikes the right balance between the interests \nof both consumers and business, and we do mean that. Adjustments were \nmade to reflect substantive and other concerns which we concluded were \nobstacles to the enactment of this bill. We believe we have \nsignificantly improved the legislation from earlier drafts and have \nbeen responsive to the issues which prevented earlier enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me draw my colleagues' attention to the substantive changes made \nin this year's bill compared with the version introduced in the last \nCongress. The most significant change addresses concerns that have been \nraised about excessive punitive damages, damages that are awarded to \npunish and to deter wrongdoing. This year's bill establishes a standard \nfor awarding punitive damages that is essentially unchanged from last \nyear's bill. We have, however, added a provision that requires punitive \ndamages to be awarded in proportion to the harm caused, at a ratio of \nthree times the claimant's economic loss, or $250,000, whichever is \ngreater. I might say that this approach to punitive damages is well \nwithin the construct of the law in many areas. Our rationale for this \nratio is the goal of bringing to punitive damages some relationship \nbetween the size of the harm and the punishment, a goal supported by \nthe American Bar Association, the American College of Trial Lawyers, \nthe American Law Institute and, in fact, the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Also concerning punitive damages, we eliminated the Government \nstandards defenses in last year's bill, referred to as the FDA and FAA \ndefenses, which would have prevented punitive damages for instances in \nwhich certain classes of products such as drugs, medical devices, or \ncertain types of aircraft had been certified by the Federal Government \nas safe. While I remain supportive of the concept of a Government \nstandards defense, nevertheless, a number of Senators expressed \nreservation during last year's debate about this provision, and we have \naccommodated those concerns by removing the provision.\n  Another change in this year's legislation concerns the statute of \nrepose which we have slightly modified to include a category of \nproducts known as durable goods used in the workplace. Last year's bill \nwas restricted to workplace capital goods, a slightly narrower \ncategory. Workplace durable goods are defined as having an economic \nlifespan of 3 years, or being depreciable under the Tax Code. The \nworkplace distinction, identical to last year's bill, preserves the \nintent of increasing incentives for employers to maintain the safety of \nequipment used in the place of employment, rather than shifting that \nresponsibility off to a manufacturer even after the useful life of the \nproduct in question has expired. In addition, we have moved the statute \nof repose period to 20 years. Last year it was 25 years. People will \nsay, well, that is 5 years less. Well, it may be, but it is still \nlonger than any State statute of repose anywhere in the Nation by at \nleast 5 years. I think the average is around 10 to 12 years. One State \nhas 15 years. Ours is 20 years. We think that is trying to lean a \nlittle bit toward the consumer.\n  The third significant change made prior to introduction of this \nyear's bill concerns the addition of a provision that had been part of \nlast year's House companion bill that requires a reduction of a \nclaimant's award due to unforeseeable misuse or alteration of the \nproduct. For example, if someone purchases a hair dryer that has \nattached to it a large warning label stating ``please do not use this \nin the bath tub,'' and the purchaser immediately uses the hair dryer in \nthe bath tub with probable adverse consequences, it does not make sense \nto hold the manufacturer liable for such misuse, and this provision \nwould prevent that.\n  In addition to the changes made prior to introduction, several \nsubstantive changes were made in the Commerce Committee markup of the \nbill itself. First, we incorporated a bill, S. 303, the Biomaterials \nAccess Assurance Act, introduced by Senator Lieberman and Senator \nMcCain, as title II of our committee-reported product liability bill. \nThis title of the bill is designed to ensure that needed raw materials \nare available to the manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the \nliability for firms that supply biomaterials. The title only limits \nliability for suppliers who have done nothing wrong. The ability of \nconsumers to recover from negligent device manufacturers is preserved.\n  We made several other substantive changes in the committee markup. We \nmodified our product seller provision to extend protection to blameless \nrental and leasing companies. This will address the fact that in 11 \nStates car rental companies can be forced to pay for damage caused by \npeople who rent their cars, even though the car rental companies \nobviously did not make the car and did not do anything wrong. We made a \nchange to the statute of repose that will ensure that manufacturers \nkeep their promise by enabling injured workers to sue for damage caused \nby products over 20 years old if the manufacturers guaranteed their \nproduct's safety for a longer period.\n  Finally, we modified our alternative dispute resolution provision \nwhich gives States an incentive to create proplaintiff, voluntary, \nnonbinding arbitration mechanisms.\n  This provision contains a penalty for defendants who unreasonably \nrefuse to participate in the arbitration. A criticism was raised during \nour committee hearings on the bill that greater specificity was needed \nfor the definition of unreasonable refusal, so a set of factors was \nadded to address that concern.\n  Mr. President, I will have a lot more to say about the substance of \nthe bill as this debate unfolds, but I know there is at least one other \nSenator who \n[[Page S5595]] wishes to speak, so I will keep my remarks brief. Let me \nconclude by stating the reasons we must pass product liability reform \nthis year after all of these years.\n  Under our current system, injured consumers often find it impossible \nto get just and prompt resolution. Just as frequently, blameless \nmanufacturers are forced to spend thousands of dollars on baseless \nlawsuits. The system frequently allows negligent companies to avoid \npenalties and even rewards undeserving plaintiffs.\n  Product liability law should deter wasteful suits and discipline \nculpable practices, but not foster hours of waste and endless, endless, \nendless litigation. The adverse effect of having a hodgepodge of rules \nis severe for everyone. In fact, is a rather major fact in American \nlife, I might add.\n  Injured persons and those who make products alike face a 55-unit \nroulette wheel when it comes to determining rights and \nresponsibilities. The results hurt everyone.\n  Injured persons have testified that they may be unable to obtain \nneeded medical devices for their continued health and well-being, and \nthere is a lot of very powerful testimony on that front. Manufacturers \nhave indicated that good and useful products are not placed on the \nmarket. The Brookings Institution has documented many instances where \nsafety improvements were not made because of fears about uncertainties \nin our legal system, which brings up the sort of fascinating concept \nthat manufacturers will decline to improve a product for fear that that \nlends the implication that the product that they previously had was \nsomehow insufficient.\n  It is now a fact of life in many places where they simply, therefore, \ndo not improve the product so as not to make themselves liable to that \ninterpretation, all of which, of course, is absolutely ridiculous. \nIncluded in the Brookings discussion were, for example, built-in child \nseats and air bags.\n  As I have studied this complex area, I found incentives for \npreventing accidents are often not in the right place. In formulating \nour bill, we have striven to place incentive on the person who can best \nprevent an injury. This is a matter that has not been given adequate \nattention during past debates, but given the opportunity to carefully \nstudy our bill, Senators, I believe, will see that care and thought has \nbeen invested to assure that no wrongdoer goes unpunished and that \npositive prosafety behavior is encouraged.\n  For all of these reasons I very much look forward to our debate. I \nwelcome the criticisms, the insights, and the suggestions for \nimprovements that I am sure our colleagues will contribute during the \nprocess of this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5592-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5595-S5596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRAGEDY IN OKLAHOMA--THE LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express on my own behalf, \nand on behalf of the people of the State of Ohio, our deepest sympathy \nwith and for the people of the State of Oklahoma as they cope with the \ndevastating tragedy that took place last Wednesday. Our hearts go out \nto victims and the victims' families. No one, Mr. President, could \nwatch yesterday's memorial service and see the pictures of the victims, \nthe pictures of the children, without a lump in their throat or having \nto turn away from the screen.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate the rescue workers and all the \nvolunteers, as well as the police--both the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the local police officers--who have proven to a \nconcerned America that we will, in fact, fight back against terrorism.\n  Mr. President, when Oklahoma State trooper Charlie Hanger arrested \none of the suspects in Oklahoma, he was acting on behalf of all \nAmericans. He did not know at the time, of course, that he was \narresting a terrorist. He was simply doing his job, the job that he \ndoes day in and day out.\n  He pulled over a motorist apparently for suspicion of speeding. The \nmotorist said he was driving cross-country--but the officer noticed the \ndriver had not gotten comfortable the way most cross-country drivers \ndo. He still had his jacket on. He did not have any luggage.\n  Mr. President, noticing details like that is the very heart of good \npolice work. When the motorist leaned over, the policeman saw the bulge \nof a concealed weapon and at that point arrested him.\n  Officer Hanger brought in the suspicious motorist. Subsequently, it \nturned out that the man he arrested for carrying a concealed weapon was \none of the most wanted individuals in America. All in a day's work.\n  That, Mr. President, is really what police work is. It is not \nglamorous. In fact, many times it is downright laborious, boring. To \nget that one terrorist, it takes thousands of police chasing down \nthousands of leads. Most of the leads do not go anywhere, but they all \nhave to be pursued so that ultimately the guilty can be captured. I am \nsure, Mr. President, in the days since this tragedy occurred, thousands \nand thousands of police officers thousands of thousands of different \ntimes across this country have analyzed what they were doing and tried \nto identify the composite picture and have done things that they do in \ntheir good police work, things that in most cases turn out not to lead \nanywhere, but they know that they have to do that.\n  Mr. President, the pursuit of the suspects in the Oklahoma City \nbombing proves the immense value of hard work and patience in American \npolice work. It also proves the awesome importance of technology in the \nwar against terrorism and other kinds of crime.\n  Technology and good police work have really been the key to making \nthe progress that has been made thus far in solving the mystery of this \nhorrible tragedy. Federal agents recovered a confidential vehicle \nidentification number from a fragment of a truck found at the bombing \nscene. This number led the FBI to a Ryder truck rental office in \nJunction City, KS--and that is where the composite pictures of the \nsuspects were made.\n  Mr. President, we need to do everything we can at the Federal level \nto promote the kind of cutting-edge Federal technology that makes this \npossible. I will be introducing in the near future a comprehensive \nFederal crime bill that would help hook up all of America's police \ndepartments into this Federal information data bank. It will help \nmaintain a national DNA bank to allow the local law enforcement \nofficers to identify and capture sex offenders and other violent \ncriminals. It will be a data base, Mr. President, that deals not only \nwith DNA, but also with fingerprints, also with ballistic comparisons, \nand also with information about individuals who have been convicted of \nserious offenses.\n  Mr. President, as we deal with the aftermath of the bombing in \nOklahoma City, I think there are three important tasks ahead for the \nU.S. Senate.\n  First, the Senate does need to increase the availability of crime-\nfighting technology to make this available to every law-enforcement \nofficer in every town and every community in the country.\n  Second, the Senate needs to take a very close look at how we deal \nwith the entry into the United States of individuals who are affiliated \nwith international terrorist groups. We must look, also, at what we \nshould do when we determine aliens already in this country are members \nof such groups.\n  Third, the Senate needs to examine the issue of domestic terrorist \ngroups to figure out the best way to infiltrate these extremist groups \nand then to keep tabs on their dangerous activities.\n  Mr. President, over the next few days I will be discussing my own \nlegislation in greater detail. I think that the level of attention the \nSenate gives these issues in the days to come will be one factor, a \nmajor factor, lessening the chance of another tragedy of the kind that \ntook place this past week.\n  Again, Mr. President, let me offer to the victims, the families of \nthe victims, the loved ones, our deepest sympathy for this horrible and \nsenseless tragedy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks to be recognized?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  [[Page S5596]] Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5595-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5596-S5602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMON SENSE PRODUCT LIABIL- ITY AND LEGAL REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President and my colleagues, here we go again, back \non the famous product liability reform bill. I think one of the things \nthat Members do in an effort to try to get legislation passed, I would \nsay sort of tongue in cheek, when they are uncertain about the merits, \nthey label it ``reform.'' We have had the Tax Reform Act, we have had \nthe Health Reform Act, we have had the Product Liability Reform Act, \nand no matter whether it is real reform or not, if you call it reform \nlong enough and loud enough and enough people hear it, then a lot of \nconstituents will start writing and saying, ``You have to be for that \nreform act that is pending in the Senate or pending in the House. I am \nnot really sure what it does, but if it says that it is reform, it must \nbe good and you had better vote for it if you ever want to come back \nand get reelected or speak with your constituents in any kind of \ncivilized fashion.'' I say here we are again, because once again in \nthis Congress, the Senate is going to be called upon to address what \nsome have called a Product Liability Reform Act.\n  I raise the question at this time as to why we need to be doing this \nbecause, in fact, I think this is something that, over the many \ndecades, years and years of our country's history, has been an area \nthat has been reserved to the States in order for the various State \nlegislators to look at these issues and make decisions based on what is \nappropriate and proper when it comes to dealing with the personal \ninjuries of the people who reside in their respective States.\n  Now, there are some in this Congress who will say no, we are going to \ndo it all from Washington, and we do not care how long the States have \ndone it or how intense they have been in their efforts at laying out \nsystems that make sense for the people of their respective States--no, \nwe do not care about that. We are going to take it all here, here in \nWashington. We are going to do it all from Washington because we know \nbest.\n  I suggest just this. People in some parts of our Government here in \nWashington, and some parties here, are saying when it comes to some \nsubjects like product liability reform--again, the word reform is \nattached to everything you want to change; let us reform it--they make \nthe point that States are so backwards and so inefficient and so \nineffective in handling personal injury cases, they would say that we \nare going to bring it all to Washington, but that with welfare reform, \nthe Federal Government is so ignorant and so slow and so messed up that \nwhen it comes to welfare reform, we are going to send that to the \nStates.\n  They say we are going to block grant all the welfare programs and \nrules and regulations on welfare and send it to the various States--all \n50 States. Let each State decide what is best for the people of that \nState when it comes to welfare programs and how to reform it because \nthe States know best and the Federal Government is really too slow and \ntoo ignorant to make the right decision. But when it comes to product \nliability, the States are so slow and so dumb and do not know what to \ndo we are going to take that jurisdiction away from them and bring that \njurisdiction to Washington because Washington will do a much better \njob. The inconsistency of those positions in my opinion is \nirreconcilable.\n  I would suggest that in areas where the States have worked their will \nand where they have done a good job we should leave it alone. I would \nsuggest that when it comes to product liability, the phrase ``if it \nain't broke don't fix it'' applies. I would also suggest that those who \nsay this is such a crisis of litigation that it threatens the very \nlegal institutions by which we govern ourselves, look at the facts at \nwhat is happening out there. Is there an explosion of litigation? Ask \nanybody in this body who would be willing to answer this question of \nthe amount of litigation that says we have to supercede what the States \nhave done and bring it all here to Washington.\n  I think the facts are clearly just the opposite. In all State courts \nin 1992, all tort cases or cases that people sued because of personal \ninjury in civil courts amounted to just 9 percent of the total civil \ncases filed. And product liability suits, of which we are talking about \ntoday, accounted for only 4 percent of all the tort filings in all of \nthe civil courts, in all of the State courts, in the Nation. That \namounted to .0036 percent of the total civil case load of all of the \nState courts in the United States of America--.0036 percent.\n  When we read those figures, one might ask the question. Why in the \nworld does anybody think that there is a problem? Why does anybody \nthink, if it is that small a number of lawsuits being filed that \nrepresent product liability suits, that it is such a mess that we would \nhave to take it away from the States and we are going to do it in \nWashington, we are going to make it right in Washington because we in \nWashington know best what is best for the people of my State of \nLouisiana, or any other State in the Union, that we know so much more \nabout how to solve this we are going to do it in Washington. People \nback in Louisiana say, ``Senator, are not you saying at the same time \nthat we do such a lousy job on handling personal injury product \nliability legislation in my State that you are going to take it to \nWashington but when you talk about welfare reform, Washington does such \na lousy job you want all the States to handle it?'' Why is it any \ndifferent?\n  We are talking about laws that affect the health and safety and the \nfuture of the people of a prospective State. When it comes to those \nareas I am a strong States rights Senator. I believe the rights of the \nStates should not be trampled on. The rights of the States to govern \nwhat happens within their territorial boundaries should not be \nsuperseded by the Federal Government without a legitimate and an \noverriding mandate as to why we should do it on the Federal level.\n  I would suggest that when only .0036 percent of all civil cases filed \nin State courts amount to cases filed dealing with product liability, \nthat it is not a national problem, justifying jerking the rug out from \nunder the States and say, no. Here in Washington we are going do it, \nand we are going to do it a lot better than you have been able to do it \nback home. I do not buy that.\n  I will say to my colleagues in the Senate that my own State of \nLouisiana has addressed these problems, and they have handled it in the \nState legislative bodies. Interestingly enough, some people say, \n``Well, this is a big battle between business and plaintiffs. It is a \nbig battle between the people who get sued and the people who do the \nsuing. And there are too many people doing the suing. So we have to \npass legislation in Washington to protect those who are getting sued.'' \nThat is not so where I come from because I asked the Congressional \nResearch Service to compare the legislation that is pending in the \nSenate, and legislation passed the House as well with the laws that we \nalready have on the books in Louisiana. Do you know what they found? \nHere is the concluding paragraph. This ought to knock somebody's socks \noff who is saying we should be doing what some have suggested.\n  Conclusion: H.R. 956, which I understand is the pending bill, the \nHouse passed product liability bill. H.R. 956 would be more favorable \nto the plaintiffs than is Louisiana law with respect to product seller \nliability.\n  I repeat that again. The bill before the Senate would be more \nfavorable to plaintiffs than is Louisiana law with respect to product \nseller liability. This is from the Congressional Research Service dated \nMarch 17, 1995. Therefore, if businesses say we get sued too much, we \nknow we need changes in the law and we want more protection, my \ngoodness. The bill that we have pending before us today on the Federal \nlevel is more favorable to the plaintiffs than what Louisiana has \nalready done to limit product liability suits and to make it more \ndifficult to prove damages and to recover. Louisiana has already \ndrafted legislation. It is on the books. It is the law of the land in \nmy State.\n  [[Page S5597]] Therefore, I argue not whether we should be benefiting \nplaintiffs or whether we should be benefiting those who make defective \nproducts. My argument is that we should not be taking this jurisdiction \naway from the States who have had to address these issues, for \ncountless numbers of years. The States know the needs of people and \nthey know the needs of the companies that produce products that operate \nin their respective States. The question is; and I will ask it until \nsomeone can give me a good answer. Why is it necessary to usurp the \njurisdiction of the States and make the argument that some things the \nFederal Government knows best and we are going to handle it here in \nWashington?\n  When I was in law school they used to call it forum shopping. They \nused to say you pick the district where you want to file the suit \ndepending on the type of judge you have, and you file it where you have \nthe best judge for your particular cause. If you are a defendant or a \nplaintiff, you forum shop. I would suggest that the companies that are \nconcerned about defective products that they may have produced, say in \nsome States we get a good deal but I bet we can get a better deal if we \nbring it to Washington. So let us forum shop. Let us see if the U.S. \nCongress can take away all the jurisdiction from the States and bring \nit all to Washington because big brother in Washington knows better \nthan the people of our respective States.\n  I just cannot get passed the point argued by some people. On welfare \nreform, the Federal Government is so dumb we are going to give it all \nto the States. But on product liability the States are so dumb we will \ngive it to the Federal Government. That is forum shopping. Pick the \nissue and find where you are going to handle it, pick the best forum, \nthe best results on a particular issue.\n  The point I am trying to make here today is the States have in fact \naddressed product liability. For my State, as the CRS has concluded, \nthe Federal bill is better for plaintiffs than our State law. But I \nside with the States. I side with my legislatures who have looked over \nLouisiana and said this is what the people of my State want. This is \nwhat is best for our State. They passed it by majority vote. The laws \nhave been signed into law by the Governor of our State, and it is the \nlaw of the land. For the life of me I cannot decide why that should be \nchanged and have everything sent to Washington for a change.\n  In addition to that, I am concerned about the fairness of this \nlegislation. I do think it is one-sided. I do think on the Federal bill \nwe do not treat people who are injured with the same rights and the \nsame standards as we do the people who have made defective products. \nThat is not fair. If there is anything we ought to be following as our \nguideline on legislation that affects human health and safety, it is \nfairness. It is how people are treated, both who make the products that \nare defective and that cause injuries and how we treat people who are \ninjured by those defective products. Nobody should have an advantage. \nWe should speak of fairness. We should speak of a level playing field. \nEverybody should be treated equally.\n  But I will assure you that my reading of the legislation S. 565 does \nnot provide any basic system of standard of fairness. Let me give you \nan example. The bill S. 565 provides a series of hurdles and \nlimitations on the ability of people who are injured, that they have to \ncross over in order to be able to recover from manufacturers who make \ndefective products. But it expressly exempts business from many of the \nsame requirements that we put on individuals who are injured, many of \nthem quite seriously by defective products. The standards, in other \nwords, for the people who are injured and what they have to show and \nwhat they have to prove in order to get recovery from their bodily \ninjury is different from the standards that this bill places on \nbusiness, when they have injuries that are economic injuries caused by \nthe same defective products.\n  I would suggest that is wrong; that is not fair; that is not \nbalanced; that is not a level playing field. Let me give you an \nexample. If company A, for instance, purchased a piece of equipment \nfrom company B, and that piece of equipment was defective and one day \nexplodes, company A that bought it could sue company B that \nmanufactured for the economic injury they suffered. They could sue for \nthe loss of profits they would have made if that piece of equipment had \nnot broken or exploded. They could sue the company that sold them that \nproduct for all of their lost profits caused by the disruption of that \naccident.\n  On the other hand, let us take the family of the poor worker who was \noperating that machinery which exploded in the same factory. When he or \nshe brings their case to the courts of the land under this legislation, \nthey must face limitations and hurdles in order for them to recover.\n  To make matters even worse, under the Senate Commerce Committee's \nversion of the bill, if that machinery, for instance, had been in place \nfor 20 years or more, the injured person in the family could not even \nbring litigation to recover any of their losses for their injuries \nwhile the business would not be restricted in any way.\n  Why is it all right for the business to be able to sue for lost \neconomic profits because of a piece of defective equipment but the \nindividual who may be injured physically by this same piece of \ndefective equipment is somehow prohibited from bringing a case against \nthe company merely because it had been in place for maybe 20 years?\n  What is fair about that? Why should they not both be prohibited from \nbringing the case or both allowed to bring a cause of action for \ndefective equipment? How can you say this is fair?\n  I talked a little bit about punitive damages. It is really \ninteresting; remember when I talked about Louisiana, that we have \nalready addressed this? In Louisiana, there are no punitive damages, \nperiod--none--for product liability. You cannot get punitive damages \nfor a product liability case in Louisiana. That is what the legislature \nsaid. That is the law of our land. This bill allows it. This bill says \nwe can have punitive damages limited to $250,000 or three times \neconomic losses of the person who is injured.\n  Now, I do not know why there is a huge rush to do this in the first \nplace. My State has done it. I wish they had not done it. I disagree \nwith it. But this bill says punitive damages--which are intended to say \nto a manufacturer, you have done wrong; do not do it again; you will be \npenalized--will be limited to $250,000 or three times the economic \ndamages. That sounds like an awful lot if it is a mom and pop product \nmanufacturer, but if it is an international business? Does it mean a \nlot to them, when they may make more than that in profits in an hour? \nIs it really a deterrent to say you are only going to be able to have \npunitive damages of $250,000 or three times economic losses? If I was a \nbig international manufacturer and I saw that my punitive damages were \ngoing to be limited, why worry about it. That is just the cost of doing \nbusiness. I am going to make the product, sell a lot of it and if \nsomebody litigates this and takes 4 or 5 years to finally get a \njudgment against me, I will just pay the judgment and if the punitive \ndamage is so low, why worry about it?\n  This is the point I wish to make here. I do not know why people think \nthere is such a rush of litigation that provides for punitive damages \nthat we need to change the law. The statistics I have show only 355 \npunitive damage awards in product suits occurred from 1965 to 1990. \nThat is in the Nation. Only 355 cases between the years 1965 and 1990 \never awarded punitive damages, and half of these awards were reduced or \noverturned on appeal. And in three fourths of these cases the \ndefendants took steps to improve the safety of their product. Of \ncourse, that is the point of having punitive damages. They say to a \nmanufacturer of a product that they knew was defective or likely to be, \nwe want you to make some changes; we want you to do things differently. \nThe threat, even a small threat of punitive damages for detective \nproducts makes a great deal of sense and should not be changed.\n  This portion of the bill, quite frankly, discriminates against low \nand middle income people. I think it discriminates against women, \ninfants and children by limiting the damages to three times the \neconomic injury or $250,000.\n  I give you an example. The same type of lawsuit for a defective \nproduct against company A. The product causes \n[[Page S5598]] injury to an insurance executive or a businessman who is \nmaking $1 million a year and doing very well in society. Now, compare \nthat with the same injury from the same product to perhaps an ordinary \nhousewife who is not employed except within the home, is not employed \nas a salaried person. If the injury causes the executive to miss 1 year \nof work and causes the housewife to miss 1 year of work, the executive \nwould be able to receive $3 million in punitive damages--three times \nhis economic loss. And, for the same conduct, the housewife would only \nreceive a very small amount, $250,000, for the same type of injury, in \nthe same case, with the same defective product. I do not think that is \nfair.\n  So I will conclude. We will have a lot of time to debate this over \nthe period of time that is allotted for us to consider this \nlegislation. But the two points I have tried to make today are quite \nsimple. No. 1, the States are already doing this. And to all Members of \nCongress who have stood in the Chambers of the House and Senate over \nthe years and said I am for States rights, the Federal Government \nshould not interfere where it is not necessary, the Federal Government \ndoes not always know best--the people of the States know what is best \nas communicated through their State legislatures--I say that we should \nnot be yanking the rug out from under the States. We should not be \nusurping the power of the States to handle personal injury legislation \naffecting the people of that State concerning products that injure \nthem.\n  Point No. 2 I think is equally simple and not difficult to \nunderstand. The legislation that is before the Senate at this time is \nsimply not fair. It is simply a piece of legislation that discriminates \nagainst those who have and those who do not have. The goal of this \nlegislation should not be for us to try to make it better for one \ncategory of Americans over another category of Americans; that the goal \nshould be to create a system of balance, a level playing field, and a \nsystem of fairness for all of our citizens, whether they be businesses \nthat make products or people who use those products. It should not be a \nguiding light for us to say we are going to do everything we can to \nhelp those who make the products but discriminate against those who use \nthe products.\n  I think in the couple of cases that I have tried to cite this bill \ndoes not provide the fairness that we as Members of this body should be \nstriving to accomplish through this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on this legislation as the \ndebate continues but at this point I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment preliminarily on \nthe pending legislation, and it is my view that some reform would be \nuseful--illustratively, the alternative dispute resolution or perhaps \nthe collateral source rule which would limit a recovery where the \nplaintiff has already been compensated by insurance proceeds.\n  It is true, as to the collateral source rule, that the plaintiffs \ncontend they should not be foreclosed because they have paid for the \ninsurance, but there are valid considerations I think in such a \nsituation where having been compensated there should not be a double \nrecovery.\n  In looking at this legislation, it is my view that we must exercise \ncare in what we do here and that we must proceed with a scalpel and not \na meat ax, and that, as the Founding Fathers declared it, the Senate \nshould function as the saucer to cool the tea which has come from the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  As a practicing lawyer, I represented both plaintiffs and defendants \nin personal injury cases, represented both sides in security act cases. \nIn my early days in the practice of the law with the Philadelphia firm \nBarnes, Dechert, Crassmeier and Rhoads, which later became Dechert, \nPrice and Rhoads, I represented the Pennsylvania Railroad in the \ndefense of personal injury cases.\n I represented a plaintiff in a widely noted product liability case.\n\n  In the course of that activity in the practice of law and having been \non the Judiciary Committee for the past 14 years-plus, it is my view \nthat the Congress should proceed with caution in altering the decisions \nof the courts which have been built up over many years, many decades, \nreally many centuries.\n  As was pointed out in the treatise on the American Law of Torts by \nStewart M. Speiser, Charles F. Krause, and Alfred W. Gans, tort law has \nbeen used to control behavior for over 2,000 years. As Prosser and \nKeeton on the law of torts point out, the tort rules, including product \nliability, are evolutionary accretions, and the decisions on which they \nare based have been handed down by the courts in a very methodical way \nwith extraordinary analysis over long periods of time.\n  The seminal case was the decision in England in Winterbottom versus \nWright, where the broad language of Lord Amiger laid down the first \nrule that the original seller of goods was not liable for damages \ncaused by their defects to anyone except his immediate buyer or one in \nprivity with him. That rule stood for a very long period of time until \nthe celebrated case of McPherson versus Buick Motor Co., where Judge \nCardozo of the New York Court of Appeals, the highest appellate court \nin New York, later Justice Cardozo, ruled that a manufacturer was \nliable for negligence to the buyer of an automobile, a rule that now \nseems strange that it had to be a change in the law to say that the \nmanufacturer would be liable to the person who ultimately bought the \nautomobile as opposed to limiting the claim of the buyer of the \nautomobile to a company which sold him the car and then leaving it up \nto that company to go back to the manufacturer.\n  Early in my own legal career, I had an occasion to litigate in some \ndepth a product liability case captioned Thompson versus Reidman and \nGeneral Motors. That case achieved some note, having been reviewed in \nlaw review articles because it established a new rule which enabled a \npassenger in an automobile to sue the seller of the automobile, Reidman \nChevrolet Co., and also the manufacturer, General Motors.\n  It seems that such a decision back in 1961, when it was cited as one \nof the important cases in the law of the development of product \nliability in the law of torts by Prosser and Keeton that by the \nhindsight of the intervening years seems strange that there would be \nany question about the standing of a passenger in an automobile to sue \nthe seller of the automobile, Reidman Motor Co., and the manufacturer. \nBut it was. And it is an indication of the kind of accretion, or what I \ncall encrustation, of the common law that I studied in great depth in \nthe course of bringing that litigation as a plaintiff's lawyer. When I \nrepresented the passenger, a man named Pete J. Thompson, against the \ndriver of the automobile, William Gray, who was a sergeant in the \nmilitary, and did not learn until some 2 years and 9 months after the \nincident that the cause was a stuck accelerator pedal and then found \nthat the statute of limitations, 2 years in the State of Pennsylvania, \nhad expired. Then I took a look at the Uniform Commercial Code, which \nhad a 4-year statute of limitations, and sought to sue on behalf of the \npassenger against Reidman, which sold the car, and General Motors, the \nmanufacturer. I faced a motion to dismiss. And the prevailing law at \nthat time was that a passenger could not collect because the passenger \nwas not in privity. And that is the legal term where the individual did \nnot have a contract with the seller of the automobile, Reidman Motor \nCo., as did the buyer, William Gray. And there was no privity that the \npassenger had with General Motors.\n  I argued that the court ought to create an exception to the privity \nrule because it was an analogy to the guest in a household. The Uniform \nCommercial Code had established a standing of a guest in a household to \nsue the seller of a product, like a toaster or an oven, or the \nmanufacture of the product. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania decided in my favor.\n  As I say, the case was noted in some of the law reviews. And then, a \nplaintiff in Allegheny County noted it and filed a lawsuit out of \nprivity and the case went to the State supreme court which decided that \nprivity was necessary as a matter of Pennsylvania \n[[Page S5599]] law. The rule is that on substantive decisions, under \nErie versus Tompkins, it is the State law which governs. Then General \nMotors and Reidman Chevrolet Motor Co. came back to the eastern \ndistrict court and moved to dismiss and the judge reversed himself and \nmy case was thrown out of court, as the expression goes.\n  In the course of that litigation, it was quite an extensive research \njob that I undertook to give me some substantial appreciation of how we \ncome to these rules of law.\n  While not directly relevant from the point of view of product \nliability, I then found an exception to the statute of limitations \nunder the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940, even though \nthis was many years later, and was able to press the claim in tort and \nultimately took the case to trial and after several days of trial \nreceived a settlement in the case.\n  But I refer to the decision at some length because of the insights \nwhich I gained from that decision. And as I sit through the markups in \nthe various committees--and the markup, for those who may be listening \non C-SPAN and are not familiar with precisely what we do, is where we \ntake a bill in a committee and decide how we ought to change the law or \nwhat law we ought to make as a matter of public policy. These markups, \nwhere we write the legislation which later comes to the floor, follow \nhearings where very frequently, although there are maybe 18 members of \nthe committee, as, for example, on the Judiciary Committee, there are \nonly one or two present. It has been my observation that our markups do \nnot necessarily reflect the epitome of reason and experience as we do \nthe best we can.\n  So that, by contrast, to the way the encrustations occurred in the \njudicial decisions since 1842, when these issues were considered, \nthrough the 1916 case in Buick versus McPherson and the 1961 decision \nthat I personally participated in in Thompson versus Reidman and \nGeneral Motors, I approach the field of legislative changes in tort \nliability with some substantial concern.\n  The issues which we are considering were considered, to a substantial \nextent, in a law review article which I think is worthy of some \nreference by Prof. Gary T. Schwartz from the UCLA law school, as \npublished in the Georgia Law Review in the spring of 1992. And the \npoint that Professor Schwartz makes, which I think is worth noting \nhere, is the way that the courts have responded in a rational, case-by-\ncase, stare decisis way to important public policy considerations.\n  Professor Schwartz points out at page 697 of the Georgia Law Review, \nvolume 26, as follows:\n\n       Consider the New Jersey Supreme Court which had voted \n     unanimously in favor of hindsight liability in failure to \n     warn cases in Chadha and then voted again unanimously against \n     hindsight liability in Feldman 2 years later. In explaining \n     the turnabout in Feldman, the court acknowledged the heavy \n     criticism that the Chadha case had provoked in the law \n     reviews.\n\n  Then Professor Schwartz goes on to point to other changes when he \nnotes the evolution of the views of the distinguished supreme court \njustice of California's highest court, Justice Stanley Mosk. He says:\n\n       As a member of the California court in the 1960's and \n     1970's, Justice Mosk was deeply involved in the fashioning of \n     the strict products liability doctrine. In 1978, the court \n     majority, in a somewhat conservative vein, ruled the \n     principles of comparative negligence can reduce the \n     plaintiff's recovery in a strict products liability action. \n     Justice Mosk's dissenting opinion began with the complaint \n     that ``this will be remembered as a dark day when this court, \n     which heroically took the lead in originating the doctrine of \n     products liability, beat a hasty retreat almost to square \n     one. The pure concept of products liability so pridefully \n     fashioned and nurtured by this court is reduced to a \n     shambles.\n\n  Professor Schwartz continues:\n\n       Ten years later, however, Justice Mosk authored the \n     California court's opinion in Brown versus Superior Court \n     ruling that negligence principles, rather than hindsight \n     strict liability, apply in a prescription drug case. Three \n     years after Brown, however, Justice Mosk concurred in the \n     court's ruling in Anderson versus Owens-Corning Fiberglas \n     Corp. that a hindsight analysis should be rejected in all \n     cases involving a failure to warn even when the product is \n     asbestos. Indeed, Justice Mosk's concurring opinion suggests \n     that the entire doctrine of failure to warn in products \n     liability should probably be reclassified under the heading \n     of negligence. In this concurrence, Justice Mosk quotes his \n     own pure concept of products liability words from the Daily \n     and then goes on, in essence, to eat his words.\n\n  I do not expect the casual listener to be able to follow the details \nof this kind of commentary on this very complex, opaque, and difficult-\nto-understand products liability matter. But for those who are \nconversant in the field, it shows the evolution of a very learned and \nvery thoughtful supreme court justice as he works through the rules.\n  I would suggest that when the Congress of the United States seeks to \nmake changes on this very carefully calibrated law, which is a matter \nof accretion, as Professors Prosser and Keeton articulated, or \nincrustation, as others have, that there ought to be very great care \nexercised by the Congress in the procedures we undertake. Especially in \nthe context where we are functioning now in response to a mandate from \nlast November, that we ought to in this body exercise the Senate's \ntraditional prerogative of the saucer which cools the tea which comes \nfrom the House of Representatives.\n  Without going on at much greater length than what Professor Schwartz \nhad to say, I will quote his comments at page 702 of the Georgia Law \nReview to this effect, citing how there are modifications in the \njudicial decisions:\n\n       The last decade has witnessed a number of judicial rulings. \n     Thus, New Jersey has reversed itself on manufacturer's \n     liability on unknowable hazards, Illinois has engaged in an \n     interesting effort to abrogate the traditional tort of \n     attorneys' malpractice, the fifth circuit has essentially \n     overruled its presumption of causation for inherent risk-\n     warning cases, Tennessee has eliminated joint and several \n     liability, and Maryland has overturned precedents in reducing \n     the availability of punitive damages. Still, for the most \n     part in recent years, we have seen the marking by courts' \n     unwillingness to extend precedent and by their resolution of \n     open legal questions in a liability-restraining way.\n\n  When you take a look at some of the provisions of the current \nlegislation where we exonerate the seller from responsibility but leave \nthe purchaser to the manufacturer, how problemsome may that be in cases \nwhere the manufacturer may turn out to be insolvent. That determination \nmay not be made until long after the statute of limitations has expired \nas to the seller or provisions under the workmen's compensation \nsections where the employer may be entitled to greater compensation \nthan he has actually paid out.\n  It may be that useful attention may be directed to the question of \nservice or process of foreign manufacturers who come to the United \nStates to sell, but inordinately complex rules limit the ability of \nbuyers in the United States to bring in those foreign sellers or \nchanges in the rule where the issue arises as to the collection from \nforeign sellers.\n  The issue of joint and several liability is a very complex one, and \nit may be that there is some intermediate ground which will not subject \nsomeone liable for a tiny fraction, a percent or two, which is decided \nfor the entire award where all others are judgment-proof. That is \nsomething which I think has to be very carefully considered as we work \nthrough the amendments on the pending legislation.\n  Also, the issue of damages as to what will occur where you have a \ncase like the one involving the tragic death of our late colleague \nSenator John Heinz where there were tragic deaths and injury on the \nground when the plane in which Senator Heinz was flying had a landing \ngear which apparently was not going down and a helicopter from Sun Oil \ncame to try to help out. There was a collision, and the plane fell to \nthe ground in a school yard in suburban Philadelphia--tragic deaths, \ntragic burning injuries which would not have been compensated as this \nbill would limit joint liability, a liability which has been eliminated \nin some States but something which I think we have to very, very \ncarefully consider.\n  There are a series of cases which have illustrated the very dastardly \nconduct--searching for a right word not to be overly condemnatory--\nwhere you have the Ford Pinto case where there would be a classic case \nfor the imposition of punitive damages if ever one existed.\n  It was brought to light in litigation where the defendant had the \nmatter brought to light in a letter which was sent by Ford's chief \nsafety officer to \n[[Page S5600]] the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It \nwas noted in that case that Ford had sought to avoid liability or \nresponsibility to make changes in its fuel system which was located too \nclose to the rear bumper and lacked critical safeguards\n where minor collisions caused the car to burst into flames upon \nimpact.\n\n  This letter, which contained a remarkable cost analysis saying that \nthere ought not to be a change in the fuel system because the savings \nfrom 180 burn deaths and 180 serious burn injuries and 2,100 burn \nvehicles would cost $49.5 million, evaluating the deaths at $200,000 \nper death and the injuries at $67,000 per injury, and the vehicles at \n$700 per vehicle, contrasted with the cost of what the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration wanted done to change 11 million cars and \na million and a half light trucks at $11 million per car and trucks \nwhich would cost $137 million.\n  When this effort was brought to light, it showed in as clear a way as \nyou can conceive the necessity for a liability which would exceed the \nkind which is talked about here under punitive damages. Or if you deal \nwith the Dalkon shield IUD case or the asbestos cases, where in the \nface of known damage the manufacturing was done again and again and \nagain; or in the Playtex case of tampons causing toxic shock syndrome, \nor the flammable pajamas case, or the Dalkon shield. These instances \nhave to be very carefully considered when this body is undertaking a \nreview of the punitive damage issue.\n  There are several relatively recent decisions by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in this field, including one captioned TXO Production \nCorp. versus Alliance Resources Corp., decided by the Supreme Court in \n1993, and another case is captioned Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. \nversus Haislip. Both of these decisions have opinions written by \nJustice Scalia, who is noted for his conservatism. While these cases \ninvolve the constitutional issues regarding punitive damages, they have \nsome bearing on a public policy analysis which, as we know, when the \nSupreme Court of the United States takes up constitutional issues, they \nvery frequently move over into being a super legislature. Some of those \nmatters, I think, are worthy of our analysis.\n  So, Mr. President, I make these preliminary observations as we move \nto open debate on this product liability legislation, saying as I did \nat the outset that some reform would be appropriate, but urging my \ncolleagues to subject this legislation to very, very careful analysis, \nbecause we are looking at tort law developed over some 2,000 years to \ninfluence human conduct and a stream of product liability cases \noriginating in Great Britain in 1842, subject to very, very intensive \nlitigation in the United States; product liability, which is not made \nby the plaintiff's bar or the defense bar but made by the courts of the \nUnited States, and issues on punitive damages which have reached the \nSupreme Court of the United States, which have been upheld in the \nconstitutional context by justices like Justice Scalia.\n  I think the debate will prove useful. There are many issues to be \nconsidered. And as has been said earlier, I look forward to the debate \nand to an opportunity to participate extensively as we move through \nconsideration of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, wish to address Senate bill 565, the \nGorton-Rockefeller Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has just mentioned, today marks the beginning \nof a historic debate in the Senate on the need for civil justice \nreform, because more than ever in recent years there appears to be an \nopportunity for us to make some real changes in law. For the first time \nin more than two decades, the House of Representatives has debated and \npassed comprehensive legal reform legislation, including product \nliability reform, as part of its Contract With America.\n  According to a Luntz Research Co. survey, ``83 percent of Americans \ncontinue to believe that our liability lawsuit system has major \nproblems and needs serious improvements.''\n  Now the Senate, I suggest, must do its part to make meaningful legal \nreform a reality to respond to this concern on the part of the American \npeople.\n  I want to begin by commending my colleagues from Washington and West \nVirginia for their 15-year effort to bring needed reform to the \nNation's product liability laws.\n  I also agreed with the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania who \nnoted that it is important for us to be careful in the process of \nchanging this law, because our States have different versions of \nproduct liability laws and because the law has built up expectations \nover the years. I also note, however, that the roughly 2,000-year \ndevelopment of this law, as the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned, \nhas changed rather dramatically just in the time since I attended law \nschool, and that was not that long ago, Mr. President. In fact, the law \nwas quite stable until about that time.\n  So I think that because of the changes in the law and the dramatic \nimpact that those changes have had on our economy and on our society, \nit is time to reexamine what might be done and that it is important for \nthe Congress to enact reasonable reforms to protect our Nation's \nmanufacturing base from unreasonable litigation.\n  Historically, of course, America's strength has been in \nmanufacturing, where much of the wealth of our Nation has been created. \nAlthough product liability law is but a small area of tort law \ngenerally, it is also a critical area in which America is losing its \ncompetitive edge. I noted, Mr. President, that this law has changed \ndramatically since I was in law school. The year was 1964 when I began \nlaw school. Some important decisions came down, starting with decisions \nfrom the State of California, which created a new concept called \n``liability without fault.'' It is a concept that some Americans might \nhave difficulty in understanding. I myself still have difficulty \nunderstanding why someone who is not at fault can be held liable for \nliterally millions of dollars in damages. That is what the doctrine is \ncalled, liability without fault.\n  Why is the doctrine called liability without fault? Because a \nplaintiff who is injured has the right now to bring an action against a \nmanufacturer for a defective product, even though it is impossible to \nprove that there was any negligence in the creation of that defect. In \nother words, Mr. President, a manufacturer cannot have exerted every \nbit of care possible, has been as careful as one could be in developing \nthe plans and hiring the people to produce the product, and they could \nhave been as careful as possible; yet, notwithstanding all of the care \nexercised in the creation of the product, as happens, we all know it is \npart of life, a mistake is made, a defect is created and someone is \ninjured as a result. Because of that injury, and only because there was \nan injury, in this one limited area of our law the manufacturer can be \nheld liable for an unlimited amount of dollar damage because of the \ndefect, even though there was no negligence.\n  Mr. President, I said Americans might find this difficult to \nunderstand because of the historic notion in our tort law that you can \nrecover against someone who is negligent, who was not careful, as a \nresult of which you were injured and sustained damage. That has been \nthe law for 2,000 years, until 20 years ago, or 25 years ago, when the \nnotion began to be accepted that the status of the victim was the most \nimportant thing and that it did not really matter what the consequences \nwere to the manufacture of a product or to our society as a result of \nholding manufacturers of products to this standard of liability without \nfault.\n  In other words, it did not matter with respect to the financial \nstatus of a business; it did not matter whether or not it puts the \nUnited States at a great competitive disadvantage; it does not matter \nthat all due care was exercised. The only thing that mattered was that \nsomeone who was hurt had to be able to recover against someone.\n  It is so bad, Mr. President, that persons do not even have to recover \njust against the manufacturer of the product. It is enough to find \nsomeone in the case persons can sue and recover from.\n  So we identify the manufacturer of the product, we identify the \nwholesaler \n[[Page S5601]] and we identify the retailer, just to make it a simple \ncase, although there are more complex cases. And we then find that the \nmanufacturer has gone out of business or does not have enough insurance \nto cover the loss. The wholesaler, too, has gone out of business or \ndoes not have adequate insurance.\n  So despite the fact that the seller had nothing to do with this \nexcept that he unwrapped the box, put it on the shelf, and sold it to \nthe consumer, who was then injured because of the defect, despite that \nfact, the seller can also be held responsible.\n  In a case where we get a judgment against all three--the \nmanufacturer, the wholesaler, and the retailer--there is what is called \njoint and several liability. They are each liable for all of the dollar \ndamage, irrespective of the relative degree of their involvement. None \nof them, remember, were negligent, but one of them produced a product \nwhich turned out to have a defect in it that caused the damage. All of \nthem can be held liable. The notion has been accepted that all of them \ncan be liable for the entire amount, so that the retailer in this case, \nif that is the one that has the deepest pockets, as they say, the one \nthat can afford to pay, ends up paying the bill.\n  A lot of folks think that is wrong. I agree. That is why we have \njoint and several liability reform. But it does not go nearly far \nenough in this bill, as I will get to in a moment.\n  The point of this little discourse in law is simply to note the fact \nthat some things have happened to our law over the years that have, in \nmy view, not been based on common sense, not been based upon sound \nprinciples of law, but rather have been based upon the overriding \nnotion that no matter what, someone who is hurt must recover. Even if \nhe cannot find anybody that did anything wrong, and even if the party \nyou recover against did not do anything wrong, if persons can find \nsomebody that has deep enough pockets and they have something to do \nwith the incident, then nail them.\n  That has resulted in a lot of people in our country deciding not to \nget into certain forms of business. Last year, fortunately, the \nCongress amended the law very slightly with respect to the manufacturer \nof airplanes because nobody was building airplanes in this country \nanymore. I am talking not about the big commercial jets, but the planes \nthat a person would fly on the weekend, for example, or a small plane \nfor business purposes.\n  Companies have stopped making things and people have stopped selling \nthings because of this potential liability. That is why it is important \nto reform the law of product liability and why this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that we must ultimately go beyond product \nliability to comprehensively reform the entire civil justice system, \nand that this bill will be one of the ways in which we can do that.\n  In effect, we must repeal the regressive tort tax, as someone called \nit, that depletes our economy, raises prices, destroys jobs, stifles \ninnovation, and reduces exports, making America less competitive in the \nworld. This tort tax creates a capricious legal lottery that stimulates \nthe filing of lawsuits.\n  One result, a very important result, is that it causes doctors to add \nbillions to our national medical care costs each year because they must \npractice defensive medicine. They must order unnecessary tests or \nperform unnecessary procedures simply to cover the possibility that \nsomeone could claim that that last procedure or test was necessary to \nprevent some kind of harm to a patient; in other words, to do defensive \nmedicine rather than the medicine that makes the most sense.\n  In Arizona, my own State, Mr. President, medical malpractice premiums \nhave increased by nearly 200 percent just in the last 14 years. That is \nobviously reflective of the cost of the medical care which we provide. \nIt is one of the areas that requires specific attention as we reform \nhealth care in this country today.\n  Attorney's fees and transaction costs are increasingly a large part \nof litigation expenses; in fact, approaching 50 percent. I think people \nwould be interested to note, those who argue that we would be denying \nvictims the right to recover, that, in fact, half of the money \ncollected or nearly half of it goes to the lawyers--not to the victims.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce has estimated that only 40 cents of \neach dollar expended in product liability suits ultimately reaches the \nvictims. A Rand Corp. study showed that 50 cents of each liability \ndollar does not go to victims but to attorney's fees and other \ntransaction costs.\n  Toward the goal of national legal reform, S. 565 represents a small \nbut critical first step. This bill and the House bill, H.R. 956, \ncontain many similar provisions.\n  They are, very quickly, a product seller provision that extends \ncoverage of the bill to rented and leased products as well; a drug and \nalcohol defense provision does not go far enough; a provision creating \nincentive for biomaterial suppliers to make available raw material for \nuse in medical implant devices sponsored by my colleague from Arizona, \nJohn McCain, and a very important provision; and finally, a provision \nreducing judgment amounts where a product has been misused or altered.\n  Beyond the provisions, the House bill is significantly broader in \nscope, and I support most of its additional provisions. It is my \nunderstanding this body will consider more comprehensive legal reform \nlegislation later this year: Senator Hatch's Civil Justice Reform Act \nof 1995, and Senator McConnell's Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995, and I will \nsupport those efforts.\n  I will plan to offer and support amendments to S. 565 that would \nbroaden the legislative scope of this bill, more consistent with the \nHouse product. For example, I support expanding the scope of Senate \nbill 565, punitive damage reform provisions of three times a claimant's \neconomic loss or $250,000, whichever is greater, now applicable only to \nproduct liability actions, to all civil actions.\n  It is important in the medical malpractice arena, in particular, \nwhere we very seldom have a product that has created a problem, to \nlimit the liability of the physician or hospital or other health care \nprovider in order to contain the cost of health care.\n  Second, I would support expanding the scope of S. 565, joint and \nseveral liability reform with respect to noneconomic damages for \nproduct liability actions to all civil actions, which I spoke to a \nmoment ago. I will be offering an amendment to that effect.\n  Third, expanding Senate bill 565's $250,000 limitation on noneconomic \ndamages in product liability actions to medical malpractice actions, as \nwell.\n  I will also support the amendment of my colleague from Michigan \nregarding attorney disclosure requirements which would require that \nattorneys appearing in Federal court fully disclose at the time of \nretention all of the clients options, including a clear statement of \nthe terms of compensation, and to provide an itemized accounting at the \ntermination of representation.\n  I will be introducing an amendment that would preclude punitive \ndamages from being awarded if the health care producer of a medical \ndevice or drug successfully completes the FDA approval process, unless \nthere is a situation of fraud involved. I also believe that there may \nbe three other amendments necessary to this bill in order to preclude \nit from, I would say, Mr. President, having fatal flaws.\n  There is one provision which relates to alternative dispute \nresolution where the parties seek to resolve their dispute outside of \nthe tort lawsuit, and try to shorten the time and reduce the expenses. \nThere is a penalty involved for the defendant in one of those \nsituations. I believe that those provisions should be fair, equal to \nboth the plaintiffs and the defendant, and that if there is any penalty \nattached for not agreeing to participate in an alternative dispute \nresolution mechanism, that that penalty should be provided both equally \nto the plaintiffs and the defendant, rather than only being a penalty \nfor defendants.\n  Second, there is a good provision that says, where a plaintiff has \nbeen impaired by drug or alcohol use and is therefore more than 50 \npercent culpable or responsible--in some States it is called \ncontributory negligence, where plaintiff himself or herself is at least \nhalf responsible for the injuries--there could not be recovery. It \nseems to me that the principle is sound but the limitation is too \nrestrictive. Whether it is because of drug or alcohol use or because of \nlack of care or \n[[Page S5602]] concern or negligence, if plaintiff is 50 percent \nresponsible then either there should be comparative negligence or \ncontributory negligence should preclude a recovery. It should not just \nbe limited in that one situation. In fact, I can think of far more \negregious actions on the part of the plaintiff than simply being drunk \nor under the influence of alcohol.\n  Third, there is a provision that I spoke to earlier that says that, \nin a product liability case, the seller should not have to pay for the \nmanufacturer's liability. It seems to me that should apply in any kind \nof situation. In no case should the seller be required to pay for the \nmanufacturer's liability simply because you cannot find the \nmanufacturer or the manufacturer does not have insurance to pay. If the \nseller was not responsible in any way, then the seller should not have \nto pay the damages.\n  As I said, notwithstanding these areas in which I believe S. 565 \ncould be broadened, I think it is important we not allow the perfect to \nbe the enemy of the good, and therefore we should support whatever \nreforms we can accomplish. In the last 5 years cloture motions have \neffectively barred votes on the merits of bills similar to this that \nwere supported by a majority of the Senate. We should not allow this to \nhappen again.\n  So I would like to close by addressing one of the most frequently \ncited and most unpersuasive arguments employed by the opponents of the \nnational legal reform, only one, but I think it is important to \nestablish this right up front because it has the superficial sense of \nStates rights about it and suggests that those of us who support this \nlegislation do not trust the States.\n  As someone who is a very strong States' rights supporter, who is very \ninterested in allowing local decisionmaking, I want to make very clear \nour basis for supporting this legislation. This legislation would not \nprohibit a State from enacting more restrictive provisions so we are \nnot saying the Federal Government should take over this area of law to \nthe exclusion of the States at all. We are simply establishing a \nstandard. If the States wish to be more restrictive they are entitled \nto do so.\n  It is not appropriate to argue it would be an unconstitutional \npreemption of State authority if we were to act in this fashion. The \ncommerce clause clearly grants the United States the authority to act. \nNo individual State can solve the problems created by abusive \nlitigation of the kind we have been discussing here and that is \nparticularly true with product liability where a product may be \nmanufactured in one State, sold in another State, and cause injury in a \nthird State. In fact, Government figures establish that on average over \n70 percent of the goods manufactured in one State are shipped out of \nState for sale and use. So it is clear that a national solution is \nrequired and justified by the fundamental interstate character of \nproduce commerce.\n  The threat of disproportionate unpredictable punitive damages awards \nexerts an impact far beyond the borders of individual States, and this \nthreat influences investment strategies, it dampens job creation and \nprevents new products from reaching the marketplace. In an increasingly \nintegrated national and international economy, the confusing \ninconsistent patchwork of State liability awards has created a major \nobstacle to America's economic strength. And I think this is precisely \nthe kind of problem the Framers gave Congress the power to address \nthrough the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Framers \nclearly realized the National Government needed the power to prevent \nthe chaos that would result if every State could regulate interstate \ncommerce. That is one of the reasons, as a matter of fact, that the \nArticles of Confederation were required to be amended.\n  Opponents of legal reform profess concern about the preemption of \nState law and interference with States rights, but I note that many of \nthese same interests are enthusiastic supporters of intrusive Federal \nregulations imposed on the States by OSHA, by the FDA, by the EPA, and \nother Federal regulators. In truth, States rights is not what is being \ndefended here but rather the status quo or else.\n  Why is the multimillion-dollar litigation industry the only segment \nof the economy that opponents of legal reform believe is beyond the \nreach of Federal law? Legal reform will not cause the creation of a \nsingle new Federal program or the expenditure of a single new \nappropriation. Legal reform will not impose new taxes or new \nregulations on our citizens. Legal reform will simply create clear, \nconsistent legal standards covering civil actions brought in State and \nFederal court. It will enhance the essential principle of due process \nand, as the U.S. Supreme Court has said, due process, criminal and \ncivil, is fundamental to our concept of ordered liberty.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we keep these thoughts in mind as we debate \nthis important, and as I said at the beginning, historic legislation, \nand that in the end we will have found the wisdom and courage to make \nthese reforms so we can pass them on to the President for his signature \nand begin the process of restoring more sensibility, more common sense, \nmore fairness into the U.S. tort system.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5596-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

A bill to amend rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, relating to representations in court and sanctions for \nviolating such rule, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               legislation to deter frivolous litigation\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the United States has become the \nmost litigious society in history. The filing of frivolous or baseless \nclaims has begun to jeopardize our system of redress for legitimate \nclaims. Neither the parties nor the courts can or should shoulder the \ncosts of the frivolous, baseless, or harassing suits.\n  Last Congress, changes were proposed to rule 11. By law, unless \nCongress acted to prevent or modify those changes, they would \nautomatically become law. This body refused to consider the changes to \nrule 11. Protection against frivolous lawsuits included under rule 11 \nwere repealed by Congress's refusal to act. As a consequence, rule 11 \nno longer provides clear deterrance to frivolous lawsuits. The changes \nof last year in effect protect the abuser, not the abused.\n  If this Congress wishes to address civil justice reform, the first \nplace to start is with rule 11 and frivolous litigation.\n  I have introduced a bill that would breath life back into rule 11 and \nonce again deter those who abuse the court system.\n  Last Congress, rule 11 was changed in significant ways. Under the \nnew, ineffective rule 11, if a court finds the rule was violated, \nsanctions are no longer \n[[Page S5604]] mandatory--they are now permissive. In other words, if a \ncourt finds a party was using the court system to harass another party \nor was filing papers or charges which were untrue, the court does not \nhave to sanction the guilty party.\n  Under the new, ineffective rule 11, a party is given a 21-day safe \nharbor in which the party can file harassing motions and then withdraw \nthem after they are exposed without fear of sanction.\n  Under the new, ineffective rule 11, a party may allege facts which \nthe party does not know to be true.\n  The new rule 11 says: Sue first and ask questions later. The bill we \nare introducing today puts teeth back in rule 11 so that lawyers and \nparties will be deterred from filing baseless or harassing lawsuits.\n  Why the rule was changed to begin with is not clear. According to a \nFederal Judiciary Center study, 80 percent of district judges believe \nrule 11 has an overall positive effect and should have been retained in \nthe then-present form, 95 percent believed that the rule had not \nimpeded development of the law, and 75 percent said that benefits \njustify the expenditure of judicial time.\n  Rule 11 can be the most effective tool Congress has to control \nlitigation abuses and frivolous lawsuits. At a time when the Federal \ncourts are over-burdened with filings, we should not accommodate \nbaseless claims.\n  The bill makes four important, restorative changes to rule 11. First, \nit requires that if rule 11 is violated, sanctions are mandatory. \nSecond, it requires that there be some factual or evidentiary support \nfor factual contentions. Third, it returns the preference for awarding \nattorneys' fees to the innocent party. Fourth, it clarifies that \nattorneys' fees can be awarded against attorneys.\n  We have limited resources for the Federal courts. These four \nrestorative changes aim to make sure the resources are properly \nallocated to resolve legitimate disputes. Swift action against \nfrivolous lawsuits saves time and money, and promotes public respect \nfor the integrity of the courts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Cohen):\n  S. 721. A bill to impose a moratorium on sanctions under the Clean \nAir Act with respect to marginal and moderate ozone nonattainment \nareas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n    legislation imposing a 1-year moratorium under the clean air act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill impose a 1-year moratorium on sanctions under the Clean Air Act \nfor States that have marginal or moderate nonattainment areas within \ntheir borders.\n  All across the country, from Maine to Texas, citizens are voicing \ntheir dissatisfaction with some of the requirements of the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of 1990. In particular, they are objecting to the \nimposition of enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs. \nMany governors, frustrated over the difficulty of implementing this and \nother measures mandated by the act, have joined in this chorus of \ndissatisfaction and discontent, and have petitioned the Environmental \nProtection Agency for flexibility and assistance in meeting the act's \nrequirement. Neither the people nor the Governors question the act's \ngoals--clean and healthy air for everyone. But they do question the \nequity and reasonableness of the way that the act has been implemented \nto date.\n  In response to the widespread criticisms, the Administrator of EPA, \nCarol Browner, announced late last year that the Agency would provide \nthe States with the greatest possible flexibility in implementing the \nact. She singled the enhanced inspection and maintenance program out \nfor special mention, stating that EPA would review alternatives to a \ncentralized enhanced I program, which had been required initially.\n  Although the EPA deserves credit for making a commitment to greater \nflexibility, much uncertainty and trepidation regarding the act's \nrequirements remains. Maine provides a stark example of the serious \nproblems that still exist and that must be addressed.\n  My home State led the Nation in implementing the enhanced inspection \nand maintenance program. Maine began its program 6 months ahead of \ntime, on July 1, 1994, to avoid situations in which motorists might \nface long lines or technical problems at testing facilities in the \nmiddle of winter. The program was beset with problems almost before it \nbegan, with motorists complaining about long lines, inconsistent test \nresults, and ill-informed attendants. In combination with serious \nconcerns about potential repair costs, and legitimate questions about \nthe need for such extensive tests in a small, sparsely populated State, \nthese problems created a swell of popular opposition to the program.\n  By September, the State legislature and the Governor decided to \nsuspend implementation of the program until March 1, 1995. People in \nother States facing the enhanced I requirements, hearing about the \nproblems with Maine's program, and realizing what the enhanced program \nwould require of them, began to express concerns as well. Their elected \nofficials at the State and Federal levels relayed there concerns to the \nEPA. In response to the many criticisms coming from States across the \ncountry, EPA made its December announcement on alternatives and \nflexibility.\n  Unfortunately, since that time, little has been settled. There is \ngreat confusion in Maine, and probably other States, about exactly what \nwill be required of them, especially with regard to ozone \nnonattainment. Not only is it unclear what kind of emissions testing \nprogram will be acceptable, but questions persist about whether states \nsubject to significant transported polluted air will be able to account \nfor this transported air in their plans to attain the federal ozone \nstandard.\n  Maine sits at the tail and of the Northeast ozone transport region, \nwhich includes the 11 Northeastern States and the District of Columbia. \nNo area in the State is classified higher than moderate nonattainment. \nBut under the Clean Air Act, Maine is required to reduce volatile \norganic compounds by 15 percent in all of these areas. Given the \nuncertainty and confusion surrounding emissions inspection and the \nact's requirements for ozone in general, the State has not yet adopted \nits 15 percent reduction plan, and it faces a statutory deadline of \nJuly 26, 1995. After that date, EPA is required by law to impose stiff \nsanctions, either withholding highway construction funds, or imposing a \nstrict 2-to-1 offset requirement for new sources of emissions.\n  With the threat of painful sanctions weighing heavily over their \nheads, the Governor and the Maine Legislature are scrambling to devise \na VOC reduction plan and an alternative I program. But people in \nMaine are understandably reluctant to move forward with expensive and \ncomplicated emissions reductions measures if a significant amount of \nthe air that accounts for the nonattainment classification is \ntransported in from outside state boundaries. Yet, the data that could \ndetermine the amount of transported pollution is unavailable at the \npresent time. Maine is caught between a rock and a hard place. If it \nmoves forward, it could impose burdensome requirements on its citizens \nwithout knowing the full extent to which they contribute to the \npollution in Maine. If they do not proceed by July 26, the EPA will be \nforced to levy serious penalties. And they do not know, in precise \nterms, what is acceptable to EPA now, and what will be acceptable 6 \nmonths from now.\n  Maine faces similar uncertainty with regard to enhanced emissions \ninspection and maintenance programs. Because Maine is included in the \nNortheast ozone transport region, the act mandates that, at a minimum, \nthe cities of Portland and Kittery implement the enhanced emissions \ntesting program that has generated intense controversy in Maine and \nother States across the country. My legislation protects States from \nsanctions related to this requirement as well, provided the area \nsubject to the enhanced I requirement has been designated as marginal \nor moderate nonattainment.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that States like Maine should be \nrequired to develop these sensitive programs under the duress of \nFederal Sanctions. They should have sufficient time to sort out the new \ndevelopments on the issue, to collect data on transported air, and to \n[[Page S5605]] negotiate with the EPA on a range of acceptable \ncompliance measures. In the absence of a more deliberative process that \nallows States to carefully analyze all of their options, we could \nprovoke a repeat of last year, when States like Maine tried to \nimplement programs but met stiff public opposition. That kind of \nscenario will not bring us any closer to cleaner air.\n  States need a temporary break from the sanctions threat, and my bill \nwill provide that break. It establishes a 1-year moratorium on \nsanctions and penalties related to marginal and moderate ozone \nnonattainment areas. It applies only to States, and it simply gives the \nStates with these areas a reprieve from the Clean Air Act's heavy-\nhanded sanctions so that they are not forced to act too hastily in what \nappears to be an evolving regulatory landscape.\n  Mr. President, my bill offers a reasonable approach to a major \ncontroversy affecting many States. I think it will advance the cause of \nclean air by allowing States to develop emissions reductions plans that \nhave some credibility in the eyes of the public. I invite my colleagues \nfrom other States facing similar problems to join me in cosponsoring \nthis legislation, and to work with me for prompt passage of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 721\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OZONE NONATTAINMENT AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 1-year period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency

and classified as a \n     Marginal Area or Moderate Area under section 181 of the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511), including such an area that is \n     located in the ozone transport region established by section \n     184(a) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 7511c(a)).\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``enforcement \n     action'' includes--\n       (1) the withholding of a

      (3) the imposition of a sanction under section 110(m) or \n     179 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(m), 7509); and\n       (4) any other action intended to obtain compliance (unless \n     the action is agreed to by the State) or punish noncompliance \n     with a requirement applicable to an area described in \n     subsection (a) under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et \n     seq.).\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5603-6", "month": "04", "year":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The \n     discovery conducted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be \n     limited to issues that are directly relevant to--\n       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or\n       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.\n       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) \n     of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to \n     be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action \n     for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an \n     action relating to liability for a violation of contractual \n     requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).\n       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant \n     a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the \n     defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 205 on the \n     grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to \n     such section 205(b) or seller subject to section 205(c), \n     unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that \n     demonstrates that--\n       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the \n     defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under \n     section 205(b); or\n       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that \n     the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a seller under \n     section 205(c).\n       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--\n       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to \n     dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the \n     pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and \n     any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this \n     section.\n       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings \n     and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise \n     genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a \n     motion concerning contractual requirements and \n     specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to \n     be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection \n     (d).\n       (d) Summary Judgment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier \n     shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the \n     court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any \n     material fact for each applicable element set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 205(d).\n       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding \n     made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a \n     genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence \n     submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a \n     reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the \n     jury found the evidence to be credible.\n       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for \n     summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court \n     permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary \n     judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery \n     shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine \n     issue of material fact exists.\n       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A \n     biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in \n     connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary \n     judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section \n     205(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of \n     section 205(d) solely to the extent permitted by the \n     applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against \n     nonparties.\n       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant \n     has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section \n     205(b) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not \n     issued a final decision on the petition, the court shall stay \n     all proceedings with respect to that defendant until such \n     time as the Secretary has issued a final decision on the \n     petition.\n       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer \n     of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under \n     this title shall be permitted to file and conduct a \n     proceeding on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal \n     filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under \n     this section if the manufacturer and any other defendant in \n     such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual \n     agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the \n     cost of such proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.\n       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to \n     compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer \n     appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f)) \n     for attorney fees and costs, if--\n       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier; \n     and\n       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials \n     supplier to be without merit and frivolous.\n\n     SEC. 207.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough April 7, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. \n218), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution \nby $5.6 billion in budget authority and $1.4 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.5 billion over the revenue floor in 1995 and below \nby $9.5 billion over the 5 years 1995-99. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$238.0 billion, $3.1 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 \nof $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated March 27, 1995, the Congress has cleared, \nand the President has signed, the 1995 Emergency Supplementals and \nRescissions Act, Public Law 104-6 and the Self-Employed Health \nInsurance Act, Public Law 104-7. These actions changed the current \nlevel of budget authority, outlays and revenues.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1995.\n     Hon.

The estimates of budget \n     authority, outlays and revenues are consistent with the \n     technical and economic assumptions of the 1995 Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget (H. Con.

Mr. President, I am delighted to recognize and \ncongratulate a group of exemplary citizens upon their induction into \nthe 1995 Dr. Nan S. Hutchison Broward Senior Hall of Fame. These 11 \nvolunteers have shown enduring commitment to the community and have \nbrought about positive change through their selfless concern for and \ndedication to helping others.\n  It gives me great pleasure to salute each of the 1995 inductees for \ntheir laudable accomplishments:\n  Elaine Appel has been a guardian ad litem and savior for numerous \nabused, neglected, and mentally and physically challenged children. \nWith limitless energy, Ms. Appel has given hope to some of those most \nin need of a loving care giver.\n  Bernard Bernhardt has worked diligently to empower visually impaired \ncitizens so that they might lead productive and independent lives. By \nalso visiting many clients' homes, Mr. Bernhardt has brought assistance \nto some who might otherwise not have been able to benefit from his \ncaring efforts.\n  Norman Birger is a dynamic volunteer with loyal devotion to the \nSoutheast Focal Point Senior Center. Placing concern for the center \nbefore concern for himself, Mr. Birger has worked tirelessly to keep \nthe center a vibrant resource for its members.\n  Constance Caloggero has displayed commendable concern for a wide \nvariety of causes. Her commitment to seniors, women, children, and the \ninfirm--while at the same time serving as Hillsboro Beach \nCommissioner--enables her to enjoy her work 7 days a week.\n  Oscar Davis has worked on diverse causes and is an example of \nlimitless energy and devotion. From collecting and distributing food \nfor the Salvation Army, to picking up visually impaired citizens so \nthey may attend his talking-book club, to organizing health fairs and \nblood drives, Mr. Davis works vigorously in helping others.\n  Irving Friedman has used his caring nature and fine leadership \nabilities to help numerous seniors enjoy a better quality of life. By \nmaking support groups and counseling services available, by arranging \nfor transportation to medical facilities, and by visiting seniors in \nhospitals and nursing homes, Mr. Friedman is a friend for those most in \nneed of one.\n  Dr. Shirley Schaffer Kaufman has donated her professional skills for \nproviding psychiatric and bereavement counseling to seniors and for \nimproving their self-confidence. Dr. Kaufman's distinguishable fund-\nraising and leadership abilities in aiding the Area Agency on Aging \nhave further assisted countless seniors.\n  Eleanor Locasicio has volunteered numerous hours to bringing care to \nnumerous seniors. In using her personal and professional skills to \nevaluate infirm elderly in their homes, to instruct seniors in the AARP \n55/Alive Mature Driving Course, and to protect wildlife and nature at \nFlamingo Gardens, Mrs. Locascio has shown a distinct concern for others \nand for the environment.\n  Juanita C. Phillips has worked diligently to bring children's and \nminority concerns to the forefront. Her endeavors with several \nchildren's organizations, as well as with the Democratic Black Caucus \nof Broward County, demonstrate her excellent leadership skills and \ncommitment to helping others.\n  Edward Pudaloff has immersed himself into the plight of abused and \nneglected children. As the founder of HANDY--Helping Abused Neglected \nDependent Youth--Mr. Pudaloff provides scholarships and such \nnecessities as clothing, glasses, and medication to needy youths. He \nhas further assisted children in working as a guardian ad litem and \nspeaking for them in the courts.\n  Sybil Scheinman has translated her gift of and love for the theatre \ninto fund-raising assistance for several charitable organizations. Ms. \nScheinman's passion is performing, but she is just as enthusiastic \nhelping at the ticket window or backstage--so long as she knows she is \nbringing happiness to others.\n  Florida and the residents of Broward County alike are fortunate to \nhave been heir to the fine endeavors of these 11 vibrant, caring \nseniors who have bettered the community and served as an inspiration to \nothers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5613-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ALABAMA BUSINESS CONNECTIONS 1995\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, today I rise to mourn the death \nand celebrate the life of Ms. Ginger Adams, whose life was cut \ntragically short at 20 after an automobile accident in western \nKentucky.\n  Ginger Adams of Murray, KY, was an inspiration to all those who knew \nher. An honor student at Murray State University, Ms. Adams was also a \npopular campus leader and accomplished athlete.\n  Her love of athletics led her to join the nationally recognized \nMurray State cheerleading squad. Late last month, the squad accompanied \nthe school's basketball team to its appearance in the NCAA Tournament \nin Tallahassee, FL. Returning home from the game, the van carrying \nGinger and 12 other cheerleaders overturned on the highway injuring all \naboard and, tragically, taking Ginger's life after a 2-week struggle in \na Nashville hospital.\n  In his touching eulogy, Murray State University President Kern \nAlexander said of Ginger, ``We know she was a grand achiever and \nstudent leader, cheerleader, superb athlete and outstanding student, \nbut the supreme \n[[Page S5614]] measure is not in those accomplishments. The measure of \nher life is in the great wealth of love and affection that was \nengendered in all she touched.''\n  Mr. President, please join me in extending our heartfelt sympathy and \nprayers to Ginger's parents, Hank and Joanna Adams, and to all those \nwhose lives she touched. She will be missed very, very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Dr. Alexander's eulogy be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The eulogy follows:\n  Eulogy of Ginger Adams, Delivered by Dr. Kern Alexander, President, \n                        Murray State University\n\n       Ginger was given only 20 years, but her brief years were no \n     measure of the importance of her life. She accomplished more \n     in those few years than most persons achieve in 80. We know \n     she was a grand achiever, student leader, cheerleader, superb \n     athlete, outstanding student, but the supreme measure is not \n     in those accomplishments, but rather the measure of her life \n     is in the great wealth of love and affection that was \n     engendered in all she touched; fellow students, sorority \n     sisters, neighbors, her University, and her community.\n       Sir Christopher Wren, the architect who rebuilt London \n     after the great fire, died. In his remembrance it was said, \n     ``For his monuments look ye around.'' For Ginger's \n     accomplishments ``look ye around.'' Look at all those of you \n     here today who cherish and love her. This love and devotion \n     to Ginger are her monuments and these are the monuments that \n     are most enduring.\n       This outpouring here today of so many in this solemn \n     ceremony is the ultimate measure of one's achievements on \n     this earth. Here, they are Ginger's in abundance.\n       When death allies itself with youth and beauty it is the \n     most difficult for us to understand.\n       When the most beautiful and radiant among us dies, we are \n     all the more profoundly stricken with grief and wonderment as \n     to its reasons and purposes.\n       When beauty dies our own limitations and frailties as human \n     beings become more obvious and less comprehensible.\n       This week we lost the most beautiful and talented among us \n     and none of us can understand. Consolation can only come in \n     prayer to those who love Ginger, the prayer that:\n       ``The Lord God will wipe away the tears and will swallow up \n     death in final victory.''\n       It helps us in our own poverty of comprehension if we know \n     that life and death are not absolutes, but merely transition \n     of the human soul. This we know in our faith and trust in \n     God.\n       Prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, please help Ginger's mother \n     and father, JoAnna and Hafford, and her brothers, in this \n     time of great sorrow. Help them in this moment of \n     overpowering grief.\n       O God, we give back to you those whom You gave us. You did \n     not lose Ginger when You gave her to us, and we do not lose \n     her by her return to You. Your dear Son has taught us that \n     life is eternal and love cannot die. So death is only an \n     horizon, and an horizon is only the limit of our sight. Open \n     our eyes to see more clearly, and draw us closer to You that \n     we may know that we are nearer to our loved ones, who are \n     with You. You have told us that You are preparing a place for \n     us. Prepare us also for that happy place, that where You are \n     we may be always.\n       O Lord, You have made us very small, and we bring our years \n     to an end like a tale that is told. Help us to remember that \n     beyond our brief day is the eternity of Your Love. Amen.\n       God bless Ginger and her family.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5613-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 483\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1380, that the bill be \ndeemed read a second and third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1380, \nwhich temporarily suspends class action lawsuits filed under the Truth \nin Lending Act until October 1, 1995.\n  This bill will give Congress time to address a U.S. Court of Appeals \ndecision, Rodash versus AIB Mortgage Co., which allowed a borrower to \nrescind a mortgage based on a technical violation of the disclosure and \nnotice requirements provided for in the Truth in Lending Act. Nearly 50 \nclass action suits have been filed based on the Rodash decision.\n  The Truth in Lending Act is a complex law with almost no room for \nforgiveness if an honest technical error is made by the lender. Under \ntruth in lending, for a mistake as little as $11 in how a charge is \ndisclosed, the lender could be forced to reimburse all fees and costs \nto the borrower, including all interest paid for up to 3 years. In \naddition, the lender must release the mortgage lien, leaving the lender \nwith an unsecured loan. These laws encourage cookie-cutter lending in \norder to avoid mistakes. Consumers are then hurt by higher rates and \nless lending.\n  The enormous number of loans that have been refinanced since 1991 \nmakes this a potentially system-wide problem. I do not believe that the \nauthors of the Truth in Lending Act intended to stifle creative lending \nand punish the mortgage industry for technical violations of its \ncomplex disclosure provisions. If the courts were to permit borrowers \nto rescind loans as part of class action lawsuits, the impact could be \nfelt from the financial institutions and the secondary markets all the \nway to the Federal deposit insurance funds, which are ultimately backed \nby the U.S. taxpayer.\n  In Florida, we have seen ads with banner headlines, ``collect money \nback from your lender,'' encouraging borrowers to rescind their loan. \nThere is no mention of harm done to the consumer in the ads. In fact, \neven if the amount disclosed was more than what was actually charged, a \nborrower can rescind the loan. I have heard that some attorneys are \ntrying to amass a large number of plaintiffs in order to increase their \nfees. In the end, the biggest beneficiaries of this wave of class \naction suits will be the lawyers. Consumers will be left with small \nsettlements, higher costs, and fewer choices of mortgage lenders.\n  This bill, H.R. 1380, gives Congress time to examine the Truth in \nLending Act and correct the problems created by the Rodash decision. At \na minimum, we need to clarify the disclosure provisions of this highly \ncomplex law, provide a greater tolerance for honest mistakes, and make \nsure that the penalties are in line with the violations.\n  This bill is narrowly drawn to temporarily end the abuse of the Truth \nin Lending Act through class-action suits. Individual consumers will \nstill be allowed to bring suit during the moratorium on class actions. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nTruth in Lending Class Action Relief Act of 1995. Our colleagues in the \nHouse recently passed this legislation. It is a product of bipartisan \ncooperation and is intended as a temporary measure to deal with an \nurgent situation. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I believe that \nimmediate action is warranted. I would therefore encourage my \ncolleagues to consider and pass H.R. 1380 immediately.\n  Mr. President, I made reference to an ``urgent situation.'' The \nsituation to which I refer is the potential for devastating liability \nthat threatens our housing finance system in the wake of the 11th \nCircuit Court of Appeals' recent decision in Rodash versus AIB Mortgage \nCo. The Rodash decision has resulted in a wave of litigation and \ncreated a threat of wholesale rescissions of mortgages. The threat of \nrescissions on so massive a scale could wreck havoc on our mortgage \nlending system and the secondary mortgage markets.\n  If a class-action rescission is granted, every class member would be \nreleased from their mortgage lien, and the obligation to pay finance \ncharges and other charges. Class members would also be entitled to \nreimbursement of all finance charges, as well as other charges that are \noutside the scope of the finance charge. The 3-year right of rescission \nin truth in lending entitles the borrower to reimbursement of these \ncharges. The potential for massive rescissions, based on technical \ndisclosures errors of as little as $10, creates a potential for \nliability that has \n[[Page S5615]] been estimated to be as high as $217 billion.\n  The granting of wholesale rescissions, and the liability that such \nrescissions would create, could be devastating to both mortgage \nlenders, and to the secondary markets that provide the mortgage-market \nwith liquidity. And we must remember that the liquidity of the mortgage \nmarkets has helped millions of Americans obtain their dream of home \nownership at lower costs.\n  This bill will permit time for careful consideration of this problem. \nThis legislation provides a short-term moratorium that only applies to \nclass action certifications in connection with certain first-lien \nrefinancings and consolidations. This moratorium is narrowly focused on \na specific, technical disclosure problems, and will last only until \nOctober 1, 1995. This provision is not intended to impede the \nsettlement of class actions. If, for purposes of settlement, the \nparties stipulate to the certification of a class, a court can approve \nthe stipulation and solely for the purposes of settlement, can certify \nthe class. A class action cannot be settled without certification of \nthe class. This moratorium will provide time to remedy this problem and \nensure the continued safety-and-soundness of the mortgage-finance \nmarkets.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I state my support for H.R. 1380, the Truth \nin Lending Class Action Relief Act of 1995. This important legislation \nis designed to impose a class action moratorium on certain lawsuits \nunder the Truth in Lending Act. This legislation is narrow but \nnecessary to give the Congress an opportunity to review the \nrequirements of the Truth in Lending Act and the possible unintended \nconsequences of the Rodash case and the possible impact of Rodash on \nthe mortgage finance industry.\n  Rodash is a Florida case that allowed for the rescission of a \nmortgage where the lender disclosed certain delivery fees and an \nintangible tax in an improper place on the settlement sheet. This case \nhas now been used as precedent for nationwide lawsuits that could \npotentially disrupt and damage our mortgage finance industry. I \nemphasis that the violation in Rodash was a technical violation of the \nTruth in Lending Act, and that the fees in question were small and that \nany improper disclosure was unintended. Nevertheless, a complete \nrescission of the mortgage was permitted.\n  In addition, since 1991, some 11.8 million loans totaling $1.3 \ntrillion have been refinanced. The cost of rescinding these mortgages \nis about $217 billion. To apply Rodash to the mortgage industry is like \nkilling a mosquito with an atomic bomb. I believe we need to consider \nthese consequences.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The bill (H.R. 1380) was deemed read three times and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/24/senate-section/article/S5614-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-3 AND TREATY \n                           DOCUMENT NO. 104-4\n\n  Mr. KYL.
