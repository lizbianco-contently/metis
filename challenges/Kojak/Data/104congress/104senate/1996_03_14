The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to make a case for a \ncommonsense, responsible forest policy. Today, I want to plead with my \ncolleagues to fix a mistake that this Congress made last year and put \nin place a long-term plan to restore the lawful expeditious salvage of \ndead and dying timber in our Nation's forests.\n  Today, our national forests are at the center of extreme controversy. \nMy constituents are angry and many believe that the salvage rider from \nlast year went way too far. It is very critical that we address this \nsituation now.\n  Let me remind my colleagues about the course of forest policy in \nthese past few years. I will spend most of my time discussing the \nPacific Northwest, because that is where much of the forest controversy \nis right now about salvage timber and it is where it is currently \nfocused.\n  When I came into office in 1992, the national forests of the \nNorthwest were locked up, they were closed to timber management because \nthe agency had not followed the environmental laws of this Nation. The \ncourts prohibited the agency from selling trees, and Congress was \ngridlocked. Nothing was moving, and there was war in the woods. Rural \ncommunities were hurting, and environmentalists were winning in the \ncourts of law and in the courts of public opinion because the public \nsaw mountainsides ravaged and felt betrayed.\n\n  President Clinton held a forest conference early in 1993, listened to \nall sides and eventually endorsed a plan developed by scientists for \nthe Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management that would provide \na sustainable flow of timber while protecting species diversity, \nwatersheds, and other important values.\n  Few people liked the plan, I will admit, but, once again, the forests \nwere finally open for science-based timber harvests.\n  Unfortunately, the timber sales program established under the \nNorthwest forest plan has not produced the volumes many of us had hoped \nthat it would. I, like my opponents, am very frustrated that the Forest \nService has been unable to produce a timber-sale level even close to \nwhat scientists believe is sustainable under the President's forest \nplan.\n  Near the end of 1994, delays under the forest plan, combined with a \nrash of forest fires in the inland West, brought frustration to a \nboiling point. But instead of working within the plan or trying to \nreach a compromise on a reasonable approach to salvage logging, this \nCongress lowered the boom. The rider that passed last year suspended \nenvironmental safeguards, it cut the public out of Government \ndecisions, and, under subsequent court rulings, mandated unscientific \ntimber sales.\n  This rider may have sped up the flow of timber to mills marginally, \nbut it also has sparked a war in the woods in my State and my region. \nLike so many other environmental proposals pushed by this Congress, it \njust went too far. I, too, want the President's forest plan to deliver \nand I, too, want dead timber to be salvaged from our Nation's forests. \nThe big difference between my approach today and my opponents is how we \nmove forward. Do we allow the public to be involved? Do we give \nagencies discretion to follow the law? Do we provide 1-year fixes or \nestablish a long-term approach?\n  I believe that we can salvage trees quickly while still allowing \npublic involvement in sales that comply fully with the laws.\n  I want to take the time to explain my amendment.\n  The first title simply repeals the timber rider whose consequences \nshocked so many people. How many Senators envisioned this kind of sale \nwhen we discussed timber salvaging dead trees, this kind of sale where \nthe result is a tremendous damage to our ecosystem, to our salmon, to \nour fish, to the wildlife, where we cut without regard to what happens \nto the environment or what happens to the timber around it? We cause \nslides, we cause backups, we cause flooding, and we cause tremendous \ndamage to many of our timber areas and to the salmon and the fish that \ndepend so much on it.\n  How many of my colleagues, when we voted last year, thought that we \nwould see a sale like this?\n  My friends, this picture is of a tree that was cut down under the \nrider from last year. This tree is well over 250 years old. This tree \nis older than the Constitution of the United States of America. We hear \nso much today about the fact that we need to take care of our children \nand our grandchildren, that we want something there for them in the \nfuture. This tree will not be replaced for my grandchildren, my great-\ngrandchildren, or my great, great-grandchildren.\n  This is what we did when we passed the rider last year. This is not \nthe type of sale that the public believes should be exempt from \nscrutiny or statutory safeguards.\n  The second provision of this title addresses how we fix the mess we \nhave made. Even the senior Senators from Washington and Oregon admit \nthat mistakes were made. They agree that the administration needs some \nflexibility to right the wrongs brought about by these old-growth \nsales. Unfortunately, the approach they take in this bill does not \nsolve the problem. It allows the Secretaries to negotiate with \npurchasers for alternative volume, but then it gives the purchasers the \nfinal say. Furthermore, it allows buyback of these harmful sales, but \nonly using funds other than timber sales money; apparently, watershed \nrestoration money, trails money, and wildlife funds. I do not agree \nwith that approach.\n  In contrast, my approach provides the administration and the \npurchaser equal negotiating position but gives the Secretary the final \nsay. It establishes that the priority should be alternative volume. \nHowever, if that is unavailable, the Secretary has a whole package of \ntools available to assist the purchaser. He can offer cash, bidding \ncredits, loan forgiveness, or any other available option under current \nlaw.\n  The final provision of this title addresses the problem of salvage \ntimber sales throughout the country. Under the timber rider passed last \nyear, the agencies were not required to follow environmental laws and \ntheir decisions were not subject to administrative appeal or \nsubstantive legal challenge. The public, you and I, were cut out of the \nprocess. While I believe that the vast majority of sales comply with \nenvironmental laws, as the administration promised they would, some of \nthe salvage sales likely would not withstand administrative or judicial \nscrutiny.\n  Some people have raised concerns that my amendment will allow \nfrivolous appeals to gridlock reasonable agency decisions to award \ntimber sale contracts.\n\n  Let me be very clear; this is not the case at all. My amendment \nallows judicial review of awarded sales and gives a judge discretion to \nprovide injunctive relief when necessary. The goal is twofold: First, \nto allow one check on sales that have received no checks at all, and \nsecond, to allow legally awarded sales to move forward.\n  Title II, I admit, is a bit parochial. As I complained about earlier, \nwe simply must make the Northwest forest plan work. The way we make it \nwork is to get the scientific underpinnings in place by finishing the \nwatershed analyses as soon as possible. In this amendment, we direct \nthe agencies to expedite sales under the plan and use available funds \nfirst and road construction funds as a backup to complete these \nimportant watershed analyses.\n  The Northwest forest plan has to work. We have too much riding on it. \nBoth the States of Washington and Oregon and many private companies \neither have developed or are in the process of developing habitat \nconservation plans to protect threatened and endangered species. These \nState and private lands supply the vast majority of timber available \nfor harvest in Washington State. Without a sound Federal policy \nunderpinning, these HCP's may no longer provide sufficient habitat \nprotection. This will put our timber workers and our communities in \njeopardy once again.\n  Title III of my amendment is the most comprehensive. It is a section \nthat sets forth in a number of ways, I believe, that reasonable timber \nsalvage can be expedited on Federal lands without cutting people out of \nthe process. Unlike the rider from last year, it limits the definition \nof ``salvage'' to true salvage: dead and dying trees. It establishes an \nexpedited process for getting at those trees because the trees are\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\ndead or dying, so they must be harvested quickly in order to get any \neconomic value from them.\n  Maybe it is our puritan heritage, but most Americans do not like to \nsee deadwood going to waste. Why not get some economic value out of the \ndevastation caused by wildfires or insect epidemics or blowdowns? I \nagree and I try to expedite that often cumbersome process.\n  Both the timber interests and conservationists have criticized this \ntitle. That tells me I must be in the middle. Some people say it will \nestablish a whole new bureaucracy. That is not correct.\n  One provision does require agencies to work together to shorten the \ntime required for consultation under the Endangered Species Act. At \nfirst, I wanted to codify the memorandum of understanding that is \nworking in the Pacific Northwest to reduce the amount of time it takes \nfor the regulatory agencies to approve Forest Service and BLM sales. \nHowever, that document is quite cumbersome, so I simply adopted the \nstreamlined consultation methods that it contained. In other words, \nthis system is already in place. It was put there to expedite salvage \nunder the timber rider, and it is working.\n\n  Timber interests are also concerned that this more limited definition \nof salvage is unscientific and alters current law. I have two answers \nfor that. First, the current definition, whose eligibility requirements \ninclude such sweeping phrases as trees ``imminently susceptible to fire \nor insect attack'' is too broad for the widespread use to which salvage \nsales are now being offered. A few years ago the Forest Service had a \nvery small timber salvage program and, because of its relatively small \nscale, was not under public scrutiny.\n  Second, while my definition is narrower, it does not prohibit the use \nof the other definition. That is an important point. My bill does not \nlimit the agencies' ability to perform salvage under the older \ndefinition.\n  What my bill does is this: It says, where we need to get in to \nharvest timber quickly because it will lose its economic value if we do \nnot, we need expedited procedures. On the other hand, in situations \nwhere the timber is not dead or rotting, the agencies can take the \nlonger route of compliance with lengthier documents and lengthier \nappeals. The old salvage program would be better suited to forest \nrehabilitation activities such as thinning of overstock stands or \nestablishing multilayered canopies to mimic old-growth forests.\n  Some people have expressed concern that the new NEPA regulations will \nnot be completed for at least a year. That is true. However, I want to \nemphasize that we are putting in place a new long-term policy to allow \nsalvage logging. The agencies and the Council on Environmental Quality \nwill develop that process within a year, which is very fast for the \nFederal bureaucracy, and it will remain in place as long as this \nCongress wishes it to be there.\n  Let me turn to the issues raised by conservationists. They are \ngreatly concerned about the ``salvage'' definition contained in the old \nrider that we passed last year because it is too broad and it \nencompasses virtually any standing tree. They want only dead trees to \nbe cut, and they do not want any new roads to be built.\n  My amendment narrows the definition to focus directly on dead trees \nand minimizes the risks of subjecting healthy trees to harvest under \nthe moniker of ``salvage.'' In addition, my amendment limits new road \nconstruction under the salvage program to quarter-mile spurs. My \ndefinition does not go nearly as far as they wanted, but it does \nrepresent a responsible, sensible compromise.\n  They want all sales prohibited if arson is committed and believe the \nburden of proving someone committed arson to create a salvage sale is \ntoo onerous. They want this bill's expedited provisions to apply to \nsales located outside of any wilderness areas, not just those \nwilderness areas in which timber harvest is currently precluded.\n  Others expressed reservations about the provision that gives the \nagency more discretion to provide guidelines for purchasers regarding \ntree marking. They believe that too many trees are mismarked, and they \ndo not trust the agency to develop reasonable guidelines. However, my \nlanguage comes directly from feedback received by people on the ground \nthat I talked with, and it is designed to save time in laying out these \nsales.\n  Some environmentalists have raised concerns about provisions limiting \nthe time to appeal sales. They feel their rights have already been \nreduced by the provisions included in the 1992 appropriations bill \nestablishing a time of 45 days. My amendment reduces it to 30 days.\n  My theory was that the bill gives the public more access up front in \nthe process by allowing them to participate in interdisciplinary team \nmeetings. They will then hear agency experts discussing timber sales \nand may be better able to suggest helpful changes early, thus reducing \nthe likelihood of bad sales and the need to appeal at all. Again, this \nis a reasonable approach.\n  The amendment facilitates up-front public involvement, public \ninvolvement in a second way. It waives some Federal Advisory Committee \nAct requirements if the agency feels public involvement would be \nfacilitated by doing so. As we saw in the Applegate project in Oregon, \nFACA thwarted a particularly useful community-based effort to manage \nresources. Where communities can resolve these thorny natural resource \nissues, I want to do everything I can to endorse and encourage those \nsolutions.\n  Finally, conservationists are nervous about the increased flexibility \nallowed under the pilot program for stewardship contracts. Senators \nMack and Baucus and Representative Pat Williams introduced legislation \nthis session that encourages this type of contracting that allows the \nagency's flexibility to design sales to foster stewardship goals, \nrather than necessarily producing a high financial return to the \nTreasury.\n  I have spoken to timber workers, and they believe this program holds \ngreat promise. I share their enthusiasm, and I am certain it can be \nimplemented in a constructive and beneficial way for our workers.\n  Let me conclude this with a note about the final title that is simply \nan effort to increase our knowledge about forest health and healthy \ntimber stands. This title is primarily directed at tree health. As \nconservationists have repeatedly pointed out to me as I discussed this \ntopic, forest health is not just about tree health; it is about \nwatersheds and soils and other vegetation, wildlife, and a whole host \nof noncommodities. I agree. However, I also agree that in some areas of \nour Nation, our timber stands are unhealthy. We need to use science to \nfigure out a way to help restore them.\n  This title asks the agencies to identify unhealthy stands and \nprioritize those that would benefit from rehabilitation. I know that \nSenator Craig and others, including Senator Daschle, have been very \ninterested in this approach. The bill directs the agencies to \nprioritize areas based on their health, their ease of access, and their \nprobability of arousing controversy. Why not rehabilitate areas that we \ncan most easily reach with the least amount of outcry and treat those \nfirst?\n  Finally, the bill concludes with a study recommended in Senator \nBradley's timber salvage repeal bill. It directs the National Academy \nof Sciences to study the ecological health of forests. It should \nprovide us information with which, if necessary, we can modify our \napproach to forest health in the years to come.\n  This has been a rather lengthy explanation of my amendment. However, \nI think it is important to discuss so that my colleagues can understand \nthe reasons for the decisions I made in this amendment. This amendment \nis not perfect, but it does provide us with a real opportunity to do \nthe things that the vast majority of Americans can agree on. We should \nharvest dead and dying timber quickly on our national forests while \ngiving people--people--the power to influence agency decisions.\n  It is also critical to point out that this bill is not a referendum \non how the administration has handled this issue. Opponents are going \nto argue that the administration has changed its position or sent us \nmixed signals. This is not about the executive branch. This amendment \nis about people.\n\n  Under the rider, Federal agencies are out in the woods running timber \nsales with little or no accountability. Under\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nthe rider that we passed last year, ordinary citizens--you and I--have \nlittle or no ability to influence Government decisions. Under that \nrider, timber communities have once again been dragged into a political \nstorm. My amendment puts the public--us--back in the process and \nimplements a long-term salvage program.\n  Mr. President, this Congress reignited a war in the woods in the \nPacific Northwest and elsewhere. The rider passed last year was \nlegislative overkill on the environment. I do not want to have to face \nmy constituents and tell them that this Congress did not want them \ninvolved in management decisions about the forests they own. I want my \nconstituents to know they have a place in our Government and in our \nforests. Likewise, I want our timber communities and families to know \nthat we value the services that they provide to this Nation.\n  They have borne a lot of criticism for supplying us with wood and \npaper products. That criticism is shortsighted and hypocritical. I want \nto make it very clear: One of the messages of this amendment is that \ntimber salvage is good if it is done correctly and wisely. It is a \nbeneficial activity that should be encouraged where it is \nscientifically sound. We should stop the pendulum from swinging so \nwildly--from no cutting to no accountability.\n  Mr. President, through this amendment we can show the American people \nthat this Congress can pass a piece of legislation that gives neither \nside everything but both sides something. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment that repeals the timber rider and replaces it \nwith reasonable, a long-term, expedited timber salvage program \nproviding commodities for this country and protection for our forests.\n\n  One more note, Mr. President. This amendment is fully paid for from \nForest Service accounts. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. I withhold the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, first of all, I commend my colleague for \nher keen interest and her willingness to become involved in one of the \ngreat issues that confronts the Pacific Northwest--not only the Pacific \nNorthwest, but the entire country, and not just for the entire country, \nbut now something that is an issue that is worldwide.\n  I want to just say briefly that we get ourselves oftentimes so \nfocused on our own geographic focus of interest, we sometimes forget \nthe impact of policies that affect the entire world. A group of us went \nto Siberia to see the timber situation in Siberia this last August and \nto review the cutting policies of that part of the world. Due to the \nstalemate and the gridlock in the Northwest, which has succeeded pretty \nmuch in eliminating this Northwestern part of the United States which \nis, worldwide, the greatest productive area for softwood timber in the \nworld, effectively eliminating it from the area of supply for one of \nthe great demands in our own country, housing--housing for many people: \npoor, middle income, rich, everybody. The only product for housing that \nreally is a renewable product that is grown by free solar energy and \nthat can be replaced and renewed, renewed, and renewed, as it is a \nthesis of our whole timber policy, is a renewable resource.\n  Let me just say that we are, today, witnessing what I call a modern \ntype of environmental imperialism, much the same as the 18th and 19th \ncentury imperialism of Britain and the European powers. For what we \nhave not found available, in part due to our own policies on the home \nfront, we are going to the rest of the world, to exploit the rest of \nthe world--the rest of the world that has no policies in place.\n  Siberia has a great hunger for hard cash. Let me just say that this \nis a reality. We have 10 small mills in the Northwest consortium, and \nin the 10 small mills--6 from the State of Oregon--they have gone in to \nmake purchases of Siberian timber because of our own lack of supply. In \nSiberia, there is a multiplier of 15. What we can produce in the \nNorthwest on 100,000 acres takes 1.5 million acres of timber in \nSiberia--1.5 million.\n  It seems to me that we have to begin to lift our eyes to not only the \nenvironmental needs of our own area within this country, and in this \ncountry on this continent, but also the whole world.\n  The same is happening in South America. The demand has not been met \nin our own country, and, as a consequence, we are looking to other \nmarkets in South America. Again, let me emphasize, even our Canadian \nfriends have not fully implemented a national timber policy governing \nthe way in which timber is managed in Canada. The pressure is on \nCanada. Our 13 Southern pine States, mostly made up of small wood lots, \nare stripping their lands to meet the supply.\n  That is just one facet of what we do here and its environmental \nimpact on the rest of the world. I think the day has come when we have \nto take seriously the right of the United States to go to the rest of \nthe world and exploit and extrapolate their raw materials to feed our \nown need here domestically.\n  Now, I think also that it is very important to recognize that these \npictures that we see absolutely chill my blood--about the same as if I \nwent to a slaughterhouse to watch sausage being made would chill my \nblood. But I still like sausage. I am a tree planter. I do not know how \nmany people in this Chamber planted trees. I have planted 1,800 of them \non 5 acres of seedlings. I do not like to see the process of providing \nus housing material or beautiful paneled walls in our offices, and the \nother myriad of ways in which we use the timber product. And I think, \nalso, our history is very, very limited.\n\n  We have had some floods in the Pacific Northwest. There are those who \nare trying to say those floods were tied directly to timber harvests. I \nthink in some areas that is true. But to say that the floods were \ncreated solely, or exclusively, or in the main by this is not \nhistorically accurate. The greatest flood we had was in 1891. We were \nnot doing much timbering in 1891 in my State, nor I do not think in the \nState of Washington either.\n  We also have a short history when, in World War II, the National \nGovernment said, ``We have to have timber for the war effort, and we \nare not using our Federal timber. We are asking the private timber \nlandowners to produce the timber now for the cause of the war, and we \nwill replace it from Federal timber after the war.'' That is an \nimportant factor in this history of timber in our Pacific Northwest. A \nlot of people like to go around and say, ``Look how they have stripped \nthe land of the timber.'' That was because we had locked up our own \nFederal land timber and, for the sake of the war effort, calling on \npeople's patriotism to strip their land for that timber because it was \nfaster to be gathered and cut, rather than having to wait to build \nroads into the Federal area.\n  I want to now just recall something in 1989. That is not that long \nago. In 1989, Mr. President, Speaker Foley, Congressman Les AuCoin, and \nI called a timber summit to face the problem we had at that time of a \nshutdown of our Federal forests for any timber harvesting. In 1989. It \nis very interesting because in July 1989 the Ancient Forest Alliance, a \ncoalition of environmental groups, proposed their own short-term timber \nsupply solution. What did the Ancient Forest Alliance propose? They \nproposed a 9.6 billion board feet harvest--a 9.6 billion board feet \nharvest in 1989 and 1990, a 2-year period. That was to take place on \nthe Federal forest lands and the BLM lands in Oregon and Washington \nalone.\n  They had other parts to their proposal, such as minimizing the \nfragmentation of old growth using the Forest Service definition and \nPNW-447, or regional guide, and protecting the spotted owl. These were \nall components. But can you imagine a 9.6 billion board feet proposed \ncut from the Ancient Forest Alliance?\n\n  History changes. And this is obviously another example of change. But \nlet us keep a continuity of that history, and let us look at all parts \nof that history, and let us remember that at that particular time we \nhad just left the period when the so-called ASQ, the allowable cut, was \n5.3 billion board feet annually from the Pacific North region, never \nhaving reached that level of cutting; the highest was 4.8. But that has \nchanged, too.\n  Now, let us be very straightforward and historically correct on this. \nNo one should be surprised about the rider. The administration \nnegotiated every dot and every comma in that rider, fully cognizant of \nits meaning and fully understanding of what it proposed to\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\ndo and what it proposed not to do. It was a rider to what? An \nadministration bill, a rescissions package. The administration, let us \nface it, had a higher value on getting the votes for that rescissions \npackage than they did at that moment in negotiating a rider on timber. \nThat is a fact, too. I was one of the negotiators.\n  So for people to say somewhat that this is a great surprise, that all \nof a sudden we opened it up and here was the fine print, that is not \ntrue. Everybody that was involved in that, including the \nadministration, understood precisely what it said in that.\n  Now intervene the next step: A Federal district judge and a suit that \nhe had to rule on relating to his interpretation of this rider. Now, \nwhen it is said that Senator Gorton and I found that it was not the \nbest rider or the best effort we could have made, or whatever, it was \nthe intervening interpretation by a Federal district judge that caused \nanybody and everybody who understood what the rider was and that it had \ngone too far.\n  Now, let me say that the administration then began to discuss and \nnegotiate a modification to this rider. They asked for five points. \nFirst of all, before I give the five points, what are we talking about? \nWe are talking about contracts that had been negotiated in the past on \nthe basis of the forest procedures, on the basis of all of the in-place \nregulations. Nobody has done this in the dark. All of those were fully \noperative and negotiated, and they were fully publicized, as all timber \nsales are. In other words, we moved down not to the subject of timber \nsale, but to the right of contract.\n  Three points of contract: Offer, consideration, and acceptance. I \nlearned that in my one and only year of law school. My colleague \ngraduated; I did not. So we are talking about a legal instrument that \nis fully enforceable under our American jurisprudence system. \nConsequently, we are talking about a contract. When they say, ``Well, \nany substitute sale has to be agreed to by both parties,'' of course, \nyou cannot violate a contract. Two parties had entered the contract, \nand if you are going to modify that contract, you have to have the two \nparties agree to the modification. This is not anything strange or \nweighted in the favor of one side or the other. It is a fundamental law \nof contracts. So we have these contracts, or a $150 million value of \ncontracts, that the Federal Government entered into in good faith, and \nthe buyer, in good faith, with consideration.\n\n  OK. What were these points then? The administration said, ``Your \nlanguage is too narrow, as it has been interpreted,'' and so forth. The \nlanguage was, in effect, and I want to quote it:\n\n       The administration has the ability to offer replacement for \n     those areas where a marbled murrelet is known to be nesting.\n\n  Oh, did we have long discussions with the White House on how do you \ndefine the presence of a marbled murrelet. They are reclusive kind of \nbirds. If you find an eggshell, is that sufficient evidence? If you \nheard one fly over? So we said, ``nesting.'' And we said the \nreplacement for those areas and those sales, if you found a marbled \nmurrelet nesting, could then be set aside and replaced in like kind as \na substitute sale. They said those were restrictions that they felt \ncould not produce the best environmentally sound replacement policy. \nTwo points: Expanded beyond the marbled murrelet, and do not make it \nreplacement sale in kind. That would require an old growth, or no \ngrowth, or second growth, or whatever.\n\n  So, consequently, we lifted both of those out of the rider \nmodification. In effect, we said, for any reason that you feel it would \nbe environmentally unsound to pursue a sale, set it aside, and you do \nnot have to replace it in kind. Replace it in volume with a mutual \nagreement because there were two parties to this contract.\n  We have no other way to do this except to legislate it and invalidate \nan existing contract. I do not think the Congress wants to get into \nthat business.\n  All right. Those were two issues that we cleared up.\n  Then they said, ``Well, there are times when, perhaps, we do not want \nto have a substitute sale. We would like to have a buyout of the \ncontract,'' which is always possible under contract, any contract. So \nwe said, ``All right. Have a buyout.'' There is a little question as to \nwhere we are going to get the money for the buyout. But the point is, \nwe would give them authorization for a buyout and work with the \nadministration. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have a \nlittle flexibility to do things of this kind, to make commitments. We \nwill find ways to help finance an agreed financing system for the \nbuyout. Then they said, ``Put a date of December 1996 as to when all of \nthis has to be accomplished.'' That might rush us into premature \ncutting in order to meet a deadline. So it took a deadline off.\n  The last thing they asked for was a repeal on the sufficiency \nlanguage, which is a red light, a red herring, or a bell in the minds \nof most environmental groups. But based on history and based on the \nrecord, there were people who were filing an injunction on every single \ntimber sale to tie up every timber sale whether it had an environmental \nissue or not an environmental issue. We had the woods being run by \nlawsuits or locked up by lawsuits.\n  So the sufficiency language which we used in other cases, in other \nlaws in this Congress and in this Government--wait until Superfund \ncomes out. There will be sufficiency language in that. That is OK \nbecause that is against corporations who use the courts to stall their \nresponsibilities to clean up. I will support it. I think it is a \nlegitimate instrument if used carefully, and the record will show that \nthere is plenty of evidence why sufficiency was going to have to be the \nimplementation on this.\n\n  By the way, it went clear through the court system from the district \nto the ninth circuit to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court sent \nback the ruling, the ninth circuit having invalidated section 318 when \nthe first sufficiency language appeared, and, in effect, said, ``Leave \nthe management of the forest to the experts,'' and unanimously \noverruled the district court and the ninth circuit court. Of course, \nthe ninth circuit court has a great record of being overruled. It is \nprobably overruled more than any other circuit at certain times.\n  But the point is simply this. That was very legitimate. So four of \nthe five--but listen to what we did with the four. You do not need \nsufficiency from the standpoint of the administration, or administering \nthe forest, because it said for any reason you want to indicate that \nyou do not feel a contract should be implemented, do not implement it. \nHave a substitution or a buyout--all power.\n  Let me make an observation. If the administration's position now is \none of surprise, or they did not realize what they were signing and \nthey want it repealed, let them talk to their foresters, their experts, \nand not to the pollsters and the political counsel at the White House. \nThis is not a forestry issue, Mr. President. This is purely a political \nissue. And they need to repair that base of their support in the \nenvironmental community, and this is the only way the environmentalists \nsay it: Do it this way, our way, or we will go out there and trash it. \nAnd they have already been doing that, when this first came about.\n  So, this is not a forestry or an environmental problem. This is a \npolitical problem being put into environmental wraps for the sake of \nthe political election cycle we are in. They knew every inch of the way \nand every word of the rider, and now they are trying to get out from \nunder it. By the same token, we have given them all the leeway, all of \nthe flexibility necessary to cancel any sale by a buyout, or a \nnegotiated replacement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon, [Mr. Wyden] is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this past January 31, around 2 o'clock or 3 \no'clock in the morning, I tried to imagine what I would say in my first \nSenate floor speech. I reflected a bit on what I had learned from \nOregonians during the campaign that sent me here.\n  Though I had not slept a whole lot for many days, I had no problem \npiecing together what the election was all\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\nabout: Oregonians, regardless of who they voted for, are hungry for \nreal solutions. In many ways, ideological purity--looking at Government \nthrough a set of partisan blinders--is far less important to the people \nof my State than making the Government work.\n  The message from our electorate was blunt: Put aside the partisan \ndifferences, shed the political armor, and find common ground.\n  I am by nature an optimist, and I believe that there are plenty of \nreasons to see that the water glass of democracy is more than half \nfull. Both political parties now understand how important it is to \ndownsize the Federal Government. Both parties recognize that our Nation \nneeds real welfare reform. Soon the Senate will deal with a bipartisan \nhealth insurance reform bill. These are all areas where Democrats and \nRepublicans can come together and find consensus.\n  But, frankly, I did not expect in the early morning hours of January \n31 that my first speech would be about the so-called ``salvage rider,'' \na subject that seemingly defies consensus building. And that is why our \njob today is so critical. More than half the forests in Oregon are \nowned by the Federal Government. For many Oregonians, the responsible \nmanagement of these Federal lands is the acid test for determining if \nthe Government really works or is actually broken beyond repair.\n  I believe that the Senate can help bring peace to our forests. Our \nchallenge is to help persuade the warring forest factions to lay down \ntheir ideological clubs and work together so that America has healthy, \nproductive forests in the next century.\n  Eminent forest scientists agree that our Western forests have genuine \nhealth problems that can be cured through salvage logging. For example, \nOregon Governor John Kitzhaber's expert panel has made a number of \nimportant findings with respect to our State's Blue Mountains. They \nfound that sizable amounts of certain species, such as Douglas fir and \ntrue firs, have died as a result of overcrowding on drier sites, \ndrought, and insects.\n  A major portion of the live forest is under stress because stands are \ntoo dense, especially the true fir and Douglas fir understories beneath \npine and larch, and it increases the likelihood of future mortality in \nboth understory and overstory.\n  Restoration treatments including thinning and fuel reduction could \nreduce the risk of loss from insects and fire on large areas of these \nforests. Time is of the essence to capture economic value and reduce \nrisk of catastrophic losses in the future. Salvage and restoration \ntreatments have the potential to pay for themselves and provide funds \nfor ecosystem restoration projects.\n  This story is not unique. Similar situations exist in forests \nthroughout the West. A science-based forest health and salvage policy \nis needed to end this crisis, and as an Oregon Senator I am going to \nwork with anyone, anywhere, anytime for a forestry policy that works.\n  In 1995, the Congress enacted a new salvage logging program. The \nsupporters said it was a win-win policy, arguing that dead and dying \ntrees would be salvaged for our mills and that the harvest would reap \nthe added benefit of improving forest health. As a Member of the House, \nI felt compelled to vote against the plan because it was hard to find \nwhat we call the good wood in these arguments.\n  First, buried in the technical language of the bill was a definition \nof salvage that was so broad that virtually any tree in the forest \ncould be cut. That definition specifically allows salvage sales to \ninclude what were called associated trees that are not dead or dying as \nlong as that part of the sale did include salvage of dead or dying \ntrees.\n  Second, the lack of hearings on the measure was a sure ticket, an \nabsolute glidepath to the legal bedlam that Senator Hatfield has \ndescribed.\n  Third, whether or not you support the President's forest plan, a \nFederal judge has ruled that timber-dependent communities can actually \nharvest trees under it. The salvage rider threatens that harvest for a \nshort-term gain.\n  Finally, I voted against this rider because it embodies what citizens \nhave come to mistrust in American politics. While supporters of the \nrider said it was a good Government plan to prevent catastrophic fires \nand insect infestation, it has turned out to be a Trojan horse that \nwould allow for the lawless logging of healthy old growth trees. The \noutcry that followed the rider's enactment is predictable and is why we \nare in the Chamber today.\n  My colleagues, it did not have to be this way. The Congress could \nhave addressed these problems through the proper authorization process. \nThe Senate could have let the public in on the debate. Senator Craig's \nbill, S. 391, squarely addresses forest health and could serve as a \nvaluable starting point for a discussion of this issue. In our previous \nlife in the House, Senator Craig and I worked very well together. I \nhave always enjoyed working with Senators Hatfield and Gorton. They \nhave both been very kind to me in these early days of my service in the \nSenate, and I know we can work together again to achieve better Federal \nforest management.\n  The Senate needs to understand that the frustrations in resource-\ndependent communities that gave birth to the salvage rider are \nlegitimate. That is certainly the message I got in my recent townhall \nmeeting in Prineville, OR. Thousands of families in these communities \nare losing hope, and the Congress has to respond to their needs.\n  Under the President's plan for northwest forests, timber workers and \ncommunities were promised a harvest level of more than 1 billion board \nfeet by 1999. This is down from unsustainable but peak harvest levels \nin the 1980's, but timber workers and their communities rightly feel \nabused when even meager promises are not kept.\n  Some of the original supporters of the salvage rider agree that the \nold growth logging that is occurring goes beyond what they have \nintended. In an effort to fix the problem, they have included language \nin the appropriations bill to give the agencies some additional \nflexibility to substitute alternative tracts and authority to buy back \nenvironmentally damaging sales.\n  These provisions are only a partial fix. They provide only a brief \n45-day period allowing Federal agencies to substitute new timber for \nold sales which would be environmentally damaging or for a buyout of \nthese sales. If the purchaser is not happy, the agencies have little \nleverage. Environmentally sensitive sales are going to go forward. The \ndeck is stacked heavily in favor of the purchasers so that in effect \nthey can dictate the terms.\n\n  In addition, provisions currently in the bill continue the exempting \nof salvage logging from environmental laws even extending this \nexemption for some of the most troubling sales. If these environmental \nlaws are not working, then it is the duty of the Senate to change them. \nBut it ought to be done in the open. It ought to be done in the clear \nlight of day. As a new Senator, I am not going to support the politics-\nas-usual process by circumventing the law.\n  I also have no intention of turning my back on working families. If \nyou oppose the salvage rider, you have to stand up for an alternative. \nYou have to say what you are for if you are going to keep faith with \nfolks in timber-dependent communities. I support a strong legally \nconstituted forest health and salvage logging program that provides a \nreal timber harvest and real hope for rural Oregonians.\n  That is why, today, I am going to support the amendment offered by \nSenator Murray. I compliment the Senator and her staff for her efforts \nto reach out to the broad section of stakeholders who care so much \nabout this issue. I intend to work actively with other Senators to \nimprove this legislation, but I believe that the Murray bill is a \nsounder, more comprehensive solution than the language now in the bill.\n  I believe that the centerpiece of reforming the salvage rider is \nensuring that those who voluntarily relinquish contract rights to old-\ngrowth timber receive replacement timber. If the Murray amendment is \nadopted, I wish to work with my Northwest colleagues to strengthen the \nMurray proposal by making it a legal duty for the Clinton \nadministration to find acceptable replacement timber from nonsensitive \nareas. My own view is that failure to provide certainty on the \nreplacement timber issue virtually guarantees that this body will be \nback debating yet another fix to this problem.\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\n  The Murray amendment provides the agencies with tools they can use to \ndeliver on the critical requirement of replacement volume. And the \nMurray amendment has other positive features. First and foremost, it \nrestores critical habitat, forest and streambed protections in our \ncurrent law. It gives citizens the right of legal redress, but the \nlegal process will no longer drag on interminably. Instead of using \nscarce tax dollars for salvage buyouts, the buyouts are used as a last \nresort. The Murray amendment encourages and expedites legitimate \nsalvage logging where it can treat genuine forest health problems.\n  There is more to do, and let me outline some followup steps if the \nMurray amendment goes forward. For example, I believe it is important \nto expedite the harvest of any remaining 318 sales that are not \nenvironmentally sensitive. These are sales that were planned under the \nprocess set up in the 1990 appropriations. The salvage rider orders the \nrelease of 318 sales which had been held up for environmental concerns. \nThere are some who would claim that all of these sales should be \nsuspended because of their potential environmental impacts. The fact \nis, Federal agencies do not challenge the release of all of them. A \nnumber of them have already been cut. If, in fact, some of these sales \ndo not impact environmentally sensitive areas, I hope they will move \nforward.\n\n  A related concern is that bona fide salvage sales not be held up \nwhen; they do not trigger environmental concerns. Delay in salvaging \ndead and dying trees can cause the value of timber to decline \nsubstantially, even making it unmarketable. Automatically suspending \nsalvage sales when an appeal is filed could invite meritless appeals \nthat frustrate legitimate salvage efforts.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the forest health provisions in the \namendment are somewhat duplicative, and that more work needs to be done \non the roadless area provisions.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my first speech in the Senate \nwith one final comment. I am the first Senator from Oregon elected from \nmy party in more than 30 years. But what I want to do most in the \nSenate is get beyond party labels, get beyond urban versus rural \npolitics, and find common ground to help all our people. Whether you \nare an environmentalist or a mill owner, a fisherman or a logger, a new \npolicy for creating and maintaining healthy forests is the common \nground on which we all may stand. I urge my colleagues to support the \nMurray amendment and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, due to the prominent nature of this \ndebate, perhaps the first thing we ought to do is to put in context how \nmuch, in the way of our national forests and our timber, we are talking \nabout in the contracts that go beyond pure salvage. As a consequence, I \nhave a picture here. The President's forest plan for the Pacific \nNorthwest involves some 24 million acres in the States of Washington \nand Oregon. Mr. President, 19 million of those acres, more than three-\nquarters of them, are protected as statutory wilderness or park areas \nor set aside as research, old growth, and riparian acres.\n  Ten thousand acres in existing contracts are called for to be \nharvested in this amendment. I have indicated those 10,000 acres here.\n  Oh, you say, Mr. President, you cannot see it? Maybe this magnifying \nglass will help.\n  Mr. President, you still cannot see it? That is because what we are \ntalking about is so small that, on a graphic illustration like this, \nyou literally cannot see it. Ten thousand acres of harvest in the \nPacific Northwest, already under contract, will be canceled \nautomatically by this amendment should it pass.\n  As Senator Hatfield pointed out, these 10,000 acres are not some \npermanent forest plan. They are unharvested acres in contracts which \nthe Federal Government offered, received bids for, accepted the bids, \nand signed the contracts between 1990 and 1995. They are legal and \nbinding contracts. And, of course, the amendment is closed-ended \nbecause it applies only to those contracts that were already signed.\n  But, Mr. President, let us say that we have made this a permanent \namendment and said that every year the Forest Service had to execute \ncontracts for 10,000 acres, and let us weigh it against this chart. Mr. \nPresident, grade school math tells us that it would then take 100 years \nto get to 1 million acres. It would take 1,000 years to get to less \nthan half of the acres shown here in the President's forest plan.\n\n  Let me say that again, Mr. President. Out of 24 million acres, in 100 \nyears, if this were permanent, we would get to 1 million acres; in \n1,000 years we would get almost to half of these acres being harvested \nonce. But, of course, this is not a permanent provision. It just says \nthe Government made a deal, it entered into a set of contracts. It \nought to keep those contracts.\n  That is talking about acres here, Mr. President. Let us talk about \nboard feet. This is the almost 400 billion board feet of timber on \nthose acres. This is the almost 300 billion board feet that are in \nthose protected areas. This is the less than 100 billion board feet \nleft. This is what we are talking about, 650 million board feet, \nsomewhat less than one-tenth of the amount of growth each year.\n  Mr. President, you say you cannot see this line? I cannot see this \nline, standing as close to it as I am, because the number is so small. \nThe number is so small.\n  What did the President of the United States say when he signed this \nbill, barely 6 months ago? President William Jefferson Clinton said, \n``The final bill does contain changes in language that preserve our \nability to implement the current forest plans and their standards and \nto protect other resources such as clean water and fisheries.'' That is \nwhat the President said in July of last year about this proposal.\n  Mr. President, this is presented as some kind of modest change, \nmoving toward balance. In fact, of course, this amendment would not \nonly cancel the contracts that have already been let that create legal \nobligations on the part of the Government, that are the subject of the \ncharts that I have just shown, it would also cancel all of the \nprovisions relating to salvage timber, the actual dead and dying \ntimber, and all of the provisions relating to option 9.\n  Senator Murray, in her comments, spoke about the President's timber \nsummit. At the President's timber summit after he was elected, his \nstatement of balance ended up being what is now called option 9, which \ncalled for a harvest of about 1 billion board feet a year in these \nforests. In the nonprotected lands, that would take almost a century to \nwork through.\n  But, as Senator Murray has admitted, almost none of that was actually \nharvested, even though that summit took place in 1993. Why? Because of \nthe endless opportunities the law gave for appeals and for delay. It is \nalmost impossible to find a single harvesting contract that was not \nsubject to such an appeal. The Forest Service, President Clinton's \nForest Service, tells us that in 1994 and in 1995, 92 percent of all of \nthese appeals were turned down. They were frivolous. But an appeal in \nconnection with salvage timber is as good as a cancellation. That \ntimber is dead. It falls to the forest floor. It rots. If you go \nthrough one season stopped by these appeals, for all practical purposes \nthe value of the salvage timber is gone. If you go through two seasons, \nit is absolutely and totally and completely worthless.\n\n  So the timber rider in the rescissions bill included three parts. One \npart said: Mr. President, you have offered the people of the Pacific \nNorthwest option 9. The timber communities do not think it is adequate. \nIt is a harvest of 20 percent, one-fifth of what the normal harvest is. \nBut it was something, it was some offer. You have not been able to keep \nyour promise. We are going to allow you to keep your promise. We are \nnot going to change any of the environmental laws at all. No, you still \nabide by them. That is why the President was able to make this \nstatement. But once you have determined that a particular offering is \nvalid under option 9, you can go ahead and do it and you cannot be \nstopped by this frivolous appeal.\n  Second, for the whole country with respect to salvage timber, we said \nthe\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nsame thing. Mr. President, once your very green administration, your \nvery environmentally sensitive administration says that a salvage sale \nought to go forward, we are going to allow it to go forward. We will \nnot allow it to be stopped by a frivolous appeal until the salvage \ntimber has rotted out and become worthless.\n\n  But, Mr. President, nothing in either one of these provisions, option \n9 or the salvage timber provisions, requires the administration to \nexecute a single contract under option 9 or across the country for \nsalvage timber. It is forced to do nothing that it does not want to do, \nand yet Senator Murray would cancel its ability to do something if it \nwants to do something.\n  The only mandate in the rescissions bill was this 650 million board \nfeet, this tiny amount of existing contracts that the Federal \nGovernment signed, followed all the rules that were in effect at the \ntime it signed them and for which it is liable if it cancels them.\n  Senator Murray's proposal will cancel all of those contracts, will \nallow the suspension by appeal of all of the contracts under option 9 \nor under salvage timber while those appeals are pending, will, in \neffect, result over the next few months in this season in no harvest at \nall in the Pacific Northwest and will create both a loss of revenue to \nthe Federal Government, which it now expects from these sales, and very \nlarge liabilities on the part of the Federal Government to people who \nhold valid contracts.\n  Mr. President, how does she pay for it? She does not add to our \ndeficit directly. She takes it out of general administration of the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Forest Service and out of forest research, \ninterestingly enough, the very research which the amendment says is so \nvitally important. That is for the loss of income, the money that would \ngo into those accounts.\n  For the loss of judgments to people who have valid contracts, she \nsays, interestingly enough, the Secretary concerned can take it from \nany money appropriated to them. Mr. President, did you know that? Did \nyou know that the Secretary could take that money from the account for \nRocky Mountain National Park? Do my colleagues know that it can be \ntaken out of agricultural research in South Carolina? No appropriation, \nno direction from the Congress at all, just wherever an imperial \nSecretary wants to take the money, no matter what it was appropriated \nfor--to the Department of the Interior or the Department of \nAgriculture--the Secretary literally can take that money from anywhere.\n  I listened to the eloquent maiden speech of the new Senator from \nOregon who wishes for a balanced and a thoughtful approach, and I \nwholeheartedly join him in that desire. I believe, as Senator Hatfield, \ndealing with the administration both back in July and at the present \ntime on this has provided exactly that. Senator Hatfield's original \nwork resulted in this statement by the President. That statement is: No \nproblem, no problem at all, we can do everything for the environment we \nwish consistently with this rider.\n  But over and beyond that, this bill, the bill we have before us, \nallows buyouts as long as they are agreed to by both contracting \nparties, allows transfers, as long as they are agreed to by both \ncontracting parties, allows all of the flexibility necessary.\n  The President of the United States promised balance. All of us want \nthat balance. The President of the United States now, in supporting \nthis proposition, says, ``No, this is a tough year and it is an \nelection year. There has been a furor over this.''\n  There have been all kinds of misstatements. No one in the world would \nunderstand from what we have seen how little we are actually talking \nabout: ``You must cancel the whole thing. You must allow appeals to \nstop any harvest of salvage timber, any harvest under option 9, cancel \nall of the sales under section 2001(k)'' and, besides that, another 200 \nmillion board feet of sales that there has been no controversy about \nwhatsoever. Almost half again as much as we told the President to \nexecute is canceled by this amendment about which there has not been \nany controversy, but it will be canceled if this amendment is adopted.\n  Mr. President, this is not balance. It is not a fair approach. The \ndefinition of what is allowed in salvage in here is so tight that there \nwill be no salvage. You cannot salvage in any area without roads. You \ncannot salvage in any wilderness area. You cannot salvage in any lake \nor recreational area. You cannot salvage in any conservation area. That \nis what the whole forest system was created for.\n  There is no money in the salvage account, because it is all used for \nsomething else. If that is not enough, if you get around that and find \none or two, it can be stopped by an appeal.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a prescription for an end to all \nharvesting of timber in the national forests of the Pacific Northwest \nand, therefore, should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding time. I do not know if I will use the entire 10 minutes.\n  Last year on an appropriations bill, we passed the timber salvage \nrider which I consider one of our bigger, if not the biggest, mistakes \nin natural resource management of the last 18, 19 years. We abandoned \nour environmental principles and endorsed a program of logging \nessentially without laws which undermines protections for precious \nresources, with only slight economic justification.\n  It is very difficult to accomplish all those things with one piece of \nlegislation, but that is what the rider did. We passed the original \nrider with little knowledge of its potential impact and without holding \nany hearings. I remember standing on this floor during the debate on \nthat rider and focusing on the language that said any tree susceptible \nto fire or insects could qualify as a tree for salvage, which meant the \nentire forest.\n  Members thought that they were voting to remove dead and dying trees \nfrom our national forests in order to protect forest health and capture \nthe remaining value of trees which had been damaged by devastating \nfires. But we argued against that, pointing out, no, that is not what \nthe language of the rider says. The language was not just for dead and \ndying trees that needed to be salvaged, but that vast areas of the \nnational forests--healthy trees--would be cut as a result of this \nrider.\n  Unfortunately, in our view, the rider, more or less, prevailed in its \nbreadth. The courts interpreted the law to mandate the cutting of some \nof America's most valuable trees.\n  I hope that everyone has a chance to see the pictures that the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington has on the floor, to look at the \nold-growth forests that are being cut because of this rider. Anyone who \nhas ever walked in old-growth forests understands that there is a \ndimension to those forests that is beyond the material. And cutting \ntrees that are 50, 60, 100 years old means that it is going to take \nthat long for them to regrow, if they do, and destroying habitat in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, the areas that are subject to cutting under the court \ndecision include the healthy old-growth forests of western Oregon and \nWashington that have been long off-limits to timber sales because of \ntheir environmental sensitivity.\n  Mr. President, it would be irresponsible for this Congress to ignore \nthose environmental problems and take actions which could make them \nworse. For example, a recent long-term study of the effects of timber \ncutting in the Northwest found that there was increased flooding even \nafter 20 years, resulting from clear-cutting in sensitive areas. How \ncan we appropriate millions more in this bill to repair flood damage in \nareas without taking the steps that the Murray amendment represents, to \nreduce the risks of future floods by assuring a full-growth national \nforest? How can we do that?\n  If you had the forest restored, you would have fewer floods; but we \ncut the forests, and we have more floods. Then we take taxpayers' \ndollars to make those individuals that are affected by those floods \nwhole.\n  Mr. President, the timber salvage is not just an issue for the \nNorthwest, which is another point. Even though\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nthe focus is on those old-growth forests, the riders apply equally to \nforests nationwide by requiring salvage sales in areas that would \notherwise have been rejected for legitimate environmental reasons.\n  Although agencies such as the National Marine Fisheries Service, Fish \nand Wildlife Service, and EPA have objected to many of those sales, \ncourts have held that they must go forward because of this salvage \namendment rider, because they are required by the letter of that law. \nEven worse, Mr. President, the rationale for the rider rests on \nimproving deteriorating forest health conditions.\n  That is supported with very little data. We lack even the basic \ninformation needed to justify cutting trees on the scale endorsed by \nthe rider, under conditions which suspend environmental laws and \nterminate almost all avenues for administrative and judicial appeal.\n  Senator Murray's amendment, I believe, would supply this missing \ninformation by requiring a new National Academy of Sciences study for \nforest health that provides the answers that Congress needs to regulate \nthe forests sensibly. We do not have the answers right now. The law was \npassed, essentially mandating the cutting, and we do not have even the \ninformation to back it up. Last year's rider also undermines President \nClinton's consensus Northwest forest plan, which took many months to \nproduce and gave some hope for settling the region's longstanding \ntimber wars.\n  Instead, under the rider, the timber wars have resumed at full force. \nThe distinguished Senator from Washington pointed out that the \nPresident said he thought that he could work with it, and that is why \nhe signed the bill. That was before the court decision said no. There \nwere vast areas that were now open for salvage that the President had \nno idea of under the language of the law as he read it. The court \nbroadly interpreted it so that now you are not just going in to pick up \na few dead trees and dying trees, but you are slashing old-growth \nforests, as in the pictures that the distinguished Senator from \nWashington has shown to the Senate and to the country.\n  Mr. President, we have a chance to reverse these mistakes. We have a \nchance to take a more measured approach to timber salvage. That is the \nMurray amendment. It is supported by a wide variety of environmental \ngroups. I know that that is not important to everyone, but it should be \nregistered. The Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society, Wilderness \nSociety, National Resources Defense Council, regional groups throughout \nthe Pacific Northwest, they understand the significance of cutting old-\ngrowth forests. All this Murray amendment does is put laws back into \nthe timber program. It is probably the biggest environmental vote that \nwe are going to take, at least so far, this year. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Murray amendment and restore lawful logging to our \nnational forests. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nMontana uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair very much, and I thank the leader on \nthis.\n  Here we go again, talking about health of the forests, talking about \nthe elimination of jobs in research, when more research is needed, and \ntalking about a situation that existed in damaged forests before this \nsalvage bill was passed a year ago.\n  It was simply management by committee at that time, and that did not \nwork very well. It was not successful. Professional land and resource \nmanagers could not have or they could not have been allowed to apply \ngood conservation measures when dealing with renewable resources. We \nare talking about renewable resources here.\n  And the salvage program gave some hope, hope of predictability in the \ncommunities across the Northwest that depend upon that healthy, viable \nforest. A diseased forest supports nobody, not this Federal Government, \nnot people who want to own houses, not people who use wood products, \nnor the people who live in those communities that are dependent on the \nconservation or the wise use of a renewable resource.\n  The salvage program was passed by this Congress, with bipartisan \nsupport, as a tool to deal with forest health. The fires of 1988, 1994, \nand 1995 were devastating, so this Congress did exactly what it should \nhave done in light of what the President and Vice President had \npromised the folks in the Northwest.\n  Now, are we seeing the rug pulled out from underneath them again? I \njust want to draw the attention of my colleagues to a couple things \nthat I think are very, very important whenever we start considering \nthis issue. This is where we want to get to: healthy, growing, young \nforests. The subject of the fire, now with a lot of things cleaned out, \na lot of the undertow cleaned out, this forest is well on its way to \nrecovery. That is where we want to get to. I think that is very \nimportant.\n  I want to draw your attention to this photograph. Here is a diseased \nforest as we find some of our forests in the State of Montana, dead and \ndying, with a green tree every now and again, basically a forest that \nhas matured. If we are to regain any kind of value from this resource, \nwe should take these forests, take the dead and dying trees, because if \nwe do not--if we do not--as the years of 1988 and 1994 proved, this \nwill be the scene across the great landscape of my favorite State of \nMontana.\n  This is up in the Yaak--a very dry year, lightning fires. You want to \ntalk about air quality. Let us talk about air quality while we are \ntalking about an environmentally impacted area. That is what it looks \nlike when you get up a little closer, as it takes everything, the dead \nand dying and, yes, even the green trees. It takes it all. Devastating, \ndangerous. Again we can talk air quality. Want to get up a little \ncloser? Anybody ever look down the throat of a forest fire? I have. In \n1953, Edith Peek, Tango--I can name a lot of fires, most of them caused \nby a very natural thing called lightning. But with all the fuel that is \non the forest floor, once it starts there is no stopping it. Again, it \nburns the diseased, the dying, and the healthy trees.\n\n  Now, after this little episode is over, this is what you have. This \nis what we are talking about as far as salvage is concerned. Some of \nthese logs that are on the floor of the forest are actually usable, but \nas a year or 2 years goes by, they lose their value. There is no value \nthere at all. So the salvage is not taken care of.\n  Another picture, same way, the subject of fire. Only take the ones \nthat are on the floor of the forest. It makes a resource for us and \neverybody in this country.\n  A while ago we talked about water quality. This is in a forest that \nis subject to disease. A stream, drainage--that was not caused by man, \nbut it can be healed by man--to protect this water quality, and \nnobody--nobody--is better at it than the State of Montana, or is more \naware of it and more sensitive to it than my State of Montana.\n  When the provision was signed into law a year ago, it was a sound \nland management decision then. It still is. Instead of keeping an \nactive forest salvage program in place, this amendment does a couple of \nthings. It adds back new layers of bureaucracy while it takes away from \nother areas, areas where we could put more research and technology--\nthis also promotes brandnew litigation. You know who wins in \nlitigation. It is not the forest, and it is usually not the resource \nproducers or the resource managers.\n  The salvage bill was passed by Congress and signed into law by the \nPresident. It provided a speedy process of processing and preparing. It \ncalled for environmental assessment and biological evaluation to be \ncompleted upon each sale. Let me tell you something that has happened \nas a result of this: Knowing that it may not end up in the courts, the \ndifferent groups--both the logging industry, both the Forest Service \nwho has responsibility of taking care of and managing that forest, and \ngroups outside that were concerned about the environmental impact on \nthat forest--all came together and they went into the forest and looked \nat some proposed sales. Everybody signed off on them. What it is, it \nbrought them closer together because they knew that this problem was \nnot going\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nto be taken to court, that we had to participate in the dialog. \nEverybody signed off. Everybody was happy. I think that was through the \nleadership of some people who worked for the Forest Service in the \nState of Montana that understood that if we are going to make the \nsalvage law work, and protect the integrity of that law, we had to \ninclude a lot of people. They did that.\n  Really, all the groups concerned fundamentally agree to the same \nthing. They want a healthy forest. They want a renewable forest. They \nwant one that is growing. Not only does it make good sense for the \namenities of the area, it also makes good economic sense for the \ncommunities that depend upon the harvest of timber, and the harvest in \nan environmentally sensitive way--to involve people. That is what we \ndid in Montana.\n  The courts are a terrible place to resolve our disputes. What \nhappened in our case as a result of the salvage rider is this: When two \nsides or three sides are forced to settle their differences on the \nground, knowing that the only way they will attain resolutions on the \nground, they try to because reasonable people find ways to solve \nreasonable problems.\n\n  There was a copy of a letter sent to me from the commissioners up in \nLincoln County, MT, testifying, ``We are here to personally testify \nthat these salvage sales on the Kootenai National Forest are being done \nresponsibly and in compliance with environmental laws, improving forest \nhealth conditions damaged by fires, creating jobs and generating a \nreturn''--a return--``of funds to the general Treasury of the United \nStates of America,'' where those funds will dry up if this amendment is \napproved.\n  It is a testimony of people who live in the area who are concerned \nabout their forest and who testify that, yes, the salvage rider is \nworking. What criticism it may have, we must not lose the sight that \nour only goal is really for a healthy forest. Our communities cannot \nlive without a healthy forest.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, allow us to proceed in \na way where there is balance, where the balance is responsible and \nwhere we can find answers by talking to people and not yelling at them \nin a courtroom. That is where we solve problems--when it comes to our \nnatural resource management, in the areas that are totally dependent on \nthat natural resource.\n  Mr. President, the timber salvage provision enacted last summer is \ndoing what it was intended to do. But the amendment offered by Senator \nMurray turns the clock back on sound land management policy and job \nsecurity.\n  The lack of management over the years has left our communities at \nrisk. Not only are Montana's communities which depend on the wood \nproducts industry on economic shaky ground, we have placed them at risk \nof serious fires.\n  We must not lose site of the fact that the timber salvage provision \nsigned into law last year was in reaction to the serious fire load on \nthe ground in the West. The fires of 1994 and 1995 were damaging. Human \nsafety, community stability, and jobs were at stake. The work that is \nbeing done on the ground today under the salvage provision will help \nalleviate the potential threats during the 1996 fire season and beyond.\n  The provision signed into law last summer is a sound land management \nplan. But, with this amendment we have turned away from reason. Instead \nof keeping an active forest salvage program in place, the amendment \nwould repeal sales which have been prepared, add new layers of \nbureaucracy, and promote new litigation. The proposal we have before us \nshould be called the ``No Logging, No Logic, and Lots of Litigation \nAmendment''.\n  It is important to remember what the timber salvage provision \nsupported earlier by this Congress and signed by President Clinton \naccomplishes. The provision speeds up the process in which a sale is \nprepared and offered. It calls for an environmental assessment and a \nbiological evaluation to be completed on each sale. The land management \nagencies are required to implement a reforestation plan for each parcel \nof land. Also, the enacted provision excludes wilderness areas, \nroadless areas recommended for wilderness by the land managers, and any \nother Federal land where timber harvesting is prohibited by law.\n  These sales must be completed quickly because we are talking about \ndead and dying trees. The longer the diseased or dead trees stay in the \nwoods, the more rapidly their value deteriorates. For instance, after \nfire damage a Douglas-fir will lose 20 percent of its value over 1 \nyear. This rate of deterioration increases more rapidly with time. We \nneed to move quickly. If we do not, the potential for jobs are lost and \nfire hazard increases.\n  Also, the funds acquired through these sales is being used on \nrestoration activities in the woods. If we stop these sales, or \ndecrease the value of the sales by waiting, we lose revenues for \nrestoration activities.\n  The timber salvage provision has resulted in 62 million board feet of \ntimber being sold in Montana and there is 233 million board feet in the \npipeline; 143 million of this is salvage from the 1994 fires on the \nKootenai National Forest.\n  There has been criticism that this salvage program has resulted in \nthe sale of green trees. This simply is not true. If it were true, I \nwould be the first in line telling the Forest Service they are not \nfollowing the intent of the law and would support legislative changes.\n  But the fact is, 90 percent of the salvage program in Montana is dead \nor immediately dead timber. The remaining 10 percent harvested fits the \nintent of forest health definition under the law. This is the same \ndefinition the Forest Service has used. Sometimes the harvesting of \ngreen trees is necessary to implement salvage activities. But, in \nMontana, only 10 percent of the timber harvested under the salvage \nprovision was green.\n\n  The amendment offered by Senator Murray moves us backward. It guts a \nfair and balanced provision and replaces it with legal bells and \nwhistles, stopping aggressive management practices, and placing jobs at \nrisk.\n  Appeals are a lawyer's heaven and a timber man's nightmare. Yet, this \namendment encourages appeals. The snowballing effect of stopping these \nsales is large. Due to similarities in all salvage sales, if one appeal \nis filed it has the potential of stopping all salvage sales.\n  In addition, not only would this affect future sales, it would affect \nsales which have already been prepared. For folks on the ground in \nMontana, this means that they could be working today, but sent home \ntomorrow if this amendment were enacted.\n  Senator Murray's amendment also sacrifices Montana's interests for \nthe President's Northwest forest initiative. The amendment directs the \nmanagement agency to pay for the trade or buy out of the 318 sales in \nOregon and Washington in a 1-year timeframe. These sales were sold and \nthen canceled by the Clinton administration. The cost is around $300 \nmillion.\n  In order to pay for these cancellations, financial resources from \nother States could be diverted. This means new visitors construction, \npreparation of new salvage and green sales, and other activities in \nMontana could be diverted to pay for the President's Pacific Northwest \nforest initiative.\n  In order to address concerns raised by the White House over the 318 \nsales, Senators Hatfield and Gorton included language in the bill which \ngives the Forest Service and BLM the opportunity to find alternative \ntimber or funds to meet these contracts. The Murray language, however, \nhas a 1-year period to trade or buy out these contracts. That certainly \ndoes not seem fair or balanced for the rest of the Nation, including \nMontana.\n  One last point I would like to make is that the timber salvage \nprovision enacted last year is temporary. It sunsets at the end of this \ncalendar year. I am hopeful that this year the Congress will send, and \nPresident Clinton will sign, a comprehensive forest health bill. In \nfact, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has placed \nSenate bill 391 on its calendar for consideration.\n  Mr. President, the timber salvage provision enacted last year is \nworking. It is providing jobs to Montanans. It is helping to lessen the \nfire load on the ground in our forests. It is helping to minimize the \nrisks of forest fires around communities.\n  Yet, the amendment offered by Senator Murray takes us backward. It\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nadds new bureaucracy, litigation, and not much common sense.\n  The days of not managing our woods has to end. Our national forest \nneed management. I strongly oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nMurray because it will block effective land management decisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from \nGovernor Racicot, dated March 8, 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                             State of Montana,\n\n                                   Helena, Montana, March 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Timber salvage activities have been \n     controversial in Montana and throughout the west, and there \n     is no question that since July of last year--when the \n     emergency timber salvage law was passed by Congress and \n     signed by the President--the U.S. Forest Service has labored \n     under significant pressure and intense scrutiny in complying \n     with Congressional salvage timber mandates.\n       Now, nine months after passage of the emergency salvage \n     law, Congress is apparently considering a partial reversal of \n     its previous action and abandoning the purpose and intent of \n     the emergency salvage law. Such a reversal has the potential \n     to infuse delay, disruption, chaos and economic uncertainty \n     into timber salvage operations with forest health the number \n     one casualty.\n       While I cannot speak for Forest Service performance in \n     other states, I can speak with some certainty about the \n     performance of the Forest Service in Montana. In meetings \n     with the Regional Forester, in meetings with forest \n     supervisors and in discussions with various Forest Service \n     personnel from the Regional Forester's office to local ranger \n     districts, I can assure you the Forest Service has surpassed \n     expectations in forest stewardship and professional land \n     management in implementing the timber salvage intent of \n     Congress. It would be a disservice to the mission of the \n     Forest Service and to forest health in Montana to countermand \n     or withdraw the direction from Congress given in July 1995.\n       Thus far in Montana, some 62 million board feet of timber \n     has already been sold under the provisions of the emergency \n     salvage law. Some of this has already been harvested, and \n     much of it is being harvested now. Some 233 million board \n     feet are in the timber salvage pipeline, and 90 percent of \n     this volume is dead or dying timber. Obviously, having been \n     burned two years ago in 1994, the value of this dead or dying \n     timber continues to decline and for the intent of the salvage \n     law to be met logging operations must continue throughout \n     1996. Under the proposed language form Senator Murray, \n     contracted sales could be delayed for months, thus \n     countermanding congressional intent to expedite salvage \n     operations.\n       Like many Montanans, I had some concerns about the Forest \n     Service and its ability to meet the Congressional intent of \n     the salvage law and at the same time meet existing \n     environmental and forest health standards set by state and \n     federal law and national forest plans. Forest Service \n     personnel were granted significant discretion to implement \n     the salvage law, and the dual goals of accelerated harvest \n     and environmental protection seemed to present compliance \n     problems for Forest Service officials.\n       To their credit, the Forest Service has walked this ``fine \n     line'' of compliance with an impressive commitment which has \n     yielded impressive results. The Memorandum of Agreement \n     signed by the Forest Service and three additional federal \n     agencies makes clear the commitment to follow proper \n     environmental guidelines. The State of Montana, and the \n     people of Montana, were assured by the Regional Forester that \n     environmental standards would not be compromised, water \n     quality would be maintained, fisheries protected, \n     endangered or sensitive species would not be jeopardized, \n     forest economies would be sustained and forest health \n     would be improved.\n       In December of 1995, a member of my staff, joined by \n     personnel from the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & \n     Parks and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, \n     met with Forest Service officials to discuss timber salvage \n     operations. The Forest Service salvage team included \n     fisheries biologists, wildlife biologists, hydrologists and \n     others in addition to forest rangers and federal timber \n     managers. While the Forest Service salvage team made it clear \n     it would follow Congressional intend to accelerate harvest of \n     dead and dying timber, there were also assurances that \n     environmental laws and forest standards would be followed as \n     stipulated in the federal MOA. Thus far, those assurances \n     have been backed up with performance. During a recent tour of \n     salvage operations on the Kooetnai National Forest, a member \n     of my staff joined a large group which evaluated the Fowler \n     Fire Salvage Sale. The Fowler salvage sales is an ongoing \n     harvest and it was clear the Forest Service personnel who \n     planned and laid out the sale recognized environmental \n     sensitivities and the importance of water quality. The \n     logging contractor also did an excellent job of protecting \n     water quality and the integrity of the area.\n       In addition, it was pointed out during the tour briefing \n     the Kootenai National Forest comprises some 2.5 million \n     acres. Of this total, some 53,000 acres burned in 1994. Of \n     the 53,000 acres, the Forest Service identified only 15,000 \n     acres for possible salvage sale operations. Of this 15,000, \n     less than 7,000 acres will actually be slated for salvage \n     timber harvest activity. While the Kootenai will see more \n     timber salvage operations than any other national forest in \n     Montana, abuse of the salvage directive is virtually \n     nonexistent as was any evidence of so-called ``lawless \n     logging.'' What was seen was low impact snow roads. INFISH \n     buffer strips, intentions to close roads and a commitment to \n     produce timber with environmental safeguards in place.\n       In a sense, Congress challenged the Forest Service with the \n     emergency salvage law. In Montana, the Forest Service appears \n     to have met that challenge. Through the salvage law, Forest \n     Service personnel received additional discretion. That \n     discretion has not been abused. If there are isolated cases \n     of poor federal stewardship, we should identify and correct \n     them. But it does not make sense for congress to order the \n     Forest Service to halt, do an about face, and send the agency \n     in conflicting and confusing directions.\n       Montana experienced serious fire damage in 1994. Yet we \n     were fortunate that damage wasn't worse. It is imperative we \n     improve the health of our forests, create jobs and economic \n     stability for western Montana, and present--best we are \n     able--conditions for dangerous and uncontrollable \n     conflagrations in the future. The Public Participation in \n     Timber Salvage Act may be well intended, but it is \n     unwarranted in Montana, and if it prevents or retards the \n     proper harvest of dead and dying trees, it will not help \n     improve forest health.\n       Thank you for your review of this information, and if I can \n     address any concerns or questions you may have regarding this \n     letter, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Modification of Amendment No. 3493\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have a modification to my amendment, \nand I ask unanimous consent to send it to the desk. It has been cleared \non both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). Is there an objection to the \nmodification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification follows:\n\n       Strike Section 13 of amendment No. 3493 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Sec. 13. Offsets.--Not withstanding any provision in \n     Title II of this Act, no more than $137,757,000 shall be \n     obligated for `Forest Research' and no more than \n     $1,165,005,000 shall be obligated for the `National Forest \n     System.' ''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. President. I join with my colleagues this \nmorning in opposition to the Murray amendment to the salvage law that \nbecame part of the law of this land last year, as we attempted to \naddress the devastating fires of 1994. Of course, we have watched over \nthe last good number of months as we worked with the administration and \nthe Forest Service to implement the necessary regulations to carry out \nthe salvage.\n  I am disappointed this morning that we find ourselves in a situation \nnow where for political purposes, I have to guess, we are here on the \nfloor debating this issue. I say that in all due respect to the Senator \nfrom Washington who is attempting to craft an amendment to address an \nissue that obviously she is very concerned about.\n  Here are my problems, and I will not go into the detail of the 318 \nsales--those are valid existing contracts, carried out by \nmultidiscipline groups on the ground, selecting the right sales, \ntalking to the environmentalists, seeking the counsel. All of that has \nalready been done.\n  Now, if it had not been done, there may be a basis to argue. But it \nhas been done. It has been done for over several years. I know that \nbecause sitting beside me on the Senate floor is a staff assistant who \nwas a ranger in one of the forests, who developed the teams that \nbrought the environmentalists to the table to resolve the issue of what \nought to be in those sales. Those are facts on the books. Why are we \ndebating 318 sales if the public has already had a full dimension in \nparticipating in how those types of sales would be brought about?\n  The Senator from Washington said there were not adequate hearings. \nMr. President, here is the record of the hearings, and these are not \nall the books. There have been a lot of hearings. I have conducted at \nleast one in\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nthe committee that I chair. We have had the administration and the \nAssistant Secretary before us to talk about the details of how this law \ngets implemented. This administration spent over 6 months putting \nregulations together, in a way that involved more and more people in \ndecisionmaking, as to what were the right and the wrong sales. So there \nhas been a phenomenal amount of involvement.\n  The Senator's amendment proposes to take approximately $130 million \nfrom the remaining fiscal year of the Forest Service to implement what \nshe suggests ought to be done. Here are some calculations that come to \nme from staff, based on what we believe are legitimate figures. The \nSenator from Washington, if her amendment becomes law, will require an \nimmediate RIF of nearly 1,700 Federal employees off the employment \nrosters of the U.S. Forest Service. Because she could not find offsets, \nshe goes immediately into the law and into the budget for the U.S. \nForest Service for the remainder of the fiscal year, and it appears \nthat that is what is happening. I hope she will explain that to us and \ncorrect that. The Forest Service, through a reduction in force, has \nreduced employees over the last 5 years 1,000 a year; 5,000 employees \nin the Forest Service are now gone from where they were 5 years ago.\n  I hope the junior Senator from Washington can speak to us about where \nshe finds her money and the impact on current employees and the ability \nof the Forest Service to carry out the remainder of this year's \nactivities, not just in timber, but in trail maintenance, campgrounds, \npublic safety, in all of the kinds of things that we expect them to do. \nI believe she is obligated to tell us the kind of impact this kind of \nreduction or change in the expenditure of the Forest Service would \nresult in.\n  I understand that the junior Senator has attempted to remove the \nclause which requires the immediate suspension of active logging. I \nappreciate that because in my State of Idaho it could cost us thousands \nof jobs this year of literally thousands of working men and women in \nsmall communities across my State, who are anticipating these salvage \nsales, based on the legal and legitimate approach the Forest Service \nhas used. She is suggesting that they might not get those jobs.\n  But here is the problem, and I wish, again, the Senator would address \nthis. I believe that even though she has changed that provision to \nimmediately suspend active logging, that is, through the clause \nrequired within the law, here is the result: What happens is the same \neffect occurs, because now all of these actions are again subject to \nappeal, and that could result in an automatic 60-day-plus stay or \nlonger. And all of those sales that are now ready to be logged this \nspring as soon as the ground stabilizes and the snow is gone could be \nimmediately back into the courts.\n\n  I am suggesting to the junior Senator that she really ought to \ncorrect that problem if she is sincere in suggesting that active \nlogging not get stopped. The reason I say that is because one sale in \nmy State, which is kind of the ``poster child'' sale, called the \n``Thunderbolt,'' was one where every environmental group lined up and \ntook this sale into court, and they kept it in court for nearly 6 \nmonths. Finally, the courts ruled that the Forest Service had done all \nof the right and proper things to resolve this sale.\n  Here is the result of it. This was a sale that was a product of the \ndevastating fires in Idaho in 1994. It is to be 100 percent helicopter-\nlogged, not one new road built. Only 12 percent of the burned area, or \n2,200 acres, will be logged. About 16,000 acres will not be touched. \nThe timber salvage will pay for the watershed restoration and the \nreplanting that needs to go on in these devastated areas. That money \nwill not now be there. Those trees will not get replanted.\n  Peer review teams of watershed scientists have reviewed that and \nreviewed this and endorsed it. I think it is important for the junior \nSenator from Washington to understand this. The scientists have said \nthat the proper management of this sale, under the way it has been \ndeveloped by the Forest Service, will improve the environment of the \nThunderbolt area, which is a critical watershed area to the Salmon \nRiver, which is, of course, a salmon habitat for a threatened and \nendangered species.\n  Mr. President, the consequence of this amendment is dramatic. You \nhave heard about the potential loss of jobs from the U.S. Forest \nService because of the RIF's that would have to occur. Another example \nof the kind of job loss that is occurring in Idaho right now is as a \nresult of not only current Forest Service action, but an inability to \nmove these salvage sales to sale this last fiscal year because of this \nadministration's very cumbersome process of crafting the regulation to \nmanage this salvage requirement under last year's law, as designed by \nthe senior Senator from the State of Washington.\n  We lost 100 jobs in Salmon, ID. In Metropolitan New York City that is \nnot a big deal, but in Salmon that was the single largest work force \noutside of the U.S. Forest Service.\n  We lost 200 jobs in Council, ID. That mill shut down, and as we \nspeak, that mill has been torn down and shipped off to a foreign \ncountry where there are logs to cut.\n  The Post Falls mill in Post Falls, ID, 200 jobs down, men and women \nnot working.\n  Louisiana Pacific mill and Priest River, 100 jobs down, not working.\n  Sandpoint, ID, 55 jobs down, not working.\n  These are men and women who are on the welfare rolls or who are \nhaving to seek other forms of employment. They have had their lives \ndevastated. They have had tremendous financial disruption in their \nfamilies--not because there are not trees to cut, but because Federal \npolicy, through the appropriate environmental restraints, will not \nallow that to happen.\n  If we have salvage sales next summer, many of these people will come \nback to work. If the junior Senator's amendment passes, these people \nwill remain on the welfare rolls in the State of Idaho.\n\n  Another mill in Grangeville, ID, closed and lost 113 jobs. That mill \nwas torn down, with pieces of it sold, I am told, to Argentina.\n  That is 738 jobs in a State with a population of 1,338,000. Those are \ncritically important jobs.\n  Mr. President, in the fires of 1994, the Forest Service estimated a \nloss in Idaho of $665 million board feet with a salvage worth $325 \nmillion. Half of that value is already gone because we could not cut \nthe trees last summer. The rest of that value will leave this summer if \nthe amendment of the junior Senator from Washington becomes law. There \nwill be no value. It will have rotted away. In other words, the money \nshe would use could be recouped if we simply allowed those sales.\n  My time is up. I certainly encourage all of my colleagues to not \nsupport the junior Senator from Washington. I wish she would respond to \nsome of the legitimate concerns we have about the impact of her bill \nand the loss of 1,700 jobs in the Forest Service and their inability to \ncarry out the public policy needs for the remainder of this fiscal \nyear, which her amendment will badly damage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Idaho for pointing out the \nconcerns he has with the offsets. Let me first say that the money comes \nfrom general administration, and we have been assured that much of this \ncan come from belt tightening for travel.\n  I will also tell my colleague from Idaho that the offset has been an \nitem of discussion all week long because of the sequencing of \namendments that have come to the floor, and we were not sure which ones \nwould pass or not pass. Senator Hatfield, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, has assured us that we can continue to \ndiscuss this legislation. It has a long way to go when it gets to \nconference, where we can reconsider this. A lot of dollar figures will \nbe discussed and changed around. It is an item we will be able to be \nflexible with once it is passed.\n  The important point of this amendment is that we go back to trees \nlike that in the picture, which are 250 to 300 years old and are coming \ndown because we have a rider in place that says people are not part of \nthe process. That is what we are focusing on.\n  Yes, we are concerned about jobs in the Pacific Northwest. The jobs \nthe Senator has talked about have passed under current policy. My \namendment says we are going to deal with jobs in\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nthe long term. We are going to put a salvage amendment in place that \nassures that those jobs will occur when people are in the process, with \nscientific evidence in place, and in a way that is safe and healthy for \nall of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and state what \nthis amendment is all about and what it is not all about.\n  This amendment is about harvesting dead and dying timber in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner. That is all this amendment is \nabout. It is not about hurting the timber industry, taking away jobs, \nor stopping timber harvesting in our national forests. It is not about \nthat at all. Once a person thinks clearly and thoroughly through the \nactual words of the amendment, particularly as modified by the Senator \nfrom Washington, one will see that this is about trying to find an \nexpedited way to salvage and harvest timber in an environmentally \nresponsible way. It is not about taking away jobs, once one reads the \namendment, particularly as modified by the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, about once a month I spend a workday in my State as \nstaff. I show up at 8 o'clock in the morning with a sack lunch. I work \nstraight on. Sometimes I bag groceries. I deliver the mail other days. \nI serve meals to senior citizens. I was once a UPS worker delivering \npackages. I have done lots of jobs.\n  I have also worked on the green chains in several mills of my State, \nin the plywood plants, the stud mills at various and different \nlocations working with the mill workers--talking to the mill workers, \nmen and women who work on green chains and work in the mills. And I \nhave a pretty good sense of where people are and what they want. It is \ntrite, but it is true: They want jobs. But they also want hunting and \nfishing. They want jobs in a very responsible and environmental way.\n  During the summer of 1994, I spent one of my workdays with the fire \ncrew on the Little Wolf fire on the Flathead National Forest near \nKalispell, MT. I spent the day fighting the fire. It turned out that my \nchief was a person from the Fort Belknap Reservation, had a group going \nall around the country. This crew knew how to fight fire. I had a devil \nof a time keeping up with them. They are tough. They are good.\n  The Little Wolf fire was just one of hundreds of fires that raged \nduring that long, hot summer in Montana. There were lots of fires in \nthe West, particularly in my State, and when fall of the year finally \ncame around and the last of the fires was finally put out, there were \nthousands of acres of our national forests that were burned. It is \namazing how many acres were burned.\n  Like most Montanans, it is clear that a lot of that timber had to be \nsalvaged. I supported and I encouraged efforts to harvest that burned \ntimber, get it to the mills, and provide jobs. Following the fires of \n1994, I wrote a letter to Forest Service Chief Jack Ward Thomas, and I \nasked him to make salvage logging a priority. I asked him to use winter \nlogging--you can log in the winter under certain circumstances--to \nharvest these burned logs, because I believe, as I stated in my letter \nto him, when done in an environmentally responsible manner, it is not \nonly good business, but it is also good, long-term, prudent forest \nmanagement to salvage that timber.\n  After all of that, Congress did act and enacted this so-called \nsalvage rider. And I think that is where Congress went wrong--went too \nfar. Rather than looking for responsible ways to promote the harvest of \nsalvaged timber, what did Congress do? Essentially Congress passed a \nso-called salvage rider, passed a provision that exempted the Forest \nService from complying with our environmental laws, from complying with \nthe Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Forest Management \nAct, the Endangered Species Act, and all of the Federal environmental \nand natural resources laws.\n\n  The rider provision also prohibited the public from contesting timber \nsales that the public thought would impair the hunting or fishing on \nparticular forests. It just cut the public out.\n  So, first, it went too far because it said that the environmental \nstatutes do not have to be observed. And, second, it cut the public out \nof the process.\n  Some wise person once said that for every complicated problem--\nbelieve me, this is a little complicated--there is a simple solution, \nand it is usually wrong. Most complicated problems do not lend \nthemselves to simple solutions. Most complicated problems lend \nthemselves to nonsimple solutions; that is, working hard, rolling up \nour sleeves, dotting the i's, crossing the t's, and trying to work out \na pretty reasoned and balanced solution.\n  That is what the Murray amendment does. It is an attempt to--and it \nis, if one reads the language, a provision that very much provides a \nframework to accomplish that result. Let me give you two examples of \nhow the current salvage rider--that is, the so-called current salvage \nrider law that we now have facing us--has aroused opposition in my \nState.\n  The first example is the Hyalite drainage in the Gallatin National \nForest. Where is that? The Hyalite is located about 7 miles outside of \nBozeman. It is a very popular recreation, hunting area. Bozeman is in \nGallatin County, one of the more prosperous parts of our State. It is \nsought after. A lot of people moving into Montana like to go to \nGallatin. It is very near the Hyalite. Locals hike and ride bikes in 31 \nmiles of trails. A herd of about 600 elk--and occasionally grizzly \nbears--make their homes in the Hyalite. And the city of Bozeman gets \nabout 15 percent of its water from the Hyalite Creek.\n  The Forest Service has proposed a timber sale in the Hyalite under \nthe salvage logging rider. The Forest Service says that they can do it; \nthey can harvest timber without hurting recreation, without hurting \nwildlife, or Bozeman's drinking water.\n  I must say a lot of people in Bozeman are not too sure about that. If \nthe Forest Service can cut timber and amply protect elk habitat and \nwater quality at the same time, most people think the Forest Service \nshould welcome accountability to the public. They should want explained \nto the public how they are doing this. Doing this under a law that \nevades all environmental protection raises obvious and understandable \nconcerns in Bozeman.\n  It is kind of like buying a used car. You buy a used car. You want to \nbelieve the salesman, but you also want to have your mechanic take a \nlook under the hood just to be safe. And the Hyalite is very important \nto Bozeman. The people there want the safety that the Clean Water Act \nand the National Forest Management Act provides. I think that is \nreasonable.\n  The second example is the Middle Fork salvage sale in the Flathead \nNational Forest. This proposed sale is a narrow strip of land just \nbetween Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area. The \ntrees the Forest Service wants to cut in the Middle Fork are not \nburned. Rather, they are trees that the Forest Service has determined \nare infected by root disease.\n\n  Like most Montanans, I have a very deep reverence for Glacier \nNational Park and the Bob Marshall. We all do in Montana. Like the \nGrand Canyon is to Arizona or Yosemite is to California, Glacier and \n``the Bob'' are part of our Montana identity. So I do not think it is \nasking too much in any timber sale in this area to be held to a very \nhigh conservation standard.\n  Ironically, I do not believe the Forest Service and the timber \nindustry need to be excused from obeying the law. I have seen the work \nthey do. It is good. And except for the rare exception, these men and \nwomen are good stewards of the land, and they harvest timber without \nhurting water quality or elk habitat.\n  Where there are opportunities to harvest timber that has been ravaged \nby fire or disease-infected timber, or ravaged by windstorms, the \nForest Service, I think, should move quickly. That is the whole point \nof the Murray amendment. The Forest Service does not, however, need to \nsuspend environmental laws to do so. In fact, since this salvage rider \nhas gone into effect, the Forest Service has committed to carrying out \ntheir salvage timber program in full compliance of all environmental \nlaws. Rather, the Forest Service needs the flexibility to protect the \nplanning\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nprocess and avoid many of the procedural requirements that simply slow \ntheir response time down.\n  That is why I support the Murray amendment. It replaces the existing \nsalvage law with a process which recognizes that salvage timber is \ndifferent from green timber. It calls on the Forest Service to identify \nsalvage logging opportunities, prepare the necessary analysis, and \noffer the timber up for sale in a very short timeframe--about 6 months. \nThis is a quick turnaround when you consider that normally it takes the \nForest Service much longer to prepare a green timber sale. The Murray \namendment does this while honoring our environmental laws and the \npublic's right to be involved in making the decision.\n  Mr. President, I was struck by an article that ran in last Sunday's \nGreat Falls Tribune entitled ``Finding Common Ground.'' This article \ndoes something that we rarely see these days; it told the good news. It \nlet the public know about the impressive work that groups all over our \nState--like the Swan Citizens Ad Hoc Committee, the Smith River \nCoordinated Resources Management Commission, and Blackfoot Challenge--\nare doing to promote jobs and economic development while protecting our \nquality of life.\n\n  I believe the Murray amendment is such an amendment. It will provide \nthe framework for future consensus building on how we can manage our \nnational forests.\n  I compliment the Senator for making the change which will help us \nmoved toward our common ground.\n  Let me say, in closing, let us not lose sight of what this amendment \nis. It is about providing jobs and protecting the environment. I urge \nSenators to support her commonsense effort to find the median in \nbetween the common ground to get the job done.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana for \nsupporting the amendment.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe very strongly that Congress \nshould repeal the salvage rider, and I believe that Senator Murray's \namendment is a responsible, balanced proposal to fix a bad law.\n  I concur with the words of the distinguished Senator from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, in commending her in working out a balanced amendment. \nI believe that is why her amendment is supported by conservation \ngroups, by private businesses, resource-based industries such as \ncommercial fishermen, editorial boards across the country, the League \nof Conservation Voters, a whole lot of others, because her compromise \nprovides economic stability and jobs for workers in rural communities, \nand it also respects what has been a 25-year tradition of bipartisan \nenvironmental protection in this body.\n  It is not an extreme measure. It is a very fair, very moderate, and \nvery responsible measure. But the current law, the current salvage \nrider is not. It is not balanced. It is not fair. It is not moderate. \nIt is not responsible. So let us come together as a Senate on a \nreasonable alternative for protecting the public's national forest \nlands. These lands are for us to share today but also to have for \ngenerations to come. That includes Senator Murray's children, who are \ngoing to live most of their lives in the next century, as will mine. \nBut this public resource is being abused, and we have to ask what is \ngoing to be here in that next century.\n  I look at some of the claims that were made. In July 1993, the \nAmerican Forest and Paper Association claimed 85,000 workers would lose \ntheir jobs because of President Clinton's forest policy. Instead, \n14,500 new jobs were created in the top four western timber States. The \npredictions were completely wrong. The American Forest and Paper \nAssociation said that they had to have the salvage rider because it \nwould provide new jobs for 16,000 workers. Instead, it went just the \nopposite: 8,000 timber workers lost their jobs since that piece of \nlegislation passed.\n  The salvage rider we are trying to correct is not a jobs producer--in \nfact, it is a jobs killer--whereas the Murray amendment will restore \njobs and economic stability to working Americans. Also, the salvage \nrider is an expensive waste of the taxpayers' money. The Forest Service \nspent millions of dollars preparing salvage sales that nobody even bid \non. More than 100 different sales totaling more than 200 million board \nfeet of timber were being ignored by sawmills last fall. The sales that \nwere supposed to be sold for more than $200 per thousand board feet \ncould not be sold at half the price. We are losing money hand over \nfist. We have to agree to this amendment.\n  In addition to the loss to the Treasury, many rural communities face \nenormous costs because of the environmental destruction caused by \nirresponsible logging.\n  Mudslides linked to timber roads and clearcutting by a peer-reviewed \nscientific report have wiped out bridges, roads, drinking water \nsystems, recreational resources, and fisheries. Local and Federal \ntaxpayers will pick up the tab.\n  While the amendment kills jobs, wastes money and hurts communities, \nthere has also been a breach of trust. The Senate was informed on March \n20, 1995, that the salvage rider would apply to a ``group of timber \nsales that had already been sold under section 318 of the fiscal year \n1990 Interior Appropriations Act.''\n  The day after President Clinton signed the bill, well-financed timber \nlawyers walked up the court steps to force a different interpretation. \nThey won, and then proceeded to try to throw one of my former staffers, \nTom Tuchmann, in jail for upholding environmental laws as a civil \nservant.\n  We need to repeal the salvage rider because special interests have \nforced old-growth logging throughout Oregon and Washington way beyond \nany agreement that had been forced on this administration.\n  Finally, it is important to reject a few other remaining myths that \nhave been perpetrated by lawless logging proponents. Some people claim \nthat dead trees on national forest lands have reached a crisis \nepidemic. The most recent Forest Service data show that through 1992, \ntrees are dying faster on industry lands. I made sure every Senator had \nthe facts about forest health before the original Senate vote on the \nrider in the spring of 1995. People claim that salvage logging protects \nfirefighters from deadly forest fires. The families of dead \nfirefighters came to Washington to stop the rider and support \nenvironmental laws.\n  The Murray amendment is not exactly the provision I wanted. It is not \neven exactly what Senator Murray wanted. I do not believe any Senator \never gets exactly what he or she wants. Democracy includes two \nrealities--compromise and majority rules. There are some who choose to \noperate outside this reality, and contribute only to a war of words. I \noppose the ideological stands that in the end accomplish nothing. \nSenator Murray has worked to accomplish results and deserves support.\n  I am proud to have been the lead cosponsor of an effort last spring \nto restore environmental laws, even though we lost by one vote. I am \nproud of the forest health data, the jobs data, the timber supply data, \nand Forest Service appeals data, and the letters I have sent to every \nSenate office in my attempts to turn the rider around. I am proud to be \nthe lead cosponsor of the Bradley amendment to restore environmental \nlaws. I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of Senator Murray's honest \neffort to get 51 votes to turn the salvage rider around.\n  My only regret thus far that we still have not prevailed.\n  We will soon vote on the Murray Amendment. I hope we can finally make \nprogress on restoring environmental laws. As the weather warms we come \ncloser and closer to a time when hundreds of millions of board feet \nwill be cut without laws. I urge my colleagues to vote for workers, for \neconomic stability, and for the environment. We need Senator Murray's \namendment now.\n  I hold up photos that the Senator from Washington State [Mrs. \nMurray], provided. Look what happens if you do not follow good forestry \npractices. Look at this mudslide as it comes down, choking off a river. \nWhat does that do to all the other resources? Ask somebody who makes \ntheir living fishing. Ask businesses that get income from recreation \nwhat it means to them. Let us go back to the kind of responsible, \nbipartisan environmental efforts that this body has been famous\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nfor and let us adopt the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Vermont for his excellent \nstatement and his support.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I am pleased to be here in support of \nmy colleague from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  I was always taught as a child that when you make a mistake, you \nadmit it and fix it. I think that is what happened here. Many of us who \nvoted for the bill in which this rider was contained believed that it \nwould allow the logging of dead and dying trees. We did not intend for \nit to work out in a way that healthy old-growth trees would be cut \ndown; they are surely our heritage. We have an obligation to fix this \nproblem.\n  I have to say for my friend, Senator Murray, because I have worked \nwith her early on, this was a very difficult amendment to put together. \nWhat she did was to get the workers together with the \nenvironmentalists. She found that compromise between preserving a \nprecious environment and preserving jobs. She deserves an enormous \namount of credit. I personally know how anguished she was as she tried \nto put together these coalitions, because it is not easy. It is very \neasy to go with one side. It is not as easy to try to put together the \ncoalitions, but she has done that. I am very pleased to be able to \nsupport her. We have a chance to reverse a mistake, a mistake that \nopened up old-growth forests and undermined President Clinton's \nconsensus Northwest forest plan.\n  We finally have a chance to restore environmental laws for our \nforests. They are basically now, as I read it, forests without laws. \nThat was the effect of the court case. And with the Murray amendment, \nwe restore lawful logging.\n  Our citizens must always have the right to take part in Federal \ndecisions about how to manage our public forests. I have always \nbelieved that was very important. The Murray amendment will restore the \nright of appeal to citizens, and it ensures judicial review.\n\n  The Murray amendment resolves the old growth issue by suspending old-\ngrowth timber sales, commonly referred to as section 318 sales, and \nrequires the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to \nprovide substitute timber volume or buy these sales back from the \npurchaser.\n  I believe that is very key because that is where we see the jobs are \nbeing preserved. The Murray amendment will expedite implementation of \nthe Northwest forest plan by making sure that resources are available \nto complete recommended watershed analysis, and we need that analysis. \nWe also see in this amendment a much needed National Academy of \nSciences study on forest health.\n  So, in brief, we made a mistake. We are losing old-growth trees. We \nhave seen the incredible photographs that the Senator from Washington \n[Mrs. Murray] has shown us--not cartoons of trees, not drawings of \ntrees, but really what is happening in the forests. I think anyone who \nsees it knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. People can \nstand up here and say: Gee, it is not true; it is not happening; \nbeautiful trees are not being cut down. Well, we see the photographs. \nWe see the truth.\n  We can fix the problem. We can make sure that in fact trees that are \nnot healthy can be cut down. That is not a problem. But not the healthy \nold-growth trees.\n  I am pleased to stand with my friend, and I hope that she obtains the \nvotes necessary to overturn a mistake that we made right here in this \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Who yields time? The junior Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains in debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Washington has 9 \nminutes and 50 seconds; 15 minutes and 31 seconds are left to the other \nside.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me just say at this point that I \nappreciate the remarks of my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, \nabout how difficult this has been, to bring people together to \ncompromise on a very difficult and serious issue. In fact, I have heard \nsome of my colleagues on the other side say that this debate is about \npolitics. I say, if this is just about politics, it would be simply an \namendment to repeal the rider. This is not about politics. This is \nabout policy. This is about putting in place a timber salvage rider \nthat works, that keeps people working, that uses our timber at its \nhighest economic value, but leaving people in the process. That is what \nmy constituents are so angry about. They have been left out of the \nprocess by the rider that this Congress adopted last year, and they \nwant back in.\n  At this time I am very pleased to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the President, sent to me last night from Jerusalem, with his \nstrong support of the amendment in front of us. His words should be \nread by all of my colleagues, but let me just read his second \nparagraph. It says:\n\n       Judicial interpretation of the timber rider, as it has been \n     applied to old growth forests, has broadened the Act's \n     requirements to the point that it undermines our balanced \n     approach to ensuring continued economic growth and reliable \n     timber supply in concert with responsible management and \n     protection of our natural resources for future generations. \n     The timber rider must be repealed as soon as possible.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Jerusalem, March 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Patty: I write to convey my strong support for your \n     amendment to repeal the timber rider attached to the 1995 \n     Rescissions Act.\n       Judicial interpretation of the timber rider as it has been \n     applied to old growth forests, has broadened the Act's \n     requirements to the point that it undermines our balanced \n     approach to ensuring continued economic growth and reliable \n     timber supply in concert with responsible management and \n     protection of our natural resources for future generations. \n     The timber rider must be repealed as soon as possible.\n       Along with repeal, I must have the legal authority \n     necessary to honor the claims of contract holders in a manner \n     that is consistent with environmental stewardship and law, \n     placing a priority on replacement timber volume. Your \n     amendment will enable us to do this.\n       With regard to salvage logging, I believe--as you do--that \n     salvage logging has an important role in the federal timber \n     program. Securing a steady supply of timber to Northwest \n     mills continues to be a priority for me. We also believe \n     salvage logging must be based on sound science and consistent \n     with our nation's environmental laws.\n       Your amendment meets my overall goals and objectives. I \n     commend your efforts to restore the kind of balanced and \n     reasonable approach that we established under the Northwest \n     Forest Plan. I strongly encourage your colleagues to support \n     your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me again thank Senator Hatfield for \nhis understanding in the offsets of this bill, with our amendment that \nstrikes the portion of section 13 that is found on page 27. We have \nmade an adjustment.\n  If this amendment is agreed to, and I hope it is, we will continue to \nwork with Senator Hatfield and others in conference to assure that this \namendment is properly taken care of.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a brief history. One year ago, right now, \n2 years after President Clinton had proposed his very, very modest \ntimber plan for the Pacific Northwest, less than half of what the \nPresident had stated was in his plan for a harvest was actually being \ncarried out, frustrated by endless litigation. This proposal was \npassed, two-thirds of which simply enabled the President to carry out \nhis own promises, to keep his own commitments. One portion of it \nauthorized the harvesting of certain contracts that had long since been \nexecuted by the Federal Government, and, Mr. President, which represent \nthis much of the\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\nnational forests in the Pacific Northwest--this being the entire \nforest, this being what is already cut off. You, Mr. President, cannot \nsee the number of acres we are talking about. I do not think you can \nsee it when I put this magnifying glass on it. That was the true \ncompromise.\n  What did the President say about it? The President said that \ncompromise contained language that preserved the ability to implement \nthe current forest plans and their standards to protect fisheries and \nthe like.\n  Then the President changed his mind, and the senior Senator from \nOregon offered him a further compromise, which is included in this \nproposal. Now we have an amendment which would cancel not only \neverything that was done last year, but would cancel more than \neverything that was done last year--canceling contracts that were never \nso much as controversial, establishing a new definition of salvage, \nmuch more restrictive than that of Clinton's own Forest Service, and a \ndefinition of salvage which will result, not in a compromise, not in \nauthorizing salvage timber, but, in effect, prohibiting any salvage \nwhatsoever. Even helicopter logging will be prohibited in roadless \nareas. There are so many restricted areas and so little money that \nthere will be no salvage timber, not just in the Pacific Northwest, but \nin your State, in States all up and down the east coast, in the \nintermountain West--there will be nothing left.\n  How is this to be paid for? Because now we have to pay for these \nthings. How is it to be paid for? It is to the credit of the junior \nSenator from my State that she does not just say, ``put it on the cuff, \nadd it to the deficit.'' She takes $130 million out of the \nappropriation for the Forest Service.\n  Earlier today this was only $110 million. We checked with some people \nin the Forest Service who, understandably enough, do not want to be \nidentified. That $110 million cut will cause the RIF of 1,400 employees \nof the Forest Service, all across the United States. So I say to the \nSenator from Vermont, the Senator from Alabama, the Senator from North \nDakota, your forests will suffer, too. One thousand RIF's in the field \nof reforestation, stand improvement, recreation maintenance, watershed \nimprovement, supposedly the very goals of this amendment, will be \nundercut by the RIF's of the people who would carry them out, and 400 \nor 500 more in the field of forest research.\n\n  So, we will devastate our national forest planning, we will devastate \nthe very goals of a healthy forest that we are talking about, by \npassing this amendment. An amendment to do what? An amendment to do \nwhat? An amendment to cancel that many acres of timber harvest \ncontracts. Can you see it? You cannot. You cannot see it. It represents \na one-time harvest of one-tenth of the number of board feet that \nregenerate automatically in these national forests every year; one-\ntenth of 1 year's growth.\n  I am simply saying the United States of America, when it signs a \ncontract, ought to keep its word, it ought to carry that contract out. \nAnd when the President makes a commitment--this President, this \nenvironmentalist President--we ought to empower him to carry out that \ncommitment.\n  The amendment will make a mockery of the President's commitments. It \nwill invalidate valid contracts. It will result in the loss of \nthousands of jobs in our forest, private sector jobs, and probably \n1,500 jobs in the Forest Service itself, helping our forests to grow \nand to regenerate.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes does the Senator from Idaho need?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Seven minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today, the issue deals strictly with \nthe management of our national forests and the health of those national \nforests. The amendment before us would eliminate the one tool we now \nhave.\n  I think, as an Idahoan, I speak with some experience as to what this \nis all about, because 2 years ago we had devastating forest fires that \ndevastated 589,000 acres of land. That is 919 square miles.\n  That is a number. How big is that? That is approximately three-\nquarters of the entire land in the State of Rhode Island. This is a \nhuge amount of land. Yet the proposal is that we would only go in and \nsalvage approximately 10 percent of the dead timber that is in that \ntremendous, huge area. This amendment would leave that dead and dying \ntimber to simply rot, to rot. We want to go in and salvage 10 percent \nof that.\n  Also, this timber that is not removed simply adds additional fuel to \nfuture devastating fires. All the fire scientists tell us that is what \nwe can expect now, more and more of these devastating fires of hundreds \nof thousands of acres at a time.\n  Is there benefit to the environment to get in there and do something \nabout it? A study of the Boise National Forest demonstrated the \nbenefits of getting in on the ground and helping forests recover after \na fire. Several areas where no recovery work was performed after the \n1992 Boise foothills fire experienced huge landslides, or blow-outs, as \nthey are called. Entire hillsides washed into streams, destroying fish \nhabitat, including habitat for the bull trout, which is being \nconsidered for listing as an endangered species.\n  The Boise National Forest study compares the results of varying types \nof intervention. The report found that salvage operations can be \ndesigned so that they are environmentally benign and, in fact, \nbeneficial. It also found that salvage areas were in better shape than \nareas that had not been salvaged.\n  For example, soils which were baked into impermeable crusts by the \nfire were broken to allow water to penetrate. Stream banks were \nstabilized and water was filtered through straw bales to catch sediment \nthat would otherwise choke resident fish and destroy spawning beds.\n  Dr. Leon Neuenschwander, professor of fire ecology at the University \nof Idaho, described the foothills fire as ``the most environmentally \nconscious salvage-logging operation'' that he has ever seen.\n  If this amendment is adopted, Idahoans, Idaho's forests, Idaho's \nwildlife are going to pay the price, straightforward. It means the end \nof any hope of salvaging just a fraction of this timber that has been \ndestroyed by fire, and it also means that that fuel load remains.\n  It means a loss of revenue that could have been used for \nenvironmental restoration in some very sensitive watersheds. I am the \nchairman of the subcommittee that is dealing with the Endangered \nSpecies Act. I am an advocate that we not follow this amendment because \nwe have species that need to be protected.\n  By allowing us to go forward with this sort of management, we can \nprotect them, we can help them. But also, Mr. President, so many of our \nrural communities derive income from those timber receipts for their \nschools so that we can educate the kids of the State through this \nharvest, and it means leaving sensitive watersheds at risk of reburn \nsince there will be no thinning of standing dead timber.\n  There was a picture shown at some point during this debate of a \nmassive slide and blamed it all on what is taking place with logging \noperations.\n  James Caswell, who is a forest supervisor in the Clearwater National \nForest in Orofino, ID, wrote a particular statement that I think is of \ngreat interest. He says:\n\n       To keep things in perspective, remember flooding and \n     landslide activity are a natural phenomenon in this part of \n     the country. In the Clearwater Forest alone, major events \n     occurred in 1919, 1934, 1948, 1964, 1968, and 1974.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Photos taken in 1934 show extensive landslide activity in \n     pristine areas, long before logging or road building took \n     place.\n\n  It is a natural phenomenon that does occur.\n  It has been pointed out, too, that many of the labor unions support \nthis amendment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letters from Douglas J. McCarron, who is the president of the \nUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, who says:\n\n       I am writing to urge your opposition to efforts to repeal \n     the timber harvesting provisions included in the 1995 Omnibus \n     Rescissions Bill.\n\n  Also, letters from the United Paperworkers International Union, as \nwell as the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \nWorkers.\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of the 550,000 members of \n     the United Brothers of Carpenters and Joiners of America \n     (UBC), I am writing to urge your opposition to efforts to \n     repeal timber harvesting provisions included in the 1995 \n     Omnibus Rescission Bill. These provisions help protect the \n     health of our national forests. They also provide a supply of \n     timber to help protect the livelihoods of tens of thousands \n     of forest products-related workers nationwide, including many \n     men and women who are members of our union.\n       The bill was developed in part as a response to the growing \n     national forest health emergency. The buildup of dead, dying \n     and diseased trees on federal lands has reached unsafe \n     levels, standing as kindling for wildfire and threatening to \n     infect healthy trees. The law allows for the removal of the \n     damaged trees which can be milled if removed in a timely \n     manner.\n       The bill was also designed to expedite timber sales \n     prepared under President Clinton's Pacific Northwest Forest \n     Plan and other timber sales sold by the U.S. Forest Service \n     and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) during the last live \n     years but held up by red tape. These sales amount to less \n     than fifteen percent of the volume historically produced from \n     the Pacific Northwest and Northern California each year. They \n     also constitute only slightly more than half of what was \n     promised under the President's plan but to date has not been \n     produced.\n       Our union has long believed that we can balance \n     environmental interests with economic realities. That is why \n     we are supporting language offered by Chairman Mark Hatfield \n     (R-OR). This legislation will modify the timber harvesting \n     provisions to provide greater flexibility for the timber sale \n     purchaser and the Forest Service or BLM to alter or \n     substitute sales as the sales conflict with environmental \n     concerns.\n       We urge you to support the Hatfield amendment and oppose \n     the full repeal of the timber harvest provisions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Douglas J. McCarron,\n     General President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               United Paperworkers\n\n\n                                          International Union,\n\n                                     Nashville, TN, March 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of the 250,000 men and \n     women of the United Paperworkers International Union, I am \n     writing to urge you to oppose any efforts to repeal the \n     timber harvest provisions of the 1995 Omnibus Rescissions \n     Bill which was signed into law by President Clinton last \n     summer. These provisions allow for emergency timber salvage \n     harvests and expedite the release of existing ``green'' \n     sales.\n       Timber salvage is critically important to our members and \n     our national forests. The salvage law allows dead, dying, and \n     diseased timber to be removed from the forests in order to \n     decrease the threat of wildfires and insect infestation. If \n     removed in a timely manner, this timber can be milled, thus \n     protecting forest products-related jobs. The timber \n     harvesting provision also calls for the release of ``green'' \n     sales prepared under President Clinton's Northwest Forest \n     Plan and other ``green'' sales that had been sold by the U.S. \n     Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management over the \n     last five years but have been held up by red tape. the amount \n     of ``green'' sales to be released amount to less than half of \n     the sales promised to be provided under the President's \n     Forest Plan but have yet to be delivered.\n       Repeal of the timber harvest provisions will only \n     exacerbate the job loss occurring in timber-dependent \n     communities throughout the nation. Since 1990, over 22,000 \n     timber-dependent workers have lost their jobs in the Pacific \n     Northwest and Northern California alone due to efforts to \n     restrict timber harvesting on federal lands.\n       As always, we stand ready to work with Congress to develop \n     legislation that balances environmental interests with the \n     economic and social needs of timber-dependent workers and \n     communities. That is why we urge your support of the \n     legislation proposed by Senators Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) and \n     Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) regarding implementation of the timber \n     sale provisions. This amendment provides flexibility to the \n     U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the \n     timber purchaser to modify or substitute sales as needed to \n     address environmental concerns. We hope we can count on your \n     support of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Wayne Glenn,\n     Office of the President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                             Machinists and Aerospace Workers,\n\n                                     Gladstone, OR, March 4, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of the 20,000 members of \n     the International Association of Machinists--Woodworkers \n     Division, I urge you to oppose any effort to repeal the \n     timber rider attached to the 1995 Omnibus Rescissions Bill, \n     which was signed into law last summer.\n       The timber rider is critical to the men and women of our \n     union. The salvage provision of the rider protects forest \n     health by allowing for the removal of deteriorating timber \n     from the forest floor. U.S. Forest Service figures show that \n     4 billion board feet of dead timber is accumulating each year \n     on federal lands. This accumulation increases the likelihood \n     that millions of acres of forest land will be devastated by \n     catastrophic wildfires. The salvage provision not only \n     improves the health of our federal forests. If removed in a \n     timely manner, this timber can be milled, protecting jobs and \n     communities.\n       The timber rider also allows for the implementation of \n     existing sales that were promised under President Clinton's \n     Forest Plan and other sales that have been previously \n     approved but have not been released due to bureaucratic red \n     tape. These sales, which amount to less than 15% of what has \n     been historically produced from federal forest lands in the \n     Pacific Northwest and Northern California each year, will \n     provide economic relief to thousands of forest products \n     workers nationwide.\n       The members of our union are willing to work with the \n     Clinton administration and Congress to solve the timber \n     supply and forest health crises. With that in mind, we \n     believe that the recent legislation introduced by Senator \n     Mark Hatfield (R-OR) attempts to balance the needs of the \n     people with the future of our federal forests. If passed, \n     this legislation would provide an adequate level of \n     flexibility to the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land \n     Management, and timber sale purchases to modify and/ or \n     substitute timber sales prepared under the timber rider.\n       Congress is in the position to provide balance to the \n     forest management debate. We hope that we can count on your \n     support for the Hatfield legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Wilson Hubbell,\n\n                                         Administrative Assistant,\n                                             Woodworkers Division.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, Gifford Pinchot, who is the father of \nthe Forest Service and he, in fact, was the adviser to the creator of \nour national park and forest system, President Teddy Roosevelt, was \nadamant that our Federal forests not be ``preserves'' but ``reserves,'' \nmanaged for the best good of the public. He specifically viewed timber \nharvest as a central part of forest management. I urge the Senate not \nto move away from the very essence of that ideal by Gifford Pinchot.\n  I commend the senior Senator from Washington for his efforts on this, \nand I say that on behalf of so many citizens throughout the Northwest \nwho have seen the devastation of these fires.\n  Also, let us allow the forest managers to be the forest managers \nthere on the ground. We cannot manage it from this Chamber. We need to \nallow them to be the managers, as was intended, as they have the \nability to do.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by my \ngood friend from the State of Washington, Senator Murray. Let me say at \nthe outset that I respect the motives and the determination of the \nauthor of this amendment. I look forward to what I have come to expect \nfrom the Senator from Washington--a well-informed and civil debate on \nthe merits of current law and proposed changes to it.\n  I have many questions about the Murray amendment--how it would be \nimplemented and what is meant by many of its provisions. I would have \npreferred to have a hearing record or some consideration by the \nauthorizing committees before making a decision about such a \ncomprehensive forestry program as Senator Murray has put forward. As a \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I am aware \nthat Senator Craig's forest health bill, which has been the subject of \nbipartisan negotiations with the White House for over a year, and which \nhas been the subject of hearings before the committee, is ready to be \nplaced on the Energy Committee's markup schedule. I would be \ninterested, as this debate progresses, to know how the Murray amendment \ncompares to Senator Craig's legislation.\n  Regardless of my feelings about the underlying statute this amendment \nwould repeal, I would be very reluctant as the manager of this bill to \nagree to such a sweeping national forest policy re-write as the one the \nSenator from Washington has laid before us today, particularly one \ndrafted so quickly. I would be especially reluctant to accept such a \ncomprehensive proposal without\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nthe full concurrence of the authorizers. Let me remind my colleagues \nthat law that would be repealed by the Murray amendment was prepared \nwith the full cooperation of both House and Senate authorizers. The \nlack of involvement of the authorizers alone would compel me to oppose \nthis amendment. Because of my personal involvement in this issue, \nhowever, I will make more detailed objections to this amendment than \nthose which I would normally offer in my role as the manager of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this is a tremendously important debate. Seven short \nmonths ago, this body included the so-called salvage rider in the 1995 \nRescissions Act. In the intervening months, those who have opposed this \nmeasure from the beginning have engaged in a vigorous campaign of \nprotest, hysteria, misinformation, and civil disobedience in an effort \nto intimidate Congress and the Clinton Administration into reversing \ntheir support of the measure. The very small minority of Americans who \nadvocate a no-cut, non-use policy on Federal lands lost this battle in \nCongress last year and now are using their anger to mislead the public \nthat the last of our old-growth forests are about to be cut down \nforever, never to be replaced. This is simply not true.\n  I represent a State that is often sharply divided on natural resource \nissues. These divides generally reflect the difference between the \nurban and the rural way of life. During the decades I have devoted to \npublic service, I have sought to bridge the chasm that has formed \nbetween the urban and rural citizens of my State and bring some order \nand balance to natural resource conflicts by addressing both sides of \nthe debate.\n  Up until recently, the forest products industry has been the largest \nmanufacturing sector in Oregon. In the past, my State alone has \nsupplied our Nation with 20 percent of its softwood lumber needs. Just \n5 years ago, 77,000 workers were employed directly by the forest \nproducts industry. Since that time, 21,800 of those 77,000 jobs have \nbeen lost and 212 mills have closed. Most often these mills are located \nin towns whose economies are based almost solely on the mills and the \nrelated businesses which deal directly with them.\n  Many of these mills, and the towns which grew up around them, located \nin the heart of Federal forests at the urging of the Federal \nGovernment. Prior to World War II, our Nation's Government told the \nforest products industry to overcut its own private lands to provide \nmaterials for the war effort, and in exchange we would open up the \nFederal forest lands to sustained yield management after the war.\n\n  Because of these commitments which were made over the years, I have \nalways felt that Congress is committed to providing these communities \nwith policies which ensure a predictable and stable supply of Federal \ntimber to these mills. Nevertheless, meeting these commitments to mills \nand timber towns and protecting our environment is not the either/or \nchoice that is presented to us by the single interest groups.\n  I have always recognized the need to balance a strong resource based \neconomy with appropriate environmental protections in my State. I have \npersonally authored legislation increasing Oregon's wilderness system \nfrom 500,000 acres to 2.1 million acres--more than any other elected \nofficial in Oregon history. I have also authored legislation increasing \nOregon's wild and scenic rivers system from 4 to 42--the largest in the \nNation. The next highest States are Alaska with 26 and California with \n10. I have also authored legislation preserving such ecologically \nsignificant areas as the Columbia River Gorge, Hells Canyon, Newberry \nCrater, Cascade Head, Yaquina Head, and the Oregon Dunes.\n  In addition, in 1989, I coauthored a bill with then-Senator Adams \nwhich, for the first time, recognized that old growth forests need to \nbe protected from further fragmentation and spotted owls need to be \nprotected consistent with the Endangered Species Act. This provision \nwas the so-called section 318 timber compromise, which was attached to \nthe fiscal year 1990 Interior Appropriations Act.\n  My commitment to Oregon's environment and to its natural resources \nruns very deep. I am proud to have played a role in preserving these \nareas for future generations, and I will work this year, my last year \nin the Senate, to protect several other areas of my State. While I have \nworked diligently to protect Oregon's environment, it was always within \nthe context of the larger picture--that 84 communities in my State were \ndependent on a stable supply of wood from Federal lands and that our \nforests could be managed, according to the best science of the day, on \na sustainable basis.\n  Now, in listening to the rhetoric from the environmental community on \nthe salvage provision, their true, underlying goal has finally been \ndisrobed and can be debated. That debate is, can we manage our Federal \nlands at all? If you listen to the rhetoric you will hear clamoring for \nan end to the cutting of any green trees. Only dead and dying trees \nshould be cut. Do not be deceived. These same extremist groups have \nadmitted that their platform is the elimination of any and all \nharvesting of trees on Federal land. If my State is first to be bullied \ninto this shortsighted program, other States will surely follow.\n  The sad fact of this debate is that the elimination of harvesting of \ntrees on Federal lands is happening without one affirmative statement \nfrom Congress that this is the course of action we believe is best for \nthe Nation. Indeed, these decisions are being made by overzealous \njudges who feel that their job is not only to interpret the law, but to \nsteer it in a certain direction not necessarily intended by Congress. \nThese decisions are being made outside of the legislative process via \npublic relations campaigns and staged media events in a hyperbolic, \nuninformed, and intentionally misleading manner.\n  The Murray amendment lends credence to this approach and gives those \nwho would lock up our forests forever the upper hand legislatively. All \nthis without one hearing, one markup, or any time for internal debate \nand discussions with the Clinton administration.\n  The modest measures contained in the law sought to be repealed by the \nMurray amendment are largely discretionary, will expire in December \n1996 and underwent Appropriations Committee hearings, markups, floor \ndebate and months of negotiations with the Clinton administration. If \nlast year's modest, stopgap provision cannot be sustained in law, we \nwill have lost any semblance of balance in our national forest policies \nand Congress will have once again abdicated its responsibility to play \na role in setting the policies governing management of our national \nforests.\n\n  This Senator advocated strongly for the enactment of the statute \nsought to be repealed by the Murray amendment, and I will energetically \ndefend it today, as modified by the chairman's mark of the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act. Let me take a moment to outline the law and clarify \nthe impetus behind its enactment.\n  The salvage provision included in the fiscal year 1995 rescissions \nbill has three separate and distinct provisions. The first provides the \nadministration with temporary expedited salvage sale authority. The \nsecond provision grants legal protections to the administration for \nimplementation of the President's Northwest forest plan. Finally, the \nstatute releases certain sales prepared and offered by the Federal \nGovernment from 1990 forward that have been blocked due to consultation \nprocedures under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Before I proceed with a more detailed outline of this law, let me \nhighlight for my colleagues a seldom stated fact about this \ncontroversial law: Except for the provision directing the release of a \nrelatively small number of sales that have been blocked by ESA \nconsultation, the remainder of this law is discretionary. More \nspecifically, the provisions of the law related to salvage and those \nrelated to the President's forest plan are toothless. The President is \nnot required to offer a single sale or cut a single tree.\n  Immediately after signing the Rescissions Act, the President sent a \nmemo to his agency heads saying:\n\n       Public Law 104-19 gives us the discretion to apply current \n     environmental standards, and we will do so. I am directing \n     you to * * * move forward expeditiously to implement these \n     timber related provisions in an environmentally sound manner, \n     in accordance with * * * existing environmental laws.\n\n  A parade of administration officials have come before the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to confirm\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\nthis commitment by the President, which is fully consistent with the \nlegislative intent of the statute, to implement the salvage program and \nhis Northwest forest plan in complete conformity with existing \nenvironmental laws. These discretionary provisions are the very \nprovisions the Murray amendment seeks to repeal and replace with a \npermanent, prescriptive, narrowly focused timber salvage program.\n  So to repeat, the law simply provides the President with forest \npolicy tools that can be used to expedite salvage timber sales and \nsales under his Northwest forest plan. Whether the President chooses to \nuse these tools is entirely up to him.\n  I would now like to discuss in further detail, each of the provisions \nof the salvage rider from the fiscal year 1995 Rescissions Act and, \nshortly thereafter, my concerns with the Murray amendment as proposed.\n  The first and most significant provision in the salvage law provides \nthe administration with temporary authority for an expedited timber \nsalvage program. This provision will expire on December 31, 1996. An \nexpedited salvage process is needed to harvest dead trees because they \npose a significant fire risk, create additional forest health concerns \nand the trees deteriorate rapidly, losing over half their value in the \nfirst 2 years.\n  In Oregon, and in Federal forests nationwide, we are in the midst of \na forest health crisis. Three years ago, 50 to 70 percent of the \nforests in eastern Oregon's Blue Mountains area were considered dead or \ndying. According to the Blue Mountains Natural Resources Institute \n[BMNRI] in La Grande, nothing has changed in regard to fuel buildup and \nfire risk. In fact, the BMNRI states:\n       The Blue Mountains is one of many areas in the interior \n     West where accumulation of dead and dying trees continues to \n     increase, thus confronting managers and the public with an \n     unprecedented degree of catastrophic fire hazard.\n\n  The 1994 fire season was one of the worst on record. Thirty-three \nlives were lost and the Government spent nearly $1 billion fighting \nfires. Four million acres and four billion board feet of timber burned. \nThe salvage law came about as a means of giving our Federal land \nmanagement agencies the flexibility to act swiftly to address this \nprecarious situation for Oregon's forest ecosystems, firefighters, and \nrural communities. Otherwise, we may face fire seasons in the future \nthat are as bad or worse than 1994.\n\n  According to the Forest Service, nationwide we have about 18 billion \nboard feet of standing dead and dying trees. The salvage provisions of \nthe Rescissions Act give Federal land management agencies flexibility \nto address the forest health problems they believe must be addressed. \nIncidentally, the agencies determined that they were capable of \nharvesting 2 billion board feet of salvage timber nationwide for each \nof the 2 years the salvage provision was to be in place. For each sale, \nthey must at least prepare an environmental assessment under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and a biological evaluation under the \nEndangered Species Act. In addition, agencies are free to follow their \nexisting standards and guidelines for implementing Federal \nenvironmental law for each timber sale.\n  Without this provision, actually conducting any forest health or \nsalvage operations would be easier said than done. Simply put, public \ninvolvement, judicial review, and administrative appeal statutes \ngranted by Congress in existing environmental laws have been used by a \nsmall minority to block any management of public lands, even for these \nvaluable and necessary salvage operations. These groups would rather \nlet our dead and dying forests burn by catastrophic fire, endangering \nhuman life and long-term forest health, than harvest them to promote \nstability in natural forest ecosystems and communities dependent on a \nsupply of timber from Federal lands.\n  The second provision of the salvage law grants legal protections for \nthe administration to implement President Clinton's Pacific Northwest \nforest plan. This protection is accomplished by eliminating \nadministrative appeals and expediting judicial appeals. This is \ndesigned to give the President the freedom to implement his plan, which \nhas been upheld in Federal court as in compliance with all \nenvironmental laws.\n  All sales under this section have been prepared under the standards \nand guidelines of the President's forest plan. These provisions are so \nprotective, the Northwest is producing about 10 percent of its historic \nvolume levels under them. Again, the provisions here are discretionary. \nThe President is not compelled to harvest one stick of timber if he \nchooses not to.\n  The third provision releases certain sales offered or awarded since \n1990 in the geographic area covered by section 318 of the fiscal year \n1990 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. By its own \nestimates, the Forest Service faces at least $150 million in contract \nliability for failure to move forward with these sales which it \nprepared and offered. Congress moved forward with them, in large part, \nin an effort to address this liability question.\n  These delayed sales represent approximately 650 million board feet of \ntimber affecting less than 10,000 acres of Federal forest land in \nOregon and Washington. To the average homeowner, this may sound like a \ntremendous amount of timber over a very large area. However, in the \ncontext of Federal land management in the Pacific Northwest, 10,000 \nacres is a minuscule amount. To illustrate, the President's Northwest \nforest plan covers 24.4 million acres, 19.5 million acres of which is \nwithdrawn entirely from commercial timber harvest. The sales released \nunder this provision represent less than an infinitesimal one twenty-\nfour-hundredth of the land within the jurisdiction of the President's \nplan.\n  Let me also put the 650 million board feet of volume in perspective. \nAgain, this may sound like a great deal of timber. However, throughout \nthe 1980's, the Pacific Northwest averaged an annual harvest level of \naround 3.85 billion--not million--board feet. Our annual harvest levels \nare now about 10 percent of these 1980's levels, largely due to the \nsignificant protections of the President's forest plan. Under his plan, \nthe President promised the people of the Pacific Northwest a first-year \nharvest of 2.2 billion board and an annual harvest level of 1.1 billion \nboard feet each year thereafter. However, since that promise was made, \na total of about 500 million board feet has been sold under the plan.\n\n  These sales have been held up for a variety of reasons, primarily for \nconsultations for the threatened marbled murrelet. Habitat for this sea \nbird has been designated as any forest land within 35 miles of the \nOregon and California coasts, and 50 miles from the coast in the State \nof Washington. This amounts to about 4.4 million acres, two-thirds of \nwhich is Federal. These birds are very difficult to survey because they \nspend an estimated 90 percent of their lives at sea. While total \nhabitat of the bird is about 2.5 million acres in the Northwest, only \n10 percent of that acreage has been surveyed. Based on this scant \nevidence, scientists estimate that the Northwest is home to between \n18,600 and 32,000 murrelets. Over 300,000 of these birds are believed \nto inhabit Alaska.\n  Under the salvage provision, timber sales must go forward unless a \nthreatened or an endangered species--murrelet--is known to be nesting \nwithin the acreage of the sale unit. In that case only, the \nadministration is authorized and directed to provide replacement volume \nof like kind and value within the contract area of the existing timber \nsale. Under this language, the administration's ability to provide \nreplacement timber is restricted more than I believe Congress intended. \nSpecifically, replacement volume can only be offered when there is a \nmurrelet problem, and finding like kind of timber within the contract \narea is proving to be very difficult.\n  I met with Clinton administration officials last December to discuss \nthese and other concerns with the salvage rider.\n  Consistent with their specific suggestions to alter the language to \nreflect their concerns, Senator Gorton and I drafted and included \nlanguage in the omnibus appropriations bill which gives the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management greater flexibility to modify \nor buy back sales on three specific counts.\n  First, under our amendment the administration may offer replacement \nvolume for any 318 area sale on which it feels there is an \nenvironmental problem, not just those where a murrelet is\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nknown to be nesting. The amendment would then give the agencies 45 days \nto reach a mutually satisfactory agreement with the purchaser regarding \nwhat that replacement volume should look like. Replacement timber can \nbe of any kind, value, volume and location, as long as there is mutual \nagreement between the land management agencies and the sale purchaser.\n  Second, our amendment gives the administration the authority not only \nto offer replacement volume to a timber sale purchaser but also to \noffer to buy out a sale. The administration has repeatedly requested \nthis authority and has even indicated that it is able to secure $50 \nmillion from a neutral funding source to cover the costs.\n  Finally, our amendment removes the requirement that these sales be \noperated by September 30, 1996. We have lifted this deadline so timber \nsale operators do not have to rush to cut these trees hastily before \nany additional environmental considerations can be taken into account.\n  In summary, Mr. President, our amendment does everything the \nadministration has requested aside from giving them total authority to \ncancel contracts unilaterally with no compensation to timber sale \npurchasers. I remind my colleagues that, by the Forest Service's own \nestimates, it is financially liable to the tune of about $150 million \nfor canceling these contracts.\n  The Murray amendment, by comparison, does not address the issues \noutlined by the administration except to relieve them from any and all \nresponsibility to harvest these sales. This course of action is \nabsolutely contrary to the commitments the administration made during 6 \nmonths of detailed negotiations with Congress on the fiscal year 1995 \nrescissions bill, which included the salvage provision.\n  Aside from my objection to the underlying principle that the Murray \namendment allows the Clinton Administration to fully back out of the \ncommitments it made during the deliberations on the salvage provision, \nthe amendment raises a number of additional concerns.\n\n  First, the Murray amendment replaces the salvage portion of the \nrider, which expires at the end of 1996, with a comprehensive, long-\nterm salvage timber harvest program. All this without one hearing in \nthe authorizing committee, no hearings in the Appropriations Committee \nand no internal or external communications or debate.\n  Under the Murray amendment, any sales which have been released as \npart of the salvage rider would be open to immediate administrative and \njudicial challenge and would be stopped instantly, even if timber is \nalready fallen and bucked and stacked on the ground. The Government has \nsold about 1.8 billion board feet of salvage and billions more are in \nthe pipeline. In addition, sales cleared under the President's \nNorthwest forest plan would be reopened to a new round of \nadministrative and judicial appeals.\n  The Murray amendment's salvage program is very detailed and \nprescriptive. Remember, the salvage program we enacted as part of the \nrescissions bill gives complete discretion to the land management \nagencies to lay out sales in a manner consistent with existing \nenvironmental laws and standards and guidelines, as President Clinton \ncommitted to doing. The Murray amendment will allow salvage only in \nroaded areas. It precludes even helicopter logging in roadless areas, \noften where we have our most severe forest health problems. No salvage \nlogging will be allowed in ``any area withdrawn by Federal Law for any \nconservation purpose.'' This is so restrictive that the language in the \nForest Service's 1897 Organic Act, which allows the President to \nestablish forest reserves, would appear to apply this restriction to \nthe entire national forest system.\n  The Murray amendment will also grant the President's Council on \nEnvironmental Quality 1 year to develop salvage compliance regulations. \nThus, not only will sales stop in their tracks, it will take at least a \nyear and probably much more to even begin offering sales under the new \nlaw. In the mean time, logs will lay on the ground and rot. The \nGovernment's liabilities to the purchasers who have operated many of \nthese sales almost to completion will increase greatly, and the backlog \nof dead timber from the 1994 fires and the risks associated with \nkeeping these trees on the ground will have gone unaddressed.\n  To oversee this new salvage program, the Murray amendment creates a \nnew interagency, multi-level bureaucracy for ESA compliance, including \ntwo interagency scientific teams and two layers of dispute resolution \nteams. Little guidance is given to these teams and the amendment uses \nso-called sufficiency language, to which the Senator from Washington \nstrenuously objects, to restrict public input and exempt these new \nbureaucracies from the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n  On that note, the amendment has its own share of sufficiency \nlanguage. As one who has used sufficiency language on several occasions \nbecause of emergency situations, I have no problem with the concept of \nusing this language. Critics of current law have strongly criticized \nthe use of sufficiency. The sponsor of the current amendment was on \nrecord as opposed to sufficiency language even prior to her arrival in \nthe Senate. Overall, I have tried to be sensitive to her concerns. In \nfact, I worked closely with her and the Clinton Administration this \nlast fall to develop a solution to the salmon recovery funding problem \nin the Columbia River Basin which did not use sufficiency language at \nall. The Murray salvage amendment, however, is filled with sufficiency \nlanguage which overturns court rulings and exempts Federal agencies \nfrom all sorts of laws.\n  The Murray amendment attempts to terminate all existing contracts on \nsales released by the salvage rider in the geographic area of covered \nby section 318 of the fiscal year 1990 Interior Appropriations Act. In \ndoing so, however, the amendment terminates all remaining 318 sales, \nincluding over 300 million board feet of noncontroversial sales that \nwere not released or affected in any way by the Rescissions Act. This \nopens the Government to additional millions in new and needless \nliability and removes much-needed timber from the pipeline of sales \navailable for use by timber dependent communities in Oregon and \nWashington.\n\n  I know the sponsor of the pending amendment will concede that she has \nhad a very difficult time finding the necessary offsets to pay for what \nCBO has told me is a $250 million amendment. We certainly cannot be \naccepting lightly any proposal that will expose the government to such \nhuge sums of liability.\n  The Murray Amendment provides replacement volume authority, but \nreplacement sales must be completed within one year, which is a near \nimpossibility, unless another time line is agreed to. Buy-out authority \nis also provided, but funding appears to be subject to appropriations \nor through loan forgiveness or future bidding credits. If negotiations \ntoward mutual agreements with timber sale purchasers are unsuccessful, \nthe administration is provided with unilateral cancellation authority \non these sales. Thus there is no reason for the administration to deal \nin good faith with these purchasers. This is the very reason we enacted \nthis provision in the first place. The Administration had been sitting \non these sales for 5 years.\n  Finally, the Murray Amendment directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \nuse road construction funds to prepare timber sales. Most of the road \nconstruction account, however, is already devoted to implementation of \nthe President's forest plan, including timber sale preparation. Under \nthis provision, we would literally reduce the work we are able to \naccomplish under the President's forest plan, as modest as it has been \nthese past 2 years, in place of preparing alternative volume sales. \nThis is expressly opposite of congressional intent in passing the \noriginal salvage provision on the Rescissions Act and specifying that \nthe volume of the 318 areas sales was not to count against current \nallowable sales quantities under the President's forest plan.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the Murray amendment. \nIt overreaches the authority of the Appropriations committee and \nauthorizes a comprehensive, long term timber salvage program. It leaves \nalready harvested trees on the ground to rot. It creates significant \nand unnecessary new areas of contract liability to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The language which Senator Gorton and I have included in the pending \nlegislation addresses the concerns raised\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nby the Clinton administration while still helping meet the original \npurposes of the act when it was signed into law by President Clinton \nafter 6 months of congressional debate and negotiations.\n  I supported the salvage rider originally, and have drafted changes to \nit now which I urge my colleagues to support. I believe it allows us to \nshow that we can be reasonable in what we do in the forests and harvest \ntrees for many uses--forest health, community stabilization, ecosystem \nrestoration and jobs for our workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the timber and salvage issue has been \nsubjected to confusing direction from the Clinton administration. After \nfirst vetoing the bill, the President began to criticize the bill.\n  This constantly changing position of this administration on this bill \nhardly contributes to a solution on what has become a needed resolution \nboth for environmental concerns as well as economic. The repeal of this \namendment would stop ongoing salvage sales, creating numerous new court \nchallenges and lawsuits. During regulatory reform this problem was \nnoted to be a significant concern of our friends across the aisle. Now \nhowever, it is a acceptable requirement.\n  Second, as Senator Craig has pointed out, the emergency salvage law \nis necessary for jobs and forest health. As the amount of dead and \ndying trees increases, so dies the threat of wildfires. The lack of \naccess to this timber results in lost jobs.\n  The Clinton forest plan is not working. The amount of timber being \nproduced is far below what the President promised and jobs continue to \nbe lost. The Forest Service has produced very little salvage volume. \nThe only volume that is really being produced under this provision are \nin the area covered by section 318, timber that was previously sold. \nYet the President wants to hold up the sale of this timber as well.\n  If this law is repealed the liability of the Federal Government \nincreases, jobs will be lost, the environment threatened and a \nbureaucratic nightmare is created. We can move forward with managed \ntimber sales and still protect endangered species and jobs. What we \nhave to do is apply good management. Repealing this law is not the \nfirst step that needs to be taken. I urge my colleagues to defeat the \nMurray amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMurray amendment. This proposal would create chaos in the National \nforests. It would repeal a measure we passed just 7 months ago, which \nthe Forest Service and BLM have, at our urging, been moving to \nimplement. Then it provides these agencies with new, conflicting \ndirection.\n  Moreover, the Murray amendment provides the agencies with long-term \ndirection on forest health restoration that: First, was introduced less \nthan one week ago; second, has never been reviewed by the authorizing \ncommittees, or been subject to a hearing; and third, is fundamentally \nand fatally flawed. By contrast, my committee has been working on long-\nterm forest health legislation introduced by Senator Craig and Senator \nHeflin for over a year. This effort has included extended discussions \nwith minority staff and members of the Energy and Agriculture \nCommittees and the land management agencies. While these discussions \nhave not produced complete consensus, they have produced a bill that is \nwell drafted, addresses many members' concerns, and will be marked-up \nand reported later this month.\n  The Murray amendment in essence asks us to put this aside and, \ninstead, enact on the floor today a multiyear piece of legislation--\nwith significant environmental and economic implications--that most of \nus have never even seen. Well let me share a few high points.\n  Senator Murray would subject all of the salvage timber sales sold in \nthe past year to new administrative appeals and expanded judicial \nreview. This amounts to 1.8 billion board feet of sales that will be \nstopped in their tracks. Loggers and mill workers will be sent home. \nThe value of the dead and decaying timber will decline as the appeals \nand lawsuits are heard. In a hearing before our committee last week, \nForest Service officials expressed concern over this problem. The \noriginal terms of the timber sale contracts will be violated by the \nGovernment, and contract damage claims will ensue as timber companies \nare forbidden to harvest under the terms and, more importantly, \ntimeframes of the contracts.\n  In response to the extraordinary 1994 fire season, we chose 7 months \nago to allow, under some conditions, ``logging without lawyers.'' \nSenator Murray apparently finds an unacceptable restriction on legal \nemployment opportunities. She wants to put lawyers back to work. Maybe \nthat's alright. I don't dislike lawyers--much. But there is a clear \nchoice here. Creating all these new legal jobs will unemploy loggers \nand millworkers.\n  Let me give you another example. The Murray amendment prohibits \nforest health and salvage activities in roadless areas. Why? Don't \nthese areas deserve treatment if they are sick? Shouldn't fire-damaged \nwatersheds in roadless areas be stabilized? Maybe people have faith \nthat roadless areas will recover without help. Perhaps this provision \nwas drafted in a Christian Science reading room.\n  Here's another--the Murray amendment eliminates the expediting \nprocedures for salvage sales that were developed by the Bush \nadministration and refined by the Clinton administration. Why are we \ngoing to substitute whatever wisdom we can muster here in an hour today \nfor provisions that represent the result of 7 years of bipartisan \nanalysis?\n  On the other hand, if that doesn't trouble you, I shouldn't bother \nmentioning that the Murray amendment offers a completed new definition \nof what constitutes a salvage timber sale. Apparently the definition \nprovided by the Forest Service scientists and used both in Public Law \n104-19 and Senator Craig's bill, is somehow inadequate. If so, we will \nnever find out why in the hour we have devoted to this issue.\n  But let me close with my favorite. Section 305 of the Murray \namendment--for those of us who have had the time to be so precise--\ndirects the Council on Environmental Quality to develop expedited NEPA \ncompliance procedures for salvage sales. They are given a year to \ndevelop these expedited procedures. This chart shows how fast fire-\nkilled timber deteriorates. So what the Murray amendment does is: put \neverything on hold; reinstate lawsuits and appeals; and maybe in a year \nor so we will have new, expedited procedures for salvage sales from the \nCEQ.\n  The Murray amendment appears to address forest health concerns and \nthe needs of forest communities. But understand that no one, least of \nall the American people, are fooled. This is a vote to appease national \nenvironmental groups. They have a lot riding on it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we end this debate, I want to respond \nto one point again. I heard my colleagues go back to the offset that is \nin this amendment and threatening our colleagues with loss of their \nForest Service funds or loss of jobs. Let me remind all of my \ncolleagues, this money comes from the general administration fund. It \ncan come from general belt tightening, and it will come from travel. \nBut we also have the commitment from the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee to work within the confines of the conference committee to \ncome up with a reasonable offset. Again, because of the way that the \namendments have come forward on this floor, we had to put in the offset \nthe way it is, but it will be worked out in conference.\n  Let me go back to why this issue is so critical at this time. Last \nyear, this Congress passed a rider on the rescissions bill that went \ntoo far. It allowed trees, such as shown right here, a tree that is 8 \nfoot in diameter, to be cut down regardless of environmental laws and \nwithout public input. This tree is more than 250 years old. This tree \nwill not be replaced in the lifetime of my grandchildren, my great-\ngrandchildren, or my great-great-grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, these are the trees that, without adoption of my \namendment, will continue to come down in forests across the Pacific \nNorthwest. That is not what the intent of this Congress was, I hope, \nlast summer, but it is the result and it needs to be stopped.\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\n  This debate is also about logging that occurs without regard to \nenvironmental impact. Without the adoption of my amendment, these types \nof logging disasters will occur where slides come down, block our \nrivers and streams and do tremendous damage to our salmon and our trout \nand our wildlife that inhabit these areas, much less to flooding that \noccurs in the Northwest because of harvesting such as this.\n  Mr. President, do not just take my word for this. We have received \neditorials from across the West, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nthem printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Seattle (WA) Post-Intelligencer, Mar. 6, 1996]\n\n              Senator Murray's Good ``Timber Rider'' Plan\n\n       Sen. Patty Murray has introduced sensible legislation to \n     undo the damage contained in the controversial ``timber \n     salvage rider.''\n       Congress ought to adopt it forthwith.\n       The Seattle Democrat's bill would cancel the harvest of \n     healthy old-growth trees in environmentally sensitive areas \n     and give companies that had bought the timber the right to \n     log elsewhere in the national forests or buy back their \n     logging rights from the Forest Service.\n       The controversy was set in motion by congressional passage \n     of a measure masquerading as a means to quickly harvest sick \n     or dying trees.\n       Sponsored by Republican Sen. Slade Gorton, the salvage \n     rider expanded the definition of salvage and re-opened to \n     logging healthy areas that had been put off limits to loggers \n     after the sales were made because of endangered species \n     habitat restrictions.\n       But little interest was shown by the timber industry in \n     felling the sick trees that supposedly are threatening \n     healthy stands. They have until September, when the rider \n     expires, to rid the woods of this menace.\n       An unfortunate feature of Gorton's legislation was that it \n     allowed ``salvage'' harvesting without regard to \n     environmental law, so the sales could not be appealed in \n     court.\n       A critical feature of Murray's legislation is that it \n     restores existing environmental laws to the harvest. That \n     feature must be preserved.\n       There is no persuasive argument to be made for suspending \n     environmental laws in national forests. Gorton's own bill to \n     cope with the furor caused by his rider also envisions buy-\n     backs and exchanges that would allow logging on less \n     environmentally sensitive lands.\n       But Gorton would force the Forest Service, already reeling \n     under budget cuts, to eat the $100 million it may take to buy \n     back the trees. That doesn't make real-world sense.\n       President Clinton initially--and rightly--resisted the \n     salvage rider but relented and signed it when Republican \n     lawmakers attached it to a budget bill he wanted. On a recent \n     visit to Seattle, Clinton admitted the rider was a \n     ``mistake.''\n       It was a huge mistake, as all the guilty parties now seem \n     to realize. The sooner they make it right and put it behind \n     them, the better off they'll be.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Portland (OR) Oregonian, Mar. 12, 1996]\n\n  Fix the Timber Rider--Senator Murray's Proposal Could Force Needed \n                Compromise on Old-Growth Sale Provision\n\n       Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., is offering the Senate a \n     chance it ought to grab to reconsider the increasingly \n     notorious timber rider that Congress passed last year.\n       The rider, proposed by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was \n     aimed at expediting salvage sales of burned and diseased \n     trees on federal lands by freeing those sales from the normal \n     appeal procedures under environmental laws. Environmental \n     groups opposed it. Its most controversial provision, which \n     Murray would largely repeal, ordered the administration to \n     proceed with suspended sales of old-growth timber in Western \n     Oregon and Washington that don't meet current forest and \n     stream protection standards.\n       Murray is proposing an amendment that would cancel the old-\n     growth sale mandate but require the administration to either \n     make other timber available to purchasers or buy back the \n     standing timber they bought but can't log.\n       Additionally, the Murray proposal would allow appeals of \n     proposed timber sales, including salvage ones, but it would \n     shorten the appeal period. On salvage sales, that's the \n     solution Congress should have adopted at the beginning.\n       Regarding the Western Oregon and Washington old-growth \n     sales, Murray's proposal would provide more flexibility for \n     the U.S. Forest Service than a modification proposed by Sen. \n     Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Gorton to the original rider. They \n     would allow forest managers to substitute other timber for \n     the purchased tracts or to buy back the sale, but only if the \n     purchaser consented. A House-passed version allows the timber \n     exchange but does not include a buyback provision.\n       As we noted a while back, the Hatfield proposal is a \n     considerable improvement over the confines of the original \n     rider.

Slade Gorton, say \n     that's hogwash; he knew, or should have known, what he was \n     signing.\n       The record favors the president. Nearly a year ago, last \n     March 3, Gorton faxed to The Times a six-page press release \n     laying out eight arguments for this timber bill. His document \n     refers repeatedly to ``salvage logging.'' There is no mention \n     of old-growth timber.\n       ``We're not talking about clear-cuts in the Olympics,'' \n     Gorton argued in his release. ``These operations will pull \n     dead, dying, burnt, diseased, blown-down and bug-infested \n     timber out of the forest, and reforest the salvaged areas. \n     It's an important part of restoring these forests to \n     health.''\n       Gorton's arguments made sense. That's why he won support \n     from the White House and others who were willing to relax \n     environmental laws to allow salvage logging, generate much-\n     needed jobs and reduce the fire danger in Northwest forests.\n       Only later was the bill expanded to include long-delayed \n     sales of old-growth timber. A year later, Gorton's plan has \n     generated little or no salvage logging. Instead, loggers are \n     attempting to clear-cut an ancient stand of Douglas firs in \n     the Olympics, where fire is not an issue. Gorton's backers, \n     including this newspaper, feel lured into a bait-and-switch \n     game.\n       The amount of timber at issue is modest--certainly not \n     enough to undermine the biological health of Northwest \n     forests. And Gorton makes a reasonable argument that the old-\n     growth timber is being cut under 6-year-old contracts that \n     should be honored.\n       The point is this: Gorton won initial, bipartisan support \n     by peddling his salvage rider as one thing. And the Northwest \n     is being asked to live with quite another. This puts \n     President Clinton on solid ground to reconsider his agreement \n     to a good deal gone bad.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\n         [From the Salem (OR) Statesman Journal, Mar. 6, 1996]\n\n                      Limit Salvage to Dead Timber\n\n\n               Environment must rule the harvest decision\n\n       Sen. Mark Hatfield has tried to bring accord out of the \n     discord about the timber salvage bill, but his compromise \n     proposal offers little hope of satisfying either side.\n       It has two major weaknesses. It extends the time during \n     which logging is exempt from environmental laws--which \n     environmentalists would protest. And it allows the federal \n     government to buy out the timber-cutting contracts, provided \n     the timber companies that hold the contracts agree and the \n     government comes up with the money. The chance that the \n     companies would agree to be bought out and that the \n     government would put up the money to do so is slim.\n       The cleanest solution is to revise the measure.\n       Allow the cutting of dead and dying trees. That was the \n     purpose of the bill in the first place. Many \n     environmentalists disagree with the salvage, but there are \n     good arguments to go ahead. We see some of them every day in \n     Oregon when we drive by forests turned brown by disease or \n     fire.\n       Then remove form the measure the rest of the timberlands. \n     Let these tracts stand on their own merits as either suitable \n     for harvesting or as essential to the environment. Most of \n     the timber already has undergone environmental assessment. \n     Supposedly, the federal government is satisfied that the \n     sales are environmentally sound.\n       If the assessment of the risk to the environment has \n     changed in the years since the sales were first considered, \n     then they can be canceled or the conditions revised. For \n     timber that already has been sold, the government would \n     return the money.\n       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., offered a reasonable compromise \n     this week. She would encourage salvage logging but without \n     suspending environmental assessment is done quickly, this is \n     a reasonable alternative.\n       What has angered most citizens about the salvage bill was \n     not the cutting of green timber itself--although there is \n     considerable opposition--but the suspension of environmental \n     laws and the right of appeal to the courts. The public must \n     continue to have the right to argue the management of public \n     timber and to appeal to the courts.\n       Anything less will not satisfy the public regardless of how \n     carefully a timber management plan is devised.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Bellingham Herald, Mar. 12, 1996]\n\n              Our View: OK Murray's Compromise Timber Plan\n\n       Forestry: Senator's proposal is fair to both \n     environmentalists and timber interests.\n       Timber workers and communities deserve a measure of help to \n     get through the painful transition they face. But the helping \n     hand shouldn't exact too great a cost on the environment.\n       Legislation introduced by U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., \n     strikes the proper balance.\n       Murray's bill would amend a law enacted last summer \n     purportedly to let salvage timber--dead and dying trees--be \n     logged through September 1996 from tens of thousands of acres \n     of federal old-growth forests in the West and South. What the \n     law actually does is allow logging of any old-growth timber \n     in the areas that have been opened up.\n       A poll last fall indicated that 60 percent of Americans \n     support environmental regulations, including those that \n     protect endangered species and restrict logging in the 10 \n     percent of old-growth forests still left standing.\n       The salvage timber law sponsored by U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, \n     R-Wash., was enacted to provide temporary economic relief to \n     timber workers and communities reeling from economic \n     hardships. A 1990 court ruling has all but shut down logging \n     in old-growth forests on federal lands.\n       Murray's bill would halt logging of healthy old-growth \n     trees but permit salvage logging on a permanent basis. It \n     also would speed up the process by which the timber sales are \n     approved.\n       Too risky, environmentalists complain. Gorton's entire law \n     must be repealed to avoid further environmental damage.\n       Too risky, environmentalists complain. Gorton's entire law \n     must be kept intact to avoid exacerbating an already dismal \n     economic picture.\n       Murray attempted to amend Gorton's bill and implement the \n     compromise last summer. That effort failed by one vote.\n       The compromise would correct the imbalance created by \n     Gorton's law. It would be fair to both sides. Lawmakers \n     should pass it this year.\n\n             [From the Reno Gazette-Journal, Mar. 13, 1996]\n\n               The Assault on Our Forests Must Be Stopped\n\n       (1995 timber salvage law amendments are needed to stop the \n     willy-nilly cutting of trees.)\n       The 1995 timber salvage law was a bad law--a very bad law \n     indeed. It pretended to help the nation's forests by making \n     it easier for the logging industry to take away dead and \n     dying trees, but in reality it endangered the forests by \n     permitting loggers to chop down huge numbers of perfectly \n     healthy trees. In addition, this act eviscerated the \n     protection of wildlife and removed the mandate of clean \n     water--which also freed the axes of the timber men to chop, \n     chop, chop willy-nilly.\n       This law, proposed by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., slipped \n     through Congress and past President Clinton's veto pen on the \n     pretext that there was an emergency of unparalleled \n     proportions: i.e., all those dead and dying trees were a fire \n     hazard of such great potential that any measure was justified \n     in order to reduce the hazard. But while there certainly was \n     a need to get cracking on the problem in places such as the \n     Lake Tahoe basin, where homes and other structures could be \n     wiped out by a wildfire, there was no need to destroy \n     environmental protections at the same time--unless, of \n     course, the real aim was to conduct a sneak raid on \n     environmentalism itself. And that does indeed seem to have \n     been the subterranean motive.\n       The law worked just as intended: Loggers cut swaths of \n     green timber and placed the remaining old growth forests of \n     the Pacific Northwest in greater danger than ever. It was \n     profit at any cost and at all costs.\n       Now there is a chance to end the assault. An amendment by \n     Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would halt all timber sales in \n     these ancient forests and would put other salvage sales under \n     stiffer environmental rules. It would give the federal \n     government a year to provide alternate timber but would also \n     permit the government to buy back previous timber sales. Also \n     to the good, it would permit appeals under environmental \n     laws. Finally, it would restrict salvage operations to dead \n     and dying trees, and would permit the cutting of healthy \n     trees only to the extent necessary to protect loggers and to \n     provide reasonable access.\n       At the same time, our own Sen. Harry Reid has proposed an \n     amendment to eliminate the prohibition of Endangered Species \n     listings. These two amendments would do much to provide the \n     forests with the protection that they need, and both should \n     be passed by the U.S. Senate.\n       Unfortunately, these amendments not only must compete \n     against the original legislation, which retains its ardent \n     supporters, but they must also contend with a much weaker \n     amendment by Gorton and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., which \n     would protect some old-growth forests from the axe, but only \n     if replacement timber can be found elsewhere. That is not an \n     acceptable substitute for the real protection that the \n     Murray-Reid amendments would give. These are the amendments \n     that should--indeed must--be adopted.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have an editorial from the Seattle \nPost-Intelligencer: ``Senator Murray's good `timber rider' plan.''\n  From the Portland Oregonian: ``Fix the timber rider. Senator Murray's \nproposal could force needed compromise on old-growth sale provision.''\n  From the Great Falls Tribune, from the Seattle PI, from the Seattle \nTimes, which talks about the amendment that was adopted last year and \ncalls it a ``cut bait 'n' switch.''\n  From the Statesman Journal in Salem, OR: ``Limit salvage to dead \ntimber.''\n  From the Bellingham Herald: ``OK Murray's compromise timber plan.''\n  And from the Reno Gazette-Journal: ``The assault on our forests must \nbe stopped.''\n  Mr. President, I have a long heritage in the Pacific Northwest. I was \nborn and raised there. My father was born and raised there, and, in \nfact, my mother was born and raised in Butte, MT. In fact, my husband's \ngrandfather was born in Seattle back at the end of the last century.\n  We know the people in this region. We know why they are angry today. \nThey are angry because the rider that passed last year through this \nCongress left them--people, my brothers, my sisters, my friends, the \npeople I have run into in the grocery store and at townhall meetings \nacross my State--it has left those people out of the decisionmaking \nprocess when it comes to our Federal force.\n  People in our region want to be involved. They want to have a say, \nand they do care. They care deeply. Because of the rider that was \npassed last year, Federal agencies are out in the woods running timber \nsales today with little or no accountability, and that makes my \nconstituents angry.\n  Under the rider that passed last year, our ordinary citizens have no \nability to influence Government decisions. That makes them angry.\n  Under the rider that was passed last year, our timber communities \nhave once again become the center of a political storm. They deserve \nbetter than that. My rider directly makes sure that those people in our \ntimber communities do not have a policy that is in place for just a few \nshort months, with timber, like I have shown you before, being cut \ndown.\n  Mr. President, my policy assures that these timber workers will be at \nwork\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\nlogging dead and dying trees--true salvage, not green trees. It will \nassure that those jobs are there for the long run.\n  Most important, my amendment puts people back into the process. \nPeople have a right to a say about the forests that we all own. People \nhave a right to know that what they own is cared for and cared for \nwell. That is what the environmental laws are all about that have \npassed in this Congress over the last four decades. That is what was \ntaken away in the rider that was passed last summer. That is what is \ncorrected in our amendment before us today.\n  Mr. President, I cannot urge my colleagues strongly enough to please \nvote for the amendment in front of you, the Murray amendment, with the \nsupport of Senators Wyden and Baucus and Leahy, and many others, \nSenator Sam Nunn. The reason is, we have to get our timber areas out of \nwar. We need to reduce anger, and most importantly, we need to put \ncommon sense, common sense and rationality, back into our timber policy \nacross this country.\n  That is what my amendment does. That is what your vote for this \namendment will do. Help me send a message back to my constituents that \nthis Congress does have the ability to listen when people are angry, \nthis Congress does have the ability to put in place commonsense, \npractical solutions to problems that are out there, and that this \nCongress will not make a mistake a second time.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may be aware, a \nmonstrous fire yesterday in Philadelphia has caused enormous damage to \na long 2-mile stretch of Interstate 95. The Philadelphia Inquirer \nreports today that the eight-alarm blaze burned the bottom of I-95 as \nif it were a pot over an open flame, snapping support wires, charring \nconcrete, and sending a column of sooty smoke south along the Delaware \nRiver. Early roadway damage estimates range from $2 to $5 million.\n  I would like to discuss with the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee the availability of emergency funding to \nrestore this important roadway, which is so critical to the economy of \nmy State and the eastern seaboard and to the quality of life of \nmillions of Pennsylvanians.\n  I understand that title II of this bill provides $300 million for the \nemergency fund of the Federal Highway Administration to cover expenses \narising from the January, 1996 flooding in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, \nand Northwest States and other disasters. Would my colleague agree that \nthe substantial highway damage that occurred on Interstate 95 should be \nconsidered a disaster for the purposes of this legislation?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I recognize the concerns raised by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. In providing the $300 million in appropriations for the \nemergency fund, it was the committee's intent to provide sufficient \nfunding to cover a range of unforeseen disaster, such as the damage \nthat has occurred on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. When critical \nhighways are impacted to such a degree that they must be closed and \nrepaired, it is important that Congress ensures the availability of \nfunds to restore the flow of commerce and individuals who are dependent \non them. I would be glad to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania to \nensure that the conference report on this legislation reflects the \nCongress' intention that the Interstate 95 fire should be considered as \na disaster by the Federal Highway Administration.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished chairman and look forward to \nworking with him in conference on this issue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, are we in a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3494.\n       In the matter under the heading ``Payment to the legal \n     services corporation'' under the heading ``Legal Services \n     Corporation'' in title V of the Departments of Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1996, strike ``$291,000,000'' and all \n     that follows through ``$1,500,000'' and insert the following: \n     ``$290,750,000 is for basic field programs and required \n     independent audits carried out in accordance with section \n     509; $250,000 is for a payment to an opposing party for \n     attorney's fees and expenses relating to civil actions named \n     In the Matter of Baby Boy Doe, and Doe v. Roe and Indian \n     tribe, with docket numbers 19512 and 21723 (Idaho February \n     23, 1996); $1,500,000''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I bring to the Senate this afternoon what \nin Idaho has been a phenomenally serious and frustrating matter in \nrelation to a young adopted child and his adoptive parents. I say that \nbecause 6 years ago the Swenson family of Nampa, ID, adopted a 2-month-\nold child. They went through all of the legal and appropriate channels \nto do so. They found out several months into the adoption of that \nchild, when the legal processes were underway, that the native American \ntribe from which this child had come--and the child was half white, \nhalf native American--wanted the child returned even though the natural \nparents did not. As a result of that, a legal fight began. And Legal \nAid Services of Idaho became involved in defending, supposedly, the \nchild--even though the child was then less than 2 years old, and the \nchild thought he was a member of the Swenson family--a loving, caring \nfamily.\n  I and my staff visited with the Legal Services Corporation, \nsuggesting they not become involved--that it was not the intent of \nCongress for Legal Services to use their money for these purposes, that \nthere were truly poor and needy people who needed Legal Services to \ndefend them, and that they ought to go elsewhere to find their clients.\n  Another reason I argued that was because the Indian tribe--in this \ninstance the Oglala Sioux--had their own attorney and their own money. \nThey were planning to defend themselves and to argue that this child \nought to be returned to their tribe. Believe it or not, this legal \nfight went on for 6 years. That legal fight was just settled a few \nmonths ago in the Idaho Supreme Court. Legal Aid Services of Idaho took \nthis fight all the way to the Supreme Court, expending thousands and \nthousands of dollars of taxpayers' money.\n  Here is the headline in the local press of February 23, ``Casey's \nAdoption Final Today.'' The Supreme Court of Idaho finally said to the \nSwenson family, ``You are entitled to your son,'' the son now being 6 \nyears old.\n  The story seemed to have a marvelous positive ending, but the tragedy \nis that the Swenson family spent $250,000 protecting their adopted son. \nThey sold their farm. Here are pictures of the farm being auctioned off \nless than a month ago to pay the legal fees because of the attack by \nLegal Services.\n  Of course, we know Legal Services Corporation and their grantees are \nfunded by tax dollars. They should be protecting the poor. That is \nCongress' intent. The ranking minority member of the appropriations \nsubcommittee has fought for years to assure that kind of direction. I \nargued with Legal Services that that is where their money ought to be \nspent. But, oh, no, they had to take on this family. They bankrupted \nthe family in an attempt to gain custody of this child. The family won. \nThe happy ending is here. But the family is bankrupt.\n  My amendment today is simple. It takes the necessary moneys from \nLegal Services Corporation and gives them to that family. We think that \nis fair and appropriate. And I have worked with the chairman, and the \nchairman of the subcommittee, and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee to deal with this because I think this sends a clear \nmessage to Legal Services Corporation and its grantees: Do what the law \nintends you to do. Defend the poor where it is necessary against a more \npowerful society. But do not enter into these areas where clearly those \nwho might need defending have the resources and support they need.\n  In this instance, that was all very, very clear throughout this \nfight. It was simply a fight that Legal Services attorneys would not \nstay out of, for political reasons.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is right on \ntarget. I have been a champion and remain a champion of Legal Services. \nI have learned over my 20-some, almost 30 years now that from time to \ntime there are excesses. In the early days, we were paying for \neverybody to come up here and break up the Congress. And Senator Javits \nand I, we put the provisions in there that cases should relate to \ndomestic, to landlord-tenant cases, employment cases, and everything \nelse.\n  This, of course, is a domestic case, but it is a case wherein a very \nresponsible entity, namely the Indian tribe, had their own counsel and \neverything else of that kind. We are not going to use Legal Services \nmoneys to sue the Governor of New Jersey. We are not going to use Legal \nServices to sue where the others have attorneys. This particular \ncorporation, started by Associate Justice Lewis Powell when he was head \nof the American Bar Association, is one of the finest that there is, \nvery much needed, and we need increases. The Senator from New Mexico \nand I cosponsored the amendment to increase the amount for Legal \nServices. We are not going to get the support of the Members of \nCongress when these excesses are allowed to go unnoticed.\n  I am tickled that the distinguished Senator from Idaho has raised the \nquestion. If we can get some discipline over there and against these \nexcesses, I think it will help Legal Services overall. So I agree to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3494) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was adopted.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee. The ranking \nmember has been gallant in his effort to maintain the Legal Services \nSystem that responds to the poor and the needy, and I truly appreciate \nhis willingness to look at this issue and to accept it and for the \nchairman to accept it also. I do believe it sends a message, but it \nalso does something very significant in our society: It rights a wrong.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would like to add to information on the previous \namendment that the subcommittee chairman, Senator Gregg, I am informed, \napproved of the amendment as well.\n  Mr. President, we are now at a time when the so-called big issues, \nnot all of them, but a goodly number of them, have been disposed of. We \ninvite Senators who have other amendments to be considered, first of \nall, to consider whether they want to offer the amendments.\n  We had 116 amendments that had been designated as of last night. I \nwas hoping that we could reduce that considerably, and I am pleased to \nsay that on our side, the acting majority leader, Senator Lott, has \nbeen doing yeomen work to get them reduced in number, and Senator \nDaschle, the Democratic leader, had indicated to me earlier this \nmorning that, likewise on the Democratic side of the aisle, there has \nbeen an effort to try to reduce these numbers of amendments.\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives is expecting to pass a 1-\nweek extension of the existing CR perhaps this afternoon. They will \nsend that over to the Senate once they have adopted it. The Senate, in \nthis process now, would be then privileged to have a vote on that CR or \nto continue work on the current vehicle, the omnibus appropriations \nbill. I am very hopeful that we can keep on this bill to clean it up \nand finish it because we have to go to the House for a conference \nfollowing our action. One week is not a very long time in the \nconsideration of this vehicle and that which we are substituting for \nthe House-passed omnibus package.\n\n  I am very hopeful that we can finish this and launch our conference \nwith the House and by Friday midnight pass the 1-week extension that \nthe House will probably pass today.\n  I think that is an orderly progression of our responsibility because \nI am fearful that if we extend this CR for 1 week, there is no pressure \nto finish this bill, and that will put us into next week on this \nvehicle and shortening the time, we have to understand, necessary to \nallow for a conference with the House.\n  I hoped we could escape any additional CR, but that is not the way \nthe Senate has worked its will. I wish to indicate again that if \nSenators are serious about the amendments they have listed, I hope they \nwill appear in the Chamber and provide the body an opportunity to \ndiscuss and to dispose one way or another of the amendments.\n  Senator Hatch has indicated that he will be here at 1 o'clock in \norder to offer an amendment. I see the Senator from North Dakota in the \nChamber, looking as though he is preparing to ask for recognition, and \nhopefully he is preparing to offer an amendment, because, very frankly, \nI do need a soft shoe or catchy tunes. We have about a 20-minute \ninterval facing us that I do not want to waste until the Senator from \nUtah arrives on his schedule for submission of an amendment.\n  Am I reading the actions of the Senator from North Dakota correctly?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will advise the Senator from Oregon I \nshould like to seek the floor for 2 minutes on an unrelated item. I \nthink there is one amendment referenced for me which may occur but \nwould require no floor time. So I will not ask for additional time from \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  I appreciate the difficulty is to try to get this bill done, and I \nunderstand the urgency with which he requests Senators to come and \noffer their amendments. I share the interest in seeing that this bill \ngets completed. If there are no other Senators seeking recognition when \nthe Senator from Oregon relinquishes the floor, I would ask for 2 \nminutes on an unrelated subject.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I hope it is in the form of a unanimous-\nconsent, and then I would say that I would object to that unanimous \nconsent request from the Senator from North Dakota unless it includes a \nsoft shoe or a catchy tune for the rest of the time we are waiting for \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to my friend from Oregon, the soft shoes and \nloud tunes, was it, are better reserved for other Members of the \nSenate. In fact, we have seen one example of that in the Senate. It was \nplayed and replayed on the nightly news, and I thought it had less to \ndo with talent than it had to do with the mere shock of seeing it occur \non the Senate floor.\n\n  Let me ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2005-6", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I seek the floor--and I would not have done it had other \nMembers wanted to continue on this bill--for 2 minutes to say that we \nare dealing with a lot of important issues in the Senate on this \ncontinuing appropriations bill, but there is another issue that is of \nenormous importance to North Dakota and to the farm belt. That is the \nfarm bill which is now in conference.\n  I want very much, now that conferees are appointed, for them to work \naround the clock in order to resolve the differences on the farm bill, \nbring it to the floor of the House and Senate and get a farm bill in \nplace.\n  The fact is, farmers in North Dakota, tens of thousands of them, are \nnow ready to go to the fields. In a matter of weeks, they will be in \nthe fields doing spring planting. The farm bill that was supposed to \nhave been passed last year was not. It is now mid-March 1996, and we do \nnot yet have a farm bill.\n  I have discerned that really if this is a revolution in the 104th \nCongress, it is a revolution with two speeds: One is a full gallop when \nit comes to the larger economic interests. Let Wall Street have a \nheadache, and we have a dozen people rushing in with medicine bottles. \nLet some of the larger corporate interests complain about a bellyache, \nand we have people who want to tuck them in bed. But let family farmers \nout there go around without a farm bill and people say there is no need \nfor a farm program; we do not need to get a farm bill for the family \nfarmer. There is slow motion in dealing with issues family farmers need \ndealt with.\n  Farmers in North Dakota and Kansas and South Dakota, Nebraska need to \nunderstand what is the farm program. What are the conditions under \nwhich they will plant this spring? Will there be a safety net or will \nthere not be a safety net? I would like Congress to provide that \nanswer, and I would like them to provide that answer sooner rather than \nlater.\n  A couple of weeks ensued when the House was in recess after the \nSenate passed its bill and a number of weeks lapsed while we were \nwaiting for conferees to be appointed. It is time for the conference \nnow that it is established to start working around the clock and get \nthis done. It ought not take a long period of time.\n\n  Farmers deserve an answer. I know that each individual farmer does \nnot have a lot of economic clout, and I guess that is why we do not see \nthe rush to serve their needs like we see when some of the larger \neconomic interests float around this institution.\n  I hope very soon the conference will convene and the conference will \ncomplete its work, bring its work to the Congress, and tell the family \nfarmers of this country what will be the farm bill for 1996. This \nCongress owes that to the farmers, and farmers deserve to hear it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. I actually do not \nhave any prepared remarks, but I was thinking that maybe later on I \nwould write up a resolution, or the leadership could write up a \nresolution, that there ought to be some words, some kind of statement \nby the United States Senate, maybe it is a message of love, to the \npeople of Dunblane, Scotland.\n  The slaughter of 16 children is just the ultimate nightmare. All of \nus who have children or grandchildren--or whether we have or do not \nhave children or grandchildren, it does not make any difference--just \nin terms of our own humanity, I think we all can feel, and we know the \nhorror of what has happened.\n  So, as a Senator from Minnesota, I just wanted to send my prayers and \nmy love to the people of Dunblane and to tell them that today, in the \nU.S. Senate, it is not as if they are not in our thoughts and prayers.\n  Mr. President, I wish it was in my power to do more. I wish it was in \nour power to do more. But I think something should be said about it on \nthe floor of the Senate, so I rise to speak, to send my love to the \npeople of Scotland. I believe I speak for other Senators as well. Maybe \nlater on today we can have a resolution that I know all of us will \nsupport.\n  Sometimes when you do this it seems unimportant, but it really is \nnot, because it is kind of a way in which all\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nthe people of the world reach out and hug one another at these moments. \nSo, later on, maybe we can have a leadership resolution or some kind of \nresolution that all Senators can sign on to, and we can send that to \nthe parents, to the families of Dunblane.\n  I hope and pray this never happens again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, today I am going to offer an amendment to \nincrease the drug czar's office. I think it is critical to this country \nthat we start taking the matter of drug control more seriously than we \nhave over the last number of years.\n  So, I rise to offer an amendment to provide an adequate level of \nfunding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, better known as \nthe drug czar's office.\n  This amendment increases ONDCP's budget by a modest $3.9 million to a \ntotal of $11.4 million for fiscal year 1996. That is still well below \nONDCP's funding level during President Bush's administration but higher \nthan the administration has requested. In fiscal year 1992, when George \nBush was President, ONDCP was getting $18.1 million for operating \nexpenses.\n  We all know why this amendment is necessary. By many accounts, \nPresident Clinton has downgraded the war on drugs. One of his first \nacts upon taking office was to cut the drug czar's staff from 146 down \nto 25. The President said he was fulfilling a campaign pledge to cut \nstaff, but several of us on both sides of the aisle warned that the new \ndrug czar would not be effective without the tools to do his job. We \nwere right. Indeed, the President's own drug czar conceded in 1993 that \ndrugs were no longer ``at the top of the agenda.'' That was in the \nWashington Post on July 8, 1993.\n  For 3 years, President Clinton gave us an imbalanced strategy \nfocusing primarily on the treatment of hardcore users. The strategy \nleft law enforcement and interdiction agencies twisting in the wind. \nFederal drug prosecutions fell, drug seizures dropped, the ability of \nU.S. forces to seize or otherwise turn back drug shipments in the \ntransit zone plummeted by 53 percent. This is just over the first 3 \nyears of President Clinton's administration.\n  Although the President's stated policy was to focus on hardcore \nusers, President Clinton also presided over record increases in the \nquality and purity of drugs reaching American streets, as well as \nstaggering increases in the number of drug-related emergency room \nadmissions of hardcore users.\n  As for supply reduction efforts, there appeared to be none. As \nrecently as 1 month ago, White House staff were arguing that more money \nfor interdiction would be wasted money. This irresponsible talk was \ncoming from people who are supposed to be advocates for the drug war, \nnot advocates against the drug war.\n  It is indisputable that under President Clinton's leadership, we have \nbeen losing ground on this issue. Just look at what has happened since \n1992 with our young people. Last year, the number of 12 to 17-year-olds \nusing marijuana hit 2.9 million, almost double the 1992 level, \naccording to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse in November of \n1995.\n  LSD use is way up among high school seniors. Mr. President, 11.7 \npercent of the class of 1995 have tried it at least once. That is the \nhighest rate since recordkeeping started in 1975.\n  A parents' group survey released this November found that one in \nthree high school seniors now smoke marijuana--one in three.\n  Methamphetamine abuse has become a major problem, particularly in the \nWestern States, including mine. Emergency room cases are up 256 percent \nover the 1991 level.\n  After 3 years of inaction, President Clinton now wants to give his \ndrug officials a fighting chance. OMB has requested $3.4 million to \nbeef up the office. This will allow them to hire 80 additional staff.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to give the President some credit \nfor giving us a new drug czar who, by all accounts, is dynamic and \nenergetic. The unanswered question here is whether the selection of \nGeneral McCaffrey signals President Clinton's newfound commitment to \nlead in the drug war or whether it is more simply an election year \nmakeover.\n  Adopting this amendment is ultimately about helping our children, \nabout helping the 48.4 percent of the class of 1995 that had tried \ndrugs by graduation day. It is about doing something to stem the \nincreasing number of 12 to 17-year olds using marijuana, currently 2.9 \nmillion of them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and \ngive General McCaffrey the tools he needs to do this job.\n  Mr. President, we have to get serious about this drug problem. It is \neating us alive. It is funding most, if not all, of the organized crime \nin this country. It is debilitating our young people. One in three \nseniors is trying marijuana, one in three senior high school students \nin the senior class happens to be trying marijuana. Think about that. \nThere is an 85 times greater likelihood for them to move on to harder \ndrugs, especially cocaine, if they have tried marijuana.\n  The vast majority of these kids think, today, both users and \nnonusers, that marijuana usage is less harmful to them than ordinary \ntobacco usage, than smoking simple cigarettes. Both, as anyone who \nknows anything about health will tell you, both are harmful to you. It \nis terrible to smoke cigarettes because they are going to lead to \ncancer and heart disease and a whole raft of other problems, but it is \neven worse to smoke marijuana, which can lead to all kinds of \ndebilitations that deteriorate our society as a whole and make it \ndifficult for people to do what is right and to live up to what is \nright.\n  On top of all that, we have those in the administration who are \narguing that the only side of the equation that really needs to receive \nsome consideration happens to be the demand side, that means those who \nare taking drugs. They take the limited resources that we have and put \nalmost all of them toward hard-core drug addicts, of whom the potential \nof saving is very, very low.\n  I am not saying we should not help hard-core drug addicts. We should. \nBut we certainly ought to be putting what limited resources we have \ninto helping these first-time offenders and these young kids who have \nreally got caught up in the drug world to come out of it and \nrehabilitate themselves. It is important to do the demand side of the \nequation. I am for that.\n  I think we ought to put money in that, and the drug czar needs to \nspend some time on it. But unless we are doing the supply side as well, \nwe will never make any headway because we have to interdict and stop \nthe flow of drugs coming into this country and we have to interdict and \nstop those who are making drugs in this country, especially with the \nnew methamphetamine rise that is inundating the Western States and is \nmoving eastward with rapidity.\n  We have to start fighting against these things, and we have to have \nour young people understand the importance of fighting against drug \nabuse in our society today.\n  I look at all the drive-by shootings, kids with weapons, the murders \nin our country's Capital here. I look at all these things, and I know \nthat a lot of this is driven by the drug trade, it is driven by the \ndrug community, it is driven by those who should know a lot better.\n  Mr. President, there is a second half to this amendment that we are \ngoing to file here today. This is an amendment that I am filing on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Grassley. We are adding various funds to \nthe budget, even above what the President has requested for the drug \nczar, because I believe that this drug czar has to have our support,\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nand we simply have to do a good job in helping him to get his job done.\n  Let me just say that, in addition to the drug czar's office, we are \nincluding in this amendment that no less than $20 million shall be for \nthe District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department to be used at \nthe discretion of the police chief for law enforcement purposes, \nconditioned upon appropriate consultation with the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the House-Senate Committees on the Judiciary and \nAppropriations.\n  In other words, what we are going to do is we are going to quit \nmouthing off about the greatest city in the world and how corrupt it is \nand how drug ridden it is and how murder ridden it is, and we are going \nto put our money where our mouths are and put $20 million into helping \nthis police chief to clean up this mess.\n  I met with Chief Soulsby a week ago. I have to say I have a lot of \nconfidence in him. One of his problems is that he has politicians \ninterfering with the use of these law enforcement moneys from time to \ntime. We are going to stop that by giving these funds directly to him. \nHe will have to consult with both the Judiciary Committees of the House \nand the Senate and both of the Appropriations Committees of the House \nand the Senate as to how he is going to use these funds.\n  We are going to give him a chance to straighten this out and to start \nmaking a turnaround on what is needed here in the District of Columbia. \nIf we find $20 million is not enough to really make that much of a \ndent, I will come back and fight for more.\n  This is the greatest city on Earth, in the sense of governmental \naction. This is the seat of our Government. It is an absolute crime \nthat people cannot walk down the streets in the District of Columbia \nwithout absolute assurance they are not going to be shot by some drug-\ninfested, drug-crazed human being, or that they are safe in their \nhomes, which is what is happening here. Not only are they not safe on \nthe streets, they are not even safe in their homes. The people of this \ncommunity, the vast majority of whom are law-abiding, decent, \nhonorable, religious citizens, deserve better.\n  I am convinced that Chief Soulsby will do an excellent job if he is \nnot hindered by some of the politicians in this town. By the way, I \nthink some of the politicians are very good, so I do not mean to lump \nthem all in a category of people who have been part of the problem \nhere. But there are some who are part of the problem as well. There are \nsome in the police department who need to be put in the appropriate \npositions or drummed out of the department. I am hoping that Chief \nSoulsby will set a system in motion that will get the very best people \nto be part of our police department in the metropolitan police \ndepartment of Washington, DC.\n  This is the first step of trying to make this a better system. But \nwhile we are making this first step in accordance with what I said I \nwould do, then I think we ought to also consider that we have 37 \ndifferent Federal law enforcement organizations in this town, 37 \ndifferent Federal law enforcement agencies. They are not coordinated \nwith the metropolitan police department. We have to use all these \nagencies to make this the safest and most important capital city in the \nworld.\n  I think we have to put our money where our mouths are and we have to \nstart now. I am going to rely on Chief Soulsby, and the administration \nof the city under Mayor Barry. I am going to rely on the help of \nEleanor Holmes Norton, who is the Representative over in the House of \nRepresentatives, who I believe is very eager to do a good job in this \narea for her constituents and for whom I have the greatest fondness and \nadmiration, and others who, in the best interest of this city, want to \ndo what is right.\n  So, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Shelby proposes an amendment numbered 3495.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 755 between lines 20 and 21 insert the following:\n\n            TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n    EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE \n                               PRESIDENT\n\n                 OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses,'' \n     $3,900,000.\n\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-52, $650,000 are rescinded.\n\n                      OFFICE OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-52, $650,000 are rescinded.\n\n                    OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-52, $500,000 are rescinded.\n\n                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES\n\n                    GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION\n\n                         FEDERAL BUILDING FUND\n\n                 LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABILITY OF REVENUE\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available for installment acquisition \n     payments under this heading in Public Law 104-52, $1,900,000 \n     are rescinded: Provided, That the aggregate amounts made \n     available of the Fund shall be $5,064,249,000.\n\n                        UNITED STATES TAX COURT\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-52, $200,000 are rescinded.\n\n                               CHAPTER 12\n\n       On page 755, line 22 redesignate the section number, and\n       On page 756, line 8 redesignate the section number.\n\n                  D.C.

Let me add in closing that this earmark would be applied \nagainst the crime control block grant. We think it is about time we do \nthis.\n  I also mention for the record that the chairman and ranking member of \nthe D.C. Appropriations Committee, Senators Jeffords and Kohl, support \nthat part of the amendment granting $20 million for the District of \nColumbia Police Force to be utilized by Chief Soulsby, with his \nconsultation, with both Judiciary Committees and both Appropriations \nCommittees.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support this amendment which will \nprovide $3,900,000 in supplemental funding to the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy to permit our new Drug Czar, General McCaffrey to \nincrease staffing by some 80 full-time equivalent positions.\n  During the debate on fiscal year 1996 funding for this Office, many \nof us were critical of the administration's dedication to reducing drug \nuse in this country.\n  Continued surveys show that drug use among our Nation's youth, \nparticularly those aged 12-17, show increases for use across the \nspectrum of illegal drugs.\n  The latest National Household Survey, released early this year, found \nthat any drug use, and specifically, crack and cocaine use for 12 to \n17-year-olds had increased above the previous year.\n  In addition, the recent Pulse Check Survey found that the \ndistribution of heroin and cocaine by the same dealers and in the same \nmarkets appear in more areas than ever before.\n  Equally disturbing, Mr. President, is the fact that the number of \nhard-core drug users remains unchanged despite an investment of over \n$100 billion on the so-called ``War on Drugs'' since 1987. In 1987 we \nhad 2.7 million hard-core drug users; in 1996, we still have 2.7 \nmillion hard-core drug users.\n  The significance of these statistics, Mr. President, is that while \nhardcore\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\ndrug represent less than 1 percent of the population in this country, \nthey consume 66 percent of all illegal drugs and are responsible for \n34-36 percent of all violent crime in this country.\n  It very well could be that this is a given, that no matter what we do \nto reduce drug use in this country, we will always have 2.7 million \nhardcore users.\n  However, I believe we have an obligation to see that we use the \nlatest innovations in both the public and private arenas to reach this \ngroup, Mr. President, before we write them off.\n  We have a new Drug Czar, who I believe, exemplifies the meaning of \nthe word ``Czar''. He is a decorated war hero and general and someone \nwho brings enormous credibility to this drug war.\n  I have met with him, Mr. President, and he is very impressive.\n  General McCaffrey has taken this job, not because he wanted it or \nsought it out, but because he recognizes the devastating effects drug \nabuse has on this country and he wants to personally dedicate himself \nto seeing that we do conduct an all-out effort, on every level, to rid \nthis country from the scourge of drugs for the long term.\n  He has asked for the resources he believes he needs to put together a \nstrategy that will work. What we've done up to this point clearly is \nnot working.\n  He has asked for an additional $3.4 million to increase the number of \nfull-time staff at ONDCP to 125. In addition, he has requested \npermission to detail 30 planners from the Department of Defense to \nONDCP.\n  Currently, ONDCP has 45 personnel who are responsible for overseeing \nthe proper implementation of an annual $14.6 billion national drug \ncontrol budget.\n  The Office budget is currently $7.5 million. If this amendment is \nsuccessful, it will bring the total budget for his office operations up \nto $11.4 million or less than 1 percent of the total annual amount \nspent on Federal drug control programs.\n  Mr. President, General McCaffrey has the confidence of this Senator \nand Members on both sides of the aisle, to lead our anti-drug efforts. \nI think we have an obligation to give him an opportunity to show us \nwhat he can do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also note for the Record that Senator \nShelby, who worked very hard on the Appropriations Committee, would \nalso like to be added as a cosponsor. I hope other Senators will also \nbe cosponsors.\n  I hope all Senators will vote for this so we can do good for our \nNation's Capital while at the same time adding enough funds now for the \ndrug czar's office.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, what is the pending \nbusiness and what are the time restraints on it?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2031-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2033-S2036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORP. AND RELATED MATTERS --MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 1:30 p.m. having arrived, there \nwill now be one-half hour of debate, equally divided, prior to voting \non the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to Senate \nResolution 227.\n  Mr. BREAUX. With that understanding, I yield myself 5 minutes in \nopposition to the pending motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I was thinking about the Whitewater \nproceedings and the stalemate we have on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nwith how to proceed. I think the American public really has an interest \nin this, not just the two political parties, Democrats and Republicans.\n  When I talk to people back in Louisiana and we talk about this \nWhitewater investigation, most of my constituents are not really \ncertain or sure what all of this is about. They know there are some \naccusations that have been presented and that there have been some \ndenials of those. But most people today are very confused about the \nentire subject that has become known as Whitewater.\n  I think the American people have an interest in this that is a \nsuperior interest, even more superior than the interests of the \nDemocratic Party members on my side and the Republican Party members on \nthat side of the aisle. There is an American interest in this which \ngoes far beyond politics, and I really think that is the solution we \nshould be seeking as we try to resolve this issue on how to handle the \nso-called Whitewater affair. What do we need to do that puts the \nAmerican people's interests in the front seat and the political \nparties' interests in the back seat for a change?\n\n  Let me suggest what I think the people in my State and the people in \nAmerica really would like to see. They would like to see this thing \nresolved. They would like to see it resolved outside the political \narena. They would like to see it resolved. The people's interests are \nfinding out what really happened, how to resolve it, and, if anything \nbad happened, that it will not happen again, and it is not who gets the \ncredit or the blame.\n  What we are doing in this debate is arguing about which party is \ngoing to get the proper advantage and the manner in which the \nWhitewater affair is brought to conclusion. That should not be what \ndetermines how we act and what we do.\n  Let me make a suggestion of some of the things that I have heard from \nthe people in my State. They have told me, ``Senator, when politicians \ninvestigate politicians, it produces political results, especially in \nan election year.'' That is pretty simple and pretty accurate and \npretty easy for people to understand. When politicians investigate \npoliticians, it produces political results, especially in a political \nelection year. That is why we had such a difficult time trying to bring \nthis to a resolution that makes sense to the average American, who is \nless concerned about the politics of all of this, but is far more \nconcerned about just getting it behind us.\n  If wrong was done, it should be punished. If it was not done, we \nshould go on with the other problems facing the Congress and not spend \nthe time we have been spending debating this issue endlessly while \nother problems continue to fester.\n  Let me suggest that the Congress has already spoken about how to get \nthis done outside of the political arena. Does anybody remember what \nthe Congress did and why we did it when we created an independent \ncounsel? I remember the arguments, and I thought they made a lot of \nsense. The argument for doing that in investigating Whitewater was \nsimple. Let us take the politics out of it and make sure we do not have \npoliticians investigating politicians, producing political results. \nTherefore, this Senate created the independent counsel, and the \nindependent counsel has been adequately funded. There is no term limit. \nThey could go on forever and always until they bring a conclusion to \nthis whole case.\n  As we stand here on the floor of the Senate, there is a trial going \non, for gosh sakes, in the State of Arkansas on Whitewater. People have \nbeen indicted. There is a Federal prosecutor who is presenting the \nevidence in a court of law, in a Federal court. They are moving to a \nconclusion of this, and it is being done outside of the political \narena.\n  We have a former Reagan Justice Department official, Kenneth Starr, \nwho was established as the independent counsel. We said we are going to \ntake it out of Congress and out of politics and give it to an \nindependent counsel who does not have any political baggage. He is not \na Democratic person, a Democratic chairman, or a Democratic ranking \nmember, or a Republican chairman, or Republican ranking member; he is \nan independent counsel. What did we do? We have given that person\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\n unlimited funding. Does any agency in the Government get that? Not the \ndefense or anything else. He has unlimited funding. He has a \nprofessional staff of over 130 people that have been working since they \nbegan in January 1994. Guess how much money they have spent? They have \nspent $25.6 million investigating this one issue. Yet, we are spending \ntime on the floor of the Senate saying, no, we like the politics so \nmuch that we just cannot let it go. We like the investigation so much, \nso let us extend it, and we need a little bit more money to continue \ndoing that.\n\n  We spent $400,000 in the Banking Committee in 1994 investigating, and \n$950,000 in 1995 with the special Whitewater Committee investigating \nit. The Senate spent $1.3 million-plus investigating this as a \npolitical interest for everybody in this body.\n  Let me suggest that what the American people want--not what Congress \nwants--which is what Congress should want, is to bring this to a \nconclusion, bring it to a conclusion in a fair manner, prosecute and \nconvict those who did wrong, exonerate those who have been falsely \naccused, if there are any; and if there has been no wrongdoing, finish \nit. The way to finish it is not by a continuation of politics as usual. \nI am not impugning anybody who has served hours over here, but it is \ntime for the Congress to recognize what the American people want, and \nwhat they would like to see is a nonpolitical conclusion. A \nnonpolitical conclusion says that politics be damned; if somebody did \nsomething wrong, they will be prosecuted. If they did not, they will \nnot.\n  I think the American people recognize that, in a political election \nyear with a November Presidential election, it is not going to be \npossible for a political investigation to produce anything but \npolitical results. The only way to ensure that that does not happen is \nto continue to allow the independent counsel, which we all created just \nfor this purpose, to do his job. He has spent $25 million doing it \nalready. Let them complete it. No one has suggested that they are not \ndoing their job. Then, when that investigation is over, completed, at \nleast the American public will be able to say, you know, they checked \nit out and they did it in the right fashion, and the politicians did \nnot do it, the professionals did it.\n  I urge rejection of the motion.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there was a recent ``Nightline'' program \nthat dealt with a new book on the market that, I believe, is entitled \n``Blood Sport.'' It is a book that was written by an individual by the \nname of James Stewart, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. One of the \nbooks he wrote was entitled ``Den of Thieves.'' He has an impeccable \nset of credentials.\n  My understanding of the genesis of this book is that Susan Thomases, \nan attorney and close personal friend of the Clintons, went to Mr. \nStewart and suggested it for the purpose of, as my colleague from \nLouisiana had indicated, trying to come to a nonpolitical conclusion.\n  So maybe where I ought to start in summing up what this ``Blood \nSport'' is all about is going to the last comments I had intended to \nmake which had to do with the conclusion that is reached in Mr. \nStewart's book. I am going to have some quotes. The quotes are going to \ncome actually from ``Nightline,'' not necessarily from the book, \nbecause Ted Koppel, in essence, asked Mr. Stewart what was the \nconclusion that he drew as a result of doing this book. He said it was \n``a study in the acquisition and wielding of power and, in the end, a \nstudy of the arrogance of power--the things they can do and get away \nwith as an elected official and then how honest and candid they are \nwhen questioned about it.''\n  It is interesting that at the time when there seems to be more and \nmore interest developing in the country with respect to what went on \nwith Whitewater, we had this ``Nightline'' show again the other night, \nthis new book ``Blood Sport''--and now Time magazine apparently is \ngoing to be doing a series for 3 weeks about Whitewater--that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle now seem to be an extension \nof the White House strategy to deal with the issue. All through this \nprocess they have delayed, they have misinformed, they have done \neverything possible, frankly, to move it to a point where they would be \nable to say ``this is political.''\n  So what are we supposed to do? Is this because this is a political \nyear, we are supposed to stop the pursuit of truth?\n  Again, the charge that I think my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have opened themselves up for is that they are now an extension \nof the activities of the White House. They are going to do whatever \nthey can to keep us from moving forward on this issue.\n  In his book, Mr. Stewart kind of outlined what he saw as the mindsets \nof the Clintons with respect to Whitewater. Again he said on \n``Nightline'' that they had ``an attitude bordering on negligence from \nthe beginning,'' that they had the ``belief that someone else will take \ncare of us because of our power as high elected officials in \nArkansas.'' They had ``a willingness to accept favors from those who \nwere regulated by the State.''\n  I am sure that the chairman remembers the hearings that we had with \nBeverly Bassett Schaffer, who was an individual who was appointed to a \nposition of securities commissioner, I believe, in Arkansas and who \nreceived a phone call from Mrs. Clinton, acting as an attorney for \nMadison, asking the question, ``Who should I send some papers with \nregard to the preferred stock issue, who should I send those to in your \noffice?'' Mind you, there has been a lot said from the First Lady's \nperspective that she was trying to do everything possible to make sure \nthat there was no impression created that she would be using her \nposition for her personal gain.\n\n  I ask you, if there really was a concern about this, why would you \nrisk shattering everything that you were trying to accomplish by making \na phone call down to the commissioner herself, and say, ``Who should I \nsend it to in your office?'' It makes absolutely no sense.\n  On some of the basic underlying issues, again, author Stewart flatly \ncontradicts Hillary Clinton. He said, ``It is simply not true'' that \nthe Clintons had no active role in the Whitewater investment. To the \ncontrary, Mrs. Clinton ``singlehandedly took control of the \ninvestment'' in 1986 once the McDougal empire began to crumble. She \nhandles everything from loan renewals to correspondence. She also had \npossession of all the records, many of which, by the way, are now \nmissing.\n  Mr. Stewart points out that the Clintons are likely guilty of at \nleast one Federal crime, the same Federal crime for which the McDougals \nare now on trial.\n  Mind you, the reason I did this this way today was that I wanted to \nuse an unbiased source, if you will. The friends on the other side of \nthe aisle say we are being political about this. I am responding to \nboth a book and to a series of articles that will take place, the first \nof which was in Time magazine this week, and ``Nightline.'' I mean, \nthis is what he is saying, that the crime that I was referring to a \nmoment ago is knowingly inflating the value of their share of \nWhitewater investment to a financial institution.\n  In a 1987 financial disclosure statement, Mrs. Clinton listed the \nvalue of their share of Whitewater as nearly double the bank's recent \nestimates, and she did this to get more money to shore up a failing \ninvestment. If that is proven, that is in fact is fraud.\n  There also are some interesting comments with respect to the Foster \nsuicide. Stewart believes that the reasons Mr. Foster listed in his \nsuicide note do not actually reflect the true nature of all that was \nbothering him at the time, and notably again the author said there were \nthings ``so serious that he''--Foster--``will not dare write them \ndown.'' Those things involve--again, this is what the author is \nsuggesting--those things involve the First Lady, Whitewater, and \nethical violations which put Web Hubbell in a Federal prison.\n  Mr. Stewart also believes, as I do, that it is entirely possible that \nthe billing records that mysteriously turned up in the White House \nresidence were formerly in Vince Foster's office. If that is so, one or \nmore felonies have been committed, and it is just a question of \nfiguring out who the guilty parties are.\n\n  With respect to damage control efforts, according, again, to the \nauthor,\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\nMr. Stewart, after White House staff had introduced the notion of \ncooperating fully with the investigators, Mrs. Clinton interrupted and \nsaid--and I am quoting him now as he is quoting here--``I am not going \nto have people pouring over our documents. After all, we are the \nPresident.''\n  The suggestion here is that by virtue of the grandeur of power of \ntheir office, they should not have to endure the experience of \nlegitimate investigation. In essence, it says to me that the First Lady \nbelieves she and the President are above the law.\n  A moment ago I read the conclusion--I am going to state it again--of \nwhat Mr. Stewart's book is about. He said it was ``a study in the \nacquisition and wielding of power and, in the end, a study of the \narrogance of power--the things that they can do and get away with as an \nelected official, and then how honest and candid they are when \nquestioned about it.''\n  If any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are listening, \nI would ask you to ponder the final words of Mr. Stewart--I believe an \nunbiased source, a source that Mrs. Clinton and her friend Susan \nThomases believes to be evenhanded and capable of finding out the truth \nabout their involvement in Whitewater. He said, ``The truth is \nimportant in our society. Just as important in our society, I do not \nthink that you can put a price tag on these things.'' And then he goes \non to say that if you feel the investigation has been harsh or nasty, \nthe reason for that--again quoting him--``is because the truth was \nnever honored in the first place.''\n  So I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that it is time \nto quit filibustering. It is time to stop being an extension of the \nWhite House strategy. It is time to allow the American people to get \nthe facts and to let them draw their own conclusions as to who is right \nand who is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 7 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from New York has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think that a very significant statement was made on \nthe floor of the Senate yesterday by the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  Senator Inouye, as we know, chaired the Iran-Contra hearings. He \nserved on the Watergate hearings. And he said yesterday in the course \nof his remarks--and I am now quoting him--``This Republican extension \nrequest''--referring to the resolution that is before us--``is \nunprecedented, and it is unreasonable.''\n  Let me repeat that. It ``is unprecedented, and it is unreasonable. \nThe U.S. Senate has never before conducted an open-ended political \ninvestigation of a sitting American President during a Presidential \nelection year.''\n  He is correct on that. This is unprecedented in all the previous \ninquiries and investigations. My distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut earlier in the debate put in a table which indicated that \nall of those inquiries have had fixed dates for their conclusion.\n  Senator Inouye later went on in his statement--referring back to the \nwork of the Iran-Contra Ccommittee, which completed its work actually \nin significantly less time than is being proposed for this committee--\nto say, and I quote him: ``Yes, there were requests by Democrats and \nRepublicans''--this is back at the time when we were going to undertake \nthe Iran-Contra hearings.\n  Yes, there were requests by Democrats and Republicans that we seek an \nindefinite time limit on the hearings, but the chairman of the House \ncommittee, Representative Hamilton, and I, in conjunction with our vice \nchairs, strongly recommended against an open-ended investigation. We \nsought to ensure that our investigation was completed in a timely \nfashion to preserve the committee's bipartisanship and to avoid any \nexploitation of President Reagan during an election year.\n  At that time, one of the most consistent spokesman that the Iran-\nContra inquiry not extend into the election year and not be open ended, \nas some Democrats, who were in control of the Congress, were intending, \none of the most consistent exponents of a limitation in that regard was \nSenator Dole, who repeatedly, both in this Chamber and in conversations \nwith the media, underscored the point of having a closing date and \nkeeping the matter out of the Presidential election year. What happened \nwas that the Democrats responded to Senator Dole and, in fact, not only \nagreed to an ending date but moved that date forward to get it even \nfurther away from the election year. In fact, Senator Dole recognized \nand acknowledged that in the course of debate in this Chamber.\n  We have a comparable situation here. In fact, Senator Dole said:\n\n       I am heartened by what I understand to be the strong \n     commitment of both the chairman and vice chairman to avoid a \n     fishing expedition. I am pleased to note that as a result of \n     a series of discussions which have involved myself, the \n     majority leader and the chairman and vice chairman designate \n     of the committee, we have changed the date on which the \n     committee's authorization will expire.\n\n  In fact, what they did was they moved it up. That was thanks very \nmuch to Senator Inouye's leadership, who, as I said, stated yesterday, \nand let me just quote him again:\n\n       We sought to ensure that our investigation was completed in \n     a timely fashion to preserve the committee's bipartisanship \n     and to avoid any exploitation of President Reagan during an \n     election year.\n\n  When this resolution was passed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, \nan essential premise of it was the ending date of February 29. Many of \nus believed the committee could have completed its work within that \ntimeframe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself the remaining amount of time. Is there 2 \nadditional minutes?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two additional minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Inouye indicated yesterday that the Iran-Contra \nCommittee intensified its hearings as it approached its deadline in \norder to complete the work. They did 21 days of hearings in the last 23 \ndays.\n  This committee, in contrast, in the last 2 weeks of February, before \nthe February 29 date, did 1 day of hearing--in the last 2 weeks. The \nIran-Contra Committee did 21 out of 23 days. This committee, the \nWhitewater Committee, has worked at a much more intense pace at an \nearlier time. Back last summer, in 3 weeks in the latter part of July \nand the first part of August, the committee held 13 days of hearings.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, did not put out a proposal: \nWell, you have reached February 29. This is the end of it. In an effort \nto be reasonable and accommodating, he said, we will agree to an \nextension of 5 weeks in which to conduct hearings, an additional month \nbeyond that in which to submit the report. Let me point out this \ncommittee itself held 13 days of hearings during a 3-week period last \nsummer. The Iran-Contra Committee held 21 days of hearings in less than \na 4-week period in July and August 1987. So an intense hearing schedule \nof that sort is clearly possible. It has been done before. It could be \ndone again.\n  I submit that the proposal offered by the minority leader is a \nreasonable proposal. It is an effort to provide an accommodation in \nthis matter, allow the committee to continue its work and bring it to \nan appropriate conclusion, and avoid moving this thing into an election \nyear with a perception, increasing perception, that it is being done \nfor partisan political reasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not think it behooves anyone to \ndenigrate a proposal to accomplish that which I believe the American \npeople want and are entitled to. More importantly, it is our \nconstitutional responsibility to get the facts and hold these hearings.\n  The offer put forth by our colleagues on the other side is \ninadequate. It is a step in the right direction, but it is inadequate \nbecause there are key witnesses, facts, and information that will not \nbe available to us by April 5. They just will not be available to us. \nThere is no way, that witnesses who are presently on trial, or who will \nbe called to testify while the trial is taking place will be available \nto this committee. Their proposal will place us in the position that, \ncome April 5, we will be back\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nhere and they will say once again you are doing it.\n  That is why we have to reject it. I hope we can come to some kind of \nmeaningful understanding that would give us the ability to go forth and \nhave, at least, a reasonable opportunity of getting as many of the \nfacts as we can, and avoid the political season and the conventions.\n  Now, my colleague, Senator Mack, has pointed out that much of the \ndelay has been occasioned because the administration has not promptly \nproduced--and/or people who work for the administration--documents that \nwere subpoenaed and requested.\n  Second, this is not some political conspiracy. There have been nine \npeople who have pled guilty already--nine. David Hale pled guilty. He \nwas a former judge, friend of the Clintons, and friend of their \nbusiness partners, the McDougals; Matthews pled guilty to trying to \nbribe Hale; Fitzhugh, he worked in the bank, pled guilty; Robert \nPalmer, real estate appraiser for the Madison bank, pled guilty; Web \nHubbell, former law partner of the First Lady, pled guilty; Chris Wade, \nformer real estate broker for Whitewater, pled guilty; Neal Ainley, \nformer president of the Perry County Bank--by the way, that is the bank \nthat lent Governor Clinton $180,000 for his 1990 gubernatorial race--\npled guilty; Stephen Smith, former Clinton aide, former president and \ncoowner of the Madison Bank and Trust that was owned by Governor \nTucker, he pled guilty; Larry Kuca, former director, Madison Financial \nCorp., pled guilty.\n  Now, let me tell you, we are going to attempt to bring a number of \nthese people in to get the complete story. I have to say it seems to me \nthat my colleagues have become an extension of the White House in \nattempting to keep the facts from coming to the American people. If \nthey want to do that, then they are going to have to take the onus of \nthese things. Again, this is just the beginning. This is the third time \nwe have come to the Senate for an extension, and we run into this \nfilibuster, this stonewall. The New York Times says it is silly. It is \nsilly.\n  The Washington Post says just because Democrats want to bring this to \nan end does not mean it will end. The people are entitled to the facts.\n  We have offered a compromise and I think it is reasonable--4 months, \nan extension for 4 months for the public hearings. This proposal would \ngive us an opportunity to do our job, and that is to get all the facts \nand to present them to the people as best we can. We may not be able to \nget all of them, but at least we can do the best we can.\n  Finally, this was an undertaking that was voted overwhelmingly, 96 to \n3. To attempt to turn this, now, into a political witch hunt, which is \nhow it has been characterized, is wrong and it is improper. We have not \nbeen able to complete our work because there has been a conscious \neffort to shield the facts from the committee and the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to just take a moment of the \nSenate's time to respond briefly to a speech that President Clinton \ndelivered in New Jersey last Monday. The President decided to give a \nvery political speech on the environment and made several misstatements \nthat I believe need to be corrected.\n  It is interesting that in that speech he decried the fact that there \nwere political divisions now over the environment. I read the speech, \nand for the life of me I cannot understand how his speech could do \nanything except to exacerbate political divisions, if there are any.\n  The President of the United States accused the Congress of moving \nforward on Superfund legislation that would ``let polluters off the \nhook and make the taxpayers pay.'' I am the chairman of the Superfund \nSubcommittee on the Environment and Public Works Committee and have \nbeen working on the bill for almost 2 years. I think I know what I am \ntalking about when I say very frankly and bluntly that is a false \nstatement. There is not another nice way to say it. It is simply not \ntrue.\n  Let me take a moment to explain. Since its inception, the Superfund \nProgram has been paid for by industries that were considered, in a \nbroad sense, to be responsible for the bulk of the toxic waste problem. \nThat is how we pay for Superfund. Those taxes that\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\nare collected are collected as follows: an excise tax on 42 feedstock \nchemicals; an excise tax on imported chemical derivatives; an excise \ntax on petroleum; and the corporate environment income tax. All of \nthose taxes together paid by these large corporations who are \nresponsible for much of the environmental--some of these environmental \nproblems we had, paid into a fund called Superfund. Together, all of \nthose taxes raise roughly $1.5 billion every year. They are then \ndeposited into that Superfund.\n  Maybe I am missing something. I do not think the average taxpayer is \nimporting chemical derivatives. It is safe to say that the taxpayer is \nnot--I repeat not--being asked to pick up the tab for the Superfund \nProgram. That is not the way it is now. That is not the way it is going \nto be under the legislation that we are drafting--in a bipartisan way, \nI might add--here in the Senate.\n  I believe those taxes should be extended. In fact, I included an \nextension of those taxes in the Superfund reform legislation that I \nintroduced last year as we were making changes in that legislation. I \nam still advocating the extension of those taxes. Both the House and \nthe Senate passed a temporary extension of the taxes last year. Guess \nwhat? We passed the extension of these taxes on these companies that \npollute, and the President vetoed--I repeat, the President vetoed--that \nlegislation.\n  I read the whole speech, and I did not find any reference to that in \nthe President's speech last Monday. That, in fact, at the very same \ntime standards that help us put money in the Superfund trust fund to \nclean up the sites, like the one the President visited in New Jersey, \nwas vetoed by the President of the United States. I find it outrageous \nhe would go to New Jersey, to one of those brown-field sites, and say \nthat. It is false.\n  Let there be no misunderstanding: The taxpayers have never--never, I \nrepeat--been asked to pay for polluters, and not a single bill \nintroduced in Congress, including my own, would ask the taxpayers to do \nit.\n  Mr. President, read the bills. Read the bills that have been \nintroduced. Read my bill, Mr. President. The bill that I am working on \nwith your colleagues in the Senate, every day, as we speak--staff, \nworking to get a bipartisan bill--that Superfund Program has always \nbeen, and will be in the future, financed by taxes on various \nindustries. Nothing has changed.\n  Second, the President claimed on Monday--this is particularly \ndisturbing--``a small army of powerful lobbyists'' have descended upon \nthe Capitol to launch a ``full-scale attack'' on our environmental \nlaws. According to the President, these lobbyists and congressional \nRepublicans just cannot wait to gut each and every one of our \nenvironmental laws--every one of them.\n  I have a message to deliver to the President. Check in with the EPA, \nyour own EPA, Mr. President. Talk to them. For the past several weeks \nand months, my staff has been in daily discussions with the Democrat \nand Republican Senate staff and the EPA, trying to work out a \ncommonsense approach to reform our Nation's Superfund Program, a \nprogram that has spent $30 billion and cleaned up 50 sites in 15 years, \nMr. President. It does need reform. It needs more than that. It needs a \ndramatic overhaul, and you know it.\n  While we are working toward this solution together, the President is \nmaking it more difficult with inflammatory and inaccurate rhetoric. The \nonly individuals working on drafting legislation are elected officials \nand their representatives. To suggest otherwise, that somehow this \nSenator or any Senator or any Congressman is allowing a lobbyist to \nwrite a bill, is an insult and demagogic at worst.\n  Let me just say this, Mr. President, give one example. You tell me \nwhere any lobbyist in any Senator's office is writing a bill. Put your \nwords up there one more time, Mr. President, and back it up with fact. \nShow me one case, one example, where any Senator is using a lobbyist to \nwrite his bill. You have insulted me, personally, Mr. President, and \nthat is exactly the way I take it. You have insulted many other people, \ngood people, in both parties in the House and the Senate.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund and Risk \nAssessment, as a father, a sportsman, environmental issues are as much \nconcern to me as you. It may come as a surprise, Mr. President, but my \ndaughter drinks the same water as your daughter does, breathes the same \nair. My sons and I fish in the same rivers, or rivers that are similar. \nThere is not a Senator or Congressman that I know who wants to trash \nour environment.\n\n  Do we have differences as to how to clean it up? Of course. To say we \nwant to trash it or imply that we do is outrageous. That is exactly \nwhat the President implied last Monday. Apparently, the President \nbelieves that his way is the only way to a clean and healthy \nenvironment. I am sorry, I disagree.\n  When the President hits the campaign trail, he tends to get a little \nbit excited and he says some things he really does not mean. I am \nwilling to forgive that. Mr. President, admit it: You were wrong in \nwhat you said.\n  President Clinton campaigned on a tax cut, and he raised taxes. He \nvetoed a tax cut. He campaigned on welfare reform, and he vetoed \nwelfare reform. He campaigned on a balanced budget, and he vetoed a \nbalanced budget. In those instances where the President has taken a \nstrong position on an issue, he always finds a way to change his mind.\n  Given that fact, I will give the President the benefit of the doubt. \nI will assume he did not intend to impugn the integrity of dozens of \nhard-working men and women who are working in the various committees, \nworking on environmental legislation in the House and the Senate. I am \ncertain that this false accusation just slipped out in the heat of the \nmoment and was not carefully thought out. This is a campaign year, but \nit need not be a year where bipartisan consensus is made impossible by \ncheap political shots. That is exactly what this is, Mr. President. You \nowe every one of us an apology--myself, my staff, Democrats who have \nworked on this issue, we would not be working day in and day out with \nthe Senate Democrats and EPA officials if we did not think there was a \nreal opportunity to pass a strong Superfund reform bill early this \nyear. That is exactly what we are going to do, in spite of that \nrhetoric. That is my goal, to get this bill on the floor of the Senate \nwithin the next couple of months, hopefully, that all of us can support \nand be proud of.\n\n  We are going to put it on your desk, Mr. President. Maybe you will \nveto that like you did the balanced budget that you promised, or \nwelfare reform that you promised. But we are going to put it on your \ndesk. I suggest, Mr. President, with the greatest respect, that you \ntone down the rhetoric a little, read the speeches before you deliver \nthem, see what your staff puts in them. I do. Maybe you ought to do \nthat, too. Talk to some of your colleagues in the Senate and in the \nHouse and find out what we are really doing before you take any more \ncheap shots.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, Madam President. I will not \nobject to my friend's request, but I would like to inquire of the \nmanagers as to the status of the legislation. Are we moving along with \namendments? It seems like in the last hour or 2 we have made speeches \nas in morning business.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the manager of the bill has just stepped \noff the floor, but I know they are working to reduce the number of \namendments, to try to resolve as many issues as they can, to get us to \na final passage document. The manager has just returned to the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, then if we are going to make speeches as \nin morning business, may I ask unanimous consent that after the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho has completed his statement, I be \nrecognized for a 10-minute period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of S. 1614 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                             Generic Drugs\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, my colleagues, Senators Chafee and \nSenator Brown, and I have submitted an amendment that every authority I \nhave consulted says should already be the law but for a simple \ncongressional mistake. According to our United States Trade \nRepresentative, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Food \nand Drug Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, our \namendment should have been part of the GATT implementing legislation \nknown as the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n  Congress made a mistake, Madam President. We left the amendment out \nof the GATT legislation. We forgot. It is as simple as that. It has \nhappened before, and it will undoubtedly happen again.\n  The very unfortunate result of our error is that every day a few \npharmaceutical companies are earning an extra $5 million a day, \ncourtesy of the American taxpayer, the American consumer, the American \nveteran, and the American senior citizen. Today, however, we have a \nunique opportunity, Madam President, to correct that mistake. We could \nimplement the law as it was intended, saving consumers billions of \ndollars and fulfilling our obligations under the GATT treaty, all in \none stroke. Let us take this opportunity today to put our mistake \nbehind us.\n\n  Madam President, I know this issue is familiar to all of my \ncolleagues. Last December we brought this amendment to the floor and \nsought a vote which we never got. There was an effort to kill the \namendment with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and call for future \nhearings. When I withdrew the amendment, along with my colleagues--\nSenators Chafee and Brown--from consideration, I promised, like \nMcArthur, to ``return.'' Today, my colleagues and I have returned to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Here is the single fact which I urge my colleagues to keep in mind. \nAmbassador Kantor testified only 2 weeks ago that the Pryor-Chafee-\nBrown amendment ``would do nothing more than fulfill our obligations to \nbe faithful to what we negotiated in the GATT treaty.'' He confirmed \nthat it would ``carry out the intent not only of the negotiations and \nwhat the Administration intended, but also what the Congress itself \nintended.''\n  Those were the words of our U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador \nMickey Kantor. In other words, Madam President, all of us in the \nCongress believed that the substance of this amendment was part of the \nGATT agreement which we enacted into law. We assumed at that time that \nthe GATT transition provisions were universal in nature and scope, but \nwe in fact neglected to include a specific, conforming amendment. As a \nresult, if we do not accept this amendment, we are then deliberately \ncarving out a special exemption from the GATT treaty for one single \nindustry--indeed, for a small number of pharmaceutical companies within \nthis single industry.\n  As my friend and colleague--and almost seat mate--Senator Paul Simon \nof Illinois, has stated, ``This is as classic a case of public interest \nversus special interest as you could find.'' A very fine statement by \nSenator Simon.\n  Madam President, I received a letter from several of my colleagues \nyesterday about this issue. But there is a misconception that they have \nraised and must be dispelled. I am certain they did not have the facts \nwhich I feel at this time must be discussed. In this letter, my \ncolleagues write:\n\n       The committee learned during the Judiciary hearing that \n     because of ongoing patent litigation, no potential generic \n     manufacturer of Zantac can expect to enter the market before \n     September of this year, regardless of what Congress does or \n     doesn't do.\n\n  I am afraid that this allegation is in fact untrue. I am sure it will \ncome as no surprise that it was the company called Glaxo and the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association who made this \nallegation before the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago. What they \nneglected to share with our colleagues were some very critical facts--\nfacts which I hold in my hand. As Paul Harvey would say on the radio, \nMadam President, ``Here is the rest of the story.''\n  There is litigation over Zantac, which is the best selling \nprescription drug in the world. It is delayed because it was Glaxo--the \ncompany that has the patent--who asked the court to delay its ruling, \nthus denying all generic competition.\n  I have in my hand a copy of the brief submitted by Glaxo's lawyers to \nthe court. Madam President, should we not inquire into the reason that \nGlaxo gave the court for delaying action and for restraining immediate \ncompetition from a market after 17 years of monopoly protection and \nextremely high prices? It was simple. It was because of the GATT \nloophole. Glaxo told the court in its brief that it has a patent \nextension which would shield it from generic competition until the year \n1997.\n  Madam President, the reason Glaxo will not face any generic \ncompetition until 1997 is because of the very same GATT loophole we are \ntrying to correct. Glaxo wants to delay the court. They want to delay \naction in the Congress because every day that we delay, Madam \nPresident, is another jackpot payday for Glaxo--and for every other \ncompany benefiting from this loophole.\n\n  Let me reemphasize this point: The reason these companies are \nshielded from generic competition is that Congress made a mistake and \nforgot a conforming amendment when the GATT legislation was passed. The \ncourt is now delaying its ruling because we in the Senate have not \nacted on the Pryor-Chafee-Brown amendment. Every day that we delay is \nanother day the court has no reason to act. Now we need to give the \ncourt that reason to act.\n  As soon as we have enacted this amendment, the courts will take \nnotice and have reason to act. They will have a statutory basis for \nallowing immediate generic competition for Zantac and other drugs on \nthe market. As a result, we will see generic Zantac reach the market as \nquickly as possible at something like one-half of the price of \nbrandname Zantac.\n  So now we can see why Glaxo would have us believe we have plenty of \ntime to act. They want us to delay. Why not? Every day is an extra $5 \nmillion in their pockets, courtesy of the American consumer and the \nAmerican taxpayer. The companies opposed to our amendment are the very \nreasons why the courts are taking their time. But if we pass this \namendment, the courts will act expeditiously--no ifs, no ands, and no \nbuts.\n  Madam President, we must also remember that there are a dozen other \ndrugs affected by this GATT loophole, costing hundreds of millions of \ndollars more for the American consumer than they should. None of these \nproducts are affected by litigation, and all of these products would be \navailable much more rapidly as generics once the amendment is enacted.\n  Madam President, I mentioned the hearing held 2 weeks ago by the \nJudiciary Committee. The hearing did one thing and one thing only: It \nconfirmed what we already knew--that Congress made a mistake. After a \nyear of exhaustive review, discussion, and debate, we held a single 3-\nhour hearing and discovered once again that the Washington Post was \nright when they called this ``an error of omission.'' And the New York \nTimes was right once again when they wrote on the morning after the \nhearing that ``Glaxo's trade loophole'' should be closed.\n  Let me quote from that New York Times editorial:\n\n       Congress finds it hard to remedy the simplest mistakes when \n     powerful corporate interests are at stake. In 1994, when \n     Congress approved a new trade pact with more than 100 other \n     countries, it unintentionally handed pharmaceutical companies \n     windfall profits. More than a year later, Congress has yet to \n     correct this error.\n\n  And most recently, Madam President, on March 6th, the Des Moines \nRegister of Des Moines, IA, wrote that it is ``patent nonsense'' to let \nthis ``costly congressional blunder'' go uncorrected, which ``Congress \ncould correct in a jiffy.''\n  Let me conclude, Madam President, with the following observation: We \nhave a vast body of evidence at our disposal from the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services, \nthe Patent Office, and the Congressional\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\nRecord. That body of evidence shows that Congress made a mistake.\n  Today is our opportunity to correct that mistake--to spare the \nAmerican consumers unnecessary expenses and guarantee 100 percent \nequitable treatment for all American companies under the GATT treaty.\n  The alternative is to ignore the evidence--to choose to side with a \nfew drug companies. There were two Glaxo lobbyists actually testifying \nat last month's hearing.\n  They happened to disagree with the U.S. Government, with our U.S. \nTrade Representative, with our Patent Office, and many others.\n  I am asking today, on behalf of Senator Chafee, Senator Brown and \nmyself, for this body to consider the possibility that Glaxo has a deep \nfinancial interest in this issue and may not be as objective as four or \nfive executive agencies of our Federal Government.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is not a partisan choice. It never \nhas been. It is about fixing a mistake. It is about doing right. It is \nabout serving consumers. It is about taking on a special interest which \nhas entered this fight and making certain that the public interest \nprevails.\n  I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is 3:15. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is here ready to work. The leadership is \nworking to identify amendments that are going to be offered. There are \na couple of amendments that are pending that have been set aside, but \nit is our hope that those amendments will be acted on. If the Members \ndo not show up and offer their amendments, I would support the \nchairman's effort to go to third reading.\n  I think it is totally ridiculous that on Thursday afternoon at 3:15, \nSenators who have amendments on the list to be offered will not show up \nand offer their amendments. This is what makes the Senate look so bad. \nThat is why we wind up working at night, like nocturnal animals, \ninstead of human beings who work in the daylight.\n  Members will show up later on this afternoon and they will want to go \nhave supper with their families, they will want to keep commitments \nthey have made, they will want to see their children before they go to \nsleep, they would like to have a good night's sleep. They are not going \nto be able to do that because they will not show up and offer \namendments now, in the middle of the afternoon.\n  This is the kind of thing that leads to bad relationships between \nMembers, because they get exhausted. They do not do the work during the \nday, and then they try to do it at night.\n  I urge my colleagues, this is not a partisan thing, it is not a \nleadership thing, this is just an individual Senator saying: Please, \nlet us do our work. The committee staff and the committee leadership is \nhere, ready to work. Come over, bring your amendments, let us get some \ntime agreements, let us get our work done, let us move this bill \nthrough.\n  This is an embarrassment. We have been working on this omnibus \nappropriations bill since Monday. That is why we started on Monday, so \nwe could, hopefully, get it done. Do the Members want to be here next \nTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night doing the same thing?\n  I just make one last plea, I am not going to do it again today, that \nMembers come on over and bring their amendments and offer them now, or \nforever hold your peace. I hope the chairman, when these amendments \nthat are pending are completed--and I urge they be acted on shortly--\nthat we go to third reading. We have always threatened it, but we have \nnever done it. This would be a good one to give it a shot on.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3497 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  (Purpose: To restore funding for the Competitiveness Policy Council)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send an \namendment to the desk that has been cleared on both sides that does not \nappear on the list that we have adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes amendment numbered 3497 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                     COMPETITIVENESS POLICY COUNCIL\n\n\n                         Salaries and Expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Competitiveness Policy \n     Council, $100,000.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, during a previous time of trying to \nassimilate the various amendments, in the Judiciary and now, there was \na Bingaman amendment relating to the Competitive Policy Council in \nwhich Senator Daschle, the minority leader, and Senator Lott, as the \nassistant majority leader, had entered into an understanding, an \nagreement, in their attempt to reduce the number of amendments.\n  Unfortunately, there was a slippage of communication, and the staff \nat that time was not informed of this agreement. So we are now \nvalidating that which had been agreed to by Senator Daschle and Senator \nLott. It has no budgetary impact, but it does make good the commitments \nmade.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The amendment (No. 3497) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was adopted and move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD: Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3495\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment by the Senator from Utah to the \nsubstitute of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3495, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to clear the parliamentary \nsituation at this moment in order to make way for Senator Harkin by \nsending to the desk a modification of Senator Hatch's amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment as modified is as follows:\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n       On page 755, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n            TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n    EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE \n                               PRESIDENT\n\n                 OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY\n\n\n                         Salaries and Expenses\n\n                     (Including Transfer of Funds)\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses,'' \n     $3,900,000.\n\n                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES\n\n                    GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n                         Federal Building Fund\n\n                 Limitations on Availability of Revenue\n\n                              (Rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available for installment acquisition \n     payments under this heading in Public Law 104-52, $3,500,000 \n     are rescinded: Provided, That of the funds made available for \n     advance design under this heading in Public Law 104-52, \n     $200,000 are rescinded: Provided further, That the aggregate \n     amount made available to the Fund shall be $5,062,449,000.\n\n                        UNITED STATES TAX COURT\n\n\n                         Salaries and Expenses\n\n                              (Rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-52, $200,000 are rescinded.\n\n                               CHAPTER 12\n\n       On page 755, line 22, redesignate the section number, and\n       On page 756, line 8, redesignate the section number.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senators \nHatch, Shelby, and Grassley regarding the drug office. I strongly \nsupport the addition of $3.9 million to help our new Drug Director--\nGeneral McCaffrey--with the increased staff he needs. As my colleagues \nknow, I have the distinction of being the author of the law that opened \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy. It took more than a decade \nworth of effort to start this office--the Reagan administration opposed \nmy every effort to have a Drug Director. It was not until 1988 that \nthey finally relented.\n  Let me also offer a little history about why the Drug Office staff \nwas reduced in the first place. Under the previous administration, the \nDrug Office had become overrun with political appointees. Frankly, it \nbecame a political dumping ground with the greatest percentage of \npolitical appointees of any Cabinet agency. This was not the only \nreason for the reduction in staff, but it was the key reason I did not \noppose the reduction.\n  But, today we have a new Drug Director, an accomplished, impressive \ngeneral who has been tasked with the difficult job of bringing action \nto our national effort against drugs. The General has asked for, and \nthe President has formally requested, an additional $3.9 million to \nincrease the staff by 80 personnel.\n  Today, we are offered an amendment sponsored by Republican Senators \nthat provides what General McCaffrey requested. It is my hope that this \nsignals that my Republican colleagues will be as supportive of General \nMcCaffrey's future requests as they are of this one.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support additional \nfunding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy to cover certain \nsalary and expenses. The efforts by the new director, General \nMcCaffrey, to restore the effectiveness and credibility of that office \nmust be welcomed as a step in the right direction--at last. In \nsupporting this legislation, I am expressing my hope and that of many \nof my colleagues that the administration will now put the drug issue \nback into the picture of its policy priorities.\n  As many Members in both the House and Senate have remarked in the \nlast several years, we have seen little in the way of serious \nleadership or direction from the administration on this issue. Drug \npolicy sank without a trace almost from day one when the President \nfired virtually the whole of the drug czar's staff at that time. Lee \nBrown, his first incumbent, never had a chance. Without staff, without \nsupport, without credibility, he was left to languish in obscurity \nalong with drug policy. Now we are preparing to vote to restore funding \nto that office in order to reinstate the positions cut in 1993. I hope \neveryone appreciates the irony of this process. Nevertheless, if \nrestoring these positions will put us back on the track of serious and \nsustained narcotics control policies, then it is money well spent.\n  In doing this, however, we are engaging in an act of faith. We have \nseen no performance yet. What we are doing is investing in a \npossibility. It is an investment that I believe we must make, but we \nmust also expect sound performance in return. We need to see a renewed \nemphasis on drug policy. We need to see a renewed strategy linked to \nmeaningful and measurable performance criteria. We need to see a \nserious effort to promote drug policy on the Hill and with the American \npublic. We need a drug czar who will fight for drug policy even if that \nmeans embarrassing some of his fellow cabinet members.\n  I hope that this money will help do these things, and I for one will \nbe looking closely to see that we get a return on our faith.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Utah.\n  The amendment (No. 3495), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to and to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, what we have just done is very simple; \nthat is, that Senator Hatch had cleared the concept on both sides of \nthe aisle in terms of expanding the support for the drug czar. The \nquestion was on the offset. This is budget neutral. The money has been \noffset from GSA. That has also been cleared. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3498 To Amendment No. 3466\n\n (Purpose: To establish a fraud and abuse control program in order to \n                  prevent health care fraud and abuse)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes amendment \n     numbered 3498 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am back on the floor today to try to \nattack the problem I have spoken about many times over the years, a \nproblem I have been working on, first as chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee dealing with labor, health, human services, and education, \nand now as ranking member of that under the able leadership of Senator \nSpecter. I have been for years working on the waste, fraud, and abuse \nsituation, particularly as it pertains to the Medicare Program.\n  I have asked for and obtained over the last several years many \ninvestigations by the GAO and by the Inspector General's Office of HHS. \nQuite frankly, Mr. President, what they have come up with is just \nstartling. I am not going to take the time of the Senate here today. I \nhave spoken about this many times before on the Senate floor. Again, \nevery day that we put off attacking this problem and making the \nnecessary changes is a day that wastes, literally, hundreds of millions \nof dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse, money that is going out and not \ncoming back, money of our taxpayers that is being wasted.\n  How extensive is this, Mr. President? The General Accounting Office \nand others have estimated that up to 10 percent of health care \nexpenditures in Medicare is lost every year to fraud, waste, and abuse. \nWell, 10 percent of what? Medicare this year is spending about $180 \nbillion. So 10 percent of that is $18 billion. GAO has said about up to \nthat much is being lost every year.\n  As we know, we are trying to find some savings in Medicare to reach a \nbalanced budget, to make the Medicare\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\nsystem more secure, to make sure that it meets its obligations through \nthe next 7 years. Quite frankly, the trustees have said we need about \n$89 billion to do that over the next 7 years. Obviously, if we are \nwasting $18 billion a year and we are talking about 7 years, we are \ntalking about $126 billion going out for waste, fraud, and abuse during \nthat period of time.\n  Assuming that we cannot save every dollar, we cannot end every iota \nof waste and abuse--which I wish we could--if we could only save 60 \npercent of it, or 50 percent of it, we would be well on or way toward \nfinding that $89 billion.\n  Common sense dictates that waste, fraud, and abuse should be the \nfirst target of any responsible plan to reduce Medicare expenditures. I \nam pleased, on a bipartisan basis, the Appropriations Committee--and I \nespecially want to pay tribute to the good work of Senator Specter and \nour chairman, Senator Hatfield, for their help in doing this--the \nAppropriations Committee agreed to my amendment to this bill to restore \nthe cut in funding for the HHS inspector general to tackle this \nproblem.\n  The amendment I am offering today builds on that. It is very similar \nto an amendment I offered last year, I regret to say, unsuccessfully, \nto the budget reconciliation bill. However, we did get, I believe, 44 \nvotes on that, and I know that a lot of Senators I talked to since that \ntime now, I think, have a deeper appreciation for the magnitude of what \nwe are talking about in terms of waste and abuse. I am hopeful that we \nmight gain even more votes on this amendment yet.\n  This amendment I offer would significantly expand the abuse-fighting \nactivities that have been proven to save money, strengthen the \npenalties for committing fraud, cut waste in Medicare payments by \ninsisting on greater competition, as well as through the use of state-\nof-the-art private sector technologies. It would provide new incentive \nto consumers and providers to expose Medicare abuses and would reduce \nexcessive paperwork and duplicative forms.\n  Mr. President, this proposal just makes common sense. It would reduce \nthe budget deficit. The CBO estimated the nearly identical amendment I \noffered last year would have reduced the deficit by $4.8 billion over 7 \nyears. I am convinced, however, based on years of analysis by the GAO \nand the inspector general and others, that this would save much more \nmoney than that.\n  For example, every dollar invested in antifraud activities by the \ninspector general and the Justice Department results in significant \nsavings to taxpayers. I have a chart here to show that. Mr. President, \nthis is a chart showing the savings per employee.\n  From 1991 to 1995; this is from the inspector general's office, HHS: \nIf you take every employee, including the secretaries, that are in the \ninspector general's office, the savings per employee, 1991, was $4.8 \nmillion, and it has gone up to $9.7 million last year.\n  Now, talking about the savings per dollar spent. For every dollar we \nput into the inspector general's office last year, they returned $115 \nto the taxpayers of this country. Let me reemphasize that: For every $1 \nthat we put into the inspector general's office, they returned back--\nthis is real money; this is not phony money; this is money they \nactually brought back or stopped from being paid out--$115 they \nreturned to the taxpayers for every $1 we put into the inspector \ngeneral's office.\n  Yet their efforts to stop Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse are \nunderfunded. In addition, efforts to combat health care fraud and abuse \nare not coordinated adequately between Federal, State, and local \nagencies. As a result, many fraud schemes move from State to State to \navoid detection. I point out, Mr. President, because of the \nunderfunding of the inspector general's office, right now there are 24 \nStates in which there is no presence by the inspector general's office. \nNot only that, Mr. President, you wonder why there is so much waste, \nfraud, and abuse? Right now, less than 5 percent of the payments are \naudited. If you have 24 States in which there is not even an inspector \ngeneral's presence, and you only audit, say, 3 to 5 percent of the \nclaims, you can see the chances of being caught are pretty slim. That \nis why we need to invest more in fighting waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n  This amendment would change that by more than doubling our investment \nin fighting fraud and abuse. The Medicare trust fund would invest \ndirectly in these efforts, providing a stable, adequate source of \nfunding, and reaping a huge return in savings to Medicare.\n  The amendment would also require greater coordination of Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement efforts to combat health care fraud. \nAll agencies investigating health care fraud and abuse will share \ninformation and otherwise coordinate activities, since fraudulent \nschemes are often replicated in different health programs.\n  The fight against Medicare fraud and abuse is also limited by \ninadequate sanctions and loopholes in the law that make it easier for \noffenders to escape any penalty. This amendment would strengthen \nsanctions against providers who rip off Medicare. Those convicted of \nhealth care fraud and felonies related to controlled substances would \nbe kicked out of Medicare. Penalties for those found to have provided \nkickbacks, charged Medicare excessive fees, or submitted false claims \nor otherwise abusive activities--the penalties would be increased. \nMaximum fines would be increased from $2,000 to $10,000 for violation. \nIn addition, fines could be imposed on HMO's and other managed care \nplans for abusive activities. No such penalty exists under current law.\n  Mr. President, think about this: Right now the maximum fine if you \nsubmitted a false claim or otherwise abusive activities is $2,000. That \nis hardly an incentive for someone to stop this practice when they may \nbe filing false claims for thousands and thousands of dollars a year. \nAgain, Mr. President, a lot of times these claims come in, and if they \nare ever caught they just claim they made a mistake, just made a \nmistake. Well, the fines and penalties is just a slap on the wrist, and \noff they go.\n  I must tell you, Mr. President, after looking at this for the last \nalmost 7 years now, I am convinced that there is absolutely near zero \nkind of a sanction or a threat of sanction against anyone filing false \nclaims or abusive activities.\n  Lastly, right now a managed care plan that submits the claims for the \ngroup itself, right now, no fine or no such penalty can be imposed on \nthose HMO's, an invitation to raid the Medicare trust fund.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would also strengthen criminal remedies \navailable to combat health care fraud and abuse by creating a new \nhealth care fraud statute, authorizing forfeiture of property gained \nthrough the commission of health care fraud. Well, if we can have \nforfeiture of property for controlled substances, then if people commit \nfraud against the health care system and they gain property by doing \nso, we ought to have that right of forfeiture. It creates a criminal \nstatute prohibiting obstruction of criminal health care investigations \nand provides other legal tools to go after criminal health care fraud \ncases.\n  This is all in my amendment as a result of, as I have said, over 7 \nyears of investigations by my subcommittee and by the GAO and the \ninspector general's office. These hearings, along with the IG's office, \nhave repeatedly documented massive losses to Medicare due to excessive \npayments for equipment, services and other items.\n  For example, Medicare pays over $3,000 a year to rent portable oxygen \nconcentrators that only cost $1,000 to buy. Mr. President, I was on a \nradio program, a call-in radio show, as I am sure all of us do in our \nown States, WMT radio in Cedar Rapids, several weeks ago. I was talking \nabout this Medicare fraud and abuse. I had a caller call in. We found \nout who he was and we later got hold of him. He has been on an oxygen \nconcentrator now for 4 years. The rent has been $300 a month. Medicare \npays it. He has been on it for 4 years. Medicare pays $300 a month, or \n$3,600 a year for 4 years. They paid over $14,000 in rent. They could \nhave bought it for $1,000. That is the kind of abuses that are taking \nplace.\n  We found cases where Medicare is paying up to $2.32 for a gauze pad \nthat the Veterans Administration purchases for 4 cents. Also, a recent \nseries of reports by the HHS inspector general found that Medicare had \nbeen billed for such outrageous items as a trip to Italy to inspect a \npiece of sculpture, country club memberships for executives, golf shop \ngift certificates, and\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\nTiffany crystal pictures for executives. These items are not \nspecifically disallowed as indirect costs to Medicare. My amendment \ncloses that loophole.\n\n  That is a fact. Right now, an executive or health care provider can \ntake a trip, write it off, and have Medicare pay for it.\n  My amendment would also end Medicare's wasteful reimbursement \npractices with regard to durable medical equipment, medical supplies, \nand other items by requiring competitive bidding to assure Medicare \ngets the best price possible. This system has been successfully used by \nmany in the private sector and the Veterans' Administration.\n  For example, take the oxygen concentrator I just spoke about. While \nMedicare pays over $3,000 a year to rent it, the Veterans' \nAdministration pays less than half that much every year for the same \noxygen concentrators, many times from the same company, the same \nsupplier. Why? Because the Veterans' Administration engages in \ncompetitive bidding and Medicare does not.\n  When I tell audiences that in Iowa and other places around the \ncountry where I speak about this, they are dumbfounded. They say, you \nmean the Veterans' Administration puts out for competitive bids certain \nitems that Medicare does not? I say, yes, Medicare has no competitive \nbidding, none whatsoever, zero.\n  Well, now, it would seem to me that if you really want to have a \nreally conservative approach to this, what we ought to do is mandate \ncompetitive bidding, like the Veterans' Administration does. I want to \nmake this clear, also. Some people say, well, you cannot have \ncompetitive bidding because it would reduce the quality. Well, under my \nprovision, quality standards would have to be maintained and access \ncould not be reduced. In other words, we issue the quality standards \nand then say, OK, now you competitively bid on it.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why, after all of these \nyears, after all the documentation, after all the hearings and \ninvestigations that have gone on year after year, this Congress cannot \npass legislation mandating competitive bidding for Medicare. I tell my \naudiences that, and they do not believe it. They absolutely do not \nbelieve that Medicare does not engage in competitive bidding. Well, \nthey do not and, to this day, we have not mandated that they do so.\n  Last year, I finally got the Director of HCFA, Health Care Financing \nAdministration, who administers Medicare, to agree that, yes, they \ncould utilize competitive bidding and, yes, it could be implemented \nand, yes, it would save them money. So the head of the agency himself \nsays it will save them money. He says they can do it. Yet, this \nCongress will not let them do it.\n  So I say to people around America, if you are mad, if you are upset \nabout all the waste in Medicare, do not take it out on Medicare because \nthey are only doing what the Congress tells them to do. The Congress, \nso far, has told them you cannot engage in competitive bidding.\n  I must say, Mr. President, this really is the heart of this \namendment. It is the guts of this amendment. Oh, we can dance around \nthe edges, we can provide increased penalties, which we ought to do, \nand which this amendment does, and we can provide for more computers \nand software to catch these practices, and this amendment does that; \nbut if you adopted all those and still did not adopt competitive \nbidding, Medicare will be throwing billions of dollars away in wasteful \nspending because we would not be getting the best deal for the \ntaxpayer.\n  What would we do around here if the Defense Department did not engage \nin competitive bidding? What if they said they were going to go to \ncontractors and say, ``What do you want for this piece of military \nequipment?'' And the contractor says, ``I want $1,000.'' We say, ``OK, \nthat is what you will get.'' Now, if you think the stories about toilet \nseats that cost $600, and things like that which came up in the past \nare abusive, wait until you see some of the things that come out in \nMedicare.\n  Well, I have a device--and we do not show things like that on the \nfloor, but I have a blood glucose monitor, as small as the palm of my \nhand, which is used with people with diabetes; it tells them their \nglucose level. We found out Medicare is paying up to $211 for each one \nof these. I sent my staff to a local K-Mart, and they bought one for \n$49.99 Yet, Medicare is paying $211 for it. We got that one item \nstopped. It took a while to get it stopped. That will save about $25 \nmillion over 5 years. But that is just one item.\n  Mr. President, we also found, thanks to the good work of the GAO, \nthat while Medicare once led the health care industry in technology for \nprocessing claims and preventing waste and abuse, it has fallen way \nbehind. A recent report by the General Accounting Office found that, in \n1994, $640 million in improper payments could be prevented if Medicare \nhad employed commercially available detection software that is already \nused in the private sector.\n  In fact, many of the same insurers that administer Medicare use this \nsoftware to stop inappropriate payments for their private sector \nbusiness.\n  I had a witness testify before my subcommittee--I think it was last \nyear or the year before maybe. Their organization is the claims \nprocessor for Medicare in the Northwestern part of the United States. \nThey also process for their own individual claims--in this case with \nBlue Cross-Blue Shield. They told me that they have one set of software \nfor what they do privately and another set for what they do for \nMedicare. Yet Medicare will not adopt what they use on the private side \nto catch and stop these abusive payments.\n  This is a study that I had done. It came out in May 1995 from the \nGAO: ``Commercial Technology Could Save Billions Lost to Billing \nAbuse.'' Here is what it said. It said HCFA could save over $600 \nmillion annually by using commercial systems to detect code \nmanipulation. Also beneficiaries--the people themselves--would save \nover $140 million a year that they are paying out of pocket to this \ncode manipulation.\n  There are a lot of examples here of unbundling. Here is one where a \nphysician was paid for interpreting two xrays because he unbundled. He \nput it under two codes. He was paid $32. When the GAO investigated it, \nhe should only have been paid $16 rather than $32. That may not sound \nlike a bunch of money. But that is twice what he should have been paid, \nand multiply that by thousands and thousands every day throughout the \nNation it adds up to real money. The GAO came up with a lot of examples \nof this.\n  Let me say at the outset, is this doctor who submitted two charges \nwhen he should have only charged once being fraudulent? Maybe; maybe \nnot. It may have been an honest mistake on that doctor's part. Maybe \nthe nurse, or his assistant, or maybe his secretary, or his \nadministrator who takes care of his billing said, ``Well, he took one x \nray here and another x ray here. So that is two different things. So we \nwill apply under two different codes.'' It could have been an honest \nmistake. Yet, he got paid $32 when he only should have been paid $16. \nUsing commercially available software that we have on the market today \nthat would have been stopped. Blue Cross would not have paid that. They \nwould not have paid $32. They would have paid $16.\n  So, again, whether it is an honest mistake, or whether a fraudulent \nclaim, we need the software that will stop that.\n  I might point out that GAO found out that only 8 percent of doctors \nhad billed inappropriately--8 percent. So 92 percent of the doctors are \ndoing just fine. But the 8 percent are the ones that are really digging \ninto our pockets. That is why we need the software. So even if we \nadopted the software there would not be any impact on the vast majority \nof providers out there.\n  So, Mr. President, my amendment would require Medicare contractors to \nemploy this private sector commercial software within 180 days--6 \nmonths. What is the cost of this? GAO estimated the cost of doing this \nwould be $20 million the first year and savings of over $600 million--\nnot a bad deal for the taxpayers and for the beneficiaries under \nMedicare.\n  So, Mr. President, we know that Medicare beneficiaries and other \nhealth care consumers are the front line in detecting and reporting \nMedicare fraud and abuse. Currently though\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\nthey have little information and incentive to aggressively watch for \nand report such activities. Likewise the providers lack the incentives \nto report problems.\n  Let me relate what happened to me a couple of years ago. Shirley \nPollock's--a constituent of mine in Atlantic, IA--mother-in-law had \nbeen in a nursing home for a few weeks. And when she got the Medicare \nreport which said ``This is not a bill'' because Medicare paid the \nclaim. On that Medicare claim it reported that Medicare had paid for \nover $5,000 in bandages for about 3 weeks of nursing home care.\n  Shirley Pollock looked at this. Of course, it said, ``This is not a \nbill.'' She went to the nursing home, and said, ``I have been here with \nmy mother-in-law. I know she did not use $5,000 worth of bandages in 3 \nweeks.'' She was told, ``Do not worry about it. You do not have to pay \nit anyway.''\n  I tell you. If you want to get heads nodding if you ever go to a \nsenior citizens meeting, relate a story like that and you will see a \nlot of heads nod because the same things have happened to senior \ncitizens all over this country. They get the report of what Medicare \nhas paid. It says, ``This is not a bill.'' A lot of times they just \nthrow it away because it says ``This is not a bill.'' And if they ever \nquestion the payment they are told, ``Do not worry about it. You do not \nhave to pay it. Medicare pays it.''\n  Thank goodness for people like Shirley Pollock. She was not going to \ntake that for an answer. She said, ``Someone is paying it, and it is \nnot right.'' She got hold of my office. We looked into it, and found \nthat was right. They should never have paid that. So we got that taken \ncare of.\n  But there is not enough incentive out there for people to come \nforward like that.\n  So what my amendment does is make it easier for Medicare \nbeneficiaries to check their bills for errors--first of all, by giving \nthem assured access to itemized bills. It would also require that when \nbeneficiaries receive their statements from Medicare they are asked to \ncarefully review it, and to report any suspected problems to a listed \ntoll-free number.\n  Third, it would establish rewards of up to $10,000 for reports by \nconsumers that lead to criminal convictions for health care fraud and \nup to 10 percent of amounts recovered from abusive billings.\n  Three things: The first thing is itemization. I do not know how many \nof you have ever looked at a Medicare claim form; payment form. When \nthese things come into Medicare, no itemization is required. You do not \nhave to itemize. So a lot of the times, as GAO pointed out, Medicare is \npaying for things and they do not even know what is there.\n  So, Mr. President, let say you are a provider and you submitted a \nbill to Medicare for $1,000. You do not have to itemize what that \nthousand dollars is for. Medicare pays you. But you obviously have an \nitemized list someplace because it makes up $1,000. So if you, as a \nprovider, have the list, it would seem to me that itemized account \nought to also be made available to the consumer so the consumer can \nlook at it and see whether or not they got something. That ought to be \navailable to Medicare, too. I know some people say, well, this is more \npaperwork. The fact is that the provider who is putting a claim on \nMedicare for reimbursement already has to have that itemized list. With \nthe modern computers that we have that can read all this data, that is \nnot a problem at all.\n\n  One constituent of mine said, you know, it is like when you go to a \ngrocery store and you pile your cart full of groceries and you go \nthrough the checkout counter. What if they just added up all your \ngroceries and they gave you a bill and said, ``Here, your groceries are \n$83.50, but you don't get a an itemized list of what you bought.'' You \nwould not stand for it. So just as easy as it is for a checkout counter \nin a grocery store to give you a long list of everything you bought and \nthe number and how much it cost, the same thing could happen in \nMedicare for the services, the equipment and devices provided.\n  Second, a little bit of an incentive. There is nothing like a little \nbit of incentive, so we provide for up to a $10,000 reward for any \nperson who provides information that leads to a criminal conviction of \nhealth care fraud, and up to 10 percent of amounts recovered from \nabusive billings. So there would be an incentive in there for people to \ntake a very careful look at what they are being billed.\n  Mr. President, I have taken a lot of time, but I wanted to lay this \nout because this is a comprehensive plan to combat waste and abuse in \nMedicare and other health programs. It is a commonsense approach. I \nhope we can adopt it. It will save us money for the taxpayers. It will \nsave the Medicare trust fund money. It will save beneficiaries money \nbecause there is a lot of this money that is out of pocket that they \nhave to spend. I pointed out that GAO said that by having this new \ntechnology, it would save beneficiaries $140 million a year.\n  So any way you cut it, I believe this is an amendment that will help \nmake the Medicare system more sound, more secure, and save us in fraud, \nwaste, and abuse.\n  I do not know the disposition of the managers of the bill as to this \namendment. It is my understanding that if this amendment were adopted, \nit would be approved by the administration.\n  Yes, I just have had reassurance of that, that the administration \nwould accept these provisions. As I said, I have spent several years of \nsubcommittee investigations and my own time on this. There is nothing \nin this amendment that has not been carefully thought out and looked at \nby the Inspector General's Office, the Justice Department, the Health \nCare Finance Administration, and others to make sure that it will \nreally do the job. So I hope it can be adopted and sent down to the \nWhite House, whatever happens to this bill otherwise, and get it \napproved and save us a lot of money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just want to respond to what the \ndistinguished whip said about Members working on their amendments.\n  I have been, over the past 18 hours or so, working with members of \nthe Appropriations Committee, and Senator Hatfield and the staff have \nbeen very cooperative in trying to work on something that we can do to \naddress the concerns I have about disaster relief funds in this bill \nbeing declared an emergency and off budget and therefore adding to the \ndeficit. We are working and have been and will continue to work to try \nto come to some agreement where we can put this spending within the \ncontext of the budget laid out last year so we do not cause an increase \nin the deficit. I know everyone wants to work on that in good faith, so \nthis negotiation will continue. I wish to tell the Members and the whip \nthis is ongoing, and I am optimistic we will come to some favorable \nconclusion on that issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Harkin amendment the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Harkin amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3500 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n   (Purpose: Delete language concerning certification of population \n                               programs)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Dole, proposes an amendment numbered 3500.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 756, Title III--Miscellaneous Provisions, strike \n     section 3001, beginning on line 14 ``The President,'' through \n     line 25, ending ``such restrictions.''\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3498\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] has \npresented an amendment that deals with a mutual concern of issues.\n  I am grateful that the Senator put together a way to deal with these \nissues. The only problem is that under the current parliamentary \nsituation, this is an appropriations measure, and, as the Senator \nrealizes, out of this rather extensive amendment, which is almost 100 \npages, there is a lot of legislation in the amendment as well as \nearmarks relating to appropriations.\n  I would have to, probably, raise a point of order against the \namendment being considered on this vehicle. Both from the standpoint of \nour personal working relationship, that I treasure, and our mutual \ninterest that we share on so many of these issues, I would not like to \ndo that, and I would like to also assure the Senator that I am willing \nto cooperate and work with him to find some suitable alternative to \nthis particular vehicle. It is fragile enough, without adding more \nproblems to it, in terms of so much legislation.\n  So, I just say I deeply regret the situation I am in, but in order to \nmove this bill on through to a conference with the House and, \nhopefully, to the signature of the President, I wonder if the Senator \nwould consider the possibility of postponing this action to a time when \nwe could join together in partnership?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand. I do not want to add to the problems our \ndistinguished chairman has with this bill. I was hoping perhaps the \nFinance Committee and others would approve of this and let it go on \nthrough. As I said, I know it is authorization, but we have other \nauthorizing things that are in this bill, too. But I understand for \nsome reason there are some who do not want this on this bill. I had \nhoped we could have prevailed on this, but I understand the chairman's \nposition on this. I know he is in a position where he has to try to get \nthis bill through.\n  We do not want to hold it up any longer. We want to get it through as \nsoon as possible. There are some very important things in this bill, \nlike education and other things that we got in it, that I hope we can \nhold.\n  With the assurance of the chairman that perhaps we can find some \nother vehicle to get this thing through this year, Mr. President, I \nthen ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3498) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Let us put our \nstaffs together, sooner rather than later, to try to work out some \nstrategy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the existing unanimous consent limiting amendments, \nthat I be able to offer the D.C. Police amendment which was originally \na part of my drug czar's amendment. The floor manager and several \nMembers expressed their hope that this amendment would not be \nconsidered as part of the drug czar's amendment.\n  I understand it has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3499 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  (Purpose: To provide assistance to the District of Columbia Police \n                              Department)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3499 to amendment numbered 3466.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 18, insert the following: ``Provided further, \n     That no less than $20,000,000 shall be for the District of \n     Columbia Metropolitan Police Department to be used at the \n     discretion of the Police Chief for law enforcement purposes, \n     conditioned upon prior written consultation and notification \n     being given to the chairman and ranking members of the House \n     and Senate Committees on the Judiciary and Appropriations.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, do we have a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limitation on debate at this time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I had heard it might be acceptable to the other side \nto have 1 hour equally divided. That would certainly be appropriate and \nagreeable with me.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. We will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good \nfriend, has inserted language in the underlying bill which affects a \nprovision in the recently passed foreign operations bill. The very \nreason it only recently passed is because the foreign operations bill \nwas ping-ponged back and forth across the Capitol, between the House \nand the Senate, over a period of 3 or 4 months, during which we had \nnine different votes in the two Houses on the question of abortion.\n  I understand the concerns that Senator Hatfield has raised with \nregard to this provision. However, this is not a new topic of debate. \nIn trying to pass the foreign operations bill, as I just indicated, we \nvoted nine times on modifications, amendments, and variations of the \nlanguage that my good friend from Oregon is now attempting to change. I \nfear that his language, like earlier proposals, will simply reopen a \ncontentious debate in which Congress and the administration simply do \nnot agree. This is just an area of deep-seated disagreement.\n  Over on the House side, initially, Congressman Chris Smith and others \nsought restrictions on population funding that would assure none of our \nresources was used by institutions which carry out abortions. At no \npoint has anyone opposed supporting legitimate and voluntary family \nplanning services.\n  I believe the proposal put forward by Congressman Smith, which I \nincluded in my chairman's mark for the foreign operations bill, was \nreasonable. Our proposal would have had no adverse impact on the \navailability of family planning. But the administration objected to the \napplication of the so-called Mexico City standards on population \nprograms.\n  As a result, after months of debate and nine votes, we reached a \nstalemate. At the time of final passage, Senator Hatfield and I agreed \nthe entire issue was more appropriately dealt with by the authorization \ncommittees.\n  To encourage them to continue negotiations and reach a settlement of \nthis policy matter with the administration, we delayed the provision of \nany population funds until July 1, and at that point disbursed the \nfunds on a limited basis over the next 15 months.\n\n  Frankly, I continue to believe we have done the best possible job we \ncould under the circumstances. I have never been involved in a more \ndifficult legislative endeavor than trying to reach some kind of \ncompromise which the previously passed bill embodied.\n  I hope we take the view, at least for this fiscal year, that a deal \nis a deal. I think the language in the bill jeopardizes the commitment \nwe made to allow the authorization process to resolve the issue. I \nreally hope we will not reopen this matter today. I think we run the \nrisk of losing the entire omnibus resolution. I do not think the House \nis going to budge 1 inch on this issue.\n  So it seems to me we potentially put the omnibus--we actually do put \nthe\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\nomnibus appropriations bill in the very same position the foreign \noperations bill was in for months, stuck in a legislative ditch.\n  My good friend, the chairman of the full committee, certainly \nappreciates the issue, that issue, was an enormously complicated \nproblem. I know he has a big task in managing this 781-page bill. But I \nurge my colleagues, regardless of whether you consider yourself pro-\nlife or pro-choice, we finally struck a deal on the foreign operations \nbill which has already passed and was signed by the President, which \ncarries us through September 30. We finally, after nine votes, reached \na compromise. Nobody was particularly happy with it, but it is now the \nlaw. I hope we will not undo that compromise here, halfway through this \nfiscal year, and run the risk of putting this omnibus appropriations \nbill in the very same condition that the foreign operations bill was in \nin October, November, December, and January.\n  So, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment I have at the \ndesk. I think it will allow us to get past this issue. We are going to \nhave to deal with it again in next year's bill. We are already \nbeginning to develop the foreign operations appropriations bill for \nnext fiscal year, and this issue obviously is not going to go away. But \nwe have reached a compromise for the current year, and I hope we stick \nto that. We take the view that a deal is a deal, at least for this \nfiscal year.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the McConnell amendment, \nwhich, hopefully, we will be able to vote on sometime in the near \nfuture. Senator Dole, I might add, is a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I have really completed my remarks. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I want to echo my colleague's remarks, \nbecause we have an excellent working relationship. I think sometimes, \non highly emotional issues like this one--emotional on both sides of \nthe issue--that there is always a fear, with good friends differing on \nan issue, of rupturing a good friendship.\n  I want to assure the Senator from Kentucky I have no intention of \ndoing that. The Senator needed help on the Jordan funding system. We \nworked that out in the Appropriations Committee. The Senator has sought \nour help even today on this appropriations bill. We have been \nresponsive to that.\n\n  So whether we agree or disagree on this issue does not in any way \nimpair my concern and desire to help the Senator when he makes the \nrequest for help as chairman of the committee.\n  But I also at the same time am a little bit dismayed that my \ncolleague would move to strike this provision I have included in the \ncommittee substitute concerning international voluntary family \nplanning. I would like to review the history of this last year. Let me \nstate briefly where things stand.\n  First of all, let me say this is not a negotiated compromise. We, at \nno time--the Senate had no opportunity to negotiate this issue with the \nHouse. We were given this kind of approach, and it was that or nothing. \nSo this is not a negotiated settlement on this issue or even a \nprovision of this bill that has been worked out with the House.\n  In late January, when the Senate passed H.R. 2880 to keep the \nGovernment from shutting down, the bill included a provision \nrestricting the expenditure of funds for the International Family \nPlanning Program administered by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  Again, let me underscore, this so-called compromise was worked out on \nthe House side unilaterally and presented to us. Our choice was to \naccept it or to shut the Government down. If anybody remembers, I stood \non the floor of the Senate and apologized for having the Senate put in \nthis position.\n  As a result, we put forth our own bill, an original appropriations \nomnibus bill that is now before the Senate, because we were not going \nto be put into that situation of being handed a document of \ncontroversial issues and told, ``Take it or shut the Government down.'' \nAnd that is where we were.\n  The Senate has a right to have its views expressed, to have its views \ndebated, to have its views understood and negotiated with the House. \nThis is not a compromise. This is a unilateral demand of the House to \ntake it or shut the Government down, and we had no option. I want to \nmake that point clear.\n  The bill included a provision restricting the expenditure of funds \nfor the International Family Planning Program. These funds for \ninternational voluntary family planning were cut by 35 percent from \n1995 fiscal year levels. However, interestingly, listen to this, two \nfurther restrictions were added which ensured that no funds may be \nallocated, unless authorized, until July 1, 1996, and thereafter funds \nmay only be allocated each month in amounts no larger than 6.67 percent \nof the total.\n  This will effectively lead to an 85-percent cut in funding for fiscal \nyear 1996 because the authorizing committee failed to act on this \nmatter and has yet to act on this matter, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  They had a chance in a recent conference on the foreign aid \nreauthorization bill to act, and they did not act.\n  I want to say clearly that I am pro-life to the extent that I do not \nnecessarily have to have exceptions for rape and incest, because I \nbelieve that life begins at the point of implantation, not at \nconception. Over 50 percent of the eggs abort naturally at conception \nbefore they are implanted, and you have 10 days to 2 weeks to take care \nof that situation, even in rape and incest.\n  So I speak as a pro-life Senator. I have voted pro-life for more \nyears and more often probably than 90 percent of the other Members of \nthis Senate, because I have been here now almost 30 years.\n  I am pro-life as it relates to capital punishment, too, and I am pro-\nlife as it relates to war as well. But nevertheless, I am unabashedly \npro-life, and I come from a State that is the most pro-choice State in \nthe Union, by all surveys. In fact, it is so pro-choice that we had, \nthrough an initiative, an assisted-suicide proposal that passed in a \nvote of the people. So if we did not get them zapped in the womb, we \ncan zap them at the other end of the lifespan.\n  But nevertheless, that is the character of my State. We have the \nlowest church membership per capita of any State in the Union. We have \nthe highest percentage of atheists per capita of any State in the \nUnion, according to the New York University religious survey.\n  I am just stating the political environment from which I come. You, \nobviously, can understand this is carried into my political elections \nas a handicap. I stand unashamedly as a pro-life Senator.\n  But let me say this. There are ways to reduce abortion and the demand \nfor abortion, and that is contraception. ``Family planning'' is perhaps \na more subtle way to express it. I think anybody who has had biology \n101 understands why. So I will not go into the details of how this \nreduces the demand for abortion. It is pretty obvious.\n  Therefore, it seems to me when we make available family planning \ndevices and contraception abroad in those countries that do not have \naccess and that are experiencing the continued population explosions \nthat are going to impact not just their country but the whole world, we \nhave an opportunity to deal with a cause rather than just the effect. I \nthink after the period of time that this bill has been bouncing around, \nwe even have more ramifications and we have more evidence of why this \nposition is a valid position.\n  A very recent methodological summary, put together by a coalition of \ngroups, including the Alan Guttmacher Institute, estimates that this \nrestriction on funding will lead to 1.9 million unplanned births and \n1.6 million more abortions. These figures have been attacked by groups \nsuch as the Population Research Institute, an arm of the pro-life Human \nLife International, which claims that the Alan Guttmacher Institute is \nfunded by Planned Parenthood and, thus, cannot be trusted to give \naccurate numbers, though it ironically cites the Guttmacher statistics \nto support its own assertions.\n  Now, you cannot have it both ways. If you say this is not a credible \ninstitute in making the studies on one hand, you cannot turn around and \ncite their statistics to prove your case on\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\nanother question that relates to abortion. That is precisely what the \nPRI has done.\n  But listen to this. The PRI's, Population Research Institute, a pro-\nlife organization, most recent study states that the actual number of \nunplanned births resulting from a 35-percent cut in funding will be \n500,000, and they further estimate that there will be 450,000 more \nabortions as a result of the cuts.\n  Now, is that not interesting? If you take the Guttmacher estimate, it \nis a higher level. But even the PRI studies show, yes, it will not be \n500,000, or as Guttmacher says it will not be a million, but it will be \n450,000.\n  PRI goes on to argue that they believe other countries will donate \nmore funds to make up for the lack of United States contributions.\n  In effect, they are saying, we, in a way, are going to answer this \nproblem in the United States by asking other countries to increase \ntheir contributions. However, using PRI's own numbers, this would \nresult in 129,000 more abortions, hardly negligible, as PRI claims, \n129,000 more abortions. In my view, whether the number is 1.6 million, \n450,000 or 129,000 makes little difference. Even one more abortion is \none too many.\n  That is why I cannot understand why my colleagues who say they are \npro-life would object to the provision that I have included in this \ncommittee substitute.\n  This provision states the following:\n\n       Sec. 3001. The President may make available funds for \n     population planning activities or other population assistance \n     pursuant to programs under title II and title IV of the \n     Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, . . . notwithstanding the provisions of \n     section 518A of such Act, if he determines and reports to the \n     Congress that the effects of those restrictions would be that \n     the demand for family planning services would be less likely \n     to be met and that there would be a significant increase in \n     abortions than would otherwise be the case in the absence of \n     such restrictions.\n\n  Bear in mind, we have not put language in here that automatically \nmakes that money available to family planning. The President has to \ncertify that there is a relationship between the absence of that money \nor the great reduction of that money and as a result more abortions.\n  So for those, again, who are concerned that perhaps we are just \ngiving the President more money to spend, there is that restriction in \nthis provision. Let me repeat, funds would be made available only if \nthe President certifies there would be a significant increase in \nabortions as a result of these restrictions.\n  Honestly, I cannot believe that anyone who claims to be pro-life and \nopposed to abortion would support a funding restriction that may lead \nto increases in abortions. If the President makes a certification that \nthe action taken by Congress will lead to an increase in abortions, I \nwould expect every Member in Congress who takes a pro-life stand to act \nto reverse this horrible result. To oppose the committee position makes \nno sense to me at all.\n  We can argue the merits of family planning until we are blue in the \nface. I believe the evidence proves that international voluntary family \nplanning programs have contributed to reducing unplanned pregnancies \nand abortions worldwide. I can give you some recent examples of where \ninternational voluntary family planning has made a difference \nspecifically. In Hungary, where voluntary family planning services were \nintroduced 8 years ago, the abortion rate has dropped by 60 percent and \ncontinues to fall. Although programs in the Newly Independent States \nand in Russia, where the average woman--listen to this--the average \nwoman has between four and eight abortions during her lifetime, are too \nnew to make reliable calculations, similar success is expected, or was \nbefore the funding cuts.\n  Mr. President, I stated in this Chamber on February 6:\n\n       The family planning language included previously in H.R. \n     2880 is not prolife, it is not prowoman, it is not prochild, \n     it is not prohealth, and it is not profamily planning. It \n     inflicts the harm of a profound misconception on the very \n     poor families overseas who only ask for help in spacing their \n     children through contraception, not abortion.\n\n  The statistics provided by the Alan Guttmacher Institute prove this, \nand those from the Population Research Institute fail to refute it. \nTherefore, I implore my colleagues, especially those who take a pro-\nlife position, to carefully examine the language I have introduced in \nthis bill. If you are opposed to abortion or in favor of family \nplanning, you should vote to oppose the McConnell motion to strike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, we have visited and revisited this \nissue many times. We struggled with the House of Representatives over \nthis issue for 3 frustrating, unproductive months, and we could not \nresolve it. We finally agreed to let the matter be resolved in the \nauthorizing legislation. Why then, as some of my colleagues are asking, \nwould Senator Hatfield choose to reopen the debate in the current \nlegislation? I suggest, Mr. President, for two very important reasons:\n  First of all, the authorizers punted. They did not address the issue \nin the authorizing language. Thus, we are left with an authorizing bill \nthat was reported out of conference which does not address this issue. \nThis part of the compromise, which we added to the last CR, was not \nfulfilled.\n  Second, the language that Senator Hatfield has added to the current \ncontinuing resolution is sound policy. As he has just so eloquently \nstated, the simple, honest truth is that maintaining effective family \nplanning programs is the best hope we have of limiting abortions. It is \nan elementary equation, I believe, that contraception does reduce \nabortions.\n  Mr. President, arguments to the contrary are just misinformed. We \ncannot prevent abortions worldwide by preventing women from having \naccess to the very information and services that enable them to prevent \nunplanned pregnancies.\n  I applaud my friend from Oregon for his thoughtfulness on this issue. \nSenator Hatfield is not an advocate of abortion rights, and yet he \nauthored the provision in the omnibus budget bill that Senator \nMcConnell is trying to strike out.\n  Why would a Senator who does not support abortion take the lead on \nrestoring funding for international population assistance programs? It \nis because Senator Hatfield judiciously realizes the most effective way \nwe can use our budget dollars is to prevent abortions and to promote \neffective, safe, and comprehensive pregnancy-prevention services.\n  Senator Hatfield's provision restores funding for population-\nassistance programs if the President determines that cutting this \nfunding would increase the number of abortions being performed. If you \nare against abortions, it seems to me, Mr. President, you must be for \nSenator Hatfield's language.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would like to thank the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nPresident, for her very astute and calmly stated remarks on a very, \nvery tough issue. I appreciate her contribution.\n  Mr. President, this is a unanimous-consent agreement that is cleared \non both sides. I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour for debate \non the pending McConnell amendment, to be equally divided in the usual \nway, and that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment, \nand that no amendment be in order to the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, too, would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Oregon for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, yet again, the Senate is debating funding and \nrestrictions on the international family planning account. In many ways \nit is a debate I cannot understand, for the supporters of this \namendment are only ensuring\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\nthat the incidence of abortion worldwide will increase, and that is a \ntrend that would disappoint and trouble every single Member of this \nbody. Mr. President, I rise to oppose strongly this amendment, that is, \nthe amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, and to support Senator \nHatfield's very reasonable and practical provision on population in the \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  My colleagues are all familiar with the difficult disagreements that \nhave ensued this year over the U.S. population program. For months now, \nthe Senate and House have lobbed amendments back and forth concerning \nwhat restrictions should be placed on family planning assistance in our \nforeign aid program. Unfortunately, as I have always argued, the debate \nin Congress has almost always been perilously miscast, as it is miscast \nagain today. This is not, as some have portrayed it, a debate about a \nwoman's right to abortion. The law has been on the books, Mr. \nPresident, since 1973, unchallenged, that U.S. assistance cannot be \nused to finance abortions.\n  That is the law. That is the way it has been for 23 years. The \nproblem we are addressing here is access to family planning services. \nThe only connection this has to abortion is that more widespread \nvoluntary family planning will reduce the number of abortions \nworldwide. That is a goal that everybody, I think, without question, \nshares.\n  The genius of the Hatfield provision is that it spells this out \nclearly and precisely. It says that if the President cannot determine \nthat our population program does not reduce the incidence of abortion, \nthen the restrictions laid out in the continuing resolution passed in \nJanuary will go into effect.\n  Mr. President, there is an ironic and dangerous twist to this debate. \nThe opponents of the Hatfield language seem to be caught up in a \nshortsighted goal to advance what is both an isolationist and \nantiabortion agenda. This is based on the somewhat perverse assumption \nand wrong assumption that population assistance increases the incidence \nof abortion.\n  Mr. President, we will take a look at how wrong that reasoning is. \nOver 100 million women worldwide, and who knows how many couples, do \nnot use family planning because they do not have access to basic health \ncare. One out of five of the women will undergo unsafe abortions. \nStatistics indicate that some will die. Some will be disabled. Some \nwill never be able to bear children again. Some may deliver babies that \nhave no chance of leading a healthy life.\n  The U.S. population program educates women and couples about family \nplanning and increases access to contraception and basic health care. \nMr. President, it saves women's lives. It is a life saver. Why would we \nwant to cut that account by 85 percent or deeper than any other foreign \naid account as currently written in January's continuing resolution?\n  For example, Mr. President, in Africa, 1 out of every 21 women die as \na result of complications of pregnancy. That is roughly 200 times the \nrate for European women. Mr. President, African women deserve the right \nto family planning. Their lives depend on it. Their nation's \ndevelopment depends on it. The countries of the former Soviet Union, \nincluding Russia, where women have no sustained access to family \nplanning and virtually no access to any quality contraception, the \naverage woman undergoes nine abortions in her lifetime. An average of \nnine abortions in those places where people do not have access to \nfamily planning.\n  Our population programs in Russia and throughout Africa are designed \nto reduce the rate of abortion. There is no rational justification to \ncut these programs.\n  Mr. President, it is a well-documented fact that when couples have \naccess to family planning, the incidence of abortion goes down. That is \nthe whole confusion in this debate. If you want to increase abortion, \nsupport the McConnell amendment and the language of a January \ncontinuing resolution; if you want to really and truly reduce the \nincidence of abortion, as I do, and if you oppose abortion outright as \nSenator Hatfield does, then the population program is one of the most \nimportant foreign aid accounts we have. Family planning simply stated \nis an important part of the solution to abortion.\n  If this is not true, then the President cannot report it. Under the \nHatfield language, the population program would be reduced. I think \nthis is really a very good compromise, for if population programs do \nnot reduce the incidence of abortions, then I agree, we should \nreexamine them.\n  Mr. President, fact, statistics, logic and United States national \ninterest dictate that the population program is an essential \ncornerstone of our goal of global development. I urge the defeat of the \nMcConnell amendment. I sincerely thank the Senator from Oregon not only \nfor his courage but also for his wisdom in crafting the underlying \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation on \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is limited to one hour, 30 minutes each \nside.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator from Oregon yield me 4 or 5 minutes?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the foreign operations conference report, \nwhich was signed into law on February 12, categorically prohibits the \nuse of any funds for abortion. It also prohibits the use of any funds \nin China.\n  But that legislation contains a provision that was inserted by the \nHouse at the behest of the right-to-life lobby, which will cut funding \nfor voluntary, international family programs by one-third.\n  Those family planning programs have one purpose--to give couples in \ndeveloping countries the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce \nthe number of abortions. The funds are used to purchase and distribute \ncontraceptives, to improve the quality and safety of contraceptives, to \neducate couples about spacing the births of their children, and \nmaternal and child health.\n  Why anyone would be against that is a mystery to me, but that is what \nthe House did. And because they recessed immediately afterward, the \nSenate had no opportunity to amend it. We were presented with the \nchoice of closing down the Government again, or accepting the House \nprovision word for word.\n  Anyone who wants to see fewer abortions, and fewer women die from \nbotched abortions, should deplore what the House did, and support the \nHatfield language in this bill.\n  The House provision would prohibit the obligation of any family \nplanning funds before July 1 unless they are specifically authorized.\n  The whole purpose of that provision was to give an incentive to the \nauthorizing committees to resolve the Mexico City issue. We were told \nthat was what they wanted--an opportunity to resolve it themselves.\n  But the authorization conferees hardly discussed the issue. In fact, \nthey specifically decided not to authorize these programs. In one of \nthe more hypocritical maneuvers I have seen in a long time, the House \nauthorizers revealed that their real agenda is to destroy the \ninternational family planning program.\n  Without an authorization, the House provision says that only 65 \npercent of the fiscal year 1995 level for family planning may be \nobligated, and then only at the rate of 6.7 percent per month.\n  What will be the effect of the House provision? According to \nconservative estimates: 7 million couples in developing countries who \nhave used modern contraceptives, will be left without access to them; \nthere will be 4 million more unintended pregnancies; 1.9 million more \nunplanned births; 1.6 million more abortions; 8,000 more women dying in \npregnancy; and 134,000 more infant deaths.\n  Mr. President, that would be unforgivable, particularly since it is \nentirely avoidable.\n  The United States has been the world's leader in the effort to \nstabilize population growth. Tens of millions of people are born into \nterrible poverty each year. Anyone with an ounce of sense knows that if \nwe make it harder for people to avoid pregnancy, the result will be \nmore abortions, not less.\n  The Hatfield language ensures that that will not happen. It would \nprevent the House provision from going into affect if the President \ndetermines that it would result in significantly more abortions.\n  Every Senator, whether pro-life or pro-choice, should support the \nHatfield\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nlanguage, and oppose this amendment. I want to commend Senator Hatfield \nfor his leadership on this, and for his determination to correct this \nproblem. He is solidly pro-life, but he is also a stalwart supporter of \nfamily planning because he knows what family planning is the way to \nreduce abortions.\n  That is what we all want, and why all Senators should vote to keep \nthe Hatfield language in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a two newspaper \neditorials which are representative of dozens of similar editorials \nfrom around the country expressing strong support for Senator \nHatfield's position, be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 12, 1996]\n\n                         Family Planning Fiasco\n\n       The continuing resolution that brought government workers \n     back to the job last January is due to expire at the end of \n     the week. One of the matters that must be settled before that \n     can be done is the future of American assistance to family \n     planning efforts abroad. This has nothing to do with \n     abortion, since no U.S. funds can be spent outside the United \n     States for that purpose. Rather, what is at stake is this \n     country's extremely valuable and long-supported work in the \n     developing world to provide couples with information and \n     materials needed to plan the spacing and total numbers of \n     their children.\n       In January, one regular appropriations bill was attached to \n     the continuing resolution by the House. It cut international \n     family planning money 35 percent below 1995 levels, and it \n     put two additional restrictions on these expenditures: \n     Nothing can be spent before July 1, and thereafter the funds \n     would be doled out at the rate of 6.7 percent a month until \n     the new fiscal year begins on October 1. This amounts to an \n     effective cut of 85 percent in a single year, which is a \n     terrible idea. Sen. Mark Hatfield, chairman of the \n     Appropriations Committee, has put a saving clause in the \n     pending bill that would allow the president to spend \n     appropriated funds without these two restrictions if he can \n     demonstrate that they will have the effect of reducing demand \n     for family planning services and lead to a significant \n     increase in abortions. That won't be hard to do. An effort \n     will be made, probably today, to strike the Hatfield language \n     and retain the restrictions.\n       The united States contributes about 17 percent of all \n     public funds spent on family planning in the developing world \n     outside China, which does not receive this kind of aid. \n     Various organizations have made estimates on what would \n     follow a cut of 85 percent--how many unplanned children would \n     be born, how many women would die in childbirth or having \n     abortions, for instance. Predictably, these figures have been \n     challenged by others who believe that the poorest people in \n     the world will simply buy their own contraceptives or remain \n     abstinent. But the exact numbers don't matter, for the damage \n     will be severe. American foreign aid has been instrumental in \n     the developing world's increasing family planning success. \n     This, in turn, has spurred economic progress and brought \n     about tremendous improvement in the health and welfare of \n     women and children in recipient countries. Legislators more \n     interested in pleasing an extreme slice of the American \n     electorate than in saving lives and reaching out to the poor \n     of the world should not be allowed to succeed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Portland, Press Herald, Mar. 12, 1996]\n\n             Senate Should Protect Needed International Aid\n\n       The abandoned baby girls pictured here testify eloquently \n     to the need for U.S. support of voluntary international \n     family planning programs.\n       A key vote on that support is expected in the Senate today.\n       The babies shown here, abandoned in India, are far from \n     alone. World population expands by nearly 100 million people \n     a year. Ninety percent are born in developing countries. \n     Countless are desperately poor and unwanted.\n       Family planning programs, long supported by U.S. aid, \n     provide assistance that can break the desperate cycle. They \n     give families the power to plan. They do not provide \n     abortions. U.S. law has forbidden use of foreign aid funds \n     for abortion for two decades.\n       Even so, opponents continue to attack the funding on that \n     basis. That's why the Hatfield Amendment coming before the \n     Senate is so important. It would enable the president to \n     override restrictions, now in place on family planning aid if \n     he can report to Congress that they unwisely ``will result in \n     significantly more abortions, as well as a greater unmet need \n     for family planning services.''\n       That is an amendment in the best interest of everyone \n     involved.\n       The Senate should approve it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On behalf of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], I \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine, [Ms. Snowe].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nyielding me this time to speak on this very important issue.\n  I regret that the Senate is in a position to address this issue once \nagain because the Senate has spoken on many occasions in support of \ninternational family planning. So I think it is unfortunate that we are \nhere today to have to fight an amendment that, basically, would \ndecimate family planning support by the U.S. Government on behalf of \ninternational family planning programs around the country.\n  I think everybody knows that the United States has traditionally been \na leader in international family planning assistance. This has been the \ncase ever since this issue rose to international prominence with the \n1974 U.N. Population Conference in Bucharest. At that time, a number of \nThird World developing countries perceived family planning as a Western \neffort to reduce the power and influence of Third World countries.\n  It is a sad irony that we are here today because the U.S. Government \nbecame a leader on this issue to influence the Third World countries, \nto insert themselves into the developing family planning programs. They \nhave done that. We have been a traditional leader in international \nfamily planning and have had unrivaled influence worldwide for setting \nstandards for these programs. An estimated 50 million families around \nthe globe use family planning as a direct result of U.S. leadership and \npopulation assistance programs. Now we are confronted with the idea of \nbasically eliminating any U.S. support for U.S. international family \nplanning programs.\n  The passage of the continuing resolution back in January came at a \nterrible price to these programs. After the date of July 1, funding may \nbe provided at 65 percent of the 1995 level, appropriated on a monthly \nbasis at 6.5 percent for 15 months.\n  As a result, U.S. population assistance expenditures could drop from \n$547 million last year to only $72 million during 1996. This means a \nloss of revenue to the program of $475 million, or a cut of 85 percent \nin funding for 1996.\n  Senator Hatfield, who has been a champion in fighting for \ninternational family planning assistance programs throughout his \ncareer, included language in the omnibus appropriations bill that would \nrestore the funding. The Hatfield provision would nullify the funding \ncuts in the continuing resolution. If not, this will lead to a \nsignificant increase in abortion. Senator McConnell is offering an \namendment that would basically strike the Hatfield language and \npreserve the cuts contained in the continuing resolution. This will \nhave a devastating impact on women, children, and families all over the \nglobe, particularly in the developing countries. The Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute, and other respected research institutions, predict that as a \nresult of these cuts, at a minimum, 7 million couples in developing \ncountries who would have used modern contraceptives will be left \nwithout access to family planning. Four million more women will \nexperience unintended pregnancies.\n  We can expect 1.9 million more unplanned births; 1.6 million more \nabortions and countless miscarriages; 8,000 more women dying in \npregnancy and childbirth, including those from unsafe abortions; and \n134,000 infant deaths.\n\n  So let us make very clear what the impact of the McConnell amendment \nwill be. It will result in more abortions, more women dying, and more \nchildren dying. It appears to be incongruous-- in fact, it is \ninconceivable--that opponents of abortions would support cuts to family \nplanning which would result, undoubtedly, in many more abortions, \nparticularly because current law prohibits the use of any U.S. \npopulation assistance funds for abortion-related activities.\n  So this debate should not be about the fact that population \nassistance programs support abortion. They do not. In fact, they reduce \nthe incidence of abortions worldwide. So the issue is not about \nencouraging abortion. It is about preventing unwanted pregnancies and \npreventing abortions, and because of the continuing resolution, \norganizations that provide family planning services with American funds \nare already determining which of their programs will have to be cut or \neliminated. A local affiliate of International\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nPlanned Parenthood in Brazil estimates that 250,000 couples who rely on \nits services will lose access to family planning and related health \ncare. In Peru, a country that is among the poorest in Latin America and \nwhere 90 percent of women surveyed say they want to prevent or delay \nanother pregnancy, more than 200,000 couples will lose services.\n  Families in these extremely poor countries cannot afford to lose this \nvital U.S. family planning assistance. But this will become a certainty \nshould the Senate pass the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been a model nation on \ninternational family planning programs, and other countries look to our \nleadership and to our example. The implications of these reductions in \nU.S. aid contained in the continuing resolution are far broader than \none might think. If other countries follow our lead, the impact will be \ndevastating to the health of women and families of developing nations. \nIronically, last Friday, March 8, was International Women's Day. Is \nthis the gift that Congress will bequeath to the women around the world \nin honor of International Women's Day? Greater poverty? Increased \nmaternal death? More abortions? Increased infant death?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the McConnell amendment because \nhanging in the balance are lives around the world. I hope we will not \nwant to set this kind of example for other countries with respect to \nthis very critical program if we are going to do everything that we can \nto reduce the explosion in population growth in other countries, and \nparticularly in the developing world. The increase in population alone \nworldwide was 100 million, the greatest increase ever, and that is not \nthe direction we want to take. In fact, the United States ought to take \nthe leadership and reject the McConnell amendment and support Senator \nHatfield's provision.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, again, I join with my colleagues in encouraging \ncolleagues to vote for the Hatfield provision.\n  In the final days of January, in an effort to avert a third \nGovernment shutdown, this body passed by unanimous consent a continuing \nresolution which included a provision that will decimate international \nfamily planning programs. After studying this provision more closely, \nwe now know that the effects will be far greater than was known at the \ntime the Senate acted on the bill.\n  We are currently in the sixth month of the fiscal year. \nUnfortunately, we are living under an extraordinary reduction in family \nplanning funding. In fact, it has received no funding from any \ncontinuing resolution since October 1, 1995. As we know, the January \ncontinuing resolution prohibits any funding for family planning until \nJuly 1. Beginning in July, the program will be funded at a level \nreduced 35 percent from the 1995 funding level, to be allocated on a \nmonth-by-month basis for the next 15 months. So, in effect, you really \nhave a reduction that is catastrophic.\n  Mr. President, in dollar figures, the family planning program has \nbeen cut from $527 million in 1995 to $72 million in 1996, which is an \n85-percent cut in 1 year. One can only conclude that that cut is not \njust a cut to try to reduce overall spending commensurate with the \nother reductions in the budget; it is punitive, purposeful, and it is \nwrong. Fortunately, in the continuing resolution before us today--the \n10th continuing resolution and I certainly hope the last funding bill \nwe are going to debate in 1996--we have the opportunity to reverse \nthose cuts and restore critical funding for these vital family planning \nprograms.\n  I congratulate Senator Hatfield for his efforts to try to do this and \nexpress my very firm support and conviction that the international \nfamily planning programs are in our best interest and do not have to do \nwith abortion. To the degree that any arguments about abortion enter \ninto this debate, it is a preventive measure. I think everybody has \nspoken to the fact that this planning money will reduce abortions and \navoid a catastrophic situation which will only result in a great deal \nmore abortions than we would want.\n  Funding for these programs is an investment that will save the lives \nof thousands of women and prevent millions of unplanned births and \nabortions in the future. These programs ensure that mothers all over \nthe world are going to give birth to, more often than not, healthy \nbabies, and that the competition for resources in our world is not even \nmore severe for those babies who are born into it because of continued \nsignificant overpopulation problems.\n  I joined Senator Simpson in representing the United States at the \n1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, \nwhere the United States went to great lengths to play a leadership role \nin galvanizing the international community to action on this issue. The \nconference called for a global effort, which we signed onto, which we \nhelped lead, and which the Vatican signed onto, to help address the \noverpopulation and to work together to promote maternal and child \nhealth care, as well as educational opportunities for women and for \ngirls, and, most importantly, family planning programs. After pledging \nto provide world leadership in the area of international family \nplanning, we should not now abandon our global partners at this \njuncture.\n  Mr. President, I again want to just emphasis what I think we must \nunderstand and underscore in this debate. Family planning does not mean \nabortion. In fact, family planning has been proven to rule out the \nincidence of abortion through education and contraception. Family \nplanning programs help women and families living in impoverished \ncountries to begin childbearing at a later stage of life, to space \ntheir children apart, and to avoid unwanted pregnancies. The issue of \nhelping families to better plan for children is in the interest of \neverybody on this planet.\n  In addition, Federal law, now in effect, prohibits the United States \nfrom funding any abortions abroad. The U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment has widely and strictly abided by that law. Those who argue \nthat international family planning programs fund abortions are simply \nwrong, and they argue in contravention of the law of the United States.\n  Mr. President, by denying people access to the family planning \nprograms worldwide and by slashing their funding, there will be an \nestimated 4 million more unintended pregnancies, close to 1 million \ninfant deaths, tens of thousands of deaths among women--and I \nemphasize, for those who oppose permitting women to choose abortion as \nan alternative--that the result of cutting this money will create 1.6 \nmillion more abortions. I think none of us want to encourage that \nabortion.\n  So, Mr. President, I simply say that these programs provide 17 \nmillion families worldwide with the opportunity to responsibly plan \ntheir families, to responsibly space their children, to provide a \nbetter life for those children, to provide for healthy children, and to \navoid adding to a population problem that hurts all of us and hurts the \nunborn generation even more severely.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the McConnell amendment which \nis counter to all of our interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose the pending amendment. I believe \nSenator Hatfield and the Appropriations Committee have recommended a \nvery prudent policy with respect to international family planning \nassistance. To strike the language as they have proposed--as the \npending amendment would do--I think would be a very serious mistake.\n  On Thursday of last week, I spoke in this Chamber about the severe \nrestrictions the current continuing resolution places on U.S. funding \nfor international family planning. If these restrictions remain in \nplace, I too, fear that abortions will come to be regarded as the only \nform of birth control in many desperately poor developing nations.\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\n  I know some of my colleagues would prefer that we not raise such an \nunpleasant prospect, but this is exactly what will occur. As family \nplanning services become less accessible, more unwanted pregnancies and \nmore abortions will be the inevitable result.\n  The language in the bill before us simply stipulates that the \nrestrictions on family planning assistance will be lifted if it is \ndetermined that they will result in a significant increase in abortions \nand a greater unmet need for family planning services. It surely seems \nto me that those who are eternally concerned about the practice of \nabortion--and we all should be--would be eager to embrace this or any \nother policy that helps to reduce the number of abortions that are \nactually performed.\n  That is where we are. It is an extraordinary thing through the years \nfor me--and, yes, I am pro-choice on abortion, and, yes, I believe that \nmen should not even vote on the issue. That is my view. I have held it \nfor many a year. And I respect those on other side of the issue. It is \na deeply personal issue in every sense--an intimate personal issue, and \nnot one of us will ever change our opinion.\n  If you can reflect on why we are not getting things done in the \nappropriations area, you might reflect that four appropriations bills \nhave been stalled continually on the issue of abortion. Let us just \nvote up or down somewhere along the line about once a year on abortion, \nand then move on instead of hanging on, tacking it on, driving us all \nto an emotional and tattered edge continually. That is what we do with \nthe issue, and we are all good at it.\n\n  The population of the Earth has doubled since 1940--since the \nbeginning of mankind to 1940. Since 1940 until 1996, the population of \nthe Earth has doubled. If anybody can believe and tell me how it \ndoubles again in the year 2067, how the resources of the Earth can \nsustain human beings who will be starving, who will be out of water, \nfood, clothing, timber, just because of how many footprints will fit on \nthe Earth, and then what legacy have we left but poverty and starvation \nand all the rest--which to me is really a remarkably bizarre result. \nThat is where we are.\n  So, I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Hatfield and all of those who \nadmire him in all things that he does to try to bring reason and \nresponsibility to all of our debates and good common sense.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. President, before he is recognized, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter from the Department of State \nrepresenting the administration's viewpoint on this particular issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's strong and unqualified support for your \n     efforts to remedy the severe limitations imposed on U.S. \n     international family planning programs in the FY 1996 Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations legislation.\n       As you know, the final agreement reached in Congress on the \n     FY 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill delays \n     population funding until July 1, 1996, and then requires that \n     these funds be disbursed over a 15-month period, at a rate of \n     6.7 percent per month. The net effect of these restrictions \n     would be to reduce U.S. funding for international family \n     planning programs to approximately $75 million in FY'96, from \n     an appropriated level of $525 million in FY'95.\n       This kind of massive reduction in U.S. funding will have a \n     major deleterious impact on women and families all over the \n     world. Family planning services help to prevent unintended \n     pregnancies and abortion, reduce maternal and infant \n     mortality and encourage overall family health. Experts inside \n     and outside the government are in agreement that the \n     congressionally imposed constraints will prevent access to \n     family planning for almost 7 million couples. As a result, \n     more than four million women will experience unplanned \n     pregnancies--leading to as many as 1.6 million more \n     abortions.\n       For the past 25 years, the United States has been the \n     world's leader in encouraging the provision of voluntary \n     family planning services around the world. Our efforts have \n     helped to reduce rapid population growth rates to the benefit \n     of our international economic and security interests, as well \n     as those of the countries and families with whom we have \n     worked.\n       The Administration wants to work with you and your \n     colleagues in the Congress to encourage global health and \n     reduce recourse to abortion. We believe that your amendment \n     will do both and we enthusiastically support its adoption.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Wendy R. Sherman,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. President, I oppose efforts to undermine the provision Senator \nHatfield included in this bill, which is intended to reduce the need \nfor abortion.\n  In the continuing resolution approved by the Congress in January, \nfunding for voluntary international family planning programs was capped \nat 65 percent of the level provided in fiscal year 1995. This \nrepresented a steep reduction below the President's budget request for \ninternational family planning programs in fiscal year 1996. Even more, \nthe continuing resolution prevented the Agency for International \nDevelopment from spending any of those funds until July 1, 1996.\n  These draconian cuts and restrictions will hamstring the voluntary \npopulation program, result in an increase in abortions, and undermine \nthe United States development efforts in the long run.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate was not given much opportunity to debate \nthis or any other provision in the last continuing resolution, which \nwas required immediately to keep the Government functioning. The House \nof Representatives sent us the bill at the 11th hour and then adjourned \nfor a long recess. Because the House of Representatives was no longer \nin session, the Senate effectively had no choice but to accept this \nprovision along with the rest of the provisions included in the \ncontinuing resolution. To do otherwise would have resulted in a \nGovernment shutdown.\n  Though advocated by opponents of abortion, the irony is that the \nfunding restriction in current law will result in more--not fewer--\nabortions. On the other hand, the provision Senator Hatfield included \nin this bill is intended to reduce the need for abortion by freeing up \nfunds for voluntary international family planning programs. Let me \nrepeat that statement. The provision in the bill before us is intended \nto reduce the need for abortion. For this reason, I do not understand \nwhy Members of the Senate who oppose abortion are seeking to delete it.\n  Ask yourselves, ``What is the net effect of reduced funding for \nvoluntary family planning and reproductive health programs?'' Less \nmoney? But what does that actually mean? Does it mean programs will be \navailable to help educate women in developing countries about how to \navoid unwanted pregnancies? Absolutely not. Does it mean fewer \nabortions? Clearly not.\n  The funding restriction on voluntary family planning programs in \ncurrent law will, I believe, inevitably result in more abortions. It is \nestimated that approximately 50 million couples worldwide benefit from \nU.S. funded family planning services.\n  But because of the draconian reductions included in the last \ncontinuing resolution, estimating conservatively, approximately 7 \nmillion of these couples will no longer have access to the very \nservices that enable them to plan the timing and size of their \nfamilies. Millions of families in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and \nCaribbean will no longer have access to information so vital to making \nfamily planning decisions.\n  Blocking access to this information in developing countries can only \nhave one result: an increase in unintended pregnancies. And that can \nonly lead to an increase in abortion.\n  These cuts are clearly at odds with America's long-term development \ninterests. Without the funds to train personnel in population control \nor educate families in the poorest countries, there is no doubt that \npopulation sizes will increase. Unchecked population growth perpetuates \nhunger, disease, and poverty. It undermines opportunities for economic \ngrowth and political stability in developing countries. It also has\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\na lasting and harmful effect on our ability to protect the global \nenvironment.\n  And who are those most affected by these cuts in voluntary family \nplanning programs? Mostly, it's poor women and their children in \ndeveloping countries. Poor women who seek to chart a better future by \nplanning the number of children they will bear. Women who seek to \nelevate themselves politically and economically and pursue greater \nopportunities for their children.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Hatfield for rectifying this wrong \nin the bill that is before us. The provision he has included in the \nbill will enable the President to restore voluntary international \nfamily planning funding if he certifies that funding restrictions will \nresult in an increase in abortions. I wholeheartedly endorse his remedy \nand urge my colleagues to fully support it as well. It gives the \nPresident a necessary tool to use to head off the devastating effects \nfunding cuts on family planning services will certainly engender.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMcConnell amendment. This amendment would continue the assault on our \nInternational Family Planning Assistance Program, and leave millions of \nfamilies worldwide without these vital services.\n  In January, in hopes of averting another Government shutdown, the \nSenate attached the foreign operations appropriations bill to the \ncontinuing resolution. As a member of this subcommittee, I was happy to \nsee these programs receive much needed funding. Unfortunately, the \ncontinuing resolution contained a provision that drastically cut \nfunding for our international family planning programs.\n  Essentially, this language said that none of the appropriated funds \ncan be spent until July 1. After that, money can only be spent on a \nmonth-to-month basis at a rate of 6.7 percent a month until the new \nfiscal year begins on October 1. The result of this is that funding for \nU.S. population assistance will be reduced by about 85 percent from \nlast year's level. This is a disastrous situation that will severely \nhamper this program.\n  Mr. President, shortly after the last continuing resolution passed, \nSenator Hatfield vowed to fix this problem. I want to commend him for \nhis leadership and action on this issue. Senator Hatfield's solution \nstates: ``If the restrictions in current law will result in \nsignificantly more abortions as well as a greater unmet need for family \nplanning services, the restrictions will be nullified.'' I think this \nis a responsible and direct approach.\n  Without the Hatfield language, millions of couples will lose access \nto these valuable services. There will be a higher incidence of \nunplanned pregnancies, an increase in infant deaths, and more women \ndying from unsafe conditions.\n  Ironically, by denying support to international family planning \nassistance, a vote for the McConnell amendment may well have the \nunintended effect of increasing the incidence of abortion.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been a leader in international \npopulation assistance since 1965. During that time, we have made \nsignificant progress in increasing access to health care, improving \nwomen's health worldwide, and providing family planning services. But \nthis progress will stop if we don't fund the programs.\n  This last year, the Senate continually showed its support for \ninternational family planning and its funding. Now we have an \nopportunity to rectify a very troubling situation.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment \nand support the Hatfield language.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to \nspeak in favor of the provision in this appropriations measure \nregarding international population assistance. The amendment before us \nwould strike this provision, a move I believe would be unwise.\n  The international family planning program was cut 35 percent in the \nFiscal Year 1996 Foreign Operations Act from fiscal year 1995 levels. \nIn addition, two restrictions were added, the effects of which will \nlead to an 85-percent cut to the program. The net effect of this cut is \na budget which will go from $547 million in 1996 to $72 million.\n  Senator Hatfield added a provision to this bill which states that if \nthe President determines that the restrictions in current law result in \nmore abortions and a greater need for family planning services which is \nnot met, the funding restrictions will be lifted. This seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, to be a reasonable approach. I am sure that those who are \nopposed to abortion do not want to support a policy which increases \nabortions.\n  I must say, Mr. President, I am always perplexed by those who oppose \nfamily planning and also oppose abortion. Study after study has shown \nthat lack of family planning leads to more unintended pregnancies which \nleads to more abortions. Consider two countries: Russia has very little \ncontraception available, and abortion is the primary method of birth \ncontrol. The average Russian woman has at least four abortions in her \nlifetime. Alternatively, Hungary has made family planning services more \nwidely available and the abortion rate has dropped dramatically.\n  Mr. President, the United States plays a critical role in providing \nfamily planning services abroad. It has been certified over and over \nagain that none of the funds are used to pay for abortions, as required \nby law. I feel strongly that we should continue our leadership role in \nthis area. I urge my colleagues to defeat the McConnell amendment and \nsupport the Hatfield language in the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Kentucky asserted, \nsection 3001 of the pending bill is unacceptable to the House. And \nunless that section is dropped, it will surely lead to another Federal \nshutdown. Simply put, section 3001 is another enormous additional gift \nof the American taxpayers' dollars to various pro-abortion \norganizations, and the House will never agree to it.\n  Because of this issue, the fiscal year 1996 foreign operations \nappropriations bill bounced back and forth between the House and Senate \nfor several months until a compromise was worked out on the previous \ncontinuing resolution. And unless section 3001 is changed, Congress \nwill be in precisely the same predicament as before; section 3001, as \ncurrently drawn, will grind the Federal Government to a halt, and the \nblame will perch squarely on the shoulders of section 3001's supporters \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am bewildered at suggestions that section 3001 of \nthe pending bill is somehow pro-life. The author of section 3001, \nChairman Hatfield, stated on the Senate floor this past month, and \nrepeated in Saturday's Washington Post that ``For those of us who take \na pro-life position, this is the most effective way to reiterate our \nprofound opposition to the practice of abortion.'' Mr. President, I \nhave constantly sought to protect the lives of unborn children \nthroughout my 24 years in the Senate. I respectfully disagree with my \ngood friend, Senator Hatfield's statement--I find it difficult to \nunderstand his conclusion that section 3001 is even remotely a pro-life \nposition.\n  After all, the loudest proponents of Senator Hatfield's so-called \npro-life language are the leaders of the abortion industry and their \nlobby. Any statistics purporting to claim that the compromise worked \nout in the previous continuing resolution would cause more abortions \nand more unintended pregnancies are bound to be contrived, and are \nbased on studies produced by recipients of international population \ncontrol funding--which was reduced substantially in the previous CR. In \nfact, it occurs to me that the numbers were cooked up to ensure that \nthese groups can receive even more of the American taxpayers' money. \nThe best that can be said of them is that they are purely hypothetical \nestimates based on guesses.\n  Mr. President, I wonder about the groups coming up with these \nstatistics, who are they and how did they obtain such doubtful \nstatistics? Among the groups cited in Saturday's Washington Post was \nthe Futures Group which just happens to be the recipient of substantial \nfunding from the Agency for International Development's population \ncontrol program. Another group cited by the Washington Post was the \nAlan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of the Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America--an active promoter of abortion.\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\n  Then, of course, there is the International Planned Parenthood \nFederation whose role in this massive lobbying campaign is perhaps the \nmost transparent because as currently drawn, section 3001 will \nguarantee that the International Planned Parenthood Federation will \nreceive 100 percent of its U.S. taxpayer funding--with no strings \nattached. The International Planned Parenthood Federation is a major \nforce behind efforts to overturn the compromise worked out in the \nprevious CR, which was agreed to by the House and the Senate and by \nPresident Clinton.\n  This is because the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and \nmany of its affiliates, are in the business of promoting and performing \nabortions. They make no bones about it. Consider, if you will, excerpts \nfrom the Federation's own 1994-95 annual report supplement:\n\n       Where it was suspected that abortion was likely to be made \n     illegal/or delegalized in a country, FPAs [family planning \n     affiliates] should act immediately to raise awareness and, \n     with IPPF's [International Planned Parenthood Federation's] \n     regional and international support, lobby where possible to \n     prevent this from occurring.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The FPA [family planning affiliate] of Nepal has initiated \n     efforts aimed at liberalizing abortion law.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The FPA [family planning affiliate] of Sri Lanka's recent \n     research into attitudes toward abortion was a major factor in \n     the successful lobby of the Government to change the law to \n     permit abortion for victims of rape and incest in 1994, a \n     major step forward for the Region. The FPA is continuing to \n     push for further liberalization.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Under the project ``Motivation of Leadership,'' AUPF \n     [IPPF's affiliate in Uruguay] held several meetings with \n     parliamentarians from different political parties interested \n     in promoting a law to legalize abortion. It is likely that a \n     new attempt to liberalize the abortion law may succeed before \n     the end of 1995.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The FPAs [family planning affiliates] of Swaziland, Burkina \n     Faso, Zambia and Senegal have conducted research to identify \n     existing laws on abortion. The research findings are expected \n     to be used for advocacy for legal and policy reform [that is, \n     to liberalize abortion laws].\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America \nboasted in its 1994-95 annual report about having performed 133,289 \nabortions in the United States. There is no telling how many abortions \nInternational Planned Parenthood affiliates are responsible for \nworldwide. How could anybody be duped into believing that the \nInternational Planned Parenthood Federation seeks to protect the lives \nof unborn children? Of course, it does not. The Federation is in the \nbusiness of destroying the lives of helpless, innocent unborn children. \nIt is, in fact, the world's leader in promoting abortions, and that \ncrowd is thrilled by Senator Hatfield's proposed language in this bill.\n  Clearly, the primary supporters of this provision are pro-abortion. \nHaving read Senator Hatfield's characterization of section 3001 as pro-\nlife, one is obliged to wonder what the pro-life groups have to say? \nThey strongly oppose the current language in section 3001. In the same \nWashington Post article, the Christian Coalition asserted that ``We \nconsider Senator Hatfield's argument preposterous, that somehow, giving \nmoney to International Planned Parenthood organizations is going to \nreduce abortions. That is absurd.'' National Right to Life has informed \nme that they are appalled at section 3001 and the claims that is \nsomehow represents the pro-life view.\n  Mr. President, I must say to those who may be inclined to support \nsection 3001, that if they genuinely want to ``reiterate [their] \nprofound opposition to the practice of abortion,'' they should vote for \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky. This entire effort \nis orchestrated by a handful of powerful organizations in the abortion \nbusiness and their well-heeled lobbyists--including the Agency for \nInternational Development. The Senate should stand up to these groups \nand reject their tactics by supporting the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, a vote for the pending amendment--not section 3001 of \nthe continuing resolution--will protect the lives of unborn children. A \nvote against the amendment is a boon for the abortion industry and its \nlobby, and will very likely result in another Government shutdown.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles be printed \nin the Record. The first is the March 9, Washington Post article and \nthe second is an article by Nicholas Eberstadt that appeared in the \nMarch 11, Washington Times. Mr. Eberstadt's analysis refutes the \nstatistics used to support the language in the bill, and should be \nrequired reading.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, March 11, 1996]\n\n                      Birds, Bees and Budget Cuts\n\n                        (By Nicholas Eberstadt)\n\n       For advocates of Third World population control--or as they \n     new prefer to say, ``stabilizing world population''--the \n     resort to scare tactics in debates and policy battles, is \n     nothing new. Quite the contrary: The specter of disastrous \n     consequences (famine, plague, vast and needless human \n     suffering) is routinely invoked by the neo-Malthusian lobby \n     in its attempts to silence opponents and to proselytize the \n     unconvinced.\n       The latest dire claims from this alarmist approach to \n     public policy discourse have just been unveiled in \n     Washington. Today Congress is being warned that millions of \n     unwanted third World pregnancies (thus, unwanted Third World \n     births and abortions) will be on its hands if it does not \n     immediately reverse itself, and add hundreds of millions of \n     dollars to the prospective foreign aid program population \n     budget. The gambit, and its supporting ``evidence,'' are \n     entirely of a piece with the anti-natalist movement that \n     authored them: amazing, but not surprising.\n       The background to this unfolding drama was a January 1996 \n     vote, in the House of Representatives and the Senate, to cut \n     America's international ``population assistance'' funds by \n     about 35 percent from the level of the previous year. The \n     slated total--about $380 million--would mean a reduction of \n     over $200 million. It looked to be a dramatic cutback \n     (although due to the enthusiastic, high-level support that \n     population programs have enjoyed in the Clinton \n     administration, the ``cutback'' would still have left these \n     programs with more money than they had under President Bush).\n       The claxons immediately sounded. Nafis Sadik, executive \n     direct of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), raised \n     the threat, among several others, of a renewed global \n     population explosion. ``The way U.S. funding is going,'' she \n     told the New York Times, ``17 to 18 million unwanted \n     pregnancies are going to take place, a couple of million \n     abortions will take place, and I'm sure that 60,000 to 80,000 \n     women are going to die because of those abortions--and all \n     because the money has been reduced overnight.''\n       Treated as a serious prognosis (rather than, say, a \n     rhetorical outburst disguised by numbers), Dr. Sadik's \n     prophecy, would have had some remarkable implications. For \n     its arithmetic to work, for example, population growth in \n     such places as Latin America and Indonesia (where, currently, \n     modern contraceptives are widely used) would basically have \n     to double from one year to the next. To all but the most \n     committed anti-natal advocates, the implausibility of this \n     official UNFPA assertion was patent. Implausible (or \n     easily falsifiable) claims do not make good debaters' \n     points. The Sadik prophecy was thus quietly retired before \n     the battle to cancel the congressional cutbacks began in \n     earnest.\n       The ammunition that is now being used in the effort to \n     overturn the funding reduction programs comes from the Alan \n     Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of the Planned \n     Parenthood Federation of America. On its face, the Guttmacher \n     analysis sounds inherently more reasonable than Dr. Sadik's. \n     Instead of 17 to 18 million unwanted Third World pregnancies, \n     the Guttmacher analysis indicates that U.S. population aid \n     cutbacks will result in about 4 million. (To be more exact: \n     3,956,544 ``unwanted pregnancies from budget cuts''--this is \n     a very precise study.) Unlike the Sadik pronouncement, \n     moreover, the Guttmacher paper offers a meticulous \n     explanation of its methodology, a detailed breakdown of its \n     calculations, and a long list of citations and references \n     utilized in the exercise.\n       Yet for all its seeming rigor and statistical precision, \n     this Guttmacher study is nothing but an elegant fantasy. For \n     despite its sober and careful tone, there is absolutely no \n     reason to expect the correspondence between ``budget cuts'' \n     and extra Third World pregnancies anticipated in its pages to \n     occur in a real world populated by human beings.\n       The reason the Guttmacher study is so flawed as to be \n     useless is both simply and fundamental: It ignores the fact \n     that human beings--in poor countries as well as rich ones--\n     respond to changes in their circumstances, and strive to \n     improve their lot in the face of constraint.\n       Forget for the moment that the impending congressional cuts \n     might well be made up by other governments (Western aid-\n     giving countries, or even Third World aid-taking countries \n     themselves). For the Guttmacher study to make sense, there \n     would have to be a fixed, mechanical and determinative \n     relationship in our world between a population's usage level \n     of publicly provided modern contraceptives and its levels of \n     pregnancy or fertility. By the logic animating this exercise,\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\n     less public money for contraception would mean that a \n     corresponding proportion of adults would automatically cease \n     practicing birth control.\n       These Guttmacher assumptions would be perfectly reasonable \n     if Third World parents were blind automatons or heedless \n     beasts. Beasts, after all, do not deliberately regulate their \n     procreation, and automatons are built to follow an immutable \n     routine. Everything we know about Third World parents, \n     though, suggests that a more human vision of them would be \n     rather more successful in describing, and predicting, their \n     behavior--including their ``population dynamics.''\n       After all: Survey results from country after country in \n     Asia, Africa, and Latin America consistently demonstrate that \n     parents throughout the Third World (like parents in rich \n     countries) have pronounced views about their own ``desired \n     family size''--and that their own ``desired family size'' is \n     in fact the best predictor of their country's fertility \n     level. Though they may be deemed ignorant by the planners who \n     propose to improve their lives, Third World parents do not \n     believe that babies are simply found under cabbages. They \n     know how to make babies and how to avoid births, and put the \n     sort of effort into achieving those objectives that would be \n     expected of major life decisions.\n       If international funding for government-sponsored family \n     planning programs falls, Third World parents will not \n     fatalistically abandon their views about their own desired \n     family size and fall into a breeding frenzy, as the \n     Guttmacher study implicitly presumes. Instead they will \n     attempt to achieve their goals by other means. They may use \n     ``traditional'' family planning methods (which brought low \n     fertility to Europe before modern contraceptives were \n     invented). They may practice abstinence--no modern method is \n     more effective than this. They may even spend some of their \n     own money to purchase modern contraceptives. (Though \n     population planners talk endlessly about the ``unmet need'' \n     for modern contraceptives in the Third World, the simple fact \n     is that poor people have an ``unmet need'' for practically \n     everything--and their spending decisions reveal their \n     preferences and priorities.)\n       Since it is completely tone-deaf to the very human \n     qualities at the center of the family formation process, the \n     Guttmacher calculations cannot provide a realistic estimate \n     of the demographic consequences of Congress' impending \n     population fund cutbacks. In truth, that impact is probably \n     incalculable. Depending upon how couples behave, it is \n     possible that those cutbacks would have a small demographic \n     impact--or virtually none at all. Conversely, if the \n     Guttmacher methodology were actually valid, the population \n     funding increases during the Clinton years should be credited \n     with bringing birth rates in Third World countries down \n     significantly--but not even the neo-Malthusian lobby has been \n     bold enough to make this extravagant claim.\n       The current population funding contretemps, of course, is \n     not the first occasion upon which junk science has been \n     brought to Capital Hill in the hope of influencing \n     legislation. It is not the first time that representatives \n     and senators have heard claimants depict catastrophes in \n     their effort to fend off cuts to their own particular \n     spending programs. By and large, however, such conduct is \n     still the exception in Washington. For the population-control \n     lobby, by contrast, such conduct now seems to define the \n     norm. As long as that population lobby exists, demographic \n     demagoguery--like death and taxes--promises to be a fact of \n     life.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1996]\n\n    Abortion Forecast Renews Fight for Overseas Family Planning Aid\n\n                          (By Barbara Vobejda)\n\n       A new law that deeply cuts U.S. aid for international \n     family planning will result in at least 1.6 million more \n     abortions in developing countries in one year, according to a \n     study that has reignited a battle over the funds and split \n     the antiabortion community.\n       The study, issued this week by a group of population \n     organizations, also estimates that the funding cuts will mean \n     that 7 million couples in developing countries who would have \n     used modern contraceptive methods no longer will have access \n     to them, resulting in 1.9 million more unplanned births, \n     134,000 more infant deaths, and 8,000 more women dying in \n     childbirth and pregnancy, including from unsafe abortions.\n       Those numbers are fueling renewed efforts by Sen. Mark O. \n     Hatfield (R-Ore.), who chairs the Appropriations Committee, \n     to rally support among antiabortion groups in his effort to \n     restore the overseas family planning funds.\n       ``For those of us who take a pro-life position, this is the \n     most effective way to reiterate our profound opposition to \n     the practice of abortion,'' Hatfield said on the Senate floor \n     last month. ``All the antiabortion speech this chamber can \n     tolerate will not reduce the number of unintended pregnancies \n     as swiftly or as surely as our support for voluntary family \n     planning.''\n       Hatfield is attempting to attach language to the interim \n     spending measure Congress must pass before government funding \n     expires March 15. The language would allow the president to \n     restore funds if he certifies that the lack of aid will lead \n     to a significant increase in abortions.\n       While Hatfield has support in the Senate and from the White \n     House, he must win over the House, where there is strong \n     opposition from some antiabortion lawmakers.\n       In late January, Congress approved legislation that cut \n     funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development's \n     family planning program by 35 percent, from $547 million to \n     $356 million. The funds were further reduced by restrictions \n     that prevent any spending until July 1 and require that funds \n     be parceled out at a monthly rate over the next 15 months. As \n     a result, funding for this fiscal year was reduced by about \n     85 percent from 1995.\n       The study on the effect of the cuts took into account the \n     35 percent cut, but not the spending restrictions, which \n     would presumably further raise the number of abortions and \n     deaths. It was conducted by demographers and others at the \n     Futures Group, Population Action International, the \n     Population Reference Bureau, the Population Council and the \n     Alan Guttmacher Institute.\n       The cut in funding follows years of disagreement over the \n     use of U.S. aid for family planning overseas. The reduction \n     was attached to the continuing resolution approved in late \n     January at the urging of Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.), \n     an ardent abortion foe.\n       Hatfield, who also opposes abortion, has had mixed success \n     in his efforts to find support among antiabortion advocates. \n     Some groups have dismissed the new study and Hatfield's \n     efforts to restore funding.\n       ``We consider Sen. Hatfield's argument preposterous, that \n     somehow, giving money to International Planned Parenthood \n     organizations, is going to reduce abortions. That is \n     absurd,'' said Brian Lopina, who heads the Washington office \n     of the Christian Coalition.\n       Opponents to family planning assistance have argued that, \n     despite a ban on use of the funds for abortions, the \n     assistance frees up other money that can then be used for \n     abortion.\n       But others with strong antiabortion views contend that \n     family planning assistance is the most effective way to \n     reduce abortions. ``To knock out this funding based on a \n     misguided pro-life agenda is absolutely the wrong thing to \n     do,'' said Gordon Aeschliman, president of the Christian \n     Environmental Association, which conducts development \n     projects in 14 countries.\n       He said antiabortion groups that work over seas see the \n     ``clear connection'' between family planning and reduced \n     human suffering. ``Unfortunately, in the U.S., the strong \n     wing in the pro-life movement sees family planning as the \n     same as forced abortion, which is inaccurate.''\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the McConnell \namendment. It is another attempt to deny health care to the world's \npoorest women.\n  The McConnell amendment seeks to maintain a provision of the foreign \noperations bill that would decimate America's effort to improve health \ncare for the world's poorest women. A recent report by the Alan \nGuttmacher Institute estimates that these cuts will mean that 7 million \ncouples in developing countries would no longer have access to \ncontraceptives. There would be almost 2 million unplanned births. And \nthere could be up to 1.6 million additional abortions.\n  Those who support the McConnell amendment claim to want to reduce the \nnumber of abortions. But the effect of this provision will be just the \nopposite. Family planning prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortions. \nYou would think this basic fact would not need to be restated on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  U.S. international family planning funds are not spent on abortion. \nSo now, some insist on going after basic health care services that \nprevent pregnancy.\n  Over 100 million women throughout the world cannot obtain or are not \nusing family planning because they are poor, uneducated or lack access \nto care. Twenty million of these women will seek unsafe abortions. Some \nwomen will die, some will be disabled. We could prevent some of this \nneedless suffering.\n  This issue won't go away. The majority of the Senate opposes the \nirrational and cruel effort to end U.S. assistance for international \nfamily planning. I commend Senator Hatfield for his principled stand on \nthis issue. We will continue the fight to enable the world's poorest \nwomen to control and improve their lives.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, we have done better in this \nlegislation than our House counterparts in protecting the lives and \nhealth of women around the globe.\n  There is a provision in this bill that allows restrictions on \ndispensing international family planning funds to be lifted if the \nPresident determines that the restrictions would result in \nsignificantly more abortions and a greater unmet need for family \nplanning services.\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\n  The McConnell amendment would deny the President the ability to make \nthis determination and leave the current funding restrictions in place. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment \nbecause the clear outcome will be an increase in abortion and an \nincrease in infant death--something no Senator can support.\n  According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute and a consortium of expert \ndemographers, the current funding restrictions will result in at least \n1.9 million unplanned births and 1.6 million abortions. The McConnell \namendment would result in over 1.6 million abortions. This amendment is \nnot about allowing women to choose, but about forcing them into a \nchoice they don't want to make.\n  If we do not retain the language in the bill and overturn the current \nfunding restrictions, we could cause 8,000 women around the world to \ndie in pregnancy and childbirth and 134,000 infants to die from low \nbirth weight and undernourishment. That is something that I cannot live \nwith and I do not believe my colleagues can either.\n  We should encourage families who are trying to make deliberate \ndecisions about their ability to have and care for additional children. \nWe should provide women with an option to unwanted pregnancy and \nabortion. We should not force families into dangerous or unwanted \npregnancies.\n  I support the language currently in the bill because it allows the \nPresident to lift the restrictions on family planning funds. It allows \nthe President to make a sound public policy decision based on the \nfacts. And the facts are that if women are denied family planning \nassistance, many will turn to abortion.\n  I oppose the McConnell amendment because it would result in \nabortions, in infant death, and in maternal death. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose the McConnell amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Atlanta \nConstitution, written by the director of the population unit at CARE, \nthat illustrates the need for international family planning funds, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Atlanta Constitution]\n\n                      Cutting Money, Costing Lives\n\n                       (By Maurice I. Middleberg)\n\n       Last July, I snapped a photograph of a couple who had \n     become family planning providers in the remote Andean village \n     of Cushcandahy, Peru, 11,000 feet in the mountains. Their \n     modest home displayed a sign: ``Plantification Familiar Aqui \n     (Family Planning Here).''.\n       Thanks in part to funds from the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, CARE has trained more than 1,400 \n     workers and introduced family planning services to thousands \n     of people in Peru, from the Amazon basin to the Andean \n     mountaintops.\n       Unfortunately, the efforts of CARE and other humanitarian \n     agencies to bring family planning to villages around the \n     globe have been jeopardized by the congressional resolution \n     of the budget impasse. The funds available for family \n     planning were cut by 35 percent. Even worse, a set of \n     unprecedented procedural requirements threatens to reduce the \n     actual flow of funds to a trickle.\n       Meanwhile, here are the facts: Some 120 million women in \n     the developing world want to stop or postpone childbearing \n     but do not have access to family planning services. Women in \n     the developing world are 100 times more likely than American \n     women to die as a result of childbirth. Half a million \n     women--one every minute of every day--die each year from \n     complications of pregnancy and childbirth; 5 million women \n     suffer serious illnesses or trauma.\n       In developing countries, more than 10 percent of births end \n     in the death of the infant before his or her first birthday, \n     a rate more than 10 times as high as in the United States. \n     High infant mortality is in part attributable to the fact \n     that many births are high risk; that is, they occur to very \n     young women, to women over age 35, to women who have already \n     had many pregnancies or who have given birth in the preceding \n     24 months. In many countries, simply spacing births could \n     reduce the infant mortality rate by one-fifth.\n       Ten million to 12 million illegal abortions occur each year \n     in the developing world. CARE does not support abortion \n     services directly or indirectly. Reducing funding for family \n     planning services means that fewer women will be able to \n     avoid the unwanted pregnancies that too often conclude in \n     abortion.\n       We find the action by Congress particularly puzzling in \n     view of its laudable decision to protect other child health \n     programs such as immunization. It may be a simple lack of \n     understanding of the health benefits of family planning.\n       The cuts in family planning programs are disporportionate--\n     three times the 11 percent cut in foreign aid overall. In \n     addition, agencies cannot get the funds until July 1, nine \n     months into the fiscal year and five months after Congress \n     appropriated the money. Therefore, the funds will be doled \n     out at a rate of one-fifteenth of the appropriation each \n     month.\n       As we were entering the village of Cushcandahy, the local \n     health worker said to me, ``In these villages, they say that \n     only God and CARE come to visit.'' The truth is that God and \n     CARE have relied on the compassion and enlightened self-\n     interest of the American people to build the links between \n     Atlanta and Cushcandahy.\n       International family planning programs are of virtually no \n     budgetary significance, totaling only a few hundredths of 1 \n     percent of the U.S. government budget. They also have been \n     extraordinarily successful: In 1965, 10 percent of women in \n     the developing world used contraceptives; today, more than 50 \n     percent do.\n       Congress should rethink the excessive cuts and burdensome \n     rules it has mandated and restore a program that reflects \n     American interests and generosity.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, I had understood that we were going back \nand forth. I do not think there are any takers on the Democratic side \nfor an amendment right now. I may be mistaken. If there is an amendment \nover here, somebody should offer it right now. Otherwise, Senator Cohen \nand I have an amendment that we were supposed to offer at the earliest \npossible time, but I do not see him on the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am really talking, trying to take up time, hoping he \nwill come to the floor and offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor. The \nSenate will please come to order so the Senator can be heard.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3501 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n(Purpose: To permit recipients of Legal Services Corporation grants to \n use funds derived from non-Federal sources to testify at legislative \n      hearings or to respond to requests for certain information)\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] for himself and Mr. \n     Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 3501 to amendment No. \n     3466.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 504 under the heading ``Administrative \n     Provisions-Legal Service Corporation--\n       (1) redesignate subsection (e) as subsection (f); and\n       (2) insert after subsection (d), the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     prohibit a recipient from using funds derived from a source \n     other than the Legal Services Corporation to comment on \n     public rulemaking or to respond to a written request for \n     information or testimony from a Federal, State or local \n     agency, legislative body or committee, or a member of such an \n     agency, body, or committee, so long as the response is made \n     only to the parties that make the request and the recipient \n     does not arrange for the request to be made.''.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today with \nSenator Bumpers is very simple and very straightforward. It would \npermit legal services organizations across the country to use non-\nFederal funds to cover the costs of testifying at legislative hearings, \ncommenting on administrative regulations, and responding to requests \nfor information from public officials.\n  Mr. President, I find it ironic that as we are seeking to devolve \nmore and more responsibility to the States, that we would preclude \nthose organizations representing low-income individuals from testifying \nbefore legislative bodies, offering comment on regulatory proposals, or \nresponding to inquiries from lawmakers.\n  We have a situation in the State of Maine in which the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, a Republican, has a very cooperative \nrelationship with Pine Tree Legal Assistance. This Republican Senator \nhas urged that the restriction on the use of non-Federal money be \nlifted so that Pine Tree can be called to testify before the committee.\n  I do not understand why we would seek to preclude non-Federal funds \nfrom being used in a way that will actually, hopefully, avoid lengthy \ncourt battles. We are talking about the possibility of turning Medicaid \nover to the States in the way of a block grant and reforming a host of \ncritical social programs. During these reform efforts, the States will \nbe adopting regulations and proposals that would have an impact upon \nthe lives of those that the programs are designed to serve. Yet, the \nvery lawyers who would be called upon to help the poor are relegated to \nbringing lawsuits or to representing them in court, when in fact their \nexpertise would be helpful to legislators that formulate policies, to \nagencies that implement the programs, and to lawmakers who seek some \nclarification in fairly esoteric areas of the law.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says that legal services \norganizations across the country are not precluded from using non-\nFederal funds for the purposes of testifying at legislative hearings, \ncommenting on administrative regulations, and responding to requests \nfor information from public officials.\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of restrictions included in \nthe bill to preclude activities which the Congress has decided that no \nlonger should be carried out by legal services attorneys. But it seems \nto me that this list of restrictions should not include a blanket \nprohibition on the participation of attorneys representing the poor \nbefore legislative bodies.\n  So I hope that this amendment will be supported by a wide variety of \nour colleagues because it does not present a threat to the proponents \nof restricting activities of legal services lawyers. Rather, it will \nultimately be beneficial to lawmakers and government officials who are \nseeking to craft programs that will have a direct impact upon the \npoorest of our society.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Bumpers and myself in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was wondering if the Senator from Maine \nwould be willing to enter into a time agreement and have a specific \nvote at 6:30 on this?\n  Mr. COHEN. What time?\n  Mr. GREGG. At 6:30.\n  Mr. COHEN. Does Senator Bumpers have any objection to a time \nlimitation on this?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. What was the request?\n  Mr. GREGG. A vote at 6:30.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is fine with me. We can probably do it in less time \nthan that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I hope the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and the senior Senator from Texas will look very \ncarefully at this amendment and accept it. It is not only a harmless \namendment, it is a very beneficial amendment.\n\n  It is an amendment that corrects a problem that apparently was not \nforeseen. It would be difficult for me to believe that the Congress \nintended that Legal Services Corporation grant recipients not even to \nbe permitted to testify if a congressional committee asked them to, or \nto respond to the committee's questions.\n  Let us assume that the Senator from New Hampshire wanted the answer \nto a question about a lawsuit brought in New Hampshire in which a Legal \nServices grantee was involved. They would not even be able to answer \nit. The Senator from Maine has crafted this amendment in a way that \ncould offend nobody in Congress because it allows Legal Services \ngrantees use only non-Federal funds to respond to inquiries. They can \nonly use money that the grantee has received from non-Federal sources \nto answer specific questions in writing.\n  To me, what we have done to the Legal Services Corporation is a real \ntravesty, but I am not here to reopen that debate. But, Mr. President, \njust to give you some idea of what we did, we put 19--count them--19 \nspecific restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation of things that \nthey have always done and can no longer do.\n  We had never before restricted the Legal Services Corporation on any \nof those things as long as they were using their own self-generated \nmoney. But now the way the bill is crafted, the Presiding Officer or \nany Member of the Senate or any of the committees of the Senate could \ncall a Legal Services grantee and ask them for information,\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\nand the way the bill is crafted now they could not answer it.\n  What kind of nonsense is that? This amendment simply says that the \nLegal Services professionals can respond to specific requests for \ncomment on proposed rules, or legislative proposals, if they are asked \nand if they have comments to offer. We are a lot better hearing from \nthem during the rulemaking process than we are hearing their arguments \nlater in the courtroom.\n  This amendment precludes lobbying. There are two things, it seems to \nme, that have really caught the attention and the exasperation of the \nSenate more than anything else--one is lobbying by the Legal Services \nCorporation and its grantees and the other are class actions.\n  I sit on the appropriations subcommittee that funds them, so I can \ntell you, it has been draconian what we have done to them. But consider \nthe fact that unless this amendment is adopted, those Legal Services \nproviders will be prohibited from responding even to congressional \ninquiries about their activities. Think about that. You cannot even ask \nthem about their activities because they would be prohibited from \nanswering. The way the law is drafted now, they will not be able to \nappear at hearings to answer questions.\n  So, Mr. President, the amendment permits only specific responses to \nspecific written requests for information by State legislators, by \nMembers of Congress and committees of Congress, or agency officials. \nAnd the response can be made only to the official who made the inquiry. \nI do not think I have ever argued for an amendment that was needed as \nbadly as is this one. I cannot imagine it not being accepted. I hope it \nwill be, and we can get on to another amendment. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support this amendment. It is a very \nmodest amendment to allow legal service providers who receive non-\nFederal funds to participate in a very limited way in responding to \nareas which are of interest on the legislative process and \nrepresentation of the poor.\n  The pendulum has swung very far in opposition to the representation \nof the poor from community legal services because of concerns which \nhave arisen over their representation of plaintiffs in class actions or \nover other kinds of representation.\n  We have really come a long way, Mr. President, in our society in \nrelatively few years. It has only been since 1963, in the landmark case \nof Gideon v. Wainwright, that an individual was entitled to \nrepresentation in a criminal case, as Justice Hugo Black put it, before \nhe was hauled into court.\n  Before that time, in a criminal case there was no requirement there \nbe a defense counsel except in capital cases. Now we have seen evolve, \nwith community legal services, broader legal representation of the \npoor, a much needed, highly controversial subject which has occupied \nmuch floor time and debate here. By and large, we have maintained \nrepresentation for the poor. Now there is a restriction which goes \nmuch, much too far.\n  To have an amendment that says a recipient may use funds derived from \nsources other than the Legal Services Corporation to comment on public \nrulemaking, which is a very limited matter, hardly inspiring \nlitigation, or to respond to a written request for information or \ntestimony from a Federal, State or local agency, legislative body or \ncommittee, or a member of one of those entities, so long as the \nresponse is made only to the parties that make the request, and the \nrecipient does not arrange for the request to be made, is \nextraordinarily limited and circumscribed.\n  I hope this amendment could be accepted; if not, that there be a very \nstrong vote in support of this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3502 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n(Purpose: To require that contracts to carry out programs of assistance \nfor Bosnia and Herzegovina using funds appropriated for that purpose be \n entered into only with corporations and other organizations organized \n                         in the United States)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3502.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 751, line 7, insert after ``1974:'' the following: \n     ``Provided further, That contracts to carry out programs \n     using such funds shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be \n     entered into with companies organized under the laws of a \n     State of the United States and organizations (including \n     community chests, funds, foundations, non-incorporated \n     businesses, and other institutions) organized in the United \n     States:''.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. The bill \nprovides $200 million in foreign aid for Bosnia. Much of the money will \nbe used to reconstruct Bosnia. This amendment requires, to the maximum \nextent possible, any contract derived from the aid from this $200 \nmillion should go to American businesses or organizations. It is not \nmandatory, but to the greatest extent possible, this money should come \nback to American businesses.\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides. I am told the \nadministration does not oppose it. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am informed that the amendment proposed \nby the Senator from North Carolina has been cleared by both sides. Both \nsides accept it, and it can be adopted by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3502) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 3503 through 3507, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send a package of five amendments to the \ndesk and ask they be made in order, notwithstanding the fact, in one \ninstance, one of the amendments amends an amendment already numbered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the en bloc amendments.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes \n     amendments Nos. 3503 through 3507, en bloc, to amendment No. \n     3466.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3503 through 3507), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3503\n\nPurpose: To partially restore funds in the Department of the Interior's \n         and the Department of Energy's administrative accounts\n\n       On page 405, line 17, strike ``$567,152,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$567,753,000''.\n       On page 412, line 23, strike ``$497,670,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$497,850,000''.\n       On page 419, line 22, strike ``$1,086,014,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$1,084,755,000''.\n       On page 424, line 21, strike ``$729,995,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$730,330,000''.\n       On page 428, line 6, strike ``$182,339,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$182,771,000''.\n       On page 447, line 7, strike ``$56,456,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$57,340,000''.\n       On page 447, line 13, strike ``$34,337,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$34,516,000''.\n       On page 474, line 21, strike ``$416,943,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$417,092,000''.\n       On page 475, line 21, strike ``$553,137,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$553,240,000''.\n       On page 440, line 19, strike ``March 31, 1996'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``September 30, 1996''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \npartially reinstate funds to the Department of the Interior and \nDepartment of Energy administrative accounts. Accounts within those \ndepartments were reduced to offset C Canal repair and park \nmaintenance. Due to the lateness in the year, it is recognized that the \nDepartment of the Interior's Departmental Office account and the Office \nof\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\nthe Solicitor account need flexibility to move funds within those two \noffices. Therefore, the reduction areas for those two offices are not \nidentified.\n  The amendment changes the availability of $8 million of unobligated \nand unexpended funding within the Operation of Indian Programs from \nMarch 31, 1996. These funds would have otherwise expired as of \nSeptember 30, 1995. The availability of the funding has been extended \nto help cover employee severance, relocation, and related expenses. The \namendment is necessary because of the delay in the completion of the \nfiscal year 1996 Interior appropriations bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3504\n\n (Purpose: To provide emergency funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n         Service to repair dmage caused by flooding in Alaska)\n\n       On page 740, line 6 of the bill, strike ``$34,800,000'' and \n     insert ``37,300,000'' in lieu thereof.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senator Stevens amendment provides an \nadditional $2.5 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service Construction \naccount in the emergency supplemental appropriations title of this \nbill. These funds would be used to repair flood damage to Fish and \nWildlife Service facilities along the Kenai River in Alaska. I have \nbeen informed by the Fish and Wildlife Service that these projects \nwould have been included in the Department's emergency request to the \nOffice of Management and Budget, but that the extent of the damages was \nnot known in time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3505\n\n       On page 740 of the bill, insert the following after line 3:\n\n\n                          resource management\n\n       For an additional amount for Resource Management, \n     $1,600,000, to remain available until expended, to provide \n     technical assistance to the Natural Resource Conservation \n     Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies on fish and \n     wildlife habitat issues related to damage caused by floods, \n     storms and other acts of nature: Provided, That the entire \n     amount shall be available only to the extent that an official \n     budget request for a specific dollar amount, that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, is \n     transmitted by the President to Congress: Provided further, \n     That the entire amount is designated by Congress as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(D)(i) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senator Kempthorne's amendment provides \n$1.6 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service's Resource Management \naccount in the emergency supplemental appropriations title of this \nbill. These funds would enable the Fish and Wildlife Service to provide \ntechnical assistance on fish and wildlife issues to FEMA, the Natural \nResources Conservation Service, the Corps of Engineers and other \nagencies involved in disaster response.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3506\n\n       On page 480, line 14, after ``Provided,'' insert ``That of \n     the funds provided, $800,000 shall be used for inhalant abuse \n     treatment programs to treat inhalant abuse and to provide for \n     referrals to specialized treatment facilities in the United \n     States: Provided further,''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3507\n\n       On page 744, beginning on line 1, strike ``emergency'' \n     through ``Mine'' on line 2, and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following: ``response and rehabilitation, including access \n     repairs, at the Amalgamated Mill''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. These amendments, Mr. President, have also been cleared \non both sides. They consist of a Gorton amendment restoring funds to \nadministrative accounts within the Interior bill and changing the date \nfor availability of Bureau of Indian Affairs funds that otherwise would \nexpire on September 30, 1995; second, a Stevens amendment providing \nfunds for flood damage to Fish and Wildlife Service facilities on the \nKenai River; third, a Kempthorne amendment to provide emergency funds \nthat will enable the Fish and Wildlife Service to provide technical \nassistance to other agencies involved in disaster response; a Daschle \namendment providing funds to the Indian Health Service for inhalant \nabuse treatment; and a Hatfield amendment on an amalgamated mill site.\n  I ask they be adopted en bloc, with each description printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 3503 through 3507), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining first-degree \namendments in order to H.R. 3019 under the previous consent agreement \nmust be offered by 8 p.m. this evening--I emphasize offered by 8 p.m. \nthis evening--with the exception of the managers' package, two \namendments by the majority leader, and two amendments by the Democratic \nleader, and one each for the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his request?\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Elyse \nWasch of my staff be granted privilege of the Senate floor during the \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3508 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  (Purpose: To permit the District of Columbia to use local funds for \n                          certain activities)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I discussed this with the manager, Senator \nGorton. At this time I ask that the pending amendment be laid aside, \nand I will send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 3508 to amendment \n     numbered 3466.\n       On page 222, line 4, insert ``Federal'' before ``funds''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I am perfectly willing to agree to a short time agreement because I \nknow the manager is anxious to move on. I would be happy to agree to 10 \nminutes on a side for this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be \nthe order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think that the offer made by the Senator \nfrom California is an appropriate one as far as I can tell. As a \nconsequence, we will agree to 20 minutes equally divided, 10 minutes on \na side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask that there be no second-degree amendments \npermitted on my amendment. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the moment--because I know there is an \nopponent of this amendment--I am not going to be able to agree to that. \nI hope we will be able to do so very shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not believe anyone will, in fact, make a second-\ndegree. I think there will be opposition. But it is very difficult for \nme to accept this time agreement where we will be able to just talk 10 \nminutes on each side, if I do not have an agreement about second-degree \namendments, I am going to have a problem.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I suggest that the Senator from California simply \nproceed with her argument, and we will see what we can do with that \nunanimous-consent request.\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the manager very much. I do not believe we are \ngoing to have a problem. It is a very straightforward amendment which I \nwould like to explain.\n  As I understand the comments of the Senator from Washington, at this \ntime we are not operating under a time agreement, and I will just \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California should know that \nthe Senate is still under a time agreement as a result of unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous consent be \nvitiated given the fact that we were not able to get agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will not take a great deal of \ntime. This is a very simple, straightforward amendment.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would restore the current law, the law \nthat we have lived under since 1993, as it pertains to abortion funding \npolicy for the District of Columbia.\n  In 1993, this body decided no Medicaid funding could be used for \nabortion but that, in fact, the District of Columbia was free to use \nits locally raised revenue as it saw fit. So that if women who did not \nhave the ability to pay for an abortion--they were in trouble, they \nwere in crisis, and they needed help--they would be able to get it. \nThat policy has been overturned by this Congress in this continuing \nresolution, and it started in December.\n  So right now the District of Columbia is treated quite differently \nthan any other city or State in this great country. It is the only \njurisdiction, Mr. President, in the country which is told that it \ncannot use its locally raised funds as it sees fit.\n  All I do with this amendment is clarify that point by saying no \nFederal funding can be used for abortion in Washington, DC, except for \nrape, incest, and the life of the mother.\n  So there is still a very broad prohibition on Medicaid funding--which \nI have to say to my friend I certainly do not support, but I know that \nthe votes are not here to change that prohibition on Medicaid funding.\n  So I am addressing this amendment just to the District's locally \nraised funds. What we say by way of my amendment is the District of \nColumbia should be treated as every other jurisdiction--have the right \nto make local funding decisions as it decides.\n  What we have here now is that none of the funds appropriated under \nthe act shall be expended for any abortion, except where the life of \nthe mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or if \nthe pregnancy is a result of an act of rape or incest. What my \namendment says is that none of the Federal funds--which means that the \nDistrict of Columbia funds which are locally raised--could be used if \nthe people in D.C. decide that is the proper policy.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that what I am offering is not a \nchange really at all. It is going back to the way the law was since \n1993.\n  I have stood on this floor, and I have listened to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle talk quite eloquently about the importance of \nletting State and local jurisdictions decide how to spend their own \nrevenue. As a matter of fact, they talked about getting Federal funds \nas a block grant and deciding how to expend the Federal funds that are \nin a block grant. In other words, the virtue of local control seems to \nreally be a strong point on the other side of the aisle except when it \ncomes to women's reproductive health care. When they now say that the \nlocally raised funds cannot be used for abortion, I think it is \ninconsistent at its best and I think it is mean spirited at its worst.\n  I want to quote one friend of mine, Senator Gregg, Republican Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, who said in another context--I am quoting directly \nfrom the Record:\n\n       Federal programs should be returned to the States to be \n     operated as State programs with the flexibility being given \n     to the State government where there is as much compassion as \n     in Washington to deliver these services to the needy and to \n     the more needy.\n\n  That is a statement from January 3, 1996, so here is a Senator from \nNew Hampshire saying that the local people are just as compassionate \nand should make the decisions on how to serve the needy, and my \namendment says you are right, Senator Gregg, that is what we ought to \nbe doing. And that is in fact what the District of Columbia has been \ndoing with its locally raised revenues since 1993. They have determined \nthat since there is a ban on Medicaid funding for abortion except in \nrare circumstances, they would come to the rescue, if you will, when \nwomen find themselves in deep trouble, deep trouble, and make an \nagonizing choice, which is their own choice, and they will stand by \ntheir side. I think it is wrong for us to dictate to the District on \nthis issue.\n  Again, I think it is most inconsistent. So if the Boxer amendment \npasses here, the District would have the ability to spend its own money \nthe way it wishes in terms of providing reproductive health care \nservices of abortion to low-income women.\n  Now, I have to say that in this bill we are denying abortion services \nto low-income women, and I think that simply stops them from exercising \ntheir right to choose. The right to choose means nothing, Mr. \nPresident, even with Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions affirming Roe \nv. Wade, if you cannot afford to get an abortion and there is nobody \nthere to help you.\n  In its wisdom, this Congress says no Medicaid funding may be used for \nabortion except in certain circumstances, in narrow circumstances. I \noppose that. I do not have the votes to overturn that. Maybe someday I \nwill have those votes. Maybe someday we will have a pro-choice Senate \nand a pro-choice House. We do not have that right now. But, at the \nminimum, we should not be telling the District of Columbia what to do \nwith its own funds.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to hope that there will be no second-\ndegree amendment to my amendment at this time. I urge my colleagues to \naccept my amendment and let the District of Columbia decide how to \nspend its locally raised revenues without congressional interference.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the manager of the bill what he \nhas in mind in terms of how to deal with my amendment. I am anxious to \nget it voted on or set aside to be voted on. I do not think we need to \nhave much debate unless there are many who wish to speak.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom California in her desire to move this entire matter forward.\n  I see the Senator from Indiana is in the Chamber, and I say, Mr. \nPresident, that the Senator from California was willing to agree to 10 \nminutes to a side and no second-degree amendments. We did not want to \nmake that agreement without the presence of the Senator from Indiana. \nAnd now, if the President will inquire of the Senator from Indiana, we \nwill see if we can get an agreement on disposing of this amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield, I just walked in the Chamber \nand I am not 100 percent sure of even what the amendment says. I think \nI have the gist of what the amendment is, and I think that there are \nprobably a number of Senators who may want to speak on the amendment. I \ncould easily check that and try to find out within the next few minutes \nas to whether or not that is the case and whether or not a reasonable \ntime limit would entertain. But I cannot speak for other Members. I \nwould like to speak in opposition to this amendment, but I cannot speak \nfor other Members, and I am not prepared to agree to a time limit at \nthis particular point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might take back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at the present time, as I understand it, \nthere is no time agreement, so the Senator from California has not \nforfeited any rights to further time. And so I hope we are going to be \nable to arrange a time agreement relatively soon, but obviously we \ncannot do so right now.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I obtained the floor--I just \nasked if the Senator would answer a question for me--is because I spoke \nto the Senator from Indiana yesterday about my\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\nintention on this. I hope he realizes I am proceeding in good faith. I \nam trying to make the point that we should go back to the 1993 law that \nsaid that although Medicaid funding could not be used, no Federal \nfunding could be used for abortion, that the District would have the \nability to decide what they wanted to do with their local funds without \nbeing dictated to. In fact, we now change the law and we tell them they \nmay not use their own funds.\n  I am very happy to agree to any time agreement that the Senator feels \nis reasonable, but I would like to at least get an agreement that there \nnot be any second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. As I said before----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would yield to my friend for a question--or a comment.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator from \nCalifornia yielding.\n  As I indicated before, I can speak for myself. I cannot speak for \nothers. It is true that the Senator spoke to me about offering the \namendment. In the context of what we are doing here, a time limit is \nreasonable. It is just that I cannot speak for other Senators who I \nknow would want to speak in opposition to the Senator's amendment. I \nwould be happy to check with those Senators and try to get an answer \nback to the Senator from California and announce to the Senate a \nreasonable time agreement.\n  In answer to the Senator's other point, it appears to me that the \nSenator's amendment attempts to extend the rights that our States, 50 \nStates do not have to the District of Columbia. This Senator is not \nprepared to do that. I do not know if other Senators are prepared to do \nthat.\n  I think that question has to be addressed in the Chamber as well as \nthe viability of the commingling, of extending the full abortion rights \nto the District of Columbia when we are not really certain how the \nfunds are commingled between District funds and Federal funds. \nEverybody knows that the District of Columbia is bankrupt. We do not \nknow how they are applying the funds or what Federal funds they are \ngoing to be getting or how the services would be funded or how the \nfunds would be separated. I think there a number of questions that have \nto be asked.\n  In response to the Senator's question, I would be happy to try to \nascertain what response other Senators might want to give.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to take back my time and thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Clearly, there is much that could be debated on this. I, \nfor one, do not see it as so complicated because every city and every \ncounty in America has the ability to use its own funds. When I am in \nworking in Washington I have an apartment in the District of Columbia, \nwhere I stay. If I park in the District of Columbia and a meter runs \nout, I pay a fine to the District of Columbia, and therefore they \nclearly have their own locally raised funds.\n  My colleague is right. I do not believe that they should be treated \ndifferently than any other city, any other county, and any other State \nvis-a-vis the ability of any city, county, or State to use their own \nlocally raised money as they will.\n  For example, I was on the board of supervisors of a county, a \nsuburban county north of San Francisco, a beautiful place called Marin \nCounty, and the board of supervisors there quite unanimously--we came \nfrom different parties, different views--did give funding to Planned \nParenthood for their clinic in which they, in fact, provided family \nplanning services. They also provided abortions.\n  Now, that is a county. We do not stand up here and say that county \ncannot use its own legally raised funds in any way to assist Planned \nParenthood.\n  If I might ask the manager, in an attempt to be as helpful as I can \nin moving the process, would it suit the manager's purposes if I asked \nunanimous consent to lay this amendment aside? If I can ask that \nquestion without losing my right to the floor, if that would help my \nfriend, then I would be glad to ask that it be laid aside with no \nsecond-degree amendments allowed until we take it up again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GORTON. The first part of the request by the Senator from \nCalifornia is perfectly acceptable. But as I heard the remarks from the \nSenator from Indiana, he is not prepared to say there will not, under \nany circumstances, be a second-degree amendment.\n  Certainly we can lay this amendment aside now while the contending \nparties try to reach an agreement on how it will be dealt with, and go \non to something else. I have, for example, a short colloquy I would \nlike to enter.\n  If the Senator from California would like to lay the amendment aside, \nrecognizing she will certainly be recognized again to bring it back up \nand she has forfeited none of her rights?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nlaid aside until it is brought back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3509 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I would like to go ahead and speak in \nopposition to the Cohen-Bumpers amendment, while we are here waiting \nfor some resolution on other issues.\n  Would that be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would be in order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have had an amendment offered by Senator \nCohen, on behalf of himself and Senator Bumpers. What their amendment \ndoes is it seeks to empower the Legal Services Corporation to engage in \ncommenting on public rulemaking, testifying before legislative \ncommittees, briefing regulators and legislators on pending bills and \nlegislation. Let me try to give our colleagues a little history of \nwhere we have come from, because I think this is typical of the problem \nwe have in dealing with an agency like the Legal Services Corporation.\n  When the Commerce, State, Justice bill was reported out of the \nAppropriations Committee, I am proud to say that we killed the Legal \nServices Corporation. In subcommittee, a level of funding for \nlegitimate legal aid was entered into as a compromise, and the bill \ncame to the floor. Then Senator Domenici, the Senator from New Mexico, \noffered an amendment to restore the Legal Services Corporation and \nprovide more money for it, but as part of that amendment he restricted \nwhat the Legal Services Corporation could do. Those limitations were \nnot as great as those that we had coming out of committee, but the \npoint is, in that amendment he banned the Legal Services Corporation \nfrom lobbying and from engaging in the process of debating rulemaking.\n  I remind my colleagues, the objective of the Legal Services \nCorporation is to provide legal services to poor people. As we all \nknow, the Legal Services Corporation has become very heavily involved \nin public policymaking. The Legal Services Corporation files lawsuits \nagainst election dates, they file lawsuits involving numerous areas \nwhere people are trying to engage in their relationship with each \nother, and they have become very heavily involved in lobbying and in \ntestifying before committees and doing other things that have nothing \nto do with their narrow mandate.\n  Senator Domenici offered an amendment to raise their level of \nfunding, which I opposed. I spoke against it. We had a long and \nspirited debate on it and I lost. Senator Domenici's provision \nprevailed. It provided more money, but with strict limits on what the \nLegal Services Corporation could do.\n  The appropriations bill that is before us adds $22 million for the \nLegal Services Corporation above the level agreed to in conference. In \naddition, in the contingency section of the bill, the Legal Services \nCorporation would get another $9 million.\n  Now we have an amendment by Senator Cohen and by Senator Bumpers that \nseeks to lift the restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation.\n  Granted, there is a figleaf which seeks to differentiate between what \nSenator Domenici has done and what\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\nthey are doing, and that figleaf is that it allows them to do these \nthings if anyone asks them to do it in a written request.\n  Mr. President, that is obviously going to happen. This amendment is \ngoing to eliminate the restrictions in the Domenici amendment, and my \ncolleagues who offered this amendment both voted for the Domenici \namendment.\n  So, what we are saying here is we had a debate about killing the \nLegal Services Corporation. That was successful in committee. An \namendment was offered on the floor that said, ``OK, we'll give them \nthis money, but only under strict limitations to see that they do what \ntheir mandate is.''\n  That amendment was adopted. As far as I know, all the supporters of \nthis amendment voted for it.\n  Then we came in and added another $31 million to Legal Services \nCorporation in this bill, and now we are going back and lifting the \nrestrictions so that the Legal Services Corporation will be able to \nspend the money on lobbying largely unencumbered and can, in fact, get \nback into exactly the kind of activities that the Domenici amendment at \nleast claimed to prohibit.\n  Could the Domenici amendment have been adopted had this provision \nbeen part of it? My guess is it could not.\n  I do not know where the votes are on this. I am opposed to the Legal \nServices Corporation because I think it is a runaway Government program \nwhich spends entirely too much time and energy and money promoting \npolitical and social causes that are not part of its mandate. We live \nin a great free country. If someone wants to promote their views and \nphilosophy and values, they have a right to do it, but they do not have \na right to do it with the taxpayers' money.\n  I thought we had restrictions that were reasonable under the Domenici \namendment. We are now in the process of lifting those restrictions. I \nam strongly opposed to this amendment and hope to see it defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am saddened by the position taken by \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, was I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will yield so I \nmay offer two amendments and ask unanimous consent that they be set \naside.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 3510 and 3511 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer these two amendments, and I send \nthem to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] proposes amendments \n     numbered 3510 and 3511 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3501\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the \nSenator from Texas for a moment, there is no point belaboring this \nissue. I want to make three or four salient points.\n  First, the 19 restrictions that were put on the corporation's \ngrantees are not touched in this amendment. They are still intact. Many \nof them deal with lobbying.\n  Second, no Federal funds can be used to carry out the actions \npermitted by this amendment. Only non-Federal funds received by a \ngrantee may be used.\n  Third, the request has to come from a legislator, a Member of \nCongress, or an agency to a grantee. Let me give the Senator from Texas \nthis illustration.\n  Let us assume that in the State of Texas the legislature thinks that \nthe Legal Services Corporation's grantees in that State are doing a \nsuper job, but the Federal funds have been cut off, we have reduced \nLegal Services Corporation funding.\n  Let us assume the Texas State Legislature wants to give a few million \ndollars to some of the Legal Services Corporation grantees, but before \ndoing so, they would like for some of those people to come in and \ntestify as to what their activities have been and maybe limit the use \nto which they can put the money the legislators propose to give them.\n  First, they have to make a request, we will say, of the Dallas \ngrantees, Legal Services of Dallas. If the State Legislature of Texas \nor a legislator or a committee wants to ask that grantee to come in, \nthey would have to direct it in writing and the grantee would have to \nrespond to that specific request, and only money that the grantee had \ngenerated on its own--not Federal money, money of its own--could be \nused to answer a written inquiry.\n  It seems to me almost ludicrous to say we are not going to allow a \ncommittee of Congress or a State legislative committee or a Senator or \na State legislator to get information that they need to make these \ndecisions, particularly when the grantees are using their own money.\n  What kind of a fix would we be in here? The Legal Services \nCorporation can come in and testify before the Senator's committee and \ntell him why they think they need more money, but a grantee could not. \nThe Senator from Texas, as chairman of this committee, can write to the \nhead of the local Legal Services provider in Dallas and say, ``Please \ncome forthwith before my committee and testify.''\n  As the bill is drafted, even if he submitted it in writing, they \ncould not honor that request.\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\n  I sit on the Appropriations Subcommittee that able Senator from Texas \nchaired. I was there when the debate took place about how much we were \ngoing to give the Legal Services Corporation, and I, indeed, did \nsupport Senator Domenici's amendment. I never heard of such unintended \nconsequences.\n  All Senator Cohen and I are doing is trying to redress a problem that \nbelieve the Senate did not intend to cause. Our amendment does not in \nany way allow grantees or the corporation to do anything to avoid \ncomplying with those 19 specific restrictions. I hope the Senator from \nTexas will reconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that the \nrestrictions imposed in the Domenici amendment applied to all funds at \nthe Legal Services Corporation, not just taxpayer funds. We have spent \nyears debating this issue when the Legal Services Corporation has \ngotten involved in labor disputes, when the Legal Services Corporation \nhas gotten involved in the politics of disputing election dates, when \nthe Legal Services Corporation has become involved, basically, in \npolitical and partisan causes.\n  It has often reminded me of an analogy you might have of the pastor \nof the First Baptist Church going to the Baptist student union and he \ndiscovers a brothel in one of the back rooms. The argument that would \nbe made by the Senator from Arkansas is, ``Well, it just so happens \nthat we didn't use the money from the Baptist Church for that room. \nActually, only 80 percent of our budget comes from the Baptist Church, \nand that room was not part of the funds that came from the Baptist \nChurch, and the electricity it used, and the natural gas for heating \nwere not part of that budget.''\n  The point is, no pastor would ever buy into that logic. So when the \nDomenici amendment was offered, it recognized this problem and said, \n``If you take taxpayer money, your job is to represent poor people, \nyour job is not advocating political causes.'' That was the purpose of \nthe Domenici amendment.\n\n  If our colleague from Arkansas was willing to limit this to simply \nappearing before committees to ask for money, I might be willing to \nagree to that. But clearly he is not going to agree to that limitation. \nWhen you allow the Legal Services Corporation to be involved in all of \nthese activities based on a written request, what you are doing is \ncircumventing the limitations that we imposed in the Domenici \namendment.\n  So, we first get the money by saying we are going to restrict the \nactivities, and then we come back in a second amendment and we take the \nrestrictions off. It seems to me that those who voted for the Domenici \namendment basically had put together a deal that they wanted the money, \nthe money was supposed to go to help poor people get legal services, \nand they were willing as part of that to have strict limits on what the \nLegal Services Corporation could do with its money. It could not lobby, \nit could not be involved in political activities. There were a series \nof other restrictions that were included, including restrictions not \njust on the Federal money but all money commingled with it. We are now \nseeing an effort to undo that. I am opposed to it. I think this is bad \npolicy. I do not know where the votes are, but if this amendment is \nvoted on, and I intend to vote against it.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may submit \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be submitted and numbered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if none of my colleagues are asking for \ntime, I wish to discuss the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian informs the Senator from \nWyoming that he has not reserved the right to debate the submitted \namendment pursuant to the unanimous-consent agreement at the desk.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Then, I guess I cannot do it. I ask the Presiding Officer \nwhat the arrangement is going to be now. We have a limited amount of \namendments that can be proposed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yesterday, there was a unanimous-consent \nagreement that was entered into reserving the right to offer amendments \nby certain named Senators. The name of the Senator from Wyoming was not \nincluded in that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have it \nconsidered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, before I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration--well, I ask unanimous consent to \ntemporarily set aside the current pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Before I send this amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration, might I inquire as to whether this Senator's \nname is on that list?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The name of the Senator from Indiana is on the \nlist.\n  Mr. COATS. This Senator is pleased to hear that information.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3513 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n     (Purpose: To amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \n  governmental discrimination in the training and licensing of health \n    professionals on the basis of the refusal to undergo or provide \n           training in the performance of induced abortions)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     Sec.  .

Mr. President, I do not intend to debate this amendment at \nthis particular time. I have been in negotiations with the Senator from \nCalifornia relative to her amendment. We are attempting to work out an \nagreement whereby we can offer our amendments for a limited period of \ndebate and prevent second degrees from being offered so that the \namendments can be dealt with on their merits and voted on an up-or-down \nbasis. I want to put the amendment in place so that when we reach that \nagreement we can proceed on that basis. I will just very briefly \ndescribe this amendment, without debating it, for my colleagues' \ninformation.\n  Until January 1, 1996, the Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical \nEducation did not require that a hospital train its residents to \nperform induced abortions. Such training, if it was necessary, was done \non a voluntary basis. On January 1, 1996, the accrediting council \nchanged its standards and now requires those facilities and residents \nto undergo training in induced abortion procedures in order to receive \nits accreditation.\n  As a consequence, most Federal Government rules regarding \nreimbursement to these hospitals and regarding grants and loans \navailable to residents and resident training programs are pegged to the \nhospitals and training programs receiving the accreditation of the \nAccrediting Council for Graduate Medical Education. These facilities, \nif they choose not to require this abortion training, will lose their \nFederal funding.\n  It is important that they retain this. While there is a conscience \nclause exemption, obviously that does not apply to secular hospitals, \nmost of which do not require mandated abortion training. That is the \nessence of the amendment. It is a nondiscrimination amendment which \nwould prevent any government, Federal or State, from discriminating \nagainst hospitals or residents that do not perform, train, or make \narrangements for abortions. It would prevent, therefore, governments \nfrom denying these providers Medicare reimbursement, loans, or licenses \nto practice medicine.\n  It does not--it is important for my colleagues to understand this--\nthis legislation does not prevent the accreditation council, a private, \nquasi-Government accrediting agency, the ACGME, it does not prevent \nthem from promulgating any standard that they wish to promulgate \nregarding abortion. We are not telling them who to accredit and who not \nto accredit.\n  We are simply saying that if they did not accredit because a \nhospital, for whatever reason--conscience reasons, moral reasons, \nreligious reasons, community standards reasons, business reasons--\ndecided not to mandate the requirement of teaching their residents \nabortion procedures, that they will not be in a position of losing \ntheir funds.\n\n  That is a quick summary of the amendment. We probably will have time \nto debate it more at length, but I did want to offer it and will \ncontinue to work with the Senator from California in achieving some \ntype of balanced approach to these two amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Senator \nfrom Indiana and I are really working to try to expedite these issues. \nThey are difficult issues. They are divisive issues in the Senate. We \ncertainly disagree, but we are never disagreeable to each other. I \nthink that if we can devise a way that we can debate the amendments and \ndispose of them and do it in a way where everybody gets a chance to \nexplain the amendments, I will certainly be happy to agree to \nreasonable time limits.\n  Let me just say on the amendment by the Senator--and I am not going \nto debate at length, as he did not debate at length; I do not intend to \ndo that--it gives me great concern because, in the end, I think what we \nare going to have is a situation where there will be enormous pressure \non hospitals across this country not to teach their residents how to do \nsurgical abortions. I just do not want to go back to the days of the \nback alleys. I feel this would lead us back to those very dangerous \ndays.\n  I will not take the Senate's time at this point to debate this at \nlength. I know we will have a chance to do that later.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as the Senator from \nOregon, notes the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Section 347(b)(3) of the Department of \n     Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 \n     (P.L. 104-50), is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) chapter 71, relating to labor-management \n     relations,''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \nwould serve to restore the basic right to organize to thousands of \nhard-working employees at the Federal Aviation Administration. As many \nMembers are aware, the FAA is poised to announce a substantial \nrestructuring of its personnel system. The authority allowing the FAA \nAdministrator to reform the personnel system was granted as part of the \nfiscal year 1996 Transportation Appropriations Act. The Administrator \nwas directed to have the new personnel system in place and functional \non April 1, 1996.\n  Unfortunately, the legislative language enabling these reforms to be \nimplemented had the unintended effect of taking away the right of FAA \nemployees to be represented by a union and to have the terms and \nconditions of their employment negotiated by their union. Obviously, we \ndid not intend this language to have that effect. I raised this concern \nduring conference committee deliberations on the transportation bill. \nHowever, it was thought by the House subcommittee leadership that this \nproblem could be addressed in the Statement of Managers. As such, the \nstatement of managers accompanying this provision in the transportation \nappropriations conference report states unequivocally that, and I \nquote:\n\n       The conferees do not intend that the personnel management \n     reforms included in this bill, force the disestablishment of \n     any existing management-labor agreement, or lead to the \n     dissolution of any union representing FAA employees.\n\n  Regrettably, since that time, our legislative language has been \nrestrictively interpreted by the Federal Labor Relations Authority. \nBased on their reading, they are refusing to hear any FAA labor dispute \ncases, effectively leaving the FAA's thousands of employees without \nrecourse or resolution in ongoing cases pertaining to pay and \ncompensation, benefits, and discipline.\n  The April 1 deadline for implementation of the new personnel system \nis upon us. If this situation is not resolved by April 1, thousands of \nFAA employees will be left without the right to organize. As such, I am \ntaking this opportunity to include this technical fix in the continuing \nresolution in order to ensure its timely passage and avert any further \nnegative impact.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this amendment by the ranking member of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, and the ranking member \nof the aviation subcommittee, Senator Wendell Ford. The FAA reform \nbill, as reported by the Commerce Committee, would serve to correct \nthis error. However, it is not clear at this time that the Commerce \nCommittee bill can become law before April 1.\n  Mr. President, we need FAA reform. The procurement and personnel \nreforms contained in the appropriations bill will assist the FAA in \nmeeting current and future responsibilities for the safety of our \naviation system. However, other aspects of the reform agenda have yet \nto be addressed. Air traffic continues to rise while it becomes more \nand more difficult each year to fund all of the FAA's needs.\n  Everyone will be asked to make sacrifices as part of the process of \nreforming the FAA. And the FAA employees are willing to do their part. \nThey are among the most dedicated employees in the Federal Service. But \nit is unfair in the extreme to deprive them of rights guaranteed to \nvirtually all other Federal employees under Chapter 71, of title 5, \nUnited States Code--to organize\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nand be represented in collective bargaining. Rectifying this error will \nassure these dedicated employees of a fair process for negotiating \ntheir grievances and a structured process for resolving disputes.\n  I am not aware of any opposition to this restoration of rights for \nFAA employees and I would ask my colleagues to join Senator Hollings, \nSenator Ford, and me in providing a just remedy by adopting this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be set aside for \nconsideration of it at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3519 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the committee substitute, insert the \n     following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no part \n     of any appropriation contained in this Act which is subject \n     to the provisions of section 4002 shall be made available for \n     obligation or expenditure.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this appropriations bill has an \nextraordinary provision in it. In fact, I am not aware that a similar \nprovision has ever been in a bill that I have seen considered in the \nCongress. This is the contingency provision whereby we seek to bribe \nthe President to enter into a budget by saying we will give him $4.8 \nbillion to spend if he will enter into any budget that we will agree \nto.\n  Mr. President, if such a proposal were made by a private party, they \nwould be subject to being sent to the Federal penitentiary. I do not \nunderstand, if our objective is to lower spending and balance the \nbudget, how bribing the President with additional funds will get us \ncloser to home or closer to the achievement of that objective.\n  I know there are many people in this body who are committed to the \nprinciple that somehow if we will just give the President enough money \nto spend, he will do what we want him to do. It seems to me that he \nwill take the money and spend it, and we will end up not doing what we \nwant to do. The problem is, what I want to do is not spend the money.\n  We, in trying to bribe the President by giving him $4.8 billion, are, \nin essence, using as the bribe the money that I want the President to \nhelp us save.\n  Now, we have adjusted this contingency fund because we decided on an \namendment offered by Senator Specter to go ahead and give him $2.7 \nbillion now. So the contingency fund is actually substantially lower \nthan the $4.8 billion. The point remains: We need to be cutting \nspending, not increasing it.\n  While I am very much in support of working out a budget agreement, I \ndo not believe that we are going to succeed by giving the President \nmore money in return for reaching a budget agreement, when we hope the \nbudget agreement will spend less money.\n  It seems to me a contradiction in terms, movement in the wrong \ndirection, and wrongheadedness. Might I say, it shows how we have lost \nour way in this Congress. If anybody told me when the Contract With \nAmerica was passed, when we sent it to the President, that we would be \nnow, several months later, offering to give the President $4.8 billion \nof new discretionary spending authority if he would simply agree to any \nbudget--there is no requirement in this bill this budget be balanced \nthat he would agree to. If he will just agree to any budget with us, we \nwill give him $4.8 billion.\n  As I said, the number has been slightly adjusted because we decided \nnot to wait until the agreement. There was such excitement about \nspending this money that we took $2.7 billion and decided to go ahead \nand spend it, not to even wait on the contingencies. I assume this \namendment will not be adopted. But I want to give people an opportunity \nto vote to strike this contingency fund out. It seems to me that we \nought to be cutting spending, not increasing it. And if we have trouble \ngetting the President to agree to a budget, it seems that the solution \nis to make these temporary spending bills\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\ntighter and tighter and tighter, until the President will finally \nrealize that it is in his interest, as well as the country's interest, \nto agree to a budget.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to send an \namendment to the desk. This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I will \nread this:\n\n       To urge the President to release already-appropriated \n     fiscal year 1996 emergency funding for home heating and other \n     energy assistance, and to express the sense of the Senate on \n     advanced-appropriated funding for fiscal year 1997.\n\n  I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and later on \nI think we will be able to work out an agreement, and I can summarize \nit at that point. My understanding is that we need to get amendments \nin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3520 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n(Purpose: To urge the President to release already-appropriated fiscal \n     year 1996 emergency funding for home heating and other energy \n     assistance, and to express the sense of the Senate on advance-\n                   appropriated funding for FY 1997)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Santorum, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Glenn, and Mr. Pell, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3520 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       The Senate finds that:\n       Record low temperatures across the country this winter, \n     coupled with record snowfalls in many areas, have generated \n     substantial and sustained demand among eligible low-income \n     Americans for home heating assistance, and put many who face \n     heating-related crises at risk;\n       Home heating assistance for working and low-income families \n     with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the disabled, \n     and others who need such help is a critical part of the \n     social safety net in cold-weather areas;\n       The President has released approximately $900 million in \n     regular Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) \n     funding for this year, compared to a funding level of $1.319 \n     billion last year, and a large LIHEAP funding shortfall \n     remains which has adversely affected eligible recipients in \n     many cold-weather states;\n       LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     approximately 6 million low-income Americans to pay their \n     energy bills. More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible \n     households have annual incomes of less than $8000; more than \n     one-half have annual income below $6000.\n       LIHEAP program funding has been substantially reduced in \n     recent years, and cannot sustain any further spending cuts if \n     the program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income people \n     in cold-weather states;\n       Traditionally, LIHEAP has received advance appropriations \n     for the next fiscal year. This allows states to properly plan \n     for the upcoming winter and best serve the energy needs of \n     low income families.\n       Congress was not able to pass an appropriations bill for \n     the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education by the beginning of this fiscal year and it was \n     only because LIHEAP received advance appropriations last \n     fiscal year that the President was able to release the $578 \n     million he did in December--the bulk of the funds made \n     available to the states this winter.\n       There is currently available to the President up to $300 \n     million in emergency LIHEAP funding, which could be made \n     available immediately, on a targeted basis, to meet the \n     urgent home heating needs of eligible persons who otherwise \n     could be faced with heating-related emergencies, including \n     shut-offs, in the coming weeks;\n       Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (a) the President should release immediately a substantial \n     portion of available emergency funding for the Low Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Program for FY 1996, to help meet \n     continuing urgent needs for home heating assistance during \n     this unusually cold winter; and\n       (b) not less than the $1 billion in regular advance-\n     appropriated LIHEAP funding for next winter provided for in \n     this bill should be retained in a House-Senate conference on \n     this measure.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone. \nThis amendment reiterates the Senate's strong commitment to maintaining \nfunding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] \ndespite efforts in the House of Representatives to terminate this \nprogram and urges House and Senate conferees to continue to fund LIHEAP \nat the Senate level of $1 billion.\n  Congress first authorized the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram in 1981 at a time of unprecedented energy costs in order to \nhelp low-income households maintain an adequate level of heat in their \nhomes to ensure their health and safety. This program helps an \napproximate 6.1 million households each year in the 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the U.S. commonwealths and territories. For \nmany of these households, which represent the most vulnerable segment \nof the population, including the elderly, the disabled, the working \npoor and children, the assistance they receive through LIHEAP can mean \nthe difference between having to choose between heating their home in \nthe cold winter months or other vital needs such as food, warm \nclothing, and medical care.\n  Mr. President, a recent study by the National Consumer Law Center \nindicated that there is a widening gap between the level of LIHEAP \nfunding and the total heating and cooling costs for low-income \nfamilies. While the LIHEAP benefits provided to these needy families \ncan not meet their entire energy costs, the average benefit of $216 per \nhousehold for heating assistance can prove critical to the efforts of \nsenior citizens and working poor families on a fixed income to stay \nsafely in their homes.\n  In my own State of Maryland, LIHEAP funds cover only about 20 percent \nof the cost of the average heating bill for eligible recipients. The \nMaryland Energy Assistance Program, which administers the LIHEAP \nprogram, draws on support from other public sector sources, non-profit \nagencies, private industry and public utilities in order to best meet \nthe compelling energy needs of approximated 90,000 low-income \nMarylanders.\n  This collaboration between public and private sector entities has \nresulted in a number of innovative programs to make home energy more \naffordable to the most vulnerable group of Maryland citizens. Special \npayment arrangements with utilities, expanded public education and \nenergy conservation programs, including weatherization assistance, and \ndirect access to other energy-related programs, serve to make the \nLIHEAP program in Maryland a successful coordinated effort.\n  Mr. President, this winter has seen record snowfalls in the Mid-\nAtlantic region and bitterly cold temperatures across much of the \ncountry. This severe winter weather threatened the safety of millions \nof Americans and strained States' ability to help needy families at a \ntime when the budgetary impasse made the very future of the LIHEAP \nprogram uncertain. This program is effective and over the years has \nhelped many families in need with their energy bills. Support of \nSenator Wellstone's amendment will send a strong message to the House \nof Representatives that the Senate will persist in its efforts to \nmaintain adequate funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2036-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2066-S2067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SYMPATHIES TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I would like to move to an amendment that \nhas been cleared which I would like to call up on behalf of Senators \nCohen and Bumpers numbered 3501.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment has already been filed.\n  Mr. BOND. That amendment has already been filed. I understand that it \nhas been cleared on both sides. It is an amendment to permit recipients \nof Legal Services Corporation grants to use funds derived from non-\nFederal sources to testify at legislative hearings, or to respond to \nrequests for certain information.\n  As I understand it, this amendment is acceptable to both sides. \nTherefore, it will not require a rollcall vote. I assume that we can \nmove to a voice vote to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to express my serious concerns with \nthe Cohen-Bumpers amendment regarding the ability of Legal Services \nCorporation grantees to testify on legislation or rulemaking before \nFederal, State, or local government bodies. I will not block this \namendment at this time, but I think this is a topic worthy of greater \ndeliberation and one that should be revisited.\n  Earlier today, I offered an amendment, which was accepted on both \nsides, that was prompted by the oft-reported tendency of LSC grantees \nto exceed the bounds of the law, of its own rules, and of appropriate \nbehavior in pursuing agendas that are often political or ideological, \nand not oriented toward providing legal services.\n  The Senate had a significant debate over LSC funding during our \noriginal consideration of the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation bill \nbecause of this very issue.\n  Even in rejecting the Appropriations Committee's recommendation to \nreplace the current LSC system with block grants to the States, the \nSenate still voted, in adopting the Domenici amendment, to try to focus \nthe activities of LSC grantees on their mission to provide legal \nrepresentation to the needy in legal proceedings. That is the only LSC-\ngrantee activity that the Federal Government has any business funding, \ndirectly or indirectly. Political and policymaking advocacy clearly \nare--and ought to be--considered inappropriate.\n  In this area and others, the Senate has come down firmly against \nFederal subsidies for lobbying and advocacy. Three times last year, the \nSenate adopted different Simpson-Craig amendments along these lines \nthat related to Federal grants, in general. The one that became law, in \nthe Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, prevents any Federal grants, \nawards, or loans from going to IRS 501(c)(4) organizations that engage \nin lobbying activities.\n  The Senate has been building this record on indirect subsidies of \nlobbying\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nand advocacy for two reasons: First, the public should not be forced to \nsubsidize political and policymaking advocacy on behalf of special \ninterests, and second, dollars are fungible.\n  Most LSC grantees take money from multiple sources. It all gets mixed \nin one pot. The more you put in the pot from any source, the more you \nsubsidize every item in that grantee's agenda, including those that \nFederal dollars should not support.\n  I supported the block grant approach to providing legal aid because \nlocal control generally leads to better oversight. Even in the Domenici \namendment, which was a compromise, there were provisions designed to \naddress the concern that we lack adequate oversight and accountability \nwhen it comes to how LSC grantees use their funds.\n  I understand the balance that the authors of this amendment believe \nthey are striking, and I am not unsympathetic. There are some matters \non which it would be appropriate for LSC grantees to offer testimony or \ninformation, in a way that is directly relevant to their mission to \nprovide legal representation to the needy.\n  However, I think there is a risk here that this amendment may enable \nwhat is essentially lobbying. I don't believe the Senate wants LSC \ngrantees to use Federal dollars to free up non-Federal funds to pay for \nactivities we don't want supported by Federal dollars. An indirect \nsubsidy is as real as a direct one.\n  This is an issue that deserves more lengthy and serious debate, and \nthis language deserves closer examination and possibly fine-tuning than \ncan be given in the final rush to finish a 780-page omnibus \nappropriations bill. I look forward to that process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The amendment (No. 3501) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3520\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes to \nsummarize the amendment that I just submitted which has been laid aside \nfor the moment.\n  This amendment deals with energy assistance. As I said to the Chair, \nI think there is broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, there are really two parts to the amendment. I mean \npart of what we are talking about is really bolstering the Senate's \nposition about funding next year for energy assistance as we go into \nconference. This is a commitment that there at least be $1 billion for \nthe whole Nation for energy assistance for people in our country.\n  The second part of the amendment deals with the emergency assistance \nin the here and now. Mr. President, in my State of Minnesota last year \nthere were 110,000 households who received this. This is a lifeline \nprogram for many elderly people, for many families with children, the \nlow- and moderate-income citizens, and quite frankly it has enabled \npeople not to be put in the position of ``heat or eat''.\n  In my State this year, fewer households have been served. I think \nlast year we received about $50 million. This year we received about \n$35 million. What is going to happen if there is no additional \nassistance as these bills accumulate? It is warm right now in \nWashington, but we have had brutally cold weather, and we are going to \ngo back to more of that weather this month. The bills will accumulate, \nand the real concern is that people will not be able to afford those \nbills.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that, as I said, I believe will \nhave broad bipartisan support. I think it really is all about values \nand our priorities.\n  I think what we are saying in this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is \nthat in the United States of America people should not go cold. Surely \nin our country, we can extend a hand and help people who need that \nhelp. This is a program that has not required very much by way of \ninvestment in resources. But it makes a huge, very concrete, and \nimportant difference in the lives of many people. To the cold weather \nStates, like my State of Minnesota, this is a program that is hugely \nimportant.\n  So, Mr. President, I propose the sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nbecause this is an issue that is staring people in the face. It is \nextremely important that people do not go without heat. Therefore, I \nthink it is extremely important that this amendment be agreed to.\n  I can talk more about the amendment later on. Other colleagues are \nhere on the floor. As I said, I hope there will be good bipartisan \nsupport for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. My understanding is \nthat it is in order now to send to the desk amendments provided that \nyou have a prior consultation with the managers of the bill and get \nwhat is known as a ``slot'' to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be laid aside. When that is granted, an amendment \nis in order if the Senator's name is on the list.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not correct that the name of \nthe Senator from Virginia is on the list?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is authorized to offer a relevant \namendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3523 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the District of Columbia from enforcing any rule \n     or ordinance that would terminate taxicab service reciprocity \n          agreements with the States of Virginia and Maryland)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I offer an amendment which I send to the \ndesk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3523 to amendment No. 3466:\n\n       At the end of title I of section 101(b), add the following:\n       Sec. 156. None of the funds provided in this Act may be \n     used directly or indirectly to implement or enforce any rule \n     or ordinance of the District of Columbia Taxicab Commission \n     that would terminate taxicab service reciprocity agreements \n     with the States of Virginia and Maryland.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is not going to be regarded as an earth-shaking \namendment, but it is one that is very important in my judgment to every \none of us in the Senate and, indeed, in the House of Representatives. \nWe have every day constituents who come to visit us from our States, \nfrom many places, and they have to rely upon the indigenous \ntransportation. Part of that transportation is taxicabs operated under \nthe jurisdiction of the District of Columbia, the jurisdiction of the \nsovereign State of Maryland, and the jurisdiction of the sovereign \nState of Virginia. For some 50 years, there has been a general format \nof understanding between these three jurisdictions as to how the taxis \nwill allocate the various customers, business and the like.\n  Out of the blue, the D.C. Taxi Commission, without any notification, \nto my knowledge, of either the appropriate authorities in Maryland and \nVirginia, said that henceforth they are going to start a certain policy \nwhich would be at considerable variance with what had been in place for \nsome 50 years and what is now operating.\n  Speaking for myself, I have lived in the greater metropolitan area \nfor many years. I have been concerned about the quality of the taxi \nservice, the ability of the drivers to understand even the simple basic \nthings--language, locations. I am concerned about the overall public \nsafety as that is associated with those cabs, primarily those cabs that \nare licensed in the District of Columbia.\n  But, anyway, the purpose of this amendment is to not permit any of \nthe funds appropriated for the District of Columbia to be used for the \npurpose of trying to implement such agreements as the D.C. Taxi \nCommission acting unilaterally wishes to put in effect.\n  In my judgment, the proper way is to go to the Council of \nGovernments, referred to as COG, and COG has many\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\ntimes taken into consideration the needs and requirements of the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the great State \nof Maryland, and resolved them. That is what should be done in this \ncase. So I think it is a matter, while not of earth-shaking \nproportions, that should be considered by the Congress in terms of \nsaying to the District: Wait a minute. You are not to implement any \nagreement which will impact on our constituents coming from many places \nto visit the Nation's Capital. Let the Council of Governments arbitrate \na fair allocation between the States of Virginia and Maryland and the \nDistrict of Columbia and work out an appropriate agreement.\n  So, Mr. President, I will soon consult with the managers. Perhaps \nthey can accept this amendment at this time. Otherwise, I will ask that \nit be laid aside.\n  Mr. President, to accommodate the managers and the leadership, I will \nask unanimous consent that my amendment be laid aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. After consultation with the Democratic leader and lots of \nother people, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining first-degree \namendments in order to H.R. 3019 under the previous consent agreement \nmust be offered by 8 p.m. this evening, with the exception of the \nmanagers' package, two amendments by the majority leader, two \namendments by the Democratic leader, one for the Democratic manager, \nand one for the minority manager, and it be in order for the mover of \nthe amendment to withdraw his or her amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \ncertainly do not wish to object, I am also here to protect the \ninterests of the Armed Services Committee and the desires of the \nchairman of that committee, Senator Thurmond, to put in sequence here \nan amendment on behalf of himself and other members of the committee.\n  Could I inquire of the manager if Senator Thurmond could be given an \nappropriate slot, or whatever terminology the distinguished leader \nwishes to use, to put that amendment in?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I might respond, Mr. President, certainly that would be \nin order if the amendment is offered by the designated hour. No time \nhas been set yet as to the order that they will be brought up. We are \njust trying now to ascertain exactly what amendments we have, and when \nthe manager, the distinguished chairman, returns there will be an order \nset up then. I am sure this will be put in the sequence.\n  Mr. WARNER. As I understand, the distinguished majority whip assures \nthe Senator, speaking on behalf of Senator Thurmond----\n  Mr. LOTT. I do give that assurance to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wanted \nto ask the Senator, does this mean that it is--in terms of this \nagreement, I gather that the leaders can offer amendments for Senators \nif they were not here before 8 if those amendments had been on the list \nas part of the original agreement?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my understanding, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object further, Mr. President, I \nwonder if the distinguished leader would consider this unanimous \nconsent request, and I state it at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment that I will \nsoon send to the desk on behalf of Senator Thurmond be filed under \nSenator Thurmond's name in lieu of one of the relevant amendments \nreserved by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. Would there be any \nobjection to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska object?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the body is the unanimous \nconsent request of the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of this new agreement, for the \ninformation of all Senators, there will be no votes between now and \n8:30 p.m., and any votes ordered between now and 8:30 will be stacked \nto occur at 8:30 p.m. this evening on a case-by-case basis. With that, \nI yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3524 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n(Purpose: To reconcile seafood inspection requirements for agricultural \n   commodity programs with those in use for general public consumers)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if it is in order, I will send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], for himself and \n     Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 3524 to Amendment \n     No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page   , beginning with line   , insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SEAFOOD SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any \n     domestic fish or fish product produced in compliance with the \n     ``Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and \n     Importing of Fish and Fish Products'' (published by the Food \n     and Drug Administration as a final regulation in the Federal \n     Register of December 18, 1995) or produced in compliance with \n     food safety standards or procedures accepted by the Food and \n     Drug Administration as satisfying the requirements of such \n     regulations, shall be deemed to have met any inspection \n     requirements of the Department of Agriculture or other \n     Federal agency for any Federal commodity purchase program, \n     including the program authorized under section 32 of the Act \n     of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c).\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment would simply end \nfeatherbedding in the Department of Agriculture relative to the process \nof seafood inspection as we know it today. I am especially concerned \nabout the current regime for the canned salmon industry in the United \nStates.\n  As the Chair is well aware, a significant portion of that industry is \nbased in my State of Alaska, and a good portion of that industry is \ncontrolled, through the State of Washington. As a consequence of the \ndevelopment of the industry over the years, there is an inspection \nprogram operated by the State of Alaska which meets all the criteria of \nthe Federal Food and Drug Administration. This assures the consistent \nquality and wholesomeness of the salmon canned in Alaska. However, the \nUSDA and only the USDA requires yet another, completely redundant layer \nof inspection, the cost of which is charged back to the canner.\n  That means we have a situation where salmon going into the \nmarketplace, going into the Safeway, going into Giant, going on the \nshelves of the grocers throughout the United States--is subject to an \ninspection that has been traditional in the industry involving both \nState and Federal oversight.\n  However, for reasons unknown to the Senator from Alaska, the \nDepartment of Agriculture believes that what is good enough for the \nAmerican salmon consumer is not good enough for the Federal programs \nthat purchase this salmon with taxpayer dollars. So, the USDA demand \nthat the salmon it purchases, available for our programs for the \nhomeless and others, be inspected by an additional USDA inspector who \nmust actually stand in the cannery at all times. This procedure is only \nrequired for salmon that goes into the USDA program.\n  This is an additional cost to the Federal Government, and additional \ncost to the canner; additional cost, ultimately, to the consumer. It is \nreally\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nfeatherbedding. The USDA wants to keep Federal inspectors employed, \neven though they are not responsible for the safety of the salmon, and \neven though the commercial product sold in every grocery in the Nation \nis not subject to this continuous inspection.\n  This particular amendment simply would alleviate this burden and no \nlonger make necessary this inspection by the USDA.\n  I might add, the inspection process as required by USDA often \nrequires far more than just putting one inspector in each cannery. The \ncanneries work well beyond an 8 to 5 day. They work when the fish are \nin, which requires in many cases a continuous 24-hour a day operation \nto ensure the quality of the pack.\n  USDA's insistence is outdated. It has roots that are unfathomable. \nBut the main issue is not its cause but its effect. The programs that \nprotect the average consumer are necessary. They are appropriate. I \nsupport them. But it is not necessary nor is it appropriate for the \nDepartment of Agriculture to add an additional bureaucratic layer \nbeyond the ones in place for you and me.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, at the \nappropriate time, to consider adopting this amendment. I have discussed \nit with some of the floor managers. I do not know whether the Senator \nfrom Virginia has any interest in the subject or not.\n  Mr. President, I will further offer an additional amendment which I \nwill send to the desk. I ask the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3525 to amendment No. 3466\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the approval of an exchange of lands within \n                  Admiralty Island National Monument)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the amendment be set aside for \nfuture consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, moments ago I received a request to send \nan amendment to the desk on behalf of the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the senior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nThurmond].\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3526 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n (Purpose: To delay the exercise of authority to enter into multiyear \n                procurement contracts for C-17 aircraft)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Thurmond, \n     for himself, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Warner, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n     Smith, Mr. Coats, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Exon, Mr. \n     Robb, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Kempthorne, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3526 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 754, line 4, strike out the period at the end and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``: provided further, That the \n     authority under this section may not be used to enter into a \n     multiyear procurement contract until the day after the date \n     of the enactment of an Act (other than an appropriations Act) \n     containing a provision authorizing a multiyear procurement \n     contract for the C-117 aircraft.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nNunn, myself, Cohen, Lott, Smith, Coats, Santorum, Inhofe, Exon, Robb, \nBryan, and Kempthorne. We are contacting other Members, all of those \nbeing members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am of the \nopinion there will be other members of the committee that will seek to \nbecome cosponsors. For that purpose, I ask unanimous consent now that \nfurther Members may add their names.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment which would allow the \nSenate Armed Services Committee an adequate opportunity to review the \nproposed multiyear contract for the C-17 program. I would think that \nall Members who have an interest in ensuring that taxpayer dollars are \nspent wisely on defense programs would support this amendment.\n  This morning, at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \njoined with my colleagues in telling the Secretary of the Air Force and \nthe Chief of Staff of the Air Force how concerned we are with the \napproach which the administration has adopted concerning the C-17 \nprogram. Quite simply, a supplemental appropriations bill is not an \nappropriate vehicle for granting the authorization to proceed with such \na large acquisition program. In my view, there is no justification for \nbypassing the authorizing committee in a decision of this magnitude.\n  We are talking about a program to purchase 80 additional C-17 \naircraft, over 7 years, at a cost of almost $22 billion. If we proceed \nwith the administration's proposal--as contained in the Senate bill--we \nwill be giving the Pentagon the authority to sign a contract which \ncommits this Nation to a major acquisition program with a $22 billion \nprice tag. We will be rubber-stamping a Defense Acquisition Board [DAB] \nrecommendation that an additional 80 C-17 aircraft is the proper \nsolution for our airlift requirements in the future, and that this \nmultiyear contract is the best way to achieve that goal. We must not be \nrushed into such a decision. This program deserves careful and thorough \nscrutiny by the Armed Services Committee.\n  By treating this program separately--by dealing with it outside of \nthe normal authorization process--we will not have the opportunity to \nweigh this program against the other competing priorities in the \nprocurement accounts--across the services. The C-17 program, as \nproposed, will eat up a substantial share of the procurement budget for \nthe next 7 years. We must understand the full impact of this decision--\nfor the entire defense budget--before committing ourselves to such a \nprogram.\n  I remind my colleagues that this is a program which has been plagued \nby problems in the past. The Armed Services Committee has stood by the \nC-17 program in its lean years. It appears that our faith in this \nprogram has been justified. The C-17 is performing well in Bosnia, and \nit appears that the problems of the past have been corrected.\n  Our argument today is not with the aircraft--but with this unusual \nexpedited process that would effectively strip the Armed Services \nCommittee of its responsibilities to examine a proper authorization for \nthe 7-year multiyear contract for the C-17.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3527 To Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, given the time, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3532 To Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 3532 \n     to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, on page 540, line 11 after \n     ``Act'' insert: ``and $5,000,000 shall be available for \n     obligation for the period July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996 \n     for employment-related activities of the 1996 Paralympic \n     Games.''\n       In the pending amendment, on page 597, line 21 after \n     ``expended'' insert: ``, of which $1,500,000 shall be for a \n     demonstration program to foster economic independence among \n     people with disabilities through disability sport, in \n     connection with the Tenth Paralympic Games.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I ask our colleague to just \nwithhold for 1 minute while I fashion a unanimous consent request here? \nThere are amendments still ready to go.\n  When the Senator from Georgia finishes, it will be past the \nbewitching hour of 8 o'clock.\n  I ask unanimous consent if we can keep the amendment filing period \nopen for another 30 minutes--another 15 minutes?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator from Alaska accept a 5-minute delay?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator will accept 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I submit the unanimous consent request for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I simply rise to express some \ndisappointment in the fact that we have had an amendment with respect \nto China and Taiwan that we intended to offer. It has been approved by \nthe administration and the ranking minority member of Foreign Relations \nsupports it. Yet, the other side of the aisle has objected to its \nsubmission.\n  I am very sorry about that. It would seem to me that this body would \nwant to speak out on the China effort. However, through their staff and \nthrough their workings, they have kept us from doing that. We will have \nto bring it up in another fashion.\n  This was submitted by Mr. Helms, Mr. Dole, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Pell, \nMr. Simon, Mr. Mack, Mr. Grams, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Brown, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nD'Amato, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Ford. I simply want to say we \nwill have to find another way, but I should think this body would want \nto speak out on the current situation in China or Taiwan.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I can ask my good friend from Wyoming if \nhe recalls sometime ago this body voted 97 to 1 on a resolution \nwelcoming President Li as he visited his alma mater in New York and the \nissue of our responsibility to Taiwan at that time was discussed at \ngreat length in this body. I think it is fair to say my friend from \nWyoming participated in that debate. This body did vote overwhelmingly \nto support the resolution welcoming President Li to visit his alma \nmater.\n  I believe, as the Senator from Wyoming has indicated, the amendment \nhas broad bipartisan support and, in view of the recent action by the \nP.R.C. to intervene in the first free election process in Taiwan, that \nmy friend from Wyoming could give me any indication as to why anyone \nwould object in this body to allowing a substitution so that this \namendment could be presented tonight?\n  It is my understanding the amendment was not filed. As a consequence \nwhen an effort was made to get a ruling from the Parliamentarian, the \nParliamentarian indicated that substitution would be appropriate if it \nwas perhaps unanimous--I am paraphrasing it--and there was an \nobjection.\n  What would be the basis for someone to object to the consequence of \nthe bullying tactics of the P.R.C.?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have to say to the Senator that I am not certain. This \nwas designed with the assistance and involvement of the administration \nto support some of the things they are doing, certainly to rededicate \nourselves to the commitments that we have made through the Taiwan \nagreements.\n  In any event, I am sure we will make another effort. I am very \ndisappointed we were not able to bring that forward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may follow up with another question. Is the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Alaska correct that the objection was \nfrom the other side of the aisle?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, that is correct, it was from the other side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I hope we have an opportunity tonight to get an \nexplanation as to why there is an objection in this body for bringing \nup a topic that is, obviously, before the entire world as we look at \nwhat China has initiated relative to the launching of missiles to an \narea adjacent to the island of Taiwan, initiated a naval activity of \nsignificant magnitude, when clearly the elections are about to take \nplace on the 23d of March. And it seems, indeed, unfortunate that we \ncannot get an explanation as a consequence of the commitments that were \nmade under the Taiwan Relations Act to ensure that Taiwan was \nadequately provided with enough defensive capability to meet their \nneeds subject to a declining amount over the years, as well as a \nrequirement that the President of the United States evaluate the threat \nto the security of Taiwan, relative to any threat that might exist, and \nreport back to the Congress relative to that threat.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, we have obviously had a significant \nthreat, as evidenced by the missiles, as evidenced by the naval \nactivity. I ask my friend from Wyoming if he would not agree that an \nexpression of support to reaffirm the Taiwan Relations Act would not \nseem to be appropriate, timely, and in order at this time?\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I certainly agree with that analysis and suggest to the \nSenator that we did involve ourselves very deeply in this and had \nbipartisan support, administration support. I think it still would be \nthe desire of this body to have a statement, and we intend to bring it \nup in another way.\n  I thank my friend very much.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I might ask my colleague one more question, since I \njoined with him and cosponsored the resolution to reaffirm the Taiwan \nRelations Act by the U.S. Senate, and that is if it is his intention to \npursue this matter and bring it up on the next vehicle that, obviously, \nis moving? Is that the intent of the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes. Let me say that is our intention, and I do believe \nreally that the Members of this body do want to make a statement. I \nthink this statement generally reflects what we are for, and we will \nmake every effort to bring it up at the earliest possible time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague. I appreciate the reassurance. I \nthink as we look at the tensions in the world today and recognize the \nobligation the United States has under the Taiwan Relations Act that, \nindeed, a voice of support is indicated by the amendment to reaffirm \nthe terms and conditions of the Taiwan Relations Act. The fact that the \nadministration further supports that action, we find ourselves in a \nrather perplexing situation where no one who is objecting seems to care \nto come to the floor and explain the basis for the objection. I commend \nmy friend from Wyoming for his diligence and commitment to persevere on \nsomething that I think is, indeed, appropriate and timely.\n\n  I thank my good friend for joining me in a colloquy.\n  If there are no further Senators wishing recognition at this time, I \nask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes as in morning business \nuntil such time as another Senator seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2067-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2077-S2078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAIWAN AND CHINA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to continue relative to \nthe matter that the Senator from Wyoming and I discussed, because I \nthink we have seen an extraordinary series of events take place. I am \nreferring specifically to the fact that on the 23d of March, free \nelections will take place in Taiwan.\n  It is significant that we have seen an extraordinary activity as \nevidenced by Beijing who has seen fit to harass the process, threaten \nthe Taiwanese with a military presence, missile threats, as well as \nnaval activity of significant merit.\n  The consequences of that effort seem to have been misdirected, \nhowever, because President Li, who is running for reelection, in the \nsense that these would be free elections, is in a situation where he \nhas been attacked by the Government of Beijing, time and time again, as \nfostering independence for Taiwan.\n  Yet, the Taiwanese know, and most of us who have followed the \nelection process are aware, he is not the candidate of independence. \nDr. Peng is the candidate of independence. The people in Taiwan are \naware of the distinction. As a consequence, Mr. President, as they have \ncontinued their attacks on President Li, it has rallied the support of \nthe Taiwanese people around President Li.\n  I can only assume that the attack against President Li was directed \nin hopes that somehow he would receive less than perhaps 50 percent of \nthe vote. Well, we will have to see what percentage of the vote he will \nultimately receive. But clearly the attacks seem to have helped \nPresident Li's popularity in Taiwan. I was recently over there, about 3 \nweeks ago, and had an opportunity to meet with various officials, \nincluding President Li.\n  One of the other interesting things, as a consequence of the presence \nof the PRC in the election process in Taiwan, is an extraordinary \nrealization and identification of Taiwan as a significant voice in \ninternational affairs. Now it seems that there is more concern being \nleveled by Beijing against Taiwan's prominence. Taiwan is called upon \nto participate in humanitarian contributions and various activities by \ninternational organizations. They clearly are one of the most \nprosperous countries in the world, having the highest per capita \ncapital reserves of virtually any other nation.\n  So what we see today is the perplexing situation where, on one hand, \nwe have the focus of a democracy initiating its first free elections, a \nreal concern internally by the Chinese leadership as to what role they \nshould play with their renegade province, recognizing that next year \nHong Kong is basically within the total control of China, when 1997 \ncomes, and in 1997 the people's Congress will meet to basically set the \nparameters for the next 5 years and the hierarchy of the leadership in \nChina.\n  We do not know what the mindset of that leadership is. We can only \nguess. But it is fair to say that their extreme views of what should be \ndone--and as we look at the capability of the M-9 missile and the \naccuracy of that missile to be launched from within China to targets on \neither end of Taiwan, southern and northern target areas, and we note \nthe capability of the naval activities, clearly, there has been a \nstrong signal sent.\n\n  The difficulty in trying to determine just how this is ultimately \ngoing to play out, I think, deserves the action that was proposed \ntonight by my friend from Wyoming, and that is a reaffirmation of the \nTaiwan Relations Act. As I said earlier and we discussed in our \ncolloquy, the President of the United States has an obligation to come \nbefore the Congress if, indeed, in his opinion, the national security \ninterests of Taiwan are in jeopardy. I think the President and the \nadministration's actions so far are to be commended. We have, by our \ndisplay of naval power, intelligence and other assets, basically \nreinforced our commitments to the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  There are a couple of other significant events that probably should \nbe noted, Mr. President, and that is the reality that initially the \nChinese indicated they would cease their missile tests on the 15th. \nFurther, they would cease their naval activities on the 20th. And, of \ncourse, we have the date of the 23d for the free democratic elections \nin Taiwan.\n  So I think we will have to watch those dates very closely, Mr. \nPresident, to see if, indeed, the Chinese are serious in terminating \nthe missile activities, terminating the naval activities on the dates \nthat they have stated. If they do not, why, clearly they intend to \nescalate the tensions that are now in existence. And, as a consequence, \nMr. President, I fear for the ultimate disposition because the Taiwan \nRelations Act mandates that the resolve of China and the issues of \nChina with regard to its two provinces, particularly Taiwan, will be by \npeaceful means.\n  So I guess we will just have to wait and see what the ultimate \noutcome of this is as each day goes by, but I think it is most \nappropriate this body reaffirm the terms and conditions of the Taiwan \nRelations Act. We have already seen, under the terms of that act, the \nability of the Taiwanese to seek military assistance in the form of \npurchases for their defensive needs--I want to stress defensive needs--\nas a prerequisite of the Taiwan Relations Act. That activity has been \ncarried out by the United States on a decreasing dollar amount. We have \nthe request for some of the higher technological capabilities \nassociated with the Patriot missile system as an antiballistic missile \ndefense.\n  There are some of us in the Congress that feel perhaps this is the \ntime to escalate those sales and offer the people of Taiwan the \npsychological assurance, as well as the real assurance, of what that \ntype of technology should be. This Senator from Alaska is reserving his \nfirm opinions on that depending on what the situation is as we approach \nthese dates of significance relative to a determination of whether or \nnot Beijing simply wants to show its strength with regard to Taiwan or \nwhether we can expect an extended period of tensions.\n\n  In my meetings with President Li, I had the assurance that after the \nelections, assuming President Li were elected, that he would initiate \ncommunications with Beijing in an attempt to reduce tensions. I think \nthat that will occur. My concern is what price Beijing\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\nmay demand of Taiwan with regard to easing those tensions.\n  So I will encourage my friend again from Wyoming to pursue the \nresolution that is before this body that unfortunately we were unable \nto bring up tonight because of objection on the other side. I would \nagain hope that some of my colleagues on the other side who have raised \nthese objections would come before this body so that we might enter \ninto a discussion, because obviously, if there are issues that the \nSenator from Alaska is not aware of that are appropriate, why, they \nshould be considered.\n  If it is objection for the sake of objection, why, indeed, that is an \nunfortunate set of circumstances. I hope my friend from Wyoming will \nrenew the request on the next vehicle. I will certainly look forward to \njoining him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see some of my colleagues seeking \nrecognition.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was curious about two things. No. 1, has the Senator \noffered his amendment that would require the Federal Government to buy \nback from the Alaskan salmon industry $23 million worth of Alaskan \nsalmon?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no idea where the Senator from Arkansas came up \nwith that interpretation. The answer is, absolutely no.\n  What the Senator from Alaska has proposed is an amendment that would \neliminate a mandatory inspection by the Department of Agriculture on \nsalmon sold into the Department of Agriculture's food give-away \nprogram, as opposed to the inspections that exist for all other salmon \nthat is canned in salmon canneries throughout the United States. All \nother salmon is canned, is inspected under State and Federal \nregulations, and ends up on the shelves of Giant or Safeway where it is \navailable to all consumers. There is absolutely no reference to a \nmandate to buy any Alaska salmon in this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It does not require the Federal Government to spend \nanything for Alaskan salmon?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It requires the Federal Government to stop insisting \non a dual inspection process mandated only by USDA for salmon that is \npurchased under their program. It does not require purchase of one can \nof salmon.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. All the amendment says is, if any salmon is purchased, \nit would eliminate the dual inspection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No, it says if salmon is purchased by the USDA for its \nFederal programs, that it does not require a special inspection, which \nis the current requirement.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask a couple questions, if I may.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Happy to respond.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Food and Drug Administration's inspection, for \nexample, of canned salmon is for the purposes of determining its \nsafety, that is, that it is clean and edible; is that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think, as a matter of fact, that the process \nrecognized by the FDA--but is actually performed by the State, does \nassure wholesomeness. However, in doing so it also assures the level of \nquality that you and I might find in our favorite store. It is my \nunderstanding that the safety standard is uniform under the State as \nwell as Federal requirements for the inspection before the salmon can \nends up on a Safeway shelf or a Giant Food shelf, or available to any \nretail or wholesale purchase. The USDA cannot explain when we get into \na discussion why it should use a completely different standard than the \none considered good enough for everyone else.\n  I hope my friend from Arkansas can perhaps enlighten me as to why a \ndual inspection would be necessary above and beyond the existing \ninspection that is required for domestic retail and wholesale sales and \nto put product on store shelves in the United States for the homemaker.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask the Senator from Alaska who, in his opinion, \nwould inspect this salmon for quality--not for safety, but for quality? \nSome of it is graded, I guess No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4. Who does that \ninspection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Traditionally, as the Senator may know, we have five \ntypes of Pacific salmon. Obviously, there is a quality differential. \nThe buyers would inspect the salmon by lot inspections. In other words, \neach can of salmon carries on the lid a special code. That code says \nwhere it was packed. It identifies a date, a type, and a quality.\n  A buyer will go into the warehouse--they do not buy from the \ncanneries in Alaska or Washington or Oregon. They go to a warehouse in \nSeattle and make a determination of what quality they want. Do they \nwant pink salmon? Do they want skin or bone? Do they want red or \nsockeye or silver or chum? So the buyer makes that choice.\n  The inconsistency here is if the USDA will buy your salmon, they \ndemand you have an inspector in your cannery even before they say they \nare willing to buy. It is just the USDA. The question is, why?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If the amendment of the Senator only eliminates the \nnecessity for what he has described as a double inspection of salmon--\n--\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In effect, that is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does it apply to anything else except salmon?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am concerned with canned salmon.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It would not apply to anything except salmon?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, it would apply to other canned seafood, but it \nis directed primarily at salmon. There may be a requirement for tuna. \nTuna is not one of the fisheries in the northern part of the west \ncoast, so I am not as familiar with it. I do not really think it makes \na difference.\n  There is an inspection process--both State and Federal, a mandatory \nrequirement, in order for the product to be placed on the shelf of the \ngrocery stores. That applies to other types of fish in a can, as well--\nmackerel, tuna, perhaps.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Can the Senator assure the Senate that his amendment \nwould eliminate the necessity for two inspections? Specifically, an \ninspection by the Department of Agriculture that would apply to all \ncommodities bought by the Department of Agriculture, for example, for \nthe School Lunch Program, it would apply to all canned seafoods?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Certainly, it is the intention of the Senator from \nAlaska not to exclude any. My interest just happens to be in salmon.\n  The rationale behind that is, we have a considerable amount of salmon \nthat is canned in our State and in the State of Washington, and we look \nto find relief in selling a portion of that to the USDA in their food \nprogram. Much to our chagrin, we find out unless that particular pack \nhas an additional inspection, we cannot break into that market. It is \npretty hard to explain why there should have to be an additional \ninspector in a cannery above and beyond the inspections that are \nrequired to put it on the consumer shelf.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, what is the purpose of the amendment? Why do \nyou want to eliminate the Department of Agriculture's right to \ndetermine the quality of the fish?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is not an issue in this regard. They can make a \ndetermination of what quality they want. They do that as a buyer. This \ninvolves a specific inspection. No other industry has to pay extra for \na dual inspection to sell into the USDA program, to my knowledge, \nexcept the fish products industry. I do not believe it is required in \nthe chicken producing areas.\n  I know my friend from Arkansas well enough to know that he is \nconcerned about ensuring that there is nothing more in the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Alaska than trying to get rid of something that \nno one has been able to give a satisfactory explanation for. That is, \nwhy the USDA should demand an inspection for only the purchases they \nmake as opposed to the inspections that are good enough for the \nconsumer and buyers that represent the consumer. If Safeway or Giant \ncome in and buy a carload of salmon, they pick it out by quality. They \npick\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nit out by looking through the lots to determine the various quality, \ndoing samples and so forth. It has to meet a Federal and State \ninspection process to ensure that it is suitable to go to the \ncommercial ventures.\n  That is fine, but the USDA says, ``We will not buy it and put it out \nin our programs unless it has been through yet another process--and a \nvery expensive one for the producers. And it seems that the bureaucracy \nof the USDA want to keep government inspectors on the job and active. \nBut if other systems are good enough for every one else, why should \nthis particular program have to have special exception? That is the \njustification for the amendment.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Department of Agriculture is strenuously opposed to \nthe Senator's amendment. Do you know what their opposition is?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assume their opposition is that there will be less \ninspectors around. They will have to find something else to do, with \nperhaps retraining. It would certainly save the Government some money. \nI am certainly sensitive to the inquisitiveness of my friend from \nArkansas. The question is if we have adequate inspections of the \nproduct, why is it necessary that a Federal agency deems that it must \nhave its own special requirements? I have met with them, I add to my \nfriend from Arkansas, and they have no explanation. They say they have \nalways done it. We said, ``Well, it defies logic. The product meets all \nFederal and State standards of cleanliness, of quality; otherwise, it \ncould not go on the shelves.'' Do we need more? Obviously, no.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, let me tell you what my concern is. I do not \nwant to belabor this. I know that Alaska had a very bountiful salmon \nharvest, and we are all grateful that you did have such a bountiful \nharvest. But a bountiful harvest in salmon, as it does with rice, \nsoybeans, and everything else, sometimes has a down side, where the \nmarket is glutted, the price is low, and the number of customers \ndecline, because they have more than they want.\n  Now, the Department of Agriculture tells me that they have a lot of \nsalmon on hand from 1991 and 1993. I think the way the Senator's \namendment has been represented to me was that the Senator steadfastly \ndenies that, and I certainly accept his explanation. It is his \namendment. I have immense respect for him, and I applaud him for trying \nto do something for his constituents. We all try to take care of the \neconomic interests of our States.\n  But I am concerned about two things. No. 1, I do not understand why \nthe Senator wants to eliminate an inspection procedure which has been \nas traditional as the Sun coming up in the morning, and No. 2, why the \nSenator would want to eliminate that inspection which, it is my \nunderstanding, goes to the heart of the quality of the product. We all \nknow you have sockeye, you have silver, chum, you have a lot of \ndifferent kinds of salmon. I assume that when that salmon is being \ncanned, it is also graded for safety to make sure it is safe to eat, \nand second, for quality.\n  My guess is that if Giant Food were going to buy a shipload of silver \nor sockeye salmon, they would want to have some idea about the quality \nof it. Unless the Department of Agriculture is permitted to make that \ndetermination, nobody knows what the quality is.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, the Senator is incorrect in that assumption. \nFirst of all, the Senator from Alaska does not know anything about the \nchicken business, but I do know something about the salmon business. I \nassume the Senator from Arkansas knows an awful lot about the chicken \nbusiness. We are both concerned with quality control, because you are \nnot going to sell your chicken, and I am not going to sell my salmon, \nunless we have quality control and the assurance that the purchaser \nreceives the highest quality product. Now, that is the case that exists \ncurrently in the canned salmon industry, and as far as I know, in the \ncanned fish industry as a whole. The fish must pass inspections that \nare set out by the State and Federal Government. That seems to be good \nenough for the consumers of the product, except the USDA, which \nrequires--only on their purchases--not the purchases of the Safeway or \nGiant--an extra inspection process. They want a person in the cannery--\nand the canneries are not located in Juneau; they are located out in \nthe hinterland where the fish actually come in.\n  Now, a Federal inspector works 8 hours a day. It is not good enough \nto have just one in a plant because your plant may be working 14 hours \na day. If there are no fish, you still have to pay for that inspector, \nbecause he has to be there.\n\n  What has occurred here is that a giant bureaucracy has developed. I \nsupport the position of the Senator from Arkansas for quality control, \nmaintenance, and so forth. But what we have under the program is an \nindustry check, a State check, a Federal check, and then in the \nwarehouse, a spot check of the entire pack that is going out for sale, \nwhere they randomly open certain cases and look at the quality, look at \nthe wholesomeness of it, actually do a test on a portion of the lot, \nbecause no one can afford to put a product on the market that does not \nmeet the Food and Drug Administration's safety standard of \nwholesomeness--just like the chicken industry in the Senator's State \nsimply cannot afford this.\n  If you were in a situation where everybody was buying Arkansas \nchicken and it met whatever your State requirements were, and your \nFederal requirements, and suddenly the USDA said, ``Well, for the \nchicken we are going to buy, that is not good enough. We have to have \nanother inspector in all of your plants, or we are not going to buy any \nof your product.'' That is the situation we are in today.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator assure me and the other Senators here \nthat there is nothing in this amendment that would require USDA, or any \nother Government agency, to buy any salmon in any amount?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have the amendment in front of me. I would be happy \nto read it to the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is familiar with his amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am familiar with it. It does not mandate a purchase \nof any specific amount of salmon.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The answer to that question is yes or no?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The answer is no.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3525\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Second, that is all I wanted to know. We took a long \ntime to do that. With the second amendment the Senator is offering, is \nthat the Greens Creek land exchange?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska has filed a Greens Creek land \nexchange amendment. It is my understanding, since we both share a \ncommittee assignment relative to some 40 bills that are being held up, \nthat there is also an intent to clear tonight some seven or eight bills \nthat are currently being held in the House, and we hope that they could \ncome over tonight and be accepted. I think Senator Bradley has been \ninvolved in directing as to whether or not that process will be \ncleared. I might add to the Senator from Arkansas that the Greens Creek \namendment is also in that package. I might also add that the \nadministration happens to support the Greens Creek amendment. I know of \nno opposition.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I supported it. Has it been reported out of our \ncommittee?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is it on the calendar?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Hopefully, it will be. Hopefully, it could go through \ntonight. It depends on the clearance.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I support it and will support it here.\n  I am curious. I had a bill. I wanted to put a land exchange in \nArkansas on your Greens Creek exchange. I was told that the Senator \nfrom Alaska, as chairman of the committee, did not want to do that \nbecause it had not been reported out of committee. My question was, has \nthe Greens Creek exchange been reported out of committee?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, it has. It is at the desk now. It could go \nthrough tonight.\n  I find myself picking up the habit of my friend from Arkansas. I was \nreminded by my staff that I am wandering around to the extent of my \ncord. So I had better crawl back.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That habit will never get the Senator from Alaska in \ntrouble.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been some conversation here on \nthe floor which I caught on my television as I went home about the so-\ncalled Taiwan resolution.\n  Since I was the one who put an objection into the unanimous-consent \nconsideration of that resolution, I wanted to tell my colleagues what \nmy problems were with that issue and why I object to the unanimous-\nconsent consideration of that resolution.\n  Mr. President, with the thrust of the resolution, I have no problem. \nI do not agree, really, with all of the wording of it. But you never \ncan always embrace every jot and tittle in words and mood swings. But \nwith the general thrust--which is to strongly condemn the People's \nRepublic of China for, in effect, saber rattling in the Strait of \nTaiwan--Mr. President, with that I have no problem.\n  But, Mr. President, we have gotten into a situation where the United \nStates now has two of our largest aircraft carriers in the Strait of \nTaiwan. We have the largest country in the world, one of the fastest \ngrowing countries in the world, soon to be the largest market in the \nworld, clearly the linchpin of stability in all of Asia, and we are in \na very dangerous situation with them.\n  How in the world did we get there, Mr. President? We got there, in my \njudgment, because of the fault of the United States Congress, because \nof the fault of the People's Republic of China, because of the fault of \nthis administration, and because of the fault of Taiwan and their \nPresident Li Teng-hui.\n  The fact that this fault is shared does not diminish or ameliorate \nthe fact that we have two carrier groups in the Strait of Taiwan in a \nsituation that could lead, probably not to war, but, Mr. President, it \ncould lead to great difficulties. It could lead to an incident--two \nships bump in the night, a rocket goes astray and hits on Taiwanese \nterritory. And there will be those in the Congress who would say, ``Let \nus go. Let us attack. Let us get the smell of grapeshot. Boy, the blood \nis running. Let us go over and fight.''\n  Mr. President, we are playing with fire with the largest country in \nthe world. I am old enough to remember when we egged on the people in \nHungary to revolt. Remember those broadcasts? Some of you will \nremember. They went across the border. We wanted them to revolt, and \nthey revolted. They wanted to know where the United States was, and we \nwere nowhere to be found. I remember women pulling open their shirts in \nfront of tanks and daring them to shoot.\n  Mr. President, before we get our macho up too much, I believe we \nought to rationally consider this question. I believe we ought to \nconsider the basis of our relationships with China and with Taiwan and \ncool our rhetoric a little bit--and yes; condemn the People's Republic \nof China for what they are doing, but at the same time realize that it \nis the Shanghai Communique with its reaffirmations which was begun by \nPresident Richard Nixon, to the applause of Republicans, to the \napplause of Democrats, and to the applause of the country back in 1972, \nand reaffirmed by five Presidents. We have to understand that that \ncommunique, a one-China policy, two systems, peaceful reunification, is \nthe basis of our relationship with China.\n  My problem with this resolution is not that it condemns the People's \nRepublic of China. for saber rattling. I agree with that. But it \nmisstates, I believe, the basis of our relationship with China.\n  In paragraph 5 on page 2, it says, ``Relations between the United \nStates and the People's Republic of China rest upon the expectation \nthat the future of Taiwan will be settled solely by peaceful means.'' \nAs far as that goes, it is correct. It has always been our expectation \nthat it be by peaceful means, and we ought to reaffirm that. But by \nleaving out the Shanghai Communique we are suddenly shifting ground.\n  Mr. President, I believe anyone who thinks that we can shift ground \nfrom the Shanghai Communique, the one-China policy to which Taiwan has \nrepeatedly adhered and stated that they were for, that anyone who \nthinks we can go to a two-China policy and independent Taiwan without a \ngreat deal of difficulty does not know anything about the Far East and \nabout what is going on.\n  If we are to do that, Mr. President, let us do it with our eyes wide \nopen, and let us also do it with our pocketbooks wide open because here \ncomes the new cold war if we are going to do that.\n  That is my objection to this, Mr. President. It is a subtle shift.\n  I asked the author, could we put in some words there, keep everything \nthe same and just put in some words that say, in effect, we recognize \nthe Shanghai Communique. The author told me he had no objection. But \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Helms, does, and \nother Members on that side of the aisle have objection to that. You \nsee, that is the problem.\n  There is an intention in this body to shift ground to retreat from \nthe Shanghai Communique, to go to a subtle recognition of Taiwan as an \nindependent country. That is why I voted against the visit of Li Teng-\nhui to this country, Mr. President. I was the only Member of either \nbody to vote against that visit. Oh, it was a sentimental return to his \nalma mater, Cornell, and we like Li Teng-hui. I met him, and I like him \nvery much. I find him to be a very attractive leader. He is entitled to \na lot of credit. He has brought Taiwan to a democratic system. It is a \nprosperous country. They do business with my State. I am for him. I \nthink he is great.\n\n  But anybody who thinks that was an innocent little visit to the old \nalma mater and that is all it was about, Mr. President, did not read \nthe press. You know he promised no press conference. But they put out \nthe word subtly that, ``If you reporters will be hiding behind the \nbushes when he walks around the Elipse, you just may be able to get an \nanswer to your questions.''\n  When he campaigns in Taiwan, he is stating things that, on the one \nhand, are ambiguous and, on the other hand, are promoting or moving his \ncountry in the direction of independence.\n  Maybe, Mr. President, at some time this body will consider that \nquestion and come to a different answer. I do not think so. I think if \nwe had hearings and fully considered the question, we would say that \nPresident Nixon was right, President Carter was right, President Ford \nwas right, President Bush was right, President Reagan was right, and \nnow President Clinton is right. Indeed, Taiwan was right to go along \nwith the Shanghai communique.\n  Mr. President, I do not propose to fight this resolution because to \nfight the resolution itself would be to indicate that I somehow have \nsome approval of what the People's Republic of China is doing in the \nstrait.\n  I do not. I think it ought to be condemned. When Vice Foreign \nMinister Liu was here 3 days ago and the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia and I had a luncheon for him and had a long discussion with \n10 Senators there, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu made it clear \nthat the friendship of the United States and Taiwan is indelible, there \nshould be no cause for alarm. China does not mean to go to war. But the \nUnited States needs to understand, Vice Minister Liu said, that \nindependence for Taiwan is inadmissible, that all other issues are \nsimple compared to this issue.\n  I think it bears repeating every time we have a chance that we should \nnot by indirection allow ourselves to get into a situation where we are \nshooting out there in the strait of Taiwan and people are scratching \ntheir heads and saying, ``How did we get there?''\n  Now, I said the administration was at fault, and they were because \nthey indicated to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that there would be no \nvisit by Li Teng-hui, and they changed, and after the Congress almost \nunanimously agreed with the resolution inviting Li Teng-hui to the \nUnited States we might understand that, but the Chinese, frankly, did \nnot, because they had been assured, they thought, that there would be \nno such visit.\n  I believe the Congress was at fault, even though I am the only one \napparently, only one who voted that way and one of only a few who \nshared the view that I thought it was a political visit because Li \nTeng-hui treated it as a political visit, the world treated it as a \npolitical visit, and indeed the Foreign Relations Committee chairman \nand other members there have put in resolutions saying that we ought to \nadmit\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nTaiwan to the United Nations--that is reserved only for independent \ncountries--that that ought to be done.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not plan to oppose this resolution, but if it \nis brought up tonight I will want to question the authors of it as to \ntheir intent with respect to the Shanghai communique. It is very \nimportant that the Shanghai communique not be departed from.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I might ask my friend a question.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will yield to the Senator from Georgia for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. NUNN. Is the Senator saying if we are going to consider a \nresolution on this sensitive subject that we ought to hear every word \nof exactly what we are doing, not do it at this hour of the night when \npeople are not paying attention and understand what we say on the floor \nof the Senate?\n  Sometimes we do not take it seriously but other countries do. I have \nreservations about the way this resolution is worded. It is not what is \nin it. It is what is not in it. There is not much I disagree with, but \nit leaves out the whole history of the United States relationship with \nChina, how it evolved under President Nixon, what happened when we \nnormalized, the Reagan communique in 1982. All of that is left out of \nit. We are all concerned about what is going on in China, but we do not \nfurther the cause of stability and peace in that area of the world by \nignoring what we have agreed to, by ignoring the history of President \nNixon's visit, by ignoring the one-China policy which was adhered to \nnot only by the United States when we said that we would respect \nChina's view that that was their policy but also by the people on \nTaiwan. For years that is what has brought stability and prosperity to \nthat part of the world.\n  If they are going to change that policy politically by Taiwan or \ncertainly by military force by China, then we ought to oppose both. We \nought to oppose it vigorously because that is going to cause turmoil in \nthat part of the world for a long time to come.\n  So if the Senator from Louisiana is saying let us go slow, let us do \nnot pass this tonight, I am with him. I think he is absolutely right. \nWe are not going to solve anything. This is more heat than it is light. \nAnd we need to be very careful.\n  I would be glad to work with Senators on that side of the aisle in \ncarefully wording and making sure we reflect the history, making sure \nwe have an overall perspective, making sure we understand the U.S. \nagreements, what we have agreed to. We have not always lived up to what \nwe said we were going to do either. I think we all have deep concern \nabout the dangerous situation developing there. We have deep friendship \nfor the people on Taiwan and deep admiration.\n  So I would just ask the Senator, have I captured the essence of the \npoint he is making here?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia has captured \nprecisely the point, precisely the point. It is not what it says. It is \nwhat it leaves out. It is a subtle shift of ground. It is the mood of \nabandonment of the Shanghai communique and its progeny that are the \nproblem here, and I wish we would just take some time in committee, as \nthe Senator from Georgia points out, to carefully word on a bipartisan \nbasis a resolution that, yes, condemns the use of force in Taiwan; yes, \nreaffirms our commitment to a peaceful settlement of this problem but, \nMr. President, one that, as the Senator from Georgia says, fully \nreveals the content of our policy with China.\n\n  We are in this soup right now with two carrier groups in the Strait \nof Taiwan because we acted hastily and treated the visit of Li Teng-hui \nas if it were simply a visit to the alma mater. I think we realize now \nthat it was a whole lot more. It has gotten us with two carrier groups \nover there. That is what led to it.\n  And so, Mr. President, I say let us go slowly. I do not oppose what \nit says. But let us work it out so it truly reflects American policy.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my colleague will yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will yield to the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2080-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2081-S2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could get a clarification here, I \nbelieve that the Senator has indicated that there would be objection \nand we are not going to have a vote on this issue tonight, as I \nunderstand it, and we had announced to all the members 1\\1/2\\ hours or \nso ago that we would have a vote at or about 8:30. The distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota has been on his feet for probably close to an \nhour now seeking to get recognition to speak on an amendment that is \nthe pending business.\n  Now, Mr. President, is that the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not the pending business. The pending \nbusiness is the amendment of the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell].\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Chair repeat that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment of \nSenator Coverdell of Georgia.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, Mr. President, it would be in order to ask for \nthe regular order on the Grams amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I could finish my one \nquestion of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. In order to wrap this up, I would yield to Senator Dorgan, \nand then I am going to yield to Senator Murkowski. But I would like to \nget on with the business I told the Members we have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I only want to amplify the point the Senator has made. \nThe cloakroom indicated there was going to be a vote at 8:30 on an \namendment that was pending. This is probably an appropriate time for a \nChina debate here in the Senate, but I would certainly support the \ninclination of the Senator from Mississippi to get the regular order \nand move to the amendments that are now pending.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the Senator from Alaska like to----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would just like to ask my friend from Louisiana, \nwith whom I share the responsibility on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and we work together, if, indeed, on page 2, line \n23----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, who has recognition at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like for us to be able to wrap this \nissue up. I know the Senator has some more comments to make on it, but \nwe did say the regular order would be the Grams amendment, I believe.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thought there was a reference to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the majority whip wishes, the regular order \nwill be the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that is the order, Mr. President, and I would \nlike to ask for that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The amendment 3492 is now \npending.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3492\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. I will not take a lot of time. I know \neverybody is in a hurry to wrap this up for tonight.\n  I think this is a very important amendment that I offered last night. \nIt has a growing number of cosponsors as well. It is called the \ntaxpayer protection lockbox amendment. I think it is very important \nbecause I think we have been talking about trying to get a budget \ntogether, spending authority for this Government over the next couple \nweeks, for a couple of months in order to avoid a shutdown.\n  I think it was a glaring example this last week, when we are talking \nabout a\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nlockbox, we are talking about trying to save the taxpayers some money, \nwhen the President asked for over $8 billion in new spending and he \nwants this Congress to come up with that much money.\n  There have been many amendments that have been offered that have cut \nspending trying to save the taxpayers some dollars. Those dollars have \nalways gone for a savings and a cut, but it has never been a cut. It \nhas never reduced the amount of spending for that year. Those dollars \nthat are saved are always just shuffled off into another pot and \nsomehow get spent before the end of the year.\n\n  The request that has been made by the President is supposed to come \nfrom new spending. In other words, there is even some estimated \nsavings, savings that we are going to have if we pass a balanced \nbudget. Since those dollars are out there floating, everybody is trying \nto get their hands on those projected savings dollars. In fact, we have \na number of amendments pending on the floor that are asking for those \nsame dollars to be spent over and over and over again.\n  So my objection is that this should not be a shell game for the \ntaxpayers. We should not be using smoke and mirrors when it comes to \nthe budget. If we are going to reduce appropriations or spending \nlevels, they actually should be reduced. The taxpayers should see that \nbenefit in a smaller budget.\n  Instead, all we do is move those dollars from one hand and we put \nthem into another hand, and at the end of the day they are spent and \nthe taxpayer is handed a larger bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, can we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Just a couple of quick other notes. This is not the first \ntime this idea has been introduced. The lockbox language has been \nadopted by the House three times already, by large votes, the latest \nvote, 373 to 52. Also, it has the support of a number of groups such as \nthe Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, \nthe National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n  Madam President, if we are going to be responsible for the taxpayers, \nwe should get our house in order. If we are talking about saving some \nmoney, let us make sure we do save it and just do not play a shell game \nand put it in another pocket and spend it later.\n  Madam President, I will yield to the Senator from Missouri who had a \ncomment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Does the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think I understand what the Senator is saying here, \nand I think the point is this. When something comes to the floor here \nand we knock funding out of an appropriation, instead of that being \navailable to reduce the debt----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, there are two Senators out here \nspeaking on an amendment. They have a right to be heard. May we have \norder here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senators who are having the caucus in \nthe middle of the Chamber please repair to the Cloakroom?\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized to pose a question to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri thanks the Chair.\n  It is my understanding that what the Senator is saying is, when we \nstrike something from an appropriations measure and we would reduce the \namount of the appropriation, that currently that money is not reduced \nfrom spending, but it just becomes available for spending in other \nareas. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So all the efforts we make to amend spending measures \nhere and reduce them just allow the diversion of funds to other \nsources?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct. The taxpayer is under the belief that \nmoney is being saved in their name, but it is just being moved from one \npocket and put into another.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator's measure would say whenever we reduce a \nspending measure here by amendment, that the reduction would go into a \nspecial category which could only be used to reduce the deficit?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So when we had an amendment to occasion savings, that \nwould be real savings and not just a diversion to other sources?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It seems to me that some of the rules of industry ought \nto apply. One of the great rules of industry is that your system is \ndesigned to give you what you are getting. It may not be designed to \ngive you what you wanted to get, but it is designed to give you what \nyou are getting. We have been getting a lot of debt and maybe it is \nbecause we need to redesign the structure.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is hopefully what this will do. It is the first step \nin trying to change the budget process.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That will be when we reduce the spending on the floor \nas a result of an amendment; instead of that money automatically just \nbeing diverted to other spending, it would go into a special category \nwhich could only be used to reduce the deficit?\n  Mr. GRAMS. And reduce our budget obligations for that fiscal year.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The second part of the Senator's measure is, I guess, \nrelated to revenues. If we project a certain amount of money that comes \nin as revenues and for spending, and then we get more money than that, \nthe Senator creates another special fund, that if our revenues come in \nhigher than projected, that money goes into a deficit-reduction account \nas well?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct. Say our projected revenues will be $1.6 \ntrillion and because of the hard work of the American workers, it comes \nin at $1.7 trillion, that additional $100 billion really should benefit \nthe taxpayers and workers of this country to pay off the deficit and \nnot to be laid on the table for people to grab at it and spend it in \ndifferent ways.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So the bonus would be to the next generation by having \nlower debt instead of a bonus being to politicians to have bigger \nspending?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So the two components are to change the system so when \nwe amend the system and we amend a measure to reduce spending, the \nmoney goes into a special lockbox or fund for deficit reduction, and in \nthe event we have higher-than-anticipated revenues, we sweep those \nrevenues into deficit reduction instead of dumping them into a slush--a \nfund that can be appropriated for additional spending?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If I might commend my colleague, I think this is the \nkind of structural change we need. We have been for the last three \ndecades just amassing debt and passing on the responsibility to pay \nthat to the next generation. It is high time we develop a technique and \nchange the structure, which would provide that when we do have the \ndiscipline to cut a spending measure, that the cut goes to deficit \nreduction instead of just being diverted to something else.\n  I thank the Senator for proposing this measure, and I intend to \nsupport it. I think it is a major benefit, not only to us here but to \nthe next generation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Grams, in supporting the Deficit Reduction Lockbox \nAct of 1995 as an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations Act.\n  This is a simple amendment. Often Members stand on the floor and make \nthat claim that this or that proposal is simple. Well, this is. For all \nthe legislative language, it mandates that if any money is cut from an \nappropriations bill or if revenues raised by the Federal Government are \nin excess of budgetary projections, the money can only be used to \nreduce the deficit or cut taxes.\n  Often a Member will go to the floor to oppose a program or project. \nThe Member will fight to eliminate this or that waste or abuse of \nGovernment spending. And from time to time, the effort will be \nsuccessful and funding to some program will be cut.\n  But unfortunately, instead of using the money for deficit reduction, \nit is often used to fund yet another pork barrel project.\n  Madam President, when the Senator from Minnesota and I oppose \nearmarks and pork barrel funding, we are not taking such action so that \nthe money can be used for some other pork\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\nproject. We are doing so because we want the money to be used for \ndeficit reduction. We are doing so because of the budget crisis that \nour Nation faces.\n  The No. 1 dilemma facing the future of this country is not whether \nanother bridge is built, whether a 13th swine research center is built, \nwhether we do or do not study the effect on the atmosphere of \nflatulence in cows, or if we build another supercomputer to study the \naurora borealis--it is this Nation's debt. What we must do is restore \nthe fiscal integrity of this Nation and the only way to do that is to \nreduce the debt.\n  Two final points, first, I want to note that this amendment has been \nendorsed by Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound \nEconomy, and the National Federation of Independent Business.\n  Second, this body has gone on record supporting lockbox language in \nthe past. During consideration of the line item veto, the Senate \nadopted an amendment regarding the lockbox. The House has also passed \nlockbox language--adopting an amendment very similar to this one just \nlast week. I would hope that we could now follow the House's lead.\n  This amendment will not alone solve this problem. But it is an \nimportant step in the right direction. Together with passage of a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget and the line-item veto, \na powerful body of legislation, we will do much to restore the \nintegrity of the congressional budget process.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], the \nTaxpayer Protection Lockbox Act of 1996. I commend the Senator on his \namendment and am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  It only makes common sense: When the Senate or the other body passes \nan amendment to cut spending, with great fanfare about how fiscally \nresponsible it is and how it will help reduce the deficit, we should \nmake sure that the cut is, indeed, a cut. Many of us in both bodies \nhave been frustrated by supposed spending cuts only to learn that the \nmoney supposedly saved becomes immediately available for spending on \nsome other programs. That just shouldn't happen.\n  The Lockbox Act would be an invaluable help to honest budgeting. It \nwould be a blow for truth in legislating. It would finally put an end \nto one of the gimmicks that has fed so much public cynicism about how \nCongress goes through the budget process.\n  This amendment is very similar to an amendment adopted by the other \nbody, which was offered by Congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho. It is also \nsimilar to one title of a budget process reform package I introduced in \nthe last Congress, the Common-Cents Budget Reform Act. Not only is this \nsound legislation, it also has a good Idaho pedigree.\n  I support Senator Grams in his offering of this amendment and I call \non our colleagues to adopt it. It would remove, once and for all, one \ninsidious way in which Congress in the past have cooked the books. A \nvote for the Lockbox Act is a vote for better government, more honest \nbudgeting, and a more accountable Congress.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I understand the yeas and nays have been \nordered on this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor? The Senator \nfrom Minnesota has the floor. Does he yield the floor? Does the Senator \nfrom Minnesota yield to the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me say to Senator Grams, I share \nhis concern about getting the budget under control, but I have to \noppose this amendment because it violates the Budget Act and is subject \nto a point of order.\n  I do not choose to discuss the amendment very much, other than to say \nto the Senate that the way things work right now, the Budget Committee \nproduces a budget resolution; it is voted on by both Houses and \neventually becomes the budget resolution for both Houses. As far as \ndomestic discretionary and defense discretionary spending, after that \nbudget resolution is completed, the Appropriations Committee, under the \nleadership of the chairman, allocates to subcommittees the amount of \ndiscretionary money that is available for the entire year, and that \ntotal amount of money becomes a cap beyond which you cannot spend \nunless Congress declares an emergency for funds that would exceed the \ncap.\n  Let me give the Senate an example of how far we have come in just \nthis year. By enforcing those caps, we will save $21 billion in just \nthe discretionary appropriated accounts. Without one nickel of savings \nin entitlements, we save $21 billion.\n  What that means is that every bill that comes before the Senate is \npart of the cumulation of subcommittee allocations that equal the cap. \nWe do not need another piecemeal cap, which means on the floor of the \nSenate we readjust the caps based upon what actions we take on \nappropriations bills. We took the action. This year the action is to \nsave $21 billion.\n  I understand there is a fervent desire--and I have great respect for \nit--to do even more than the formal binding caps that were established \nthis year by the Republicans in both Houses, which save $21 billion. I \ndo not believe we should now establish another piecemeal approach to \nreducing the caps on the basis of individual votes on appropriations \nbills on the Senate floor.\n  The last time the House visited this item, they passed it by two \nvotes. I believe the U.S. Senate has a far more reasonable and rational \napproach, which is to send this proposal, this kind of change, to the \ncommittees of jurisdiction so you look at it in the context of the \noverall the budget process, not just this one piece.\n  Having said that, it is with regret that I must make a point of order \nunder section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act. I make the point of \norder.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I want to say I have the deepest respect \nfor the chairman of the committee, Mr. Domenici, and also the highest \nrespect, of course, for the hearing process, but I would like to see a \nvote on this. So I move to waive the Budget Act, and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], the \nSenator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. \nKassebaum], and the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is \nabsent on official business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 36, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 36 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--36\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Brown\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thurmond\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Bennett\n     Dole\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Moynihan\n     Pryor\n     Stevens\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 36 and the nays are \n57. Three-fifths of the Senators duly sworn not having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is rejected.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota contains matter within \nthe jurisdiction of the Senate Budget Committee but the pending bill \nwas not reported by the Budget Committee. Therefore, the amendment \nviolates section 306 of the Budget Act. The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment fails.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3508\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senator Boxer. This amendment will ensure that the \nDistrict of Columbia can make its own decisions on whether to use \nlocally raised revenues for abortion services.\n  I oppose the provision included in the bill as reported from the \ncommittee. Under the committee's bill, neither Federal nor locally \nraised funds could be used for abortion.\n  Frankly, I oppose any restrictions on funding for abortion services. \nBut the language in the committee bill is particularly onerous.\n  Madam President, let me offer three reasons why the committee's \nlanguage is objectionable, and why the Boxer amendment must be \napproved:\n  First, the language in the bill is an assault on the local \nprerogatives of the District of Columbia.\n  Second, it threatens the health of poor women.\n  Third, it is part of a wide ranging attack on women's reproductive \nrights.\n  Let me explain.\n  First of all, the committee's provision is an unwarranted intrusion \non the District's sovereignty. It restricts the ability of the District \nto use its own, locally raised revenues for access to abortion.\n  No other jurisdiction is told how to use its own revenues. Every \nState can make its own decision on using its own funds to provide \naccess to abortion for poor women.\n  Seventeen States, including the State of Maryland, provide Medicaid \nfunding for abortion under all or most circumstances. That is their \nright. Thirty-three States have chosen not to use their funds for \nabortion. I may not agree with them on this point, but it is their \nright to make that decision.\n  The District should be given the same autonomy as the States to \ncreate its own policy about matters of public health. The Boxer \namendment will assure that the District has that right.\n  Madam President, the provision currently in the bill tramples on the \nrights of women who live in the District, especially those who are poor \nand most vulnerable.\n  For poor women who cannot afford basic health care without Government \nassistance, this denies access to abortion services. Poor women should \nhave the same choices to terminate a pregnancy that other women have.\n  Finally, Madam President, the provision in the bill as it now stands \nis part of a disturbing series of assaults on women's reproductive \nrights.\n  Throughout the fiscal year 1996 appropriations process, we have seen \none attack after another on women's constitutionally protected right to \nchoose. I strongly oppose these efforts to chip away at women's rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Boxer amendment. I would prefer \nto strike the entire provision, so that there would be no restrictions \non either the Federal funds or locally raised revenue. But I recognize \nthat is not possible given the current composition of this body.\n  So while it may be that we cannot strike the restriction on Federal \nfunds, surely at a minimum we must protect the right of the District of \nColumbia to use locally raised revenues as it sees fit.\n  Not to do so violates the District's right to determine its own \naffairs. It is unfair to poor women who reside in the District. And, it \nis one more effort to undermine reproductive rights.\n  I urge support of the Boxer amendment.\n\n\n                                 pride\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto commend the subcommittee chairman for his leadership and for his \nsensitivity to the alarming rate of increased drug use among our teens.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my good friend and share his concern about drug \nuse among our youth.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In my capacity as chairman of the Western Hemisphere \nSubcommittee for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I recently \nheld a field hearing in my home State of Georgia about drugs. One of \nthe witnesses, Dr. Thomas J. Gleaton who is the president of the \nParents' Resource Institute for Drug Education or PRIDE, testified that \nwe are on the brink of a national disaster. I frankly agree with him.\n  Dr. Gleaton testified that teen drug use peaked in 1979 when 55 \npercent of senior high school students reported using an illicit \nsubstance in the previous year; that level dropped steadily through \n1992 to 25 percent. However, the shocking evidence over the past 3 \nyears shows a rapid reversal. If current trends continue, drug use will \npass the high mark of 1979, and we will have more high school seniors \nusing drugs than are not. That, to me, is shocking.\n  One of the reasons I am sold on PRIDE's approach to this growing \nproblem is its emphasis on parental involvement as a main deterrent to \ndrug use among our children. A recent Barbara Walters interview with \nColin Powell illustrates the power of parental involvement. Ms. Walters \nasked General Powell if he had ever used drugs. General Powell replied \nthat he never used drugs because if he had, he would have had to answer \nto his mother.\n  I would ask the Senator if he, in his capacity as the chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee, \nwould support using a portion of Office of Justice Programs funding to \nmaintain the work of groups who seek to stop drug use among our \nchildren through grassroots efforts like PRIDE?\n  Mr. GREGG. The subcommittee shares the Senator from Georgia's belief \nthat an important component in winning the war against drugs is putting \nan end to drug use among our youth. Further, the subcommittee would \nencourage the Office of Justice Programs to support grassroots efforts \nlike the one described by the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my friend and appreciate his support.\n\n\n                       mental health block grant\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to express my concern \nabout the funding level proposed in this bill for the mental health \nblock grant. While I am pleased that the bill retains separate funding \nfor the Path Program, which provides critical services to homeless \nAmericans with mental illnesses, the mental health block grant proposal \nis another matter. The Senate cuts the block grant by 18 percent, down \nto $226.3 million, while the House proposes level funding at $275.4 \nmillion.\n  Cutting the block grant is penny wise and pound foolish. The block \ngrant is the primary Federal discretionary program supporting \ncommunity-based mental health services for adults and children. States \nuse the block grant to fund community-based treatment, case management, \nhomeless outreach, juvenile services, and rural mental health services \nfor people with serious mental illness. The block grant plays a \nparticularly important role in States like New Mexico where we have \nnumerous underserved areas where there is often inadequate access to \nmay different types of vital health care services.\n  The block grant provides up to 39.5 percent of the Community Mental \nHealth Services budget controlled by State mental health agencies. \nAlthough it constitutes a small portion of many States' overall \nspending on mental health, its impact on community-based services is \nundeniable.\n  The bill cuts block grant funds at a time when States are placing \nmore emphasis on cost-effective community-based services. More and more \nStates are closing or downsizing their State hospitals in an effort to \nsave funds. The States are replacing those services with more cost-\neffective services at the community level. The block grant helps ensure \nthat individuals who leave institutions have somewhere to go for \ntreatment, and are not simply relegated to the streets.\n  According to the National Association of State Mental Health Program \nDirectors, fiscal year 1993 was the first\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\ntime that State hospital inpatient spending equalled spending on \ncommunity-based services. The mental health block grant played an \nimportant role in this transition, and I believe this trend will only \ncontinue in the future.\n  I understand very well the constraints facing the Appropriations \nCommittee. But I believe the spending in the mental health block grant \nis cost-effective, and if the House is willing to provide level \nfunding, it is my hope that the Senate can do so as well. I urge the \ncommittee to accept the House number.\n\n\n     epa research facility, research triangle park, north carolina\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator \nChafee, to clarify the intent of his amendment concerning funds to \nconstruct a new research facility for the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency at Research Triangle Park, NC.\n  I understand the chairman's concern that this proposed project be \nreviewed by the appropriate authorizing committees of the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives. However, I have a concern that if the \nCongress does not act in time for contracts to be awarded in this \nfiscal year, that the cost will escalate dramatically.\n  I believe that the distinguished chairman is aware of my 2-year \nefforts to lower the overall costs associated with the project. As \nsuch, it would be unfortunate to experience needless delay resulting in \nhigher costs to the taxpayers. Does the chairman intend to schedule \ncommittee consideration of a resolution authorizing this project in the \nnear future?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would be pleased to respond to the Senator's question. \nI am indeed aware of your successful efforts to lower the overall costs \nof this important project. It is not my intention to sacrifice these \nsavings by delaying authorization. Instead, this amendment will \npreserve the Environment and Public Works Committee's authority to \nreview and determine spending levels for the construction of Federal \nbuildings.\n  With respect to committee consideration of a resolution authorizing \nthe project, it is my intention to schedule a business meeting as \nexpeditiously as possible. I am confident that we could consider a \nresolution well before the April 19, 1996, deadline established in the \namendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I appreciate the chairman's response. I have one final \nquestion for the chairman. Will the prospective committee resolution \nallow for multi-year funding? That is, will the authorization permit \nincremental appropriations over the next few fiscal years for this \nproject to be completed?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. Authorizations provided by committee resolutions \napproving construction of Federal buildings stand unless and until \nsubsequently modified by the committee.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3493\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto explain my vote today in support of Senator Murray's amendment to \nthe Omnibus Rescissions and Appropriations Act. A year ago this body \npassed what had become known as the salvage timber rider. Given the \nthreats this provision posed to the health of many valuable forest \nenvironments and the potential impacts of harvesting timber under \nsuspension of environmental laws on fish and wildlife habitat, I \nopposed that amendment. Today, I supported Senator Murray's amendment \nfor the same reason. Senator Murray's amendment offered our Nation a \nreasonable, well thought out, environmentally and economically sound \nalternative to current law on timber salvage.\n  Although many people feel that any timber salvage program threatens \nour natural resources, I believe our Nation needs an effective, \nenvironmentally sound timber salvage program that addresses the risks \nposed by persistent drought, disease, and insect infestation. Senator \nMurray has met the challenge of developing a reasonable and effective \nresponse to this issue.\n  I am supporting Senator Murray's amendment for several reasons: \nFirst, it repeals the previous salvage timber amendment; second, it \ninstitutes a temporary program that increases public participation in \nsalvage timber sales; third, it mandates compliance with all \nenvironmental laws; and, finally, it requires a comprehensive study of \nforest health by the National Academy of Sciences.\n  I applaud Senator Murray for her diligence and hard work in bringing \nthis amendment to the floor. Mrs. Murray developed an approach that \ngarnered the support of a wide array of constituents, a formidable task \non any issue.\n  Our Nation has reached a point where we can no longer tinker at the \nedges of the forest management system of our country. For both economic \nand environmental reasons, we need to create certainty in how our \nforests will be managed. I believe that Senator Murray's amendment is a \npositive step in that direction and will resolve what has been a \ndifficult and unsustainable situation.\n\n\n                    Joint Implementation Activities\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, it has come to my attention that there \nmay be a need to give the Environmental Protection Agency additional \nguidance and budgetary flexibility regarding their support for climate \nchanges studies in developing countries and their contribution to joint \nimplementation activities carried out by Federal agencies to reduce \nCO2 emissions worldwide. At present, a total of $8 million is \nappropriated for these activities in the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  As I understand it, there is a development consensus that the United \nStates can achieve significantly greater CO2 reductions and better \nvalue for dollars spent by supplementing that $8 million with another \n$4 million, drawn from the general allocations provided to the global \nclimate account. CO2 reductions accomplished under joint \nimplementation activities accrue to the United States. I am not \nproposing that we incorporate this direction to EPA today, but I am \nsuggesting that this is an issue that we should discuss prior to and \nduring conference with the House, especially if this kind of \nprogrammatic flexibility will assure that we achieve our environmental \nobjectives in a way that is most cost effective and which demonstrates \nthe United States commitment to environmental protection.\n\n\n                 TERMINUS OF THE NATCHEZ TRACE PARKWAY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Natchez Trace Parkway is nearing the end of \nconstruction on 445 miles of historic roadway through Mississippi and \nTennessee. The parkway has been under construction since 1937 and only \nthe final 20 miles remain to be completed along with an Intermodal \nVisitor's Center at the terminus in Natchez, MS, a cost-share project \nthat combines Federal, State, and local funds.\n  The fiscal year 1996 Interior section of the Omnibus consolidated \nrescissions and appropriations bill contains $3,000,000 for \nconstruction of the Natchez Trace Parkway. This $3,000,000 is \ninsufficient to complete construction of any of the remaining miles on \nthe parkway and the National Park Service has indicated that the \nappropriated funds can be used for the cost-share visitor center \nproject to be located at the terminus of the parkway. This transfer of \nfunds will be a single appropriation to the National Park Service to be \nused for the construction of the visitors center.\n  I have worked on this project with my friend and colleague, Senator \nGorton, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, \nand Senator Byrd, my friend from West Virginia and distinguished \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee and ask them if they are \nin agreement that it would be acceptable for the $3,000,000 provided \nfor construction on the Natchez Trace Parkway in fiscal year 1996 to be \nused for the project at the parkway's terminus?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct. In providing these funds the committee \nis aware of the need to initiate construction of the Intermodal Center, \nand that providing these funds would fulfill the Federal commitment to \nthis cost-shared visitor center project.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the chairman and my friend from Mississippi \nthat using these funds for such a project at the terminus of the \nNatchez Trace Parkway is a proper use of the appropriated funds, and \nthat agreeing to this proposal at this time will not impose any outyear \nconstruction costs for this project on the Interior bill.\n\n\n                           generic ranitidine\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH, Madam President, today the distinguished Senator from\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nArkansas offered a statement with regard to patent litigation \nconcerning an application filed with the FDA for generic ranitidine. In \nfact, that applicant has declined several opportunities to expedite \nthis case. Moreover, the applicant has introduced a new counterclaim \nwhich will begin a new round of discovery, thereby significantly \ndelaying the trial.\n  Geneva filed an ANDA for generic ranitidine tablets and notified \nGlaxo Wellcome in March 1994. Glaxo Wellcome filed a patent \ninfringement suit in March 1994. Under the Hatch-Waxman procedures, the \n30-month statutory injunction runs through September 1996. A trial date \nhas not been set.\n  A trial court decision is not considered final if an appeal is taken. \nThus it is highly unlikely that a final court ruling will occur prior \nto September 1996.\n  Even if the trial had already begun, it is unlikely that the trial \nand appeal could be completed by September. In an earlier patent \ninfringement case against Novopharm with respect to the validity of the \nForm 2 patent, the trial court ruled in Glaxo Wellcome's favor in \nSeptember 1993. Novopharm appealed the same month, but the appeal was \nnot decided for 19 months, in April 1995.\n  Geneva had delayed the case. After their initial request for an \nexpedited trial, Geneva has made little effort to expedite the \nproceedings, even after the district court in Royce versus Bristol \nMyers Squibb ruled that the FDA could approve ANDA's prior to the GATT-\namended patent expiration dates.\n  Also, after the discovery schedule was set in January of this year, \nGeneva amended their original complaint to add a new action. Glaxo \nWellcome has argued against allowing them to amend their complaint \npartially because it will open up the discovery process and further \ndelay the proceedings, probably beyond the July 1997 patent expiration \ndate for Zantac.\n\n\n                             crop insurance\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I rise to call attention to a serious \nproblem facing our Nation's farmers. Currently farmers are required to \npurchase crop insurance coverage to be eligible for farm program \nbenefits. The deadline for purchasing crop insurance has already \nexpired for southern commodities and will expire Friday, March 15, for \nmidwestern commodities. Under normal circumstances, these deadlines \nwould not be a problem; however, the farm bill has yet to be enacted, \nfarm program provisions have not been announced, and farmers are \nuncertain about what crops they can or can't plant and still be \neligible for farm program benefits.\n  As you know, I have strongly supported a viable crop insurance \nprogram and have urged farmers to utilize important risk management \ntool. However, to require farmers to meet the crop insurance closing \ndeadlines without knowing what will be in the farm bill, what they can \nor can't plant, or whether or not they even have to purchase crop \ninsurance at all does not make common sense to me.\n  Madam President, I would prefer to address this issue by simply \nextending the deadline to purchase crop insurance, but I understand it \nwill be scored by CBO as and cost and thus require an offset.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, my colleague raises a valid and \nimportant point. Farmers are in fact, facing uncertainty and a \npotentially serious situation concerning purchase of crop insurance for \n1996. Many believe they are not going to be required to buy it; others \nmay believe that they are already covered when, in fact, they aren't \nbecause the automatic extension of their 1995 policy won't cover all \nthe crops they may plant in 1996. For example, a farmer who planted \ncotton last year and corn this year is not covered under an extension \nof his old policy. And, because the closing date has or soon will pass, \nhe will not be able to purchase insurance.\n  I am pleased to report to the Senate that the conferees on the farm \nbill are aware of this issue. I hope my colleagues will work to see \nthat this is addressed as part of the conference agreement on that bill \nby temporarily extending the purchase date for those producers who want \nto purchase insurance. We should not send a mixed message by allowing \nbroad cropping flexibility, while remaining totally inflexible about \ninsurance purchase dates for the 1996 crops.\n  I appreciate the designated Democratic leader for raising this \nimportant issue. I agree this is a problem and should be corrected.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3513\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Coats. The amendment would allow hospitals whose \nprograms have not been accredited by the Accreditation Council on \nGraduate Medical Education [ACGME] to continue to receive Federal funds \nif the accreditation was denied because the program did not provide \nabortion training.\n  Let me share with you three reasons why I oppose the amendment.\n  First of all, if the amendment is adopted, the Congress will be \nimposing its judgment of what should be taught in OB/GYN residency \nprograms over that of the medical professionals of the ACGME.\n  Second, the amendment would create a bureaucratic nightmare. If \nFederal agencies cannot be guided by ACGME accreditations in \nadministering Federal programs, what standards will be used?\n  Third, under this amendment the number of physicians trained to \nprovide abortions--a legal medical procedure--will continue to decline, \njeopardizing women's health.\n  As my colleagues know, the ACGME is a private medical accreditation \nbody which sets the standards for over 7,400 residency programs in this \ncountry. The American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Association of Medical Colleges, the American \nBoard of Medical Specialties, and the Council of Medical Specialty \nSocieties are all a part of ACGME.\n  They are the medical experts who know what should be included in a \ncomplete medical training program. Earlier this year, the experts of \nthe ACGME unanimously agreed that ACGME's standards should be modified \nto require that residency programs providing training in abortion \nprocedures.\n  But, let me be clear. The ACGME recognized that people and \ninstitutions have strongly held beliefs on the issue of abortion. So, \nthe ACGME ensured that these new standards do not compel any \ninstitution or person with moral or religious objections to abortion to \nparticipate in training. It respects the beliefs of individuals and of \ninstitutions. Under the ACGME policy, training programs with moral or \nreligious objections are permitted to refer their students to other \nfacilities to receive this training.\n  I believe the Congress should respect the medical expertise and \njudgment of the ACGME. Politicians should not be setting the standards \nfor medical residency programs. That is the job of experts.\n  It is ironic that at a time when we see efforts to reduce the role of \nbig government, proponents of this amendment seek to substitute the \njudgment of government for what should be the judgment of medical \nexperts.\n  If this amendment is adopted, Federal agencies will face a \nbureaucratic nightmare. If Federal programs cannot rely on the ACGME \naccreditation in making decisions on funding medical education or other \nprograms, what standard should they use?\n  Will the Government have to devise another Federal accreditation \nstandard? Will the Federal Government require the States to set up new \nstandards? It seems to me that either of these options results in more \nredtape for medical programs, more bureaucracy, and more government \ninvolvement in the private sector.\n  Do we allow residence programs to receive Federal funds if they have \nnot had to receive any accreditation at all? This option would mean \nresidency programs have not had to meet any quality of care standard at \nall. Surely that is not in the best interests of patients or medical \ninstitutions. And, surely that cannot be the intent of those offering \nthis amendment. Yet, I fear that it could well be the result.\n  Let me make one further point, Madam President. There is a growing \nshortage of physicians who are trained in abortion procedures and \nwilling to provide abortion services. This constitutes a serious risk \nto the health of America's women, for whom access to safe and legal \nabortion is disappearing.\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\n  In fact, in 45 States, the number of physicians who perform abortions \ndeclined between 1982 and 1992. Currently, in 84 percent of counties in \nthe United States, not a single physician provides abortion services. \nAt the same time, the number of residency programs that routinely offer \ntraining in first-trimester abortions has declined from 23 percent in \n1985 to only 12 percent in 1992.\n  Abortion is legal in this country. But the constitutionally protected \nright to choice is endangered if there are no physicians trained in \nproviding abortion services. It is essential that women who need \nabortion services have access to qualified and well-trained health care \nproviders.\n  That is what the ACGME standards would ensure. That is why the \nCongress should not undermine the ACGME standards. That is why this \namendment should be defeated.\n\n\n        department of justice local law enforcement block grants\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if I could I would like to engage the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] in a colloquy with \nrespect to provisions in this bill which relate to funding under the \nJustice Department Violent Crime Reduction Programs, State and Local \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Program. I am specifically speaking to the \nissue of the local law enforcement block grants. It is my understanding \nthat in the case of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the authority to \nenforce felony crime statutes is vested solely in the Commonwealth \nPolice Department. it is also my understanding that when the committee \ntook up this provision that the committee did not intend to preclude \nthe Puerto Rico Commonwealth Police Department, the only law \nenforcement agency with the authority to enforce our felony crime \nstatutes, from being eligible for community policing funds. Is my \nunderstanding correct that the committee was unaware of this specific \ncircumstance with respect to Puerto Rico?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is correct, the committee was in fact unaware \nof these circumstances.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would hope that the Senator would ensure that this \nmatter is clarified when this bill reaches conference and the final \nconference agreement reflects that the terms and conditions of the \nlocal law enforcement block grants do not preclude the Puerto Rico \nCommonwealth Police Department from being eligible for community \npolicing funds?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I want to assure my good friend from Louisiana, that \non behalf of the committee that we intend to correct this matter in \nconference.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I want to thank my good friend from New Hampshire for \nthis clarification. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the bill now before us in the 10th \ncontinuing resolution for this fiscal year. That is 10 times too many. \nWe should and could have done better. The American people have \npatiently endured two major Government shutdowns which severely \ndisrupted their lives. Americans deserve to know that their Government \nwill remain open, that it is not in danger of another shutdown. They \ndeserve to know that agencies that perform important functions, and \nthat affect all of our lives, are funded through the fiscal year 1996 \nyear.\n  We are over 5 months into the fiscal year 1996. The fiscal year is \nnearly half over, yet we are still operating our Government in a \npiecemeal fashion. Five appropriation bills remain pending. These bills \ninclude funds for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and dozens \nof other agencies.\n  Rather than passing another stop-gap continuing resolution, we should \ncomplete action on the remaining appropriation bills. We should be \nworking to avoid another Government shutdown. Hostage-taking and \nlegislative blackmail is not the way to arrive at the kind of solution \nwe need to solve our budgetary problems.\n  As you know, a number of the provisions of this legislation have been \nvetoed by the President or have drawn veto threats. The President \nindicated that insufficient funding for priority programs was a major \nreason for his vetoes.\n\n  When this bill arrived in the Senate it lacked over $8 billion in \nfunds for important programs. The President identified several high \npriority programs in the areas of education, crime, and the environment \nand called for $8.1 billion to be added back to those programs. He also \noffered a number of suggestions to offset that spending; the \nadministration's budget offsets come from potential savings in other \nareas of the budget, so that we can restore funding without increasing \nthe deficit. However, rather than incorporating the administration's \nrequest, the committee responded by adding back only $4.8 billion. On \nthe face of it, this additional spending appears to be a move in the \nright direction. However, this money is not real; this money is \ncontingent on future actions that may or may not occur. As a result, \nthe President has threatened to veto this bill in its current form.\n  If we are to make real progress we need to get our priorities \nstraight. In a recent poll, Americans stated that they were concerned \nabout education, crime, jobs, and health care. Americans are concerned \nabout earning a fair wage, about their children's education, and about \ntheir ability to live in safe and healthy communities. Spending \npriorities should reflect these priorities.\n  Domestic discretionary spending is being badly squeezed in this bill. \nHowever, domestic discretionary spending is not one of the major causes \nof the budget crisis the Federal Government is facing. Domestic \ndiscretionary spending has not grown as a percentage of the GDP since \n1969, the last time we had a balanced budget. Domestic discretionary \nspending comprises only one-sixth of the $1.5 trillion Federal budget, \nand that percentage is steadily declining.\n  While I firmly believe that if we are to stay on track and balance \nthe budget, every program needs to be reviewed for spending reduction. \nHowever, I believe that these reductions need to be made in a fair and \nequitable way. This bill, however, guts important programs upon which \nmillions of working Americans depend.\n\n\n                              JOB TRAINING\n\n  One of the greatest concerns of public officials, nonprofits, and \nbusiness groups throughout my State is that Congress is eliminating the \nsummer jobs program for youth. This program trains young people for \njobs that actually exist, teaches them about work habits, and keeps \nthem off of the streets and out of harms--or troubles--way. Cities and \ntowns throughout Illinois are telling me that young people count on \nthese jobs, but that without funding at the $635 million level, there \nwill be almost no summer program.\n  Programs such as those that provide young people with summer \nemployment and job training, train dislocated workers in new \noccupations, and provide a transition from school-to-work for the \nNation's young people should not be pawns in a budget chess match. We \nshould not hold young people, dislocated workers, and students, among \nothers, hostage to our demands.\n  I am glad my colleagues supported the bipartisan amendment to restore \nfunds--to provide opportunity for this Nation's workers and future \nworkers. This amendment also restored funding for education the \nfoundation for the future success of our Nation's youth.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. President, we are not living in a global economy, and education \nis the key to it. Education increases our productivity and competitive \nedge. It promotes our economy, raises the standard of living, and \nimproves the quality of life for our people.\n  Education opens the doors of opportunity in American society. Today, \naccess to quality education is more important than ever. The abilities \nto read and write are no longer enough: today, a student must also \nlearn to speak the language of computers, and must learn about our \nchanging, global, competitive economy.\n  The bipartisan amendment restoring funding for many important \neducation programs was a step in the right direction. I urge my \ncolleagues to help keep these additions in the bill when it goes to \nconference.\n\n\n                              ENVIRONMENT\n\n  And I hope we can provide additional funding for essential \nenvironmental activities. In this area the bill is sadly lacking. Mr. \nPresident, time after time in poll after poll, Americans across the\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\ncountry have supported and continue to support environmental \nprotections. They want strong environmental laws. Americans want an \nenvironment that is safe and healthy. And they want their children and \ngrandchildren to be able to do the same.\n\n  The cuts in the EPA budget now included in this bill will slow \ncleanup of Superfund sites, limited the power of the EPA to maintain \nsafe drinking water standards, such as contamination by radon, and \nlimit the EPA's ability to enforce laws that protect the quality of the \nenvironment. The EPA cannot sustain cuts of this magnitude an still do \nthe job of protecting the public health.\n  These cuts in the EPA budget are part of environmental rollbacks some \nin this Congress have proposed, and that the American people simply do \nnot support. Mr. President, I believe that jeopardizing the environment \nto achieve sort-term budgetary benefits is simply wrong.\n\n\n                            women's programs\n\n  While we have done a shameful job when it comes to the environment, \nwe have done a few things right when it comes to protecting the lives \nand health of women in this country and around the globe. We have given \nthe President the ability to lift the restrictions on international \nfamily planning and we have not included a House provision giving \nStates the right to refuse Medicaid abortions for women in the case of \nrape or incest nor a House provision allowing medical colleges to be \naccredited without training OB/GYN's in abortion procedures.\n  I urge my colleagues to hold the line on these provisions. The \nstriking of the first or the inclusion of the later two provisions \nwould result in death and hardship for women in the United States and \nthroughout the world.\n  It is crucial that we allow the President to lift the restrictions on \ninternational family planning funds. According to a consortium of \nexpert demographers, the current funding restrictions will result in at \nleast 1.9 million unplanned births and 1.6 million abortions. Eight \nthousand women around the world will die in pregnancy and childbirth \nand 134,000 infants will die. Our role should be to encourage families \nwho are trying to make deliberate decisions about their ability to have \nand care for additional children. Our role should not be to punish \nthese families by forcing them into dangerous or unwanted pregnancies.\n  We must prevent the inclusion of provisions allowing State \ngovernments to refuse to pay for Medicaid abortions in the case of rape \nor incest. The women who would seek an abortion prohibited by this \nprovision are women living in poverty who have recently been the victim \nof a sexual assault by a stranger, a friend, or a family member. We \nhave already placed enormous limits on the rights of poor women to \nchoose to terminate a pregnancy, this provision brings us into the \nrealm of the horribly absurd. Rape and incest are not something any \nwoman should ever experience. Being forced, by poverty, to carry a \npregnancy resulting from rape or incest if horrific.\n  Finally, we must prevent the inclusion of a provision to overturn the \nrequirements of the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education \n(ACGME) that residency training programs in obstetrics and gynecology \nprovide medical training in abortion. This is not a requirement that \ndoctors perform abortions, but simply a requirement that a doctor know \nand understand all the procedures related to pregnancy and childbirth. \nWomen's lives depend on the full knowledge and skill of their doctors. \nProviding the opportunity for physicians to learn all the tools \navailable to save a woman's life is not too much to ask.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we need to move to a balanced budget. \nAnd we need to do it in a way that does not sacrifice the long-term \ngoals of the American people to achieve illusory short-term cuts. We \nneed a budget that restores fiscal discipline to the Federal \nGovernment. We need a budget based on the realities facing Americans. \nMost importantly, we need a budget for our future.\n  I believe that we can achieve that kind of budget, if we put aside \npartisan bickering and political point scoring, and if we get down to \nthe work the American people elected us to do.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we are working very diligently with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader to try to work out an agreement for how \nwe will proceed for the balance of the night and on Friday, Monday, and \nTuesday. I think we are close to getting an agreement worked out here \nmomentarily, so that Members will know what they can expect in terms of \nrecorded votes, if any, tonight, or on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n  In the interim, while we are trying to get that wrapped up, we will \ngo ahead and proceed with the Bond-Mikulski amendment. Our intent is to \njust have that offered and debated, and then if we can get an \nagreement, we will announce that to the Members how that one and others \nwill be disposed of. When we get that agreement, we will notify all \nMembers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3532 offered by the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that that \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3482\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask that amendment No. 3482 to the \ncommittee substitute amendment, previously debated and set aside, be \ncalled up.\n  Mr. KERRY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. I call for the regular order with respect to that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 3482 \n     to amendment No. 3466.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3533 to Amendment No. 3482\n\n   (Purpose: To increase appropriations for EPA water infrastructure \n financing. Superfund toxic waste site clean ups, operating programs, \nand for other purposes and to increase funding for the Corporation for \n     National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) to $400.5 million)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I send to the desk a second degree \namendment to amendment No. 3482 on behalf of myself and Senator \nMikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 3533 to amendment \n     No. 3482.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it has been suggested that, in order to \nfacilitate the consideration of these amendments, we ask for time \nagreements. I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes allotted \nfor the debate of this amendment with the control under the normal \nfashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  This measure inserts a new title V adding funds for EPA and for \nAmeriCorps. The increase for EPA includes $200 million for State \nrevolving loan funds for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure, \n$50 million for Superfund, and $75 million for EPA operating programs. \nThe amendment also removes the contingency requirement on $162 million \nof EPA funds contained in title IV.\n  These additional funds are offset by debt collection legislation of \n$440 million and rescissions of unobligated contract authority of $48 \nmillion.\n  The amendment also increases funding for the AmeriCorps program by \n$17\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nmillion, for a total of $402.5 million. This increase is offset by a \nreduction in HUD property disposition funding, provides $20 million to \nhelp HUD restructure and clarify its existing law for HUD block grants \nto New York, transfers $30 million for additional drug elimination \nfunding in HUD-assisted housing, clarifies existing law for demolishing \npublic housing in Texas, clarifies the rent rules in HUD-assisted \nhousing, and provides program direction to NASA for a new satellite.\n\n  Madam President, this second-degree amendment that my ranking member, \nSenator Mikulski, and I have submitted to the Lautenberg amendment \nreflects a great deal of effort. We have worked long and hard to come \nto an agreement in order for us to increase funding in this measure in \na manner that is consistent with balancing the budget. We have insisted \nall along that additional funding be offset, and we have worked with my \nranking member, Senator Mikulski, primarily. Today we had advanced \nadditional funds for an offset of $440 million, and we have found \nadditional funding, and we have placed that in what we believe is the \nhighest priority areas.\n  In January of this year, the administration, after vetoing this bill, \ncame back and said that they wanted $966 million added into spending in \nthis measure for EPA in fiscal year 1996. We have added $487 million in \nfunding for EPA with additional offsets today. That amount, combined \nwith the $240 million in additional EPA funds in title I of the \nunderlying amendment, means that we are able to fund, through offsets, \n$727 million of the $966 million requested.\n  I think this is more than a generous compromise. It is a good-faith \nattempt at resolving the fiscal year 1996 budget for EPA. I understand \nthat the administration has not been able to agree to it. At least, \ntoday, for the first time, they talked with us, and I am grateful for \nthat. But, most importantly, I think this represents a compromise that \nMembers on both sides of the aisle can work with.\n  There are many, many items that were in this original bill that we \nhave been able to increase. The amendment provides funding for the \nhighest priorities for EPA, funding for the States' toxic waste site \ncleanups, and EPA core operating programs. Under this measure, EPA \nshould not have to have a furlough or a reduction in force for a single \nemployee. Enforcement spending would actually increase by over $10 \nmillion. States would receive an 80 percent increase in their water \ninfrastructure State revolving funds, and all Superfund sites posing \nreal risk would receive cleanup dollars.\n  It has an additional $300 million for water infrastructure State \nrevolving funds, bringing the total amount to $2.025 billion compared \nto $1.2 billion available in fiscal year 1995.\n  Madam President, this provides money for State revolving funds. It \nincludes $50 million additional for the Superfund, and it provides \nfunds to begin cleanups in every single toxic waste site which poses a \nreal threat to human health for the environment, if the site is ready \nto go in the Superfund cleanup.\n  Madam President, the amendment before us today adds $487 million in \nfunding for EPA, with real offsets. This amount, together with the $240 \nmillion in additional EPA funds in title I of the committee-reported \nbill, total $727 million.\n  Madam President, this represents 75 percent of the administration's \nrequested add-back list of $966 million. This is more than a generous \ncompromise and a good faith attempt at resolving the fiscal year 1996 \nbudget for EPA.\n  Each of the items included in this amendment were requested by the \nadministration in its January wish list to the Congress. There are no \ncongressional earmarks or add-ons.\n  The amendment represents what we believe to be the highest priorities \nfor EPA-funding for the States, toxic waste site cleanups, and EPA's \ncore operating programs. The amounts provided prevent EPA from having \nto RIF or furlough a single employee.\n  Enforcement spending would actually increase by $10 million over \nfiscal year 1995. States would receive an 80-percent increase in their \nwater infrastructure State revolving funds over what they got last \nyear. And all Superfund sites posing real risks would receive cleanup \ndollars.\n  The amendment includes an additional $300 million for water \ninfrastructure State revolving funds. This brings the total amount of \nState revolving funds available through this bill to $2.025 billion--\ncompared to only $1.2 billion in available funds in fiscal year 1995. \nThese funds enable States and communities to make significant progress \nin meeting their water infrastructure construction needs.\n  These funds are provided for both clean water and drinking water \nState revolving funds, to enable communities to build and upgrade water \ntreatment plants to continue the progress which has been made to clean \nup and maintain the water quality of our rivers, lakes, and streams, \nand to provide safe drinking water.\n  The amendment includes an additional $50 million for Superfund, \nbringing Superfund spending to the fiscal year 1995 level, and \nincreasing the amount spent on actual cleanups--rather than overhead \ncosts--by $150 million. Even while I and others have very strong \nconcerns about the way the current Superfund program works, additional \nfunds are made available through this amendment to address real \nthreats.\n  Let me say clearly that funds are available to begin cleanups at \nevery single toxic waste site posing a real threat to human health or \nthe environment if the site is ready to go in the Superfund cleanup \npipeline.\n  The amendment would fund EPA's proposed new laboratory in Research \nTriangle Park, NC, a research facility which will help EPA improve the \nquality of its research so that decisions are based on sound science. \nThis is not a pork project, Madame President. This project replaces a \ndeteriorating facility inappropriate to conducting research.\n  The amendment would result in a total appropriation of $6.44 billion \nfor EPA--an increase of $35 million above the amount of funding \nactually available to EPA in fiscal year 1995.\n  In addition, carryover funds of $225 million would be available, \nmaking a total of $6.7 billion available to EPA in fiscal year 1996. \nThis is $248 million more than what EPA had available to it in fiscal \nyear 1995.\n  Madam President, this amendment does not provide everything on the \nadministration's wish list because frankly, the administration's wish \nlist is not about real environmental priorities. The administration's \nwish list is about pork-barrel projects and boutique programs. It is \nabout continuing to provide funding for programs which do not afford \nopportunities to reduce real threats to human health and the \nenvironment.\n  Despite grave concerns about EPA's ability to manage and prioritize, \nwe have been willing to provide more funds to the Agency's most \nimportant programs.\n  Madam President, I reiterate that this does not provide everything on \nthe administration's wish list because, frankly, the wish list had \nthings that were beyond our ability to fund and things that were not \nreal environmental priorities. Some were pork barrel projects or \nboutique programs. But I think, thanks to the excellent work--and I \nemphasize the excellent work--of my ranking Member and the Senator from \nNew Jersey who offered the underlying amendment, we have come together \nwith a workable amendment. I hope all of us can support that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to support this bipartisan \nagreement to restore funds for the important environmental programs, \nincluding funding for National Service.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Lautenberg, \nand their staffs as well as my own for all of their hard work in \ndeveloping this agreement.\n  This is a compromise agreement. It provides an additional $487 \nmillion for the core EPA programs. These programs are fully offset in \nthis bill to keep EPA fully staffed so that enough people are there to \nget the job done to ensure clean rivers and drinking water and to clean \nup hazardous waste sites. The environment is a priority of the American \npeople, and I think it is the priority of this Congress.\n  There was more that we wanted to do. There was more that I certainly\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nwanted to do in this bill, particularly in the area of the \nenvironmental programs. But they were not included in this amendment \nbecause we could not arrive at sufficient offsets.\n  One of the key programs that is not in this area, with great \nreluctance, is the cleanup of Boston Harbor; also, the cleanup of the \nChesapeake Bay, which is in my own State. The programs that were \nincluded there that would have been important are also not included in \nthis amendment.\n  We have consistently in the past supported the funding for Boston \nHarbor, and, as the chairman and ranking member of the VA-HUD know, I \nam committed to the cleanup of Boston Harbor and will continue to work \nto solve this problem.\n  In this legislation, Senator Bond and I have found efforts to find \nadditional funds for EPA. Again, I thank him for his efforts to move \nthe process forward to provide real money--not funny money--to deal \nwith real environmental concerns. This additional $487 million is an \ninvestment in that.\n  I also want to say thank you for the ability to provide additional \nmoney for National Service, which brings National Service to a total of \n$4.5 million. This amount will fund 23,000 participants in the program. \nIt restores funding for the Points of Light Foundation, and as part of \nthe amendment, like the EPA funding, that is part of a bipartisan \neffort.\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley, has worked with us on helping resolve \nmany of our concerns. I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with \nour former colleague, Senator Wofford, to address the very valid \nconcerns and criticisms for National Service.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Grassley and Bond to ensure \nthat these valid concerns are addressed.\n  This amendment would ensure taxpayers get a dollar's worth of effort \nfor a dollar's worth of taxes and address valid concerns about the \nprogram.\n  I believe this is the absolute minimum level this Congress should \nprovide for National Service.\n  Even more should be done, but I recognize this may be the best we can \ndo with the money available.\n  This amendment will increase funds for innovation and assistance by \n$15 million to support demonstration programs involving national \nnonprofit and volunteer organizations and other agencies and provide \nanother $2 million of the Points of Light Foundation for a total of \n$5.5 million.\n  This amendment also addresses valid concerns about the program's \nefficiency and accountability.\n  It eliminates grants to Federal agencies, makes improvements in the \nCorporation's grant review process, and requires a study of the \nCorporation by the National Association of Public Administrators.\n  Let me assure my colleagues I have a full offset for my amendment in \nthe FHA Multifamily Property Disposition program.\n  Let me tell you why I think it is so important to provide these funds \nand why we must continue to support National Service.\n  National Service meets compelling needs in our society. It provides \nopportunity for young people; it helps meet the needs of communities; \nand it cultivates the habits of the heart.\n  National Service provides opportunity by giving young people access \nto higher education and training. For many Americans, their first \nmortgage is their student debt. After graduation, many of them owe \n$15,000, $30,000, or even more. Through National Service, young people \ncan work off some of their student debt.\n  Second, National Service meets compelling needs in America's \ncommunities. Young people serve their communities. For example in \neducation, young people tutor children and teach adults basic reading \nskills.\n  They help protect public safety. For example, in my own state of \nMaryland, in Montgomery County, AmeriCorps volunteers operate a \nCommunity Policing program, where volunteers help control crime by \nrunning community education seminars and outreach projects.\n  In other communities, they patrol vacant buildings and teach conflict \nresolution skills. They help meet compelling human needs by \ndistributing food to sick people and poor families.\n  They help address environmental concerns like restoring neighborhood \nparks, and helping communities recover from floods and disasters. After \nrecent floods in Pennsylvania, AmeriCorps teams assisted the Red Cross \nto help 10,000 families devastated by that disaster.\n  Third, National Service teaches the habits of the heart. It is not a \nsocial program. It is a social invention designed to create the ethic \nof service in today's young people. It provides an opportunity \nstructure so young Americans can receive a reduction in their student \ndebt or a voucher for further education in exchange for full-time \ncommunity service.\n  National Service is a movement toward community building, it is about \nneighbor helping neighbor, and it is about helping people who help \nthemselves. National Service fosters the spirit of community in \nAmericans, it brings people together and teaches a new generation that \nby working together it is possible to create a better world.\n  I urge my colleagues to take another step toward community building \nand encouraging habits of the heart by voting to increase the funds to \nNational Service.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly on the issue \nof funding in the continuing resolution for the Corporation for \nNational and Community Service and the AmeriCorps program.\n  As many of my colleagues know, for over a year and a half I have \nraised concerns about the costs of the AmeriCorps Program. Last summer, \nthe General Accounting Office [GAO] issued a report that substantiated \nmy concerns, finding that the average cost per participant is \napproximately $27,000, with the Federal Government providing roughly \n$20,000, State and local governments $5,000, and the private sector \nproviding only 8 percent of these high costs.\n  There is no question that these measurements are not in keeping with \nthe goals and vision of this program as originally articulated by \nPresident Bill Clinton.\n  I have stated in testimony and in letters to the President and \nadministration officials that I would be willing to support funding for \nthis program if the administration would commit to several specific \nprogram reforms, most importantly, increasing the private sector match \nand decreasing the cost per participant.\n  It has been my desire to ensure the taxpayers' money is spent \nefficiently and to increase the number of young people who will be \nprovided assistance to pay for college. To that end, I met several \nweeks ago with Senator Harris Wofford, the chief executive officer of \nthe Corporation. Since that meeting, we have been engaged in \nnegotiations on how to improve and reform the AmeriCorps Program.\n\n  I am pleased to state that I believe these negotiations have achieved \nreal progress. While there are still points that need to be addressed, \nSenator Wofford has indicated in a letter to me his commitment to \nimplementing meaningful program reforms, control costs and increase the \nprivate sector match, as I have strongly suggested.\n  It is for this reason that I am willing to support funding for the \nCorporation and, in turn, AmeriCorps.\n  As my colleagues know, I have never criticized the good work \nperformed by the young people who participate in AmeriCorps. I have met \nwith young people from my State who participate in the I CAN Program \nthat allows young people at Iowa State University and several other \ncolleges in Iowa to perform community service while attending college \nfull time. There is no question these college students are a benefit to \ntheir community.\n  However, we should not forget the 3.9 million young people who do \nvolunteer work in their community without compensation. These \nvolunteers help form the backbone of community service in America.\n  As I say, my concern is not the work performed, but the costs to the \ntaxpayer and the possibility that more young people could be provided \nassistance if AmeriCorps is reinvented. My hope is that the \nreforms that Senator Wofford and I have agreed to will help ensure that \nthe program meets the original goals articulated by President Clinton.\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\n  It is my view that this President, any President, has the right to \nsee an initiative, such as this, be given an opportunity. However, the \ninitiative must remain in keeping with the President's original intent. \nAnd that has been my focus, to keep this program's costs and private \nsector match in line with the President's promises.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that no one should take my statements \ntoday to mean that I am ready to anoint the Corporation with garlands.\n  The Corporation has serious problems, most significantly in the area \nof financial management. A recent audit of the Corporation, contracted \nby the Inspector General, indicates that there is an immediate need for \nfundamental reforms in financial management at the Corporation.\n  In addition, the Corporation must now implement the reforms that have \nbeen proposed, as well as meeting the goals for per capita costs and \nprivate sector match that it will establish.\n  My colleagues can be certain that, just as I have with agencies such \nas the Department of Defense and the IRS, I will continue to \naggressively watchdog the taxpayers' money at the Corporation.\n  Madam President, in closing, let me reiterate how pleased I am to \nhave worked with Senator Wofford on this issue. I commend him for his \nsincere efforts to reform the program. There is no question that the \nCorporation has benefited from his commitment and the fresh \nperspectives he has brought as chief executive officer.\n\n  Let me note too, the work of Congressman Hoekstra who has been a true \nwatchdog for the taxpayers on this program. As I stated earlier, I \nshare his strong concerns about the financial management at the \nCorporation.\n  I also want to commend the work of the chairmen of the committee and \nsubcommittee, Senators Mark Hatfield and Kit Bond. I know it has been \ndifficult to find funding for this program.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Bond. It has been my pleasure to \nwork closely with him on this matter and appreciate all his efforts to \naddress our mutual concerns that the taxpayers' money be spend \neffectively and wisely in this program.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I join my colleagues, Senators Bond \nand Mikulski, the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Veterans, Housing and Urban Development, \nand Related Agencies, on which I serve, in supporting an increase in \nfunding for the National Service Program. This amendment provides $403 \nmillion for the National Service Program in fiscal year 1996.\n  I voted in support of establishing this program in 1993 because it \ngives young people a chance to serve their communities and earn \neducation awards to finance their education. Currently, there are over \n450 participants in Colorado's AmeriCorps programs who are engaged in \nserving low-income communities, tutoring at-risk youth, mentoring \nstudents, helping young people stay out of gangs, and providing health \nservices in rural areas.\n  The Corporation for National Service sponsors important service \nprograms for native Americans nationwide. Current activities in this \narea include improving safety on reservations, constructing community \nfacilities, improving access to medical services for low-income elders, \ntutoring students, and reducing violence among young people. The Ute \ntribes in my State and over 20 other tribal organizations throughout \nthe country are benefiting from the National Service Program.\n  The Corporation also is working with the National Coalition for \nHomeless Veterans. Dedicated individuals are serving homeless veterans \nby providing them access to health care, substance abuse treatment, and \ntraining to seek jobs.\n  It is my hope that the Corporation for National Service continue and \nexpand its support under this amendment for programs assisting those in \nour communities that need it the most and continue to build bridges \nwith programs assisting veterans, tribal organizations and at-risk \nyouth.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I rise tonight to comment on this \namendment, offered by Senators Bond and Mikulski, to provide, among \nother things, additional funding for the Environmental Protection \nAgency. I am a cosponsor of this amendment because it includes funding \nthat is very necessary to the people of Watertown, SD. This amendment \nwould provide $13 million for the reconstruction of a wastewater \ntreatment facility in Watertown, SD.\n  The city of Watertown has worked for more than 10 years to overcome \nClean Water Act violations. Now, the city is facing an expensive \nlawsuit, fines of up to $25,000 per day, and the high costs of \nrestructuring the wastewater treatment plant. I have worked closely \nwith Watertown's Mayor Brenda Barger, who is seeking a reasonable \nsettlement to the lawsuit with the EPA.\n  The city of Watertown's innovative/alternative technology wastewater \ntreatment facility was built as a joint partnership with the EPA, the \ncity, and the State of South Dakota in 1982. The plant was constructed \nwith the understanding that the EPA would provide assistance in the \nevent the new technology failed. The facility was modified and rebuilt \nin 1991 when it was unable to comply with Clean Water Act discharge \nrequirements. Unfortunately, the newly reconstructed plant still was \nfound to violate Federal regulations. That is why the city now faces a \npossible lawsuit by the Federal Government, and fines of up to $25,000 \nper day.\n  The city of Watertown, under the very capable guidance of Mayor \nBarger, has entered into a municipal compliance plan with the EPA. \nUnder the agree plan, Watertown should achieve compliance by December \n1996. However, without Federal assistance, Watertown will be unable to \ncomplete the reconstruction by the date set forth by the EPA. In \naddition, the compliance plan does not address the issue of the onerous \ncivil and administrative penalties that continue to accumulate against \nthe city.\n  Under the law, Watertown could accumulate an additional $14 million \nin penalties before the treatment facility is able to comply with the \nClean Water Act requirements.\n  Madam President, I don't know of any cities in South Dakota that can \nafford those kinds of penalties.\n  Watertown is working hard to comply with the law. However, to \nsucceed, Watertown needs the constructive cooperation of the Federal \nGovernment. The funding in the amendment offered by my friend from \nMissouri reflects the kind of constructive cooperation needed. As I \nsaid, it would provide $13 million to the city of Watertown to rebuild \nWatertown's wastewater treatment facility.\n  Madam President, this project is necessary for the health and safety \nof the people of Watertown. Already this year, the city has increased \nconsumer water rates from $9/month to $16/month in order to fund the \nwater treatment facility reconstruction project. The city is prepared \nfor additional rate increases in order to cover a portion of the total \nproject cost of $25 million.\n  The city also has worked diligently to secure a variety of available \nfunding sources, including an allocation of $1 million from the State \nof South Dakota. Additionally, the city of Watertown has committed to a \nlocal match of $8.25 million. This Federal appropriation of $13 million \nwould enable the city to complete construction on the water treatment \nfacility in a timely manner, as required by the EPA.\n  Madam President, I believe the merits of this project are clear. \nConstruction of this facility would allow the city of Watertown to \nprovide its residents with a safe water supply which complies with the \nClean Water Act and thus ensures that the environment is protected.\n  I have enjoyed working with Senator Bond, chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee that provides funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and Senator Mikulski, the ranking member on that \nsubcommittee. I know I represent the citizens of Watertown, SD, when I \nsay thank you for your commitment to securing this funding. This is a \ngreat first step. As I said, this is a constructive effort. I sincerely \nhope that the EPA will show the same constructive, cooperative spirit \nto the people of Watertown.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in closing let me briefly state my \nsupport for the amendment offered by Senator Mikulski on AmeriCorps. \nWhile I\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\nbelieve the Appropriations Committees has provided sufficient funding \nfor the Corporation, I recognize the desire of the administration and \nSenator Mikulski to see a small increase in the amount of funds \nprovided by the committee.\n  I believe this amendment is a good compromise that will allow the VA/\nHUD bill to proceed and be signed by the President.\n  The amendment contains a sense of the Senate that I have worked on \nwith Senator Kassebaum stating that the President should expeditiously \nnominate a CFO for the Corporation and that the Corporation should make \nimplementation of financial management reforms a top priority.\n  In meeting with accountants from Arthur Anderson, who conducted the \nindependent audit of the Corporation, they stated that the appointment \nof a CFO was the single most important thing that needs to be done to \nbegin the effort to get the Corporation's financial house in order.\n  The amendment also allows the Corporation to spend up to $3 million \nfor implementing financial management reforms.\n  Finally, I am pleased that in conjunction with this amendment, the \nCorporation has agreed that they will set aside $10 million for an \neducation-awards only program that I have advocated. Under this new \nprogram, the Corporation will provide only educational awards to young \npeople who perform community service. These funds could help up to \n4,000 young people pay for college.\n  Madam President, I want to recognize Senator Barbara Mikulski for her \nwork. She has been a strong advocate for AmeriCorps. Earlier this fall, \nI said that I thought there would be funding for this program. I made \nthat statement in part because of the confidence I had that Senator \nMikulski's determination would win the day. Certainly, she deserves a \ngreat deal of the credit for the funding contained in this bill already \nand all the credit for the passage of this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I will now yield the floor but reserve \nthe remainder of whatever time our side might have.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3509 Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an \namendment that I have pending on National Service be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none. It \nis withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 3509) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. How much time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield a minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not real familiar with this amendment. I just saw \nit. I am not sure we need $200 million for State revolving funds or $50 \nmillion for Superfund, $75 million--$162 million in funds offset by \nunobligated airway trust fund contract authority. I did not know that \nwas unobligated.\n  All this is another increase in spending. That is really all this is \nabout. I think it is time it came to a stop, and at least I would like \nto be on record as being in opposition to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the Senator from Maryland if I can have 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator from New Jersey 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I may not need 5 minutes, Mr. President, but I thank \nmy colleague from Maryland.\n  This is a compromise piece of legislation. If you see lots of people \nconcerned about what it is that we have in front of us, these are \nlegitimate concerns for both those who support and those who object to \nthis compromise. The amendment that is being offered, as we heard from \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri, includes $487 million for \nenvironmental programs instead of the roughly $900 million that was \nproposed in the original amendment. Unlike the earlier amendment, this \namendment does not include a provision designating the proposed funding \nas emergency spending.\n  Mr. President, clearly this amendment does not increase the budget \nfor environmental programs as much as I believe is needed. However, \nunder the circumstances, with earnest exchanges of view, we arrived at \nwhat was a middle ground. While having been so active on matters of \nenvironmental cleanup including Superfund and clean air and others, \nclean water, it distresses me that we could not get more to do the \nenvironmental job that many of us here would like to see done. I am \npleased to see that there is $50 million more for Superfund cleanup. It \nis a program that needs to be continued. And even as we choose to \nexamine it, to reform, to make reforms where necessary or where \npossible, still in all this is a program that has value and should be \ncontinued.\n  In the final analysis, there is a major concern, major disappointment \nin this amendment, that concerns the Boston Harbor cleanup. Boston \nHarbor was an environmental disaster because of the inability to \ncontain the pollution, the contamination that flowed into that body of \nwater. It caused enormous increases in costs for those who use the \ndrinking water in the area because of the costs invested thus far in \ntrying to get it to a satisfactory condition.\n  Senator Kerry and Senator Kennedy have worked very hard for a number \nof years to get the kind of funding that is essential to continue this \njob. And I hope, Mr. President, that as we consider this amendment \nthere will be opportunities to reevaluate some of the decisions that we \nare making this evening. There will be a conference with the House.\n\n  The biggest deficiency in this bill is the lack of a clear-cut \ncommitment to expend funding to clean up Boston Harbor. And again, \nother than that, we have fashioned a compromise--not one that is \nsatisfactory to those who are most anxious to get the environment \ncleaned up to the fullest extent possible, but we do face a budget \ncrisis here. We are interested in balancing the budget. We are \ninterested in doing what we can with the limited resources that we \nhave. This compromise amendment, I think, does just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from New Jersey \nthat he is in charge of the time which is remaining, which is 10 \nminutes and 18 seconds on that side, and 5 minutes and 11 seconds for \nthe majority.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to some basic \nprinciples which we had to follow in this bill. This bill, the VA-HUD, \nIndependent Agencies, which includes EPA, space, FEMA, and others, took \na 12 percent this year. There was no way we could continue to fund \nthese special projects each Member had in specific cities.\n  Now, some people would call them pork projects, but, frankly, these \nare all very important, necessary environmental projects designed to \nclean up our waterways and other vital elements of the environment. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimates that there are approximately \n$100 billion of infrastructure needs for clean water and safe drinking \nwater in the country today.\n\n  What we have tried to do is to say, we are not going to appropriate, \nin this bill, specific sums for specific projects, because there is no \nway that we can know how to rank $100 billion of needs throughout the \ncountry. We have set up State revolving funds, loan funds that will \nrevolve and provide assistance to communities, and be paid back to help \nother communities within that State. That is why we have worked hard to \nput additional dollars into the revolving fund.\n  We have been advised by the Under Secretary for EPA that we need to\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\nreach a level of $10 billion on the clean water fund, so that the \nprojects can be dealt with. We are trying to get money into those \nrevolving funds. We cannot appropriate funds for specific projects and \nthat is why there has been much disappointment in my own State. There \nare major cities that want to have funds appropriated directly to them.\n  What we have done instead is to appropriate money for the State \nrevolving funds. The States will make low- or no-interest loans to \ncommunities--to cities, to counties--to take care of their needs. When \nthat is paid back it will enable others to carry out their projects.\n  Mr. President, it is not nearly as exciting, it is not nearly as \nglamorous as having an appropriated sum targeted to one city or \nanother. We think, based on the best analysis we have made and on the \nscientific, professional advice, that the State revolving funds will \nallow the States to assist communities on a revolving basis.\n  Again, this bill is not all that we would like. There are many other \nthings we would like to do. But it is paid for. It is paid for with \nreal offsets. It is within the budget and I think it is a major \ncontribution to continued environmental progress, but progress in a way \nthat moves responsibility and authority back to the States, \ndecisionmaking back to the States.\n  That is why I ask my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how will quorum time be charged if we \ngo into a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To whatever side asks for the quorum.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent during the quorum call time \nbe charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have to point out that I object to that \nsince we are almost out of time and I would like to reserve 1 minute at \nthe end.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time be \ncharged to neither side during the quorum call.\n  Mr. KYL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time does either side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises we have 1 minute and 23 \nseconds for the majority; and the opposition has 10 minutes, 18 \nseconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But there is no opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Somewhere or another we used up 4 minutes and \n28 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, are we supposed to keep talking because \nthere are other discussions underway? Is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, very important discussions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask it be charged to the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is a pending amendment, is there \nnot?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent it be laid aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is an amendment at the desk, No. \n3527. I ask it be called up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. \n     Hatfield, for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3527.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator does not intend to ask for a rollcall vote on \nthis one? It has been agreed to on both sides. There will not be a \nrollcall vote. It will be by voice.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say this amendment is jointly sponsored by myself, \nthe majority leader, Senator Dole, the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, and Senator Leahy. It provides $50 million for emergency \nantiterrorism assistance for Israel. This is the program announced by \nthe President from Jerusalem yesterday, and will provide funds to \nprocure goods, provide training and/or grants in order to support \nefforts to help eradicate terrorists in and around Israel.\n  As might be expected given the shortness of time involved in \npreparation for this proposal, specific details are lacking and \ntherefore the amendment includes notification language, so that the \nCongress can exercise adequate oversight for a program before the money \nis spent.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of the President, Senator Dole, \nSenator Hatfield, Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, and I are offering \nan amendment to provide $50 million in antiterrorism assistance to \nIsrael.\n  All of us in the United States Senate have been shocked and saddened \nby the rash of terrorist bombings that have occurred in Israel. The \nfour attacks from February 26 to March 4 have killed 58 people bringing \nterror and grief to Israelis and, for the moment, putting a halt to the \npeace process. One tragedy is compounded by another.\n  In the days since the bombings, both Israeli and Palestinian security \nforces have moved against the terrorists. I am pleased the Palestinian \nauthority has moved to round up more than 600 Hamas members and raid \nmosques, businesses and schools owned by militants. Its arrest of three \nsenior members of Hamas' military wing over the weekend is further \nevidence that it is taking seriously the need to confront Hamas' \nterrorist threat.\n  Despite these encouraging signs, however, I share Prime Minister \nPeres' view that these steps, while a good beginning, are clearly not \nenough. Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority must continue \ntheir efforts to root out the terrorist threat in its entirety. \nFinally, the United States must also contribute to the antiterrorism \neffort, for, without U.S. assistance, hopes for a lasting peace in the \nMiddle East could be in serious jeopardy.\n  The images of the bombs' victims lying in Jerusalem's streets, of \nyoung girls at their friends' funeral, will haunt us indefinitely. The \npain and loss of the victims' families and the people of Israel will \nalways remain.\n  Mr. President, I can think of only one thing that could worsen the \ntragedy of these bombings, and that would be for these extremists to be \nsuccessful in their effort to permanently derail the peace process. The \nIsraeli people have suffered greatly through each of these bombings. \nWhile their patience must have its limits, we cannot allow the \nterrorists to achieve their ultimate objective.\n  This amendment addresses those concerns. It will assist Israel in its \neffort to combat terrorism. It will also add to the momentum for peace \nin the Middle East that was aided by President Clinton's initiatives \nand the resulting ``summit of the peacemakers.''\n  I hope Israelis will derive some encouragement from the international \ncommunity's condemnation of the attacks as well as from Wednesday's \nsummit. I am hopeful, as well, that this unprecedented summit will \ndemonstrate to the terrorists that the international community stands \nunited against them and their despicable acts.\n  It is unfortunate that Syria, among others, did not attend the \nsummit, but the list of countries, including moderate Arab nations, \nthat participated in this historic conference is most impressive: \nEgypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, \nBahrain, Algeria, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, Canada, Russia, \nBritain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Turkey, \nand the United States.\n  This extensive list of participants clearly represents the \ninternational\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\ncommunity's continued commitment to the Middle East peace process. And, \nagain, it is a sign to the Israelis that they are not alone in their \nbattle against terrorism.\n  President Clinton should also be commended for establishing an \ninternational counter-terrorism alliance involving espionage agencies \nof several nations. I am hopeful that this initiative will help ensure \nthat terrorist threats will not be tolerated.\n  This bipartisan amendment is important because it, in concert with \nthe summit in Egypt, puts the Senate squarely in support of Israel and \nsquarely on the side of urging the Palestinians and the Arab states, \nwith support from the United States, to move forcefully against the \nterrorist threat. I hope we will send a strong, united message of \nsupport for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3527) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? There being no Senator \nseeking recognition, in my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nMontana, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after a lot of efforts, I believe we have a \nunanimous-consent request that will be fair to all and will give us a \nway to get to a conclusion on this legislation.\n  The majority leader feels strongly that we need to get this work \ncompleted. I think this will help us get there. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that all remaining amendments in order to H.R. 3019 must be \ncalled up and debate concluded by 12:30 p.m., Tuesday, March 19, and \nthat the votes occur in the order in which they were debated beginning \nat 2:15 p.m., Tuesday, March 19, and, following the disposition of the \namendments, the Senate proceed to third reading and final passage of \nH.R. 3019, as amended, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object--I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no further votes tonight, Friday or Monday; however, if you \nhave an amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill, under the \nprevious agreement you must debate your amendment Friday, Monday, or \nTuesday morning. I want to emphasize it seems to me that is more than \nfair. I know some Members have commitments on Friday or on Monday or on \nTuesday, but surely they do not have commitments all of those days. So \nI think this will give us ample time to debate it. The votes will occur \nbeginning at 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  Also, Senators should be on notice that the Senate is expected to \ndebate the small business regulatory reform bill tomorrow under a brief \ntime agreement and that a vote will occur on Tuesday, also, on the \nsmall business regulatory reform bill.\n  There could be other votes on Tuesday in relation to cloture on the \nWhitewater special committee and possibly a cloture vote with respect \nto the product liability conference report. Therefore, Senators should \nbe on notice that a number of votes are expected to occur on Tuesday, \nMarch 19.\n  Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m., \nTuesday, the Senate resume the Boxer and Coats amendments regarding the \nabortion issue, and that there be 2 hours 45 minutes of debate to be \ncontrolled in the following manner: 1 hour under the control of Senator \nCoats, 30 minutes under the control of Senator Boxer, 1 hour under the \ncontrol of Senator Snowe, and 15 minutes under the control of Senator \nMurray, and that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \namendments be laid aside to occur in the voting sequence beginning at \n2:15 on Tuesday; and following the debate on the Coats and Boxer \namendments, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the Murkowski amendment No. 3525.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader for his efforts to get this agreement. I think it is fair. We do \nhave some other efforts we are still working on, and certainly we are \ngoing to work in good faith to fulfill all that we have discussed \ntonight. I yield to the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the acting majority leader for his comments and \nfor his leadership in bringing us to this point.\n  The distinguished Senator from California had a misunderstanding \nabout when the Coats amendment was going to be debated and has informed \nme it would be of great help to her if she could have 15 minutes in \nthis debate. I wonder if we might modify the unanimous consent \nagreement to provide her with that opportunity.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our previous \nagreement be amended to provide 15 minutes for Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia to be involved in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I only want to complete my thought in \nurging colleagues to use the time we have available to us on Friday and \nMonday. We have 2 full days here. There is no reason why we ought not \nbe able to use them to the fullest extent possible. Everyone now knows \nwhat the amendments are. They ought to be laid down and debated. We \nought not lose the time we have available to us on Friday and on \nMonday.\n  So I urge my colleagues to come to the floor in the next 2 days to \nget that work done.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, did we get an agreement on the unanimous-\nconsent request for the 15 minutes for Senator Feinstein?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to join the Senator from South \nDakota in urging Members to come and be involved in this debate. We \nhave a lot of work to do next week on very important legislation. \nMembers need to understand that we cannot do the work we have to do on \nTuesday, Wednesday, and part of Thursday or part of Tuesday. So please \nbe prepared to come to the floor and debate these issues on Friday and \nMonday, be prepared to work the full day on Thursday, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2081-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2094-S2095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--SHORT-TERM CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have two articles that I will ask to be \nprinted in the Record. There continues to be wholesale, gross, \nmisleading statements with regard to the Decency Act that was included \nin the telecommunications bill.\n  Somehow we must respond to the whole avalanche of highly financed \nspecial interest groups who are opposed to the measure that \noverwhelmingly passed in the U.S. Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the process we \nincorporated in the measure to expedite the consideration by the \ncourts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles, \none from the Omaha World Herald of March 11, 1996, with the headline, \n``Internet Doesn't Fit Free-Press Concept,'' and another from the Omaha \nWorld Herald of March 13, 1996, with the headline, ``Some Internet Fare \nWorse Than Indecent.''\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Internet Doesn't Fit Free-Press Concept\n\n       An illogical argument is being used to attack the \n     Communications Decency Act, which was sponsored by Sen. J. \n     James Exon, D-Neb. Some of the law's critics argue that the \n     Internet, a worldwide network of computers linked by \n     telephone lines, should be free of Government regulation \n     under the First Amendment's freedom of the press protection.\n       The anti-indecency law makes it a crime to transmit \n     indecent materials by computer when the materials are \n     accessible to children. Arguing that the law violates press \n     freedom is a group of plaintiffs consisting of Microsoft \n     Corp., the Society of Professional Journalists, the American \n     Society of Newspaper Editors and an organization calling \n     itself the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition.\n       Certainly the Internet provides many opportunities for \n     research, rapid communication and entertainment. But a loose, \n     dynamic computer network isn't a newspaper. The two have \n     little in common.\n       Newspapers are published by companies that depend on the \n     trust of their customers--their readers and advertisers--to \n     stay in business. These customers know who is in charge. They \n     know that a publisher ultimately is responsible for the \n     newspaper and its contents.\n       A newspaper has editors who select what is to be published. \n     They rank the news in importance and broad interest. They \n     package it for ease of comprehension. They operate under the \n     laws of libel. The newspaper can be held accountable and be \n     ordered to pay damages if it intentionally and maliciously \n     publishes false and damaging information.\n       The Internet has no comparable editors, no comparable \n     controls, none of the continuous process of fact-checking and \n     verification that newspapers engage in. No person or group of \n     people is accountable for materials that appear on the \n     Internet. Rather, its millions of users are free to send out \n     whatever they choose, no matter how worthless, false or \n     perverted it might be. The result can resemble a hodgepodge \n     of raw and random facts and opinions. Some are worthy and \n     valuable. Others are outright nonsense.\n       And no one stands behind the material disseminated on the \n     Internet.\n       Congress passed the Exon bill to protect children. And \n     properly so. It's ridiculous to claim that the mantle of \n     press freedom should be stretched to protect computerized \n     pornographers and predators.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald, Mar. 13, 1996]\n\n                 Some Internet Fare Worse Than Indecent\n\n                        (By Arianna Huffington)\n\n       If there is one problem with the recently signed \n     Communications Decency Act, which makes it illegal to post \n     ``indecent'' material on the Internet, it is its name. \n     Discussions of indecency and pornography conjure up images of \n     Playboy and Hustler, when in fact the kind of material \n     available on the Internet goes far beyond indecency--and \n     descends into barbarism.\n       Most parents have never been on the Internet, so they \n     cannot imagine what their children can easily access in \n     cyberspace: child molestation, bestiality, sadomasochism and \n     even specific descriptions of how to get sexual gratification \n     by killing children.\n       Though First Amendment absolutists are loathe to admit it, \n     this debate is not about controlling pornography but about \n     fighting crime.\n       There are few things more dangerous for a civilization than \n     allowing the deviant and the criminal to become part of the \n     mainstream. Every society has had its red-light districts, \n     but going there involved danger, stigmatization and often \n     legal sanction. Now the red-light districts can invade our \n     homes and our children's minds.\n       During a recent taping of a ``Firing Line'' debate on \n     controlling pornography on the Internet, which will air March \n     22, I was stunned by the gulf that separates the two sides. \n     For Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union, and his team, it was about freedom and the \n     First Amendment. For our side, headed by Bill Buckley, it was \n     about our children and the kind of culture that surrounds \n     them.\n       There are three main arguments on the other side, and we \n     are going to be hearing a lot of them in the year ahead as \n     the ACLU's challenge to the Communications Decency Act comes \n     to court.\n       The first is that there is no justification for abridging \n     First Amendment rights. The reality is that depictions of \n     criminal behavior have little to do with free speech. \n     Moreover, there is no absolute protection of free speech in \n     the Constitution. The First Amendment does not cover slander, \n     false advertising or perjury, nor does it protect obscenity \n     or child pornography.\n       Restricting criminal material on the Internet should be a \n     matter of common sense in any country that values its \n     children more than it values the rights of consumers addicted \n     to what degrades and dehumanizes.\n       Civilization is about trade-offs. and I would gladly \n     sacrifice the rights of millions of Americans to have easy \n     Internet access to ``Bleed Little Girl Bleed'' or ``Little \n     Boy Snuffed'' for the sake of reducing the likelihood that \n     one more child would be molested or murdered. With more than \n     80 percent of child molesters admitting they have been \n     regular users of hard-core pornography, it becomes impossible \n     to continue hiding behind the First Amendment and denying the \n     price we are paying.\n       The second most prevalent argument against regulating \n     pornography on the Internet is that it should be the parents` \n     responsibility. This is an odd argument from the same people \n     who have been campaigning for years against parents' rights \n     to choose the schools their children attend. Now they are \n     attributing to parents qualities normally reserved for God--\n     omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence. In reality, \n     parents have never felt more powerless to control the \n     cultural influences that shape their children's character and \n     lives.\n       The third argument that we heard a lot during the ``Firing \n     Line'' debate is that it would be difficult, nay impossible, \n     to regulate depictions of criminal behavior in cyberspace. We \n     even heard liberals lament the government intrusion such \n     regulations would entail. How curious that we never hear how \n     invasive it is to restrict the rights of businessmen \n     polluting the environment or farmers threatening the \n     existence of the kangaroo rat.\n       Yet, it is difficult to regulate the availability of \n     criminal material on the Internet, but the decline and fall \n     of civilizations throughout history is testimony to the fact \n     that maintaining a civilized society has never been easy. One \n     clear sign of decadence is when abstract rights are given \n     more weight than real lives.\n       It is not often that I have the opportunity to side with \n     Bill Clinton, who has eloquently defended restrictions on \n     what children may be exposed to on the Internet. When the \n     president is allied with the Family Research Council, and \n     Americans for Tax Reform is allied with the ACLU, we know \n     that the divisions transcend liberal vs. conservative. They \n     have to do with our core values and most sacred priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2095-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2095-S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMEMBERING HALABJA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, this weekend will mark the anniversary of \none of\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nhumanity's darkest moments. Eight years ago, on March 16, 1988, Iraqi \nPresident Saddam Hussein's forces, besieged by Iranian forces on the \nFaw Peninsula and losing ground to Kurdish insurgents in northern Iraq, \ncommenced an attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja. There, Iraqi forces \nused poison gas resulting in the death of as many as 5 to 6 thousand \nKurds, most of whom were innocent noncombatants.\n  In the 8 years since the poison gas attack, Halabja has become the \nsingle most important symbol of the plight of the Kurdish people--the \nvery embodiment of Iraq's brutality towards the Kurds. The \nunforgettable images of the victims--a man frozen in death with his \ninfant son; a little girl wearing a scarf, her face swollen in the \nfirst stages of decomposition--remain seared in the Kurdish psyche. \nMuch as the Bosnians will never forget the ethnic cleansing of \nSrebrenica, the Kurds will never forget the attack on Halabja.\n  Incredibly, as we now know, Halabja was not the only instance when \nIraq employed chemical weapons against the Kurds, nor was it the end of \nIraqi repression against the Kurds. Although clearly the most dramatic, \nHalabja was but one of a series of Iraqi atrocities against the Kurds. \nBeginning in the mid to late 1980's--and culminating in the infamous \nAnfal campaign of 1988--Iraqi forces systematically rounded up Kurdish \nvillagers and forced them into relocation camps, took tens of thousands \nof Kurds into custody where they were never heard from again, and \ndestroyed hundreds of Kurdish villages and towns. By some estimates as \nmany as 150,000 Kurds are missing from this period and presumed dead. \nCollectively, these actions amount to an Iraqi campaign of genocide \nagainst the Kurds.\n  I, along with the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms, have tried very hard to call attention to the \npersecution of the Kurds, including by introducing the first-ever \nsanctions bill against Iraq in 1988 for its use of poison gas against \nthe Kurds.\n  Since then, a wealth of evidence has been uncovered documenting \nIraq's brutality against the Kurds, much of which was written in Iraq's \nown hand. The Foreign Relations Committee--particularly through the \nvigorous efforts of former staff member, now United States Ambassador \nto Croatia Peter Galbraith--led an effort to retrieve more than 18 tons \nof Iraqi Secret Police documents captured by the Kurds in 1991, which \ncharts out Iraq's criminal behavior in excruciating detail. Human \nRights Watch, the independent human rights organization, has done a \nsuperb job of analyzing those documents to mount an overwhelming case \nthat Iraq has engaged in genocide against the Kurds.\n  This is a story that must be told. As some of my colleagues may know, \nthe issue of genocide has a particularly strong resonance for me. Just \nafter World War II, my father, Herbert Claiborne Pell, played a \nsignificant role in seeing that genocide would be considered a war \ncrime. Although he met stiff resistance, my father ultimately succeeded \nand I learned much from his tenacity and commitment to principle. The \nworld must oppose genocide wherever and whenever it occurs; Halabja \ncannot be forgotten, and Iraq must be held accountable for its \natrocities against the Kurds. We simply cannot afford to let this \nopportunity pass by.\n  I wish I could say that there is a happy ending to the tragic story \nof the Kurds in Iraq, that there was a lesson learned by the Iraqi \nleadership. Sadly, I cannot. Although the Iraqi Kurds now control a \nsignificant portion of Kurdistan--a consequence of the Persian Gulf \nwar--Saddam's ill treatment of the Kurds continues. Iraqi agents \ncontinually carry out terrorist acts against Kurdish targets, and Iraq \nmaintains an airtight blockade of the Kurdish-controlled provinces. \nSince there also is a U.N. embargo on all of Iraq, the Kurds are forced \nto live under the unbearable economic weight of a dual embargo. In \naddition, Kurds in other portions of the region--particularly in Iran \nand Turkey--have been subjected to serious abuses of human rights and \noutright represssion, demonstrating that the Kurdish plight knows no \nboundaries. The situation has become so dire that for the past 18 \nmonths, the Iraqi Kurds --once united in their quest for autonomy and \ntheir hatred for Saddam Hussein, have resorted to fighting amongst \nthemselves.\n  The situation does not seem right or fair to me. Nor does there seem \nto have been a proper response by the international community to the \nhorrifying legacy of Halabja. I think there should be a much greater \neffort to look at ways to help the Iraqi Kurds dispel the painful \nmemories of the past, to graduate from the status of dependency on the \ninternational donor community, and to confront our common enemy--Saddam \nHussein. Only then can Iraqi Kurdistan emerge as the cornerstone of a \nfree and democratic Iraq.\n  At a minimum, the international community--and the United States in \nparticular--must reaffirm its commitment to protect the Kurds. Under \nOperation Provide Comfort, an international coalition including United \nStates, British, and French forces, continues to provide air cover and \nprotection to the Iraqi Kurds, and to facilitate the supply of \nhumanitarian relief. The recent political changes in Turkey, however, \nhave cast new doubt on the long-term viability of Provide Comfort, and \noverall economic conditions in Kurdistan continue to deteriorate. The \ncurrent situation does not serve United States or international \ninterests, nor does it help to rectify the sad history of repression \nagainst the Kurds. Our work in Iraq--both against Saddam and in support \nof the Kurds--is not yet done.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished friend, \nSenator Pell, the able ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, in recalling the massacre of thousands of Kurdish civilians \n8 years ago at the town of Halabja.\n  On March 16, 1988, Iraqi jets, without warning, dropped chemical \nweapons on Halabja, a Kurdish village in northern Iraq. The attack, \nhorrific even by Iraq's barbaric standards, killed thousands of unarmed \nmen, women, and children.\n  The massacre at Halabja drew attention to Saddam Hussein's campaign \nof genocide directed against the Kurds of northern Iraq. However, that \nattention was not enough to prevent the systematic killing of hundreds \nof thousands of Kurdish civilians by the Government of Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I must commend Senator Pell for being one of the few \nwilling to speak out about the plight of the Kurds. I worked with him \nin 1988 to sanction Iraq for its reprehensible behavior. Had more \npeople around the world, and especially here in the United States, \nheeded Senator Pell's pleas to protect the Kurds, perhaps more could \nhave been saved.\n  The final act of this tragedy, however, has not yet played out. \nSaddam Hussein has not abandoned his crusade against the Kurdish \ncitizens of Iraq. If he cannot eliminate them, he will do all he can to \ndeprive them of their basic human rights.\n  Mr. President, thanks to Senator Pell, the plight of the Kurds has \nthe attention of the world. They must never be forgotten.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 8 years ago this week, in the closing \nweeks of the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam Hussein sent Iraqi forces to crush a \nrebellion among the Kurds of northern Iraq. In the assault, centered on \nthe city of Halabja, Saddam's forces rained poison gas down upon the \ncity, and over 5,000 Kurds, many of them civilians, lost their lives in \nhorrifying fashion.\n  As research since the end of the Iran-Iraq war has shown, Halabja was \nonly the most brutal chapter in Saddam's genocidal campaign against the \nKurds of northern Iraq. From the mid-1980's through the end of the war, \nIraq forced hundreds of thousands of Kurdish citizens into detention \ncamps, kidnapped tens of thousands of others, most of whom are presumed \ndead, and attacked Kurdish towns and villages, often with deadly poison \ngas. Some 150,000 Kurds lost their lives in this infamous Anfal \ncampaign--which can only be described as a campaign of genocide by \nSaddam Hussein against the Kurds of Iraq.\n  Sadly, this is not the only incident of Saddam's brutality against \nhis own people. The threshold crossed by Iraq during the Anfal campaign \nlaid the groundwork for Saddam's most recent genocidal killing spree, \nthis time against the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq. In the years \nfollowing the gulf\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\nwar, as Iraqi Shiite rebels took refuge in the remote communities of \nthe Marsh Arabs, Saddam turned his army on this community. In the last \n3 years, thousands of Marsh Arabs have disappeared, never to be heard \nfrom again, and entire villages have been burned to the ground. This \ntime, the genocide was accompanied by an environmental outrage, as \nIraqi engineers drained thousands of acres of marshlands in order to \nreach remote villages, wiping out a fragile ecosystem and obliterating \nthe centuries-old way of life of the Marsh Arabs.\n  The Kurds, too, continue to suffer at Saddam's hand. They narrowly \nescaped a new round of massacres at the end of the gulf war in 1991, \nthanks to the intervention of the United States and our allies. Today, \nalthough the Kurds of Iraq govern the northern provinces autonomously \nunder the protection of Operation Provide Comfort--a cooperative effort \nby the United States, Britain, and France--they remain subject to an \ninternal blockade by Saddam's forces, as well as the U.N. embargo \nagainst all of Iraq, and periodic Iraqi attacks against Kurdish towns \nand individuals.\n  No Member of this body has done more to publicize and address the \nplight of the Kurds than the distinguished ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Pell. Thanks in large part to his \nefforts, and those of the distinguished Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms, over 18 tons of Iraqi Government \nand secret police documents detailing Iraq's genocidal campaign against \nthe Kurds--after being captured by Kurdish rebels in 1991--were brought \nto the United States for research and analysis. The result has been a \nwell-documented history of Iraqi atrocities against the Kurds, \nincluding the horrific use of poison gas.\n  On this tragic anniversary, I want to commend Senator Pell and \nSenator Helms for their leadership on this issue. I hope that the \nUnited States will continue to take a leadership role in working to \nensure a better life for the Kurds of Iraq, both until and after Saddam \nHussein is driven from power.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2095-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on numerous occasions I have mentioned to \nfriends that evening in 1972 when I first was elected to the Senate. \nWhen the television networks reported that I had won the Senate race in \nNorth Carolina, I was stunned. Then I made several commitments to \nmyself, one of them being that I would never fail to see a young \nperson, or a group of young people, who wanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously beneficial \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them have been concerned about the Federal debt \nwhich recently exceeded $5 trillion. Of course, Congress is responsible \nfor creating this monstrous debt which coming generations will have to \npay.\n  Mr. President, the young people and I almost always discuss the fact \nthat under the U.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of \nFederal money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by \nboth the House and Senate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Wednesday, March 13, stood at \n$5,025,887,532,178.79. This amounts to $19,076.70 for every man, woman \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my report yesterday--which \nidentified the total Federal Debt as of close of business on Tuesday, \nMarch 12, 1996--shows an increase of nearly 9 billion dollars--\n$8,603,940,268.76, to be exact. That 1-day increase is enough to match \nthe money needed by approximately 1,275,792 students to pay their \ncollege tuitions for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2097-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2097-S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n STATEMENT BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND IN THE \n                              U.S. SENATE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, The Friends of Ireland is a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators and Representatives opposed to violence and terrorism \nin Northern Ireland and dedicated to maintaining a United States policy \nthat promotes a just, lasting, and peaceful settlement of the conflict. \nThe latest developments for peace and the need for an immediate \nrestoration of the IRA cease-fire make this year's St. Patrick's Day a \nparticularly critical time in the peace process.\n  I believe all our colleagues will find this year's statement by the \nSenate Executive Committee of the Friends of Ireland of interest, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n Statement by the Executive Committee of the Friends of Ireland in the \n             United States Senate, St. Patrick's Day, 1996\n\n       On this St. Patrick's Day, the Executive Committee of the \n     Friends of Ireland in the United States Senate join the \n     people of Ireland, North and South, in welcoming the latest \n     developments for peace and in demanding an immediate \n     restoration of the IRA cease-fire.\n       We welcome the Joint Communique issued on February 28 by \n     Irish Taoiseach John Bruton and British Prime Minister John \n     Major proposing steps to renew the peace process for Northern \n     Ireland and pledging to begin all-party negotiations on June \n     10.\n       Friends of Ireland everywhere were outraged by the end of \n     the IRA cease-fire last month and by the subsequent bombings \n     in populated London which took the lives of three people and \n     injured many others. Our hearts go out to the victims and the \n     families of those killed and injured in these terrorist \n     attacks. We condemn unequivocally the IRA violence, and we \n     call for an immediate restoration of the cease-fire. We \n     commend the Loyalist paramilitaries for maintaining their \n     cease-fire in spite of the IRA's resumption of violence.\n       We are greatly encouraged that the political leaders of \n     Ireland and Great Britain have recommitted themselves to \n     achieving a lasting peace. They clearly have a mandate from \n     the vast majority of the people of Ireland--North and South, \n     Protestant and Catholic alike--who recently turned out in \n     large numbers to condemn the recent violence and demand a \n     return to peace.\n       Many of the Friends of Ireland had the opportunity, during \n     the recent visit to Northern Ireland by President Clinton, to \n     see at first hand the determination of people of all \n     traditions to seize the opportunity for peace. This was \n     reaffirmed by the recent rallies in which people turned out \n     in large numbers across Ireland to condemn the recent \n     violence and demand a return to peace. As preparations are \n     made for the commencement of all-party negotiations on June \n     10, there is an obligation on all parties to ensure that this \n     widespread commitment to peace is turned into a reality for \n     all the people of the island.\n       Friends of Ireland who accompanied the President on his \n     trip also had the opportunity to observe the excellent work \n     of the International Fund for Ireland, which continues to \n     create jobs and promote understanding in both communities.\n       In 1994, at the strong urging of responsible leaders in \n     Northern Ireland and Ireland, many of the Friends of Ireland \n     wrote to President Clinton to suggest an encouraging gesture \n     be made towards Gerry Adams, by giving him a limited visa to \n     visit this country, in hopes that it might bring dialogue and \n     an end to violence. John Hume later called the visa, \n     ``crucial'' to achieving the subsequent cease-fire. We \n     believe that the participation of Sinn Fein in all-party \n     negotiations is vital for the success of the peace process, \n     but Sinn Fein cannot take its place at the peace table \n     without the restoration of the cease-fire.\n       In an effort to move beyond the pre-condition that weapons \n     be handed over prior to all-party negotiations, an \n     international commission led by former Senator George \n     Mitchell was established by the British and Irish Governments \n     to assess the issue and make recommendations to overcome the \n     impasse. We commend Senator Mitchell and the other members of \n     the commission for the outstanding job they have done. The \n     commission found that turning in weapons in advance of talks \n     would not occur and suggested constructive alternative ways \n     forward.\n       When the Irish and British Governments launched the \n     Mitchell Commission last November, they had agreed to ``the \n     firm aim'' of achieving all-party negotiations by the end of \n     February. Unfortunately, that target date was missed, due to \n     the introduction of a new pre-condition by Prime Minister \n     Major that elections must occur before talks can take place. \n     The insistence by the British Government that elections \n     precede all-party negotiations created unnecessary delays in \n     the process and aroused concern in the Nationalist community \n     of a return to the days when the Unionist majority imposed \n     its will through the Stormont Parliament.\n       We are also disappointed by the lack of willingness, on the \n     part of the leaders of the largest Unionist parties in \n     Northern Ireland, to participate in good faith in the peace \n     process, despite the fact that the process so clearly has the \n     support of the people of their community. The Friends of \n     Ireland urge the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party and \n     the Democratic Unionist Party to engage\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\n     fully in the search for a fair and comprehensive settlement. \n     There is now a unique opportunity for all sides--Nationalists \n     and Unionists--working with the two Governments to advance \n     the cause of peace.\n       We pledge to continue to do all we can to support the peace \n     process. On this St. Patrick's Day, we rededicate ourselves \n     to working with all those who continue to be genuinely \n     committed to the achievement of a lasting peace for Northern \n     Ireland.\n\n      friends of ireland executive committee, united states senate\n\n     Edward M.

Mr. President, during the past 3 weeks, several \nunfortunate events that threaten peace and stability around the world \nhave occurred. In Israel and in the skies off the Cuban coast, innocent \nmen, women, and children have lost their lives as a result of those \ntragedies. Moreover, countless others continue to suffer the \nconsequences of increased tensions between countries and groups of \npeople who have long been separated by ideological or religious \ndifferences.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have already expressed my outrage at \nthe unnecessary tragedy in the Straits of Florida and the \nunconscionable suicide bombings in Israel. I want to take this \nopportunity to voice my strong concerns about the recent escalation of \ntensions between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan.\n  In the past week, China has taken several actions intended to \nintimidate the people of Taiwan and influence its upcoming presidential \nelections. On March 5, Beijing announced its decision to conduct \nguided-missile tests near Taiwan. Three days later, China launched the \nfirst three missiles in tests it intends to conduct until March 15. On \nMarch 9, China announced its plans to conduct live-ammunition war \nexercises in the Strait of Taiwan until March 20, just 3 days before \nTaiwan's presidential elections.\n  As Secretary of State Warren Christopher indicated recently, these \nactions are ``risky, and smack of intimidation and coercion.'' China's \nactions create grave risks to stability in that region. I urge China's \nleadership to halt these dangerous and provocative actions immediately.\n  Make no mistake, the risk is real. China's missile tests and military \nexercises are dangerous in and of themselves, and they increase the \nchances of an accident that could cause tensions to spiral out of \ncontrol.\n  When China conducted similar missile tests in July and August of last \nyear, the target areas were 85 and 80 miles north of Taiwan, \nrespectively. By contrast, the target zone for the surface-to-surface \nmissiles fired last week are only half as far from Taiwan, and far too \nclose to major airline and shipping routes.\n  Of the three missiles launched last week, two landed near the port of \nKeelung which is only 23 miles from Taiwan's northern coast and \napproximately 30 miles from Taipei, Taiwan's capital. The third missile \nlanded in a target zone near the port of Kaohsiun, which is only 35 \nmiles from Taiwan's southern coast.\n  Thankfully, the three missiles fired last week and the one fired this \nweek landed where the Chinese intended. However, China intends to \nconduct similar missile tests in the same zones. If one of these \nmissiles should stray off-course and mistakenly land in Taiwan, or hit \na ship or an airliner, the repercussions would be severe. Needless to \nsay, under such circumstances, Taiwan could not be expected to sit idly \nby, and the Clinton administration has continually warned that if an \naccident occurs, China ``will be held accountable.'' I would like to \nlend my voice to those warnings.\n  Even if China's missile tests and military exercises go as planned, \nthe inevitable result is greater difficulties in the day-to-day lives \nof the Taiwanese people. Taiwan's stock market has already experienced \na great deal of volatility, and the fluctuations would have been \ngreater had it not been for government initiatives. Flights for \ncommercial airlines will also be disrupted this week when aircraft will \nbe forced to change routes to avoid China's military exercises, and \nshipping has been delayed or diverted to avoid the missile test zones.\n  Despite the heroic efforts by President Lee to keep the people of \nTaiwan calm during these trying times, China's threatening actions will \ncontinue to inject fear into the daily lives of the Taiwanese people. \nBeijing's time and efforts would be far better spent trying to \ncommunicate with Taiwan in a non-threatening and peaceful way rather \nthan carrying out reckless missile tests and military exercises.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there should be no misunderstanding that if \nChina's missile tests and military exercises should develop into actual \nmilitary action against Taiwan, the United States is well prepared to \nrespond. The carrier U.S.S. Independence, accompanied by three \nwarships, was recently ordered to move near Taiwan. Moreover, the \nU.S.S. Nimitz and five to six additional ships are expected to arrive \nnear Taiwan before the upcoming presidential elections.\n  The irony is that China is conducting missile tests and military \nexercises in order to curb support for Taiwan independence. The fact of \nthe matter is, most Taiwanese, as well as a majority of their elected \nleaders, are committed to reunification, but only reunification \nachieved through peaceful means.\n  United States policy, as spelled out in the 1979 Taiwan Relations \nAct, stipulates that the future relationship between China and Taiwan \nshould be determined by peaceful means. I sincerely hope China will not \nmiscalculate United States resolve in this regard. With the leadership \nof President Clinton, the United States stands ready to assist Taiwan \nif necessary. Again, I urge the People's Republic of China to cease its \nintimidation of Taiwan and to resolve its differences with the \nTaiwanese peacefully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2098-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2098-S2099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOLLOW-UP REPORT ON AGENT ORANGE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to call to our colleagues' \nattention important new findings on the relationship between Agent \nOrange exposure and certain health conditions. Earlier today, the \nInstitute of Medicine [IOM], which is part of the National Academy of \nSciences [NAS], released an update to their 1994 report, ``Veterans and \nAgent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam.'' These \nreports were mandated in the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-\n4), which I authored with Senator John Kerry, Senator Alan Cranston and \nRepresentative Lane Evans.\n  This report confirms what Vietnam veterans have long known: The \nVietnam war is still claiming innocent victims.\n  Unfortunately, the findings announced today validate veterans' worst \nfears about Agent Orange--that their children are suffering serious \nhealth consequences as a result of their parents' military service.\n  The report found evidence suggestive of an association between \nveterans' exposure to Agent Orange and the presence of a severe form of \nspina bifida in their children.\n  This type of spina bifida is an incurable birth defect characterized \nby a deformity in the spinal cord that often results in serious \nneurological problems, which require lifelong medical\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\ntreatment. The cost of caring for a child with spina bifida can \ndevastate a family.\n  The report concluded that there is inadequate evidence at this time \nto determine whether there may be an association to Agent Orange \nexposure and any other birth defects.\n  The Federal Government has a moral responsibility to help veterans \nwhose children suffer from spina bifida and to meet their children's \nhealth care needs. This should include the provision of essential \nmedical care and case management services to coordinate health and \nsocial services for the child.\n  But the Government's responsibility does not end there. American \nsoldiers were exposed to Agent Orange, and some of their children are \nnow paying a terrible price. The Federal Government also has a \nresponsibility to compensate these families.\n  Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown has said he will \nappoint a task force to review the findings of the new IOM-NAS report \nand make policy recommendations to him within 90 days. I applaud the \nSecretary for his aggressive pursuit of the scientific facts related to \nAgent Orange and am hopeful that the task force will help Congress and \nthe Secretary identify appropriate measures to address this \nunprecedented situation.\n  Toward that end, I am asking Secretary Brown to direct the task force \nto consider the following several specific questions as part of their \nreview:\n  First, what is the most appropriate way to provide health care to \nveterans' children with spina bifida--through the VA directly or \nthrough contracts with other providers?\n  Second, what kinds of case management services are needed to maximize \nthe quality of life for these children, and their ability to function? \nAnd how can they be delivered most effectively?\n  Third, should veterans' children with other birth defects be provided \nthose same services?\n  Finally, what is the most appropriate means of compensating the \nfamilies of children who suffer from spina bifida as a result of their \nparent's exposure to Agent Orange?\n  I am also asking the Secretary to ensure that the task force, as it \nconsiders these questions, seeks the input of organizations and \nindividuals familiar with the unique treatment and case management \nneeds of children suffering from spina bifida and other birth defects. \nI also hope the panel will consult with experts in the field of injury \ncompensation for children. Congress and the VA have an obligation to \nseek and heed the best advice these experts have to offer.\n  We need answers to these questions as soon as possible. The families \nof these children need help, and they have waited long enough.\n  Mr. President, the association between Agent Orange exposure and \nspina bifida was not the only new finding in this report. The IOM \nCommittee also updated its finding on skin cancer, moving it from \ncategory IV--``uggestive of no association with exposure''--to category \nIII--diseases for which there is ``insufficient evidence to make a \ndetermination.''\n  This change underscores the fact that we still do not understand \nfully the long-term effects of Agent Orange exposure. To facilitate my \ncolleagues' and the public's understanding of these findings, I ask \nthat a table from today's report, which explains the four-tiered \nclassification system and summarizes the results of this study, be \nprinted at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Until we have all the facts, Congress must continue, as \nwe have done since 1981, to give veterans the benefit of the doubt and \nprovide them free health care for conditions potentially related to \ntheir exposure.\n  The NAS is helping us compile an important scientific record that is \ninstrumental to Congress' effort to address the health and compensation \nneeds of veterans. I commend the Institute of Medicine for its \nexcellent work. This report builds on our scientific knowledge of the \nlong-term health consequences of exposure to Agent Orange and other \nherbicides. It recognizes that our understanding of these issues is \nstill evolving. And it recommends additional work that should be done \nto further that understanding.\n  The NAS report also serves as a valuable reminder that the impact of \nwar is felt decades beyond the final shots. This holds for the Persian \nGulf war as well as the war in Vietnam. We must be prepared to learn \nfrom the scientific effort on Agent Orange and apply these lessons to \nthe effort to discover the true health effects of environmental hazards \non the men and women who served in the gulf and on their children.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, veterans organizations, the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nthe NAS, independent scientists, and others to address the issues \nraised in this report and to continue to search for the truth and a \nbetter understanding of the lasting health effects of military service.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Table 1-1. Updated summary of findings in occupational, \n     environmental, and veterans studies regarding the association \n     between specific health problems and exposure to herbicides.\n\n\n                 sufficient evidence of an association\n\n       Evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a positive \n     association. That is, a positive association has been \n     observed between herbicides and the outcome in studies in \n     which chance, bias, and confounding could be ruled out with \n     reasonable confidence. For example, if several small studies \n     that are free from bias and confounding show an association \n     that is consistent in magnitude and direction, there may be \n     sufficient evidence for an association. There is sufficient \n     evidence of an association between exposure to herbicides and \n     the following health outcomes: Soft-tissue sarcoma, non-\n     Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease chloracne.\n\n\n             limited/suggestive evidence of an association\n\n       Evidence is suggestive of an association between herbicides \n     and the outcome but is limited because chance, bias, and \n     confounding could not be ruled out with confidence. For \n     example, at least one high-quality study shows a positive \n     association, but the results of other studies are \n     inconsistent. There is limited/suggestive evidence of an \n     association between exposure to herbicides and the following \n     health outcomes: Respiratory cancers (lung, larynx, trachea), \n     prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, acute and subacute \n     peripheral neuropathy (new disease category), spina bifida \n     (new disease category), porphyria cutanea tarda (category \n     change in 1996).\n\n\n inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association \n                                 exists\n\n       The available studies are of insufficient quality, \n     consistency, or statistical power to permit a conclusion \n     regarding the presence or absence of an association. For \n     example, studies fail to control for confounding, have \n     inadequate exposure assessment, or fail to address latency. \n     There is inadequate or insufficient evidence to determine \n     whether an association exists between exposure to herbicides \n     and the following health outcomes: Hepatobiliary cancers, \n     nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer, bone cancer, female reproductive \n     cancers (cervical, uterine, ovarian), breast cancer, renal \n     cancer, testicular cancer, leukemia, spontaneous \n     abortion, birth defects (other than spina bifida), \n     neonatal/infant death and stillbirths, low birthweight, \n     childhood cancer in offspring, abnormal sperm parameters \n     and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, \n     motor/coordination dysfunction, chronic peripheral nervous \n     system disorders, metabolic and digestive disorders \n     (diabetes, changes in liver enzymes, lipid abnormalities, \n     ulcers), immune system disorders (immune suppression and \n     autoimmunity), circulatory disorders, respiratory \n     disorders, skin cancer (category change in 1996).\n\n\n             Limited/Suggestive Evidence of No Association\n\n       Several adequate studies, covering the full range of levels \n     of exposure that human beings are known to encounter, are \n     mutually consistent in not showing a positive association \n     between exposure to herbicides and the outcome at any level \n     of exposure. A conclusion of ``no association'' is inevitably \n     limited to the conditions, level of exposure, and length of \n     observation covered by the available studies. In addition, \n     the possibility of a very small elevation in risk at the \n     levels of exposure studied can never be excluded. There is \n     limited/suggestive evidence of no association between \n     exposure to herbicides and the following health outcomes: \n     Gastrointestinal tumors (stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, \n     colon cancer, rectal cancer), bladder cancer, brain tumors.\n\n       Note.--``Herbicides'' refers to the major herbicides used \n     in Vietnam: 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid); 2,4,5-T \n     (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and its contaminant TCDD \n     (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin); cacodylic acid; and \n     picloram. The evidence regarding association is drawn from \n     occupational and other studies in which subjects were exposed \n     to a variety of herbicides and herbicide components.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2098-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2099-S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2099-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2100-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING PROPOSED RESCISSIONS OF BUDGETARY RESOURCES--MESSAGE \n           FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING RECESS--PM 131\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 13, 1996, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received the following message from the President of the \nUnited States, together with an accompanying report; which, pursuant to \nthe order of January 30, 1975, as modified by the order of April 1986, \nwas referred jointly to the Committee on Appropriations, Committee on \nthe Budget, and the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974, I herewith report five proposed rescissions of budgetary \nresources, totaling $50 million.

A bill to amend the National School Lunch Act to provide \ngreater flexibility to schools to meet the Dietary Guidelines for \nAmericans under the school lunch and school breakfast programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n          the national school lunch act amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing \ntoday will amend the National School Lunch Act to provide greater \nflexibility to schools to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans \nunder the School Lunch and Breakfast Programs.\n  The National School Lunch Program is a program that works.\n  The National School Lunch Program currently operates in over 92,000 \nschools and serves approximately 26 million children each day. In my \nState of Mississippi approximately 7 out of 10 children participate in \nthe School Lunch Program. It is very important to have the flexibility \nto serve the children healthy meals while reducing time consuming \npaperwork.\n  The Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act of 1994 contained \nprovisions to improve and simplify the National School Lunch Program. \nIt included a requirement that schools implement the Dietary Guidelines \nfor Americans.\n  We must allow for local and regional food preferences. Further, not \nevery school district has the resources to conduct sophisticated \nnutrient analysis of each meal or to hire a nutritionist.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would not delete or \npostpone in any way the requirement that the School Lunch Program \nimplement the Dietary Guidelines in a timely manner. Rather, my \nlegislation will allow local schools to implement the Dietary \nGuidelines with greater program flexibility and less expense.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the school food service \nadministrators in Mississippi.\n  I urge Senators to support it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 1614. A bill to provide for the stabilization, enhancement, \nrestoration, and management of the Coeur d'Alene River Basin watershed, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n  the coeur d'alene river basin environmental restoration act of 1996\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, with the \ncosponsorship of Senator Kempthorne, the Coeur d'Alene River Basin \nEnvironmental Restoration Act of 1996. This legislation would allow for \na workable solution to clean up the historic effects of mining on the \nCoeur d'Alene Basin in north Idaho.\n  This legislation establishes a process that is centered around an \naction plan developed between the Governor of the State of Idaho and a \nCitizens Advisory Commission comprised of 13 representatives of \naffected State and Federal Government agencies, private citizens, the \nCoeur d'Alene Indian Tribe, and affected industries. The \nresponsibilities of this commission are very important to the ultimate \nsuccess of cleaning up the basin.\n  The Silver Valley of north Idaho has made contributions to the \nnational economy and to all of our country's war efforts for well over \na century. The Federal Government has been involved in every phase of \nmineral production over the history of the valley. It is, therefore, \nappropriate that Congress specifically legislate a resolution of \nnatural resources damages in the Coeur d'Alene Basin and participate in \nfunding such a plan.\n  I want to make clear this legislation does not interfere with the \nongoing Superfund cleanup within the 21-square mile Bunker Hill site. \nThis legislation sets up a framework for voluntary cleanup of affected \nareas outside this 21-square mile area. In drafting this legislation, I \nhave worked with the mining industry, the Coeur d'Alene tribe, local \ngovernments, the Governor of Idaho and citizens in north Idaho. It is \nonly through the involvement of all these parties that a solution will \nbe reached.\n  Throughout this effort it has been clear that all parties want the \nbasin cleaned up, and they want the cleanup done with the concerns of \nlocal citizens and entities addressed and with controls and cleanup \ndecisions made in Idaho, not in Washington, DC. These are the guiding \nprinciples that I have applied in developing this legislation.\n  Local cleanup has already begun in the headwaters of the basin's \ndrainage. Nine Mile Creek and Canyon Creek have had proven engineering \ndesigns implemented within their drainages. The Coeur d'Alene River \nBasin Environmental Restoration Act of 1996 would assure that this type \nof meaningful restoration could continue. However, the actions needed \nin each part of the basin are not clear. That is why my bill calls for \nthe Governor of Idaho and the Citizens Advisory Commission to develop \nan action plan that can address the varying conditions within the \nbasin. For example, engineering solutions will certainly work in \nportions of the basin--but not every place. The steeper gradient \nstreams in the upper basin respond well to engineering fixes, but these \ntypes of fixes may only exacerbate problems in the lower, flatter \nportions of the basin. Local input and control through the action plan \ncan address such diversity and the need for varying environmental \nfixes.\n  The Department of Justice is currently threatening a lawsuit for \nalleged natural resources damages in the area addressed by this \nlegislation. For the Federal Government to follow such a course would \nbe folly. When the Federal Government litigates under Superfund, the \nmembers of the legal\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nprofession benefit, as litigation eats away at whatever resources are \navailable for a cleanup. Litigation does not benefit the citizens \naffected by a cleanup and certainly does not benefit the resources that \nare purported to be the primary consideration when such a suit is \npursued. I do not intend to see cleanup resources in north Idaho to go \nto litigation and not to cleanup. It is my goal to see the Coeur \nd'Alene basin cleanup is not litigated away. That is the reason I have \nintroduced this legislation. It will clean up the basin, not \nlitigiously waste the basin's resources.\n  I think it is an important step toward a historic cleanup of a very \nimportant and beautiful area of the country.\n       By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. JOHNSTON):\n\n  S. 1615. A bill to modify the project for navigation, Mississippi \nRiver Ship Channel, Gulf to Baton Rouge, LA, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              CHALMETTE SLIP DREDGING PROJECT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce today, together with my senior \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a bill to \nauthorize the Corps of Engineers to conduct maintenance dredging for \nthe Chalmette Slip. The project is needed to assist the St. Bernard \nPort, Terminal and Harbor District conduct its current daily business \nmore effectively and to facilitate future development.\n  Located in St. Bernard Parish near mile 90.5 of the Mississippi \nRiver, the project's authorization would be carried out as part of the \ncurrently authorized and ongoing operations and maintenance project for \nthe Mississippi River, Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The slip's depth is now approximately 30 feet. The authorization \nwould allow it to be deepened to 33 feet, over a distance of \napproximately 1,500 feet.\n  With the additional depth needed to help the port operate more \neffectively and to improve its operations, the project certainly is a \njustified one.\n  Senator Johnston and I are hopeful that the proposed Chalmette Slip \nauthorization will be included as part of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act legislation when it is taken up by the Senate.\n  We urge its consideration and passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 1616. A bill to establish a visa waiver pilot program for \nnationals of Korea who are traveling in tour groups to the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               korean nationals visa waiver pilot program\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat would establish a Visa Waiver Pilot Program for Korean nationals \nwho are traveling in tour groups to the United States. I am joined in \nthis effort by Senators Murkowski, Akaka, and Stevens.\n  According to the 1995 National Trade Estimate Report entitled \n``Foreign Trade Barriers,'' in 1994, the United States trade deficit \nwith the Republic of Korea was $1.6 billion, or $718 million greater \nthan in 1993. United States merchandise exports to the Republic of \nKorea were $18 billion in 1994, up $3.3 billion from 1993. United \nStates imports from the Republic of Korea totaled $19.7 billion in \n1994, 14.8 percent more than in 1993. The Republic of Korea is the \nsixth largest trading partner of the United States.\n  Travel and tourism play a major role in reducing the United States' \nunfavorable balance of trade. There is an increasing demand by citizens \nof the Republic of Korea to visit the United States. In fiscal year \n1994, 320,747 nonimmigrants visas were issued to Korean travelers. In \nfiscal year 1995, 394,044 nonimmigrant visas were issued to Korean \ntravelers. Of this amount, 320,120 were tourist visas.\n  The Republic of Korea is not eligible to participate in the current \nVisa Waiver Pilot Program. Thus, Koreans are required to obtain a visa \nto travel to the United States. Unfortunately, U.S. visas can not be \nprocessed in a reasonable time frame. There is often a 2 to 3 week \nwaiting period to obtain tourist visas. Although the Secretary of State \nhas attempted to address the problem by including additional personnel \nin the consular section at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, visa processing \ndelays do continue.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would establish a 3-year \npilot program that would waive the visa requirement for Korean \nnationals traveling as part of a group tour to the United States. Under \nthe program, selected travel agencies in Korea would be allowed to \nissue temporary travel permits. The applicants would be required to \nmeet the same prerequisites imposed by the United States Embassy.\n  The pilot legislation also includes additional restrictions to help \ndeter the possibility of illegal immigration. These are:\n  The stay in the United States is no more than 15 days.\n  The visitor poses no threat to the welfare, health, and safety, or \nsecurity of the United States.\n  The visitor possesses a round-trip ticket.\n  The visitor who is deemed inadmissible or deportable by an \nimmigration officer would be returned to Korea by the transportation \ncarrier.\n  Tour operators will be required to post a $200,000 performance bond \nwith the Secretary of State, and will be penalized if a visitor fails \nto return on schedule.\n  Tour operators will be required to provide written certification of \nthe on-time return of each visitor within the tour group.\n  The Secretary of State and the Attorney General can terminate the \npilot program should the overstay rate exceed 2 percent.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill text be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. KOREA VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) travel and tourism play a major role in reducing the \n     United States unfavorable balance of trade;\n       (2) the characteristics of the Korean travel market do not \n     permit long-term planning for longer trips;\n       (3) applications for United States visas cannot now be \n     processed in a reasonable period of time;\n       (4) the Secretary of State has attempted to solve the \n     problem by adding additional staff to the consular section at \n     the United States Embassy in Seoul;\n       (5) unfortunately, these additions have not resulted in any \n     discernable improvement in reducing visa processing delays;\n       (6) further, it is unlikely, given the current fiscal \n     environment, to expect funding to be available for further \n     staff additions in sufficient numbers to effect any \n     significant improvement in the time required to process visa \n     applications;\n       (7) most of the nations of the South Pacific, Europe, and \n     Canada do not currently require Koreans entering their \n     countries to have a visa, thus providing them with a serious \n     competitive advantage in the tourism industry;\n       (8) the United States territory of Guam has been permitted \n     by the United States Government to eliminate visa \n     requirements for Koreans visiting Guam, with resultant \n     impressive increases in travel and tourism from citizens of \n     the Republic of Korea;\n       (9) any application under existing procedures to add the \n     Republic of Korea, or any other nation to the group of \n     favored nations exempted from United States visa regulations, \n     would require many years during which time the United States \n     could well lose its competitive advantages in attracting \n     travel and tourism from the Republic of Korea;\n       (10) the Republic of Korea, as a gesture of goodwill, has \n     already unilaterally exempted United States tourists who seek \n     to enter the Republic of Korea from the requirement of \n     obtaining a visa; and\n       (11) growth in Korean travel to the United States has not \n     kept pace with growth in travel to non-United States \n     destinations, and cumbersome and time-consuming visa \n     processing procedures are widely recognized as the cause of \n     this loss of market share and competitiveness with \n     alternative destinations.\n       (b) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of State and the Attorney \n     General jointly shall establish a pilot project (in this \n     section referred to as the ``pilot program'') within six \n     months of the date of the enactment of this Act under which \n     the requirement of paragraph (7)(B)(i)(II) of section 212(a) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(II)) is waived during the pilot program \n     period in the case of any alien who meets the following \n     requirements:\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\n       (1) National of pilot program country.--The alien is a \n     national of, and presents a passport issued by, the Republic \n     of Korea. The Republic of Korea is urged to provide machine \n     readable passports to its citizens in the near future.\n       (2) Seeking entry as tourist.--The alien is applying for \n     admission to the United States during the pilot program \n     period as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure (as described \n     in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B))), as part of a group tour to \n     the United States.\n       (3) Period of stay.--The alien seeks to stay in the United \n     States for a period of not more than 15 days.\n       (4) Executes immigration forms.--The alien before the time \n     of such admission completes such immigration form as the \n     Attorney General shall establish.\n       (5) Entry into the united states.--If arriving by sea or \n     air, the alien arrives at the port of entry into the United \n     States on a carrier which has entered into an agreement with \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service to guarantee \n     transport of the alien out of the United States if the alien \n     is found inadmissible or deportable by an immigration \n     officer.\n       (6) Not a safety threat.--The alien has been determined not \n     to represent a threat to the welfare, health, safety, or \n     security of the United States.\n       (7) No previous violation.--If the alien previously was \n     admitted without a visa under this section, the alien must \n     not have failed to comply with the conditions of any previous \n     admission as such a nonimmigrant.\n       (8) Round-trip ticket.--The alien is in possession of a \n     round-trip transportation ticket (unless this requirement is \n     waived by the Attorney General under regulations).\n       (c) Waiver of Rights.--An alien may not be provided a \n     waiver under the pilot program unless the alien has waived \n     any right--\n       (1) to review or appeal under this Act of an immigration \n     officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien \n     at the port of entry into the United States, or\n       (2) to contest, other than on the basis of an application \n     for asylum, any action for deportation against the alien.\n       (d) Termination of Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of State, acting jointly, may terminate the pilot \n     program under this section on or after a date which is one \n     year after the date of the establishment of the pilot program \n     if--\n       (1) during the preceding fiscal year, the overstay rate for \n     nationals of the Republic of Korea entering the United States \n     under the pilot program exceeds the overstay rate of such \n     nationals entering the United States with valid visas; and\n       (2) the Attorney General and the Secretary of State have \n     jointly determined that the pilot program is leading to a \n     significant increase in the number of overstays by such \n     nationals.\n       (e) Special Bond and Notification Requirements for Tour \n     Operators.--\n       (1) In general.--Nationals of the Republic of Korea may not \n     enter the United States under the terms of this section \n     unless they are accompanied for the duration of their \n     authorized admission period by a tour operator who has \n     fulfilled the following requirements:\n       (A) The tour operator has posted a bond of $200,000 with \n     the Secretary of State.\n       (B) The Secretary of State, under such regulations as the \n     Secretary may prescribe, has approved an application by the \n     tour operator to escort tour groups to the United States.\n       (C) The tour operator provides the name, address, \n     birthdate, passport number, and citizenship of all \n     prospective tour group members to the Secretary of State no \n     less than one business day prior to the departure date of the \n     group, under such regulations as he may prescribe, in order \n     to determine that the prospective travelers do not represent \n     a threat to the welfare, health, safety, and security of the \n     United States.\n       (D) The tour operator excludes from the tour group any \n     person whom the Secretary of State denies permission to \n     travel to the United States.\n       (E) The tour operator provides written certification or \n     other such evidence prescribed by the Secretary of State and \n     Attorney General which documents the return to Korea of each \n     tour group member.\n       (2) Forfeiture of bonds.--Bonds posted in accordance with \n     this subsection shall be forfeited in whole or in part and a \n     tour operator's authorization to escort tours to the United \n     States may be suspended or revoked if the Secretary of State \n     finds that the tour operator--\n       (A) has failed to disclose a material fact in connection \n     with the application required under paragraph (1)(B);\n       (B) fails to comply with the advance notification and \n     refusal requirements of paragraphs (1)(C) and (1)(D);\n       (C) has failed to take adequate steps to ensure that \n     visitors who are being escorted to the United States under \n     the terms of an approved application return to their country \n     of residence; or\n       (D) is found at any time to have committed a felony or any \n     offense under the immigration laws of the United States.\n       (f) Participation by Tour Agents.--The Secretary of State \n     shall periodically review the overstay rate of nationals of \n     the Republic of Korea that corresponds to each tour agent \n     participating in the program under this section. The \n     Secretary may terminate the participation in the program of \n     any tour agent if the Secretary determines that the \n     corresponding overstay rate is excessive.\n       (g) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) Group tour.--The term ``group tour'' means travelers \n     who take advantage of group-purchased hotel or airfare \n     packages, as guided, supervised, and arranged by a tour agent \n     in the Republic of Korea approved or licensed by the \n     Department of State.\n       (2) Overstay rate.--The term ``overstay rate'' means, \n     during a specified period of time, the proportion that the \n     number of aliens remaining in the United States after the \n     expiration of their visas bears to the total number of aliens \n     entering the United States during that period of time.\n       (3) Pilot program period.--The term ``pilot program \n     period'' means the three-year period immediately following \n     the establishment of the pilot program.\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nKorea visa waiver pilot project legislation. I have worked closely with \nSenators Inouye, Akaka, and Stevens on this legislation. This bill \naddresses the problem of the slow issuance of United States tourist \nvisas to Korean citizens, and their, too often, subsequent decision not \nto vacation in the United States.\n  Koreans typically wait 2 to 3 weeks to obtain visas from the United \nStates Embassy in Seoul. As a result, these spontaneous travelers \ndecide to go to one of the other 48 nations that allow them to travel \nto their country without a visa, including both Canada and New Zealand.\n  This bill provides the legal basis for a carefully controlled pilot \nprogram for visa free travel by Koreans to the United States. The \nprogram seeks to capture the Korean tourism market lost due to the \ncumbersome visa system. For example, in 1994, 296,706 nonimmigrant \nUnited States visas were granted to Koreans of which 7,000 came to \nAlaska. It is predicted that there would be a 500- to 700-percent \nincrease in Korean tourism to Alaska with the visa waiver pilot \nproject. In New Zealand, for example, a 700-percent increase in tourism \nfrom Korea occurred after they dropped the visa requirement.\n  This pilot program allows visitors in a tour group from South Korea \nto travel to the United States without a visa. however, it does not \ncompromise the security standards of the United States. The program \nwould allow selected travel agencies in Korea to issue temporary travel \npermits based on applicants meeting the same preset standards used by \nthe United States Embassy in Seoul. The travel permits could only be \nused for supervised group tours.\n  Many restrictions are included in the legislation for the pilot \nproposal.\n  The Attorney General and Secretary of State can terminate the program \nif the overstay rates in the program are over 2 percent.\n  The stay of the visitors is less than or equal to 15 days.\n  The visitors have to have a round-trip ticket, in addition, the \nvisitors have to arrive by a carrier that agrees to take them back if \nthey are deemed inadmissible.\n  We recommend to the Secretary of State to institute a bonding and \nlicensing requirement that each participating travel agency post a \nsubstantial performance bond and pay a financial penalty if a tourist \nfails to return on schedule.\n  The one-time return of each tourist in the group would be certified \nafter each tour.\n  Security checks are done to ensure that the visitor is not a safety \nthreat to the United States.\n  This legislation's restrictions ensure that the pilot program will be \na successful program. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1617. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe use of appropriated funds by Federal agencies for lobbying \nactivities; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 the federal anti-lobbying act of 1996\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nFederal Agency Anti-Lobbying Act, a bill to prevent Federal agencies \nfrom using taxpayer funds to lobby Congress or encourage others to do \nso.\n  Too many times under the administration, Federal officials have used \ntheir position in an attempt to foster public support or opposition to \npending legislation.\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n  Spending taxpayer funds on politically motivated lobbying activities \nisn't just wasteful, it's wrong.\n  Taxpayers, who come from all walks of life and all ends of the \npolitical spectrum, should not be forced to finance lobbying activities \non behalf of causes they might oppose, or know nothing about.\n  Especially in this age of fiscal austerity, no one should ever use \nFederal money to lobby the Federal Government. This bill goes after the \nmost blatant examples--where Federal agencies are producing and \nspreading propaganda--and encouraging others to lobby on their behalf.\n  The abuses addressed by this bill are already illegal, but the \nexisting law, which employs criminal sanctions, has never been \nenforced. It has been subject to many different interpretations by the \nJustice Department, but never one that included enforcement.\n  This bill includes civil sanctions, providing for easier enforcement, \nand helps clear up any ambiguities.\n  Under this bill, the President, the Vice President, and Senate-\nconfirmed Federal officials are allowed to speak out on the \nadministration's position--but they cannot place pressure on non-\ngovernmental organizations.\n  Executive branch officials are allowed to communicate with Congress \ndirectly about upcoming bills.\n  But the bill does not allow the administration to continue what has \nbecome in essence a grassroots lobbying operation at taxpayer expense.\n  The bill will bring a halt to the outrageous practice of Government \nagencies providing talking points, briefing books, pamphlets, and other \nactivities undertaken to foster the support or opposition to pending \nlegislation.\n  When the Founding Fathers designed our Government, they adhered \nstrictly to the doctrine of separation of powers. This bill is an \nattempt to return our Government to their ideal.\n  The executive branch should concern itself with implementing the laws \npassed by Congress, not with trying to influence the outcome of \nlegislation for their own--or others' special interests.\n  The legislative process is the purview of the legislative branch. We \nwelcome the administration's input, but not their lobbying activities. \nThis bill will protect the taxpayers by ending these practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING MISSILE TESTS BY THE \n                   PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Republic of China, in a clear attempt to \n     intimidate the people and Government of Taiwan, has over the \n     past 8 months conducted a series of military exercises, \n     including missile tests, within alarmingly close proximity to \n     Taiwan.\n       (2) On March 5, 1996, the Xinhua News Agency announced that \n     the People's Republic of China would conduct missile tests \n     from March 8 through March 15, 1996, within 25 to 35 miles of \n     the 2 principal northern and southern ports of Taiwan, \n     Kaohsiung and Keelung.\n       (3) The proximity of these tests to the ports and the \n     accompanying warnings for ships and aircraft to avoid the \n     test areas is resulting in the effective disruption of the \n     ports, and of international shipping and air traffic, for the \n     duration of the tests.\n       (4) These tests are a clear escalation of the attempts by \n     the People's Republic of China to intimidate Taiwan and \n     influence the outcome of the upcoming democratic presidential \n     election in Taiwan.\n       (5) Relations between the United States and the Peoples' \n     Republic of China rest upon the expectation that the future \n     of Taiwan will be settled solely by peaceful means.\n       (6) The strong interest of the United States in the \n     peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question is one of the \n     central premises of the three United States-China Joint \n     Communiques and was codified in the Taiwan Relations Act.\n       (7) The Taiwan Act states that peace and stability in the \n     western Pacific ``are in the political, security, and \n     economic interests of the United States, and are matters of \n     international concern''.\n       (8) The Taiwan Relations Act states that the United States \n     considers ``any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by \n     other than peaceful means, including by boycotts, or \n     embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the western \n     Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States''.\n       (9) The Taiwan Relations Act directs the President to \n     ``inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or \n     the social or economic system of the people on Taiwan and any \n     danger to the interests of the United States arising \n     therefrom''.\n       (10) The Taiwan Relations Act further directs that ``the \n     President and the Congress shall determine, in accordance \n     with constitutional process, appropriate action by the United \n     States in response to any such danger''.\n       (11) The United States, the People's Republic of China, and \n     the Government of Taiwan have each previously expressed their \n     commitment to the resolution of the Taiwan question through \n     peaceful means.\n       (12) These missile tests and accompanying statements made \n     by the Government of the People's Republic of China call into \n     serious question the commitment of China to the peaceful \n     resolution of the Taiwan question.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the United States deplores the missile tests that the \n     People's Republic of China is conducting from March 8 through \n     March 15, 1996, and views them as a potentially serious \n     threat to the peace, security, and stability of Taiwan and \n     not in the spirit of the three United States-China Joint \n     Communiques;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     cease its bellicose actions directed at Taiwan and instead \n     enter into meaningful dialogue with the Government of Taiwan \n     at the highest levels, such as through the Straits Exchange \n     Foundation in Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across \n     the Taiwan Straits in Beijing, with an eye towards decreasing \n     tensions and resolving the issue of the future of Taiwan;\n       (3) the President, consistent with section 3(c) of the \n     Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3302(c)), should immediately \n     consult with Congress on an appropriate United States \n     response to the tests should the tests pose an actual threat \n     to the peace, security, and stability of Taiwan; and\n       (4) the President should, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), reexamine the nature \n     and quantity of defense articles and services that may be \n     necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense capability in light of the heightened threat.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  COATS (AND GRAMS) AMENDMENT NO. 3513\n\n  Mr. COATS (for himself and Mr. Grams) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 3466 proposed by Mr. Hatifield to the bill H.R. 3019, \nsupra;

More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible \n     households have annual incomes of less than $8,000; more than \n     one-half have annual incomes below $6,000.\n       LIHEAP program funding has been substantially reduced in \n     recent years, and cannot sustain any further spending cuts if \n     the program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income people \n     in cold-weather states;\n       Traditionally, LIHEAP has received advance appropriations \n     for the next fiscal year. This allows states to properly plan \n     for the upcoming winter and best serve the energy needs of \n     low income families.\n       Congress was not able to pass an appropriations bill for \n     the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education by the beginning of this fiscal year and it was \n     only because LIHEAP received advance appropriations last \n     fiscal year that the President was able to release the $578 \n     million he did in December--the bulk of the funds made \n     available to the states this winter.\n       There is currently available to the President up to $300 \n     million in emergency LIHEAP funding, which could be made \n     available immediately, on a targeted basis, to meet the \n     urgent home heating needs of eligible persons who otherwise \n     could be faced with heating-related emergencies, including \n     shut-offs, in the coming weeks;\n       Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (a) the President should release immediately a substantial \n     portion of available emergency funding for the Low Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Program for FY 1996, to help meet \n     continuing urgent needs for home heating assistance during \n     this unusually cold winter; and\n       (b) not less than the $1 billion in regular advance-\n     appropriated LIHEAP funding for next winter provided for in \n     this bill should be retained in a House-Senate conference on \n     this measure.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                    McCAIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 3521-3522\n\n  Mr. BOND (for Mr. McCain) proposed two amendments to amendment No. \n3466 to the bill H.R. 3019, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3521\n\n       On page 756, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1103.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nprospects for peace in Northern Ireland.\n  Over the past 2 years, Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland \nhave made significant strides toward achieving a fair and lasting peace \nfor their troubled land.\n  And as one of more than 40 million Irish-Americans, I take great \npride in the critically important role that the United States and, in \nparticular, President Clinton is playing in this process.\n  It was the President's courageous move, in February 1994, to grant a \nvisa to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams that set the wheels of peace in \nmotion.\n  That step, controversial at the time, was a critical factor in \nleading to the IRA's unilateral announcement of a cease-fire, 6 months \nlater.\n  For the first time in 25 years, the threat of violence in Northern \nIreland was but a distant and unrealized fear.\n  The roadblocks, the checkpoints, the house-to-house searches that \ndefaced Northern Ireland for a generation began to disappear.\n  And, in stark contrast to the past 25 years of sectarian conflict--\nwhich claimed 3,000 Catholic and Protestant lives--when the people of \nNorthern Ireland gathered together over the past 2 years it was more \noften to celebrate and not to grieve another untimely death from the \ntroubles.\n  The desire for peace among the peoples of Northern Ireland was \nunderscored just this past December, when President Clinton became the \nfirst American President to travel to Northern Ireland.\n  I had the great pleasure of joining the President on this trip.\n  And I guarantee that regardless of one's political, ethnic or \nideological persuasion, it was impossible not to be genuinely moved by \nthe heartfelt reception that the President received.\n  On several occasions the President was welcomed by crowds of more \nthan 250,000 people, all intent on listening to his message of \nreconciliation.\n  This outpouring of support is indicative of the great desire among \nthe majority of Northern Ireland's residents to live in peace with \ntheir neighbors.\n  But, just a month ago, those hopes for peace were dealt a stinging \nblow by an IRA bomb that rocked London's Docklands district killing 2 \npeople, injuring more than 100 and causing millions of dollars in \nproperty damage.\n  This reprehensible act serves as a nightmarish reminder that the \npeace process in Northern Ireland is far from complete.\n  The 17-month cease-fire in Northern Ireland, which made such progress \nin diminishing the fears and anxieties of violence among millions of \nProtestants and Catholics, was ripped asunder.\n  The image of British soldiers patrolling the streets of Belfast--a \nvision many of us hoped and believed had been banished--disturbingly \nreappeared on our television screens.\n  What's more the London bombing threatened to permanently derail the \npeace process, which has come so far in moving the peoples of Northern \nIreland closer to peace than at any time in a generation.\n  For this reason, I am particularly heartened that at this moment of \ncrisis, both Prime Minister Major and Prime Minister Bruton stepped \nforward to put Northern Ireland firmly back on the path toward peace.\n  On February 28, Mr. Major and Mr. Bruton outlined a new proposal for \nbringing all parties to the peace table by June 10.\n  Now the two governments are seeking to work out arrangements for a \nbroadly acceptable electoral process that will lead immediately to all \nparty talks in June.\n  I commend Prime Minister Major for going the extra mile at this \ncritical juncture in the peace process, in part by dropping his \nprecondition that the IRA decommission prior to the commencement of all \nparty talks.\n  I only regret that British authorities did not see the wisdom of that \napproach sooner when it was first recommended by Senator Mitchell and \nthe other members of the International Body.\n  Perhaps if they had, the current escalation in tensions could have \nbeen avoided and the parties might already be engaged in substantive \ntalks toward peace.\n  The actions of Prime Minister Major and Prime Minister Bruton echo \nthe words of the wonderful Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who recently won \nthe Nobel Prize for Literature. In his poem, Station Island, Heaney \nwrites:\n\n       You lose more of yourself than you redeem doing the decent \n     thing.\n\n  Well Mr. Major and Mr. Bruton did the decent thing and I applaud both \nof them for their foresight and their vision.\n  Let me also say that Mr. Major's compromise is commendable in light \nof the IRA's recent wave of bombing attacks in London. These \nirresponsible actions have only created confusion and greater animosity \nin the search for peace.\n  The IRA's actions eroded goodwill between Catholics and Protestants \nand threatened to derail what was already a fledgling peace process.\n  The time is now for the IRA to make clear to all parties in the \nconflict that they are truly prepared to enter into inclusive all-party \nnegotiations to bring a fair and lasting settlement to the conflict. \nAnd, if Sinn Fein is to be an active participant in helping to shape \nthe agenda for all party talks, the IRA must refrain from further \nviolence.\n  The future of Northern Ireland will not be found in the barrel of a \ngun. Compromise will not be achieved under the threat of violence. This \nis a lesson the IRA must understand and accept.\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\n  The first step in affirming that commitment would be for the IRA to \nimmediately reinstate the 17-month cease-fire they brazenly and \nfoolishly broke last month.\n  The second step would be for Sinn Fein to show a greater willingness \nto compromise on the decommissioning issue.\n  I think we all recognize the need for Sinn Fein to be at the \nnegotiating table and directly involved in all-party talks.\n  Thus, we must redouble our efforts in the coming weeks to settle on \nan elective process that will be broadly acceptable to all parties and \nwhich will lead to a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.\n  I remain optimistic that by March 17, St. Patrick's Day, all the \ninvolved parties, working together, will be able to agree upon a fair \nand comprehensive agenda for all party talks in June.\n  In order to reach this goal all sides, Catholics and Protestants, \nIrish and British, must act in good faith in order to smooth the \nprocess toward genuine reconciliation.\n  As an American of Irish descent, the resolution of the conflict in \nNorthern Ireland is of particular significance and importance to me. \nBoth sides of my family immigrated to this country from Ireland.\n  For me a foreign trip to Ireland is akin to a family reunion.\n  That is why I am so desperate to see this process succeed and bring a \nlasting peace to Northern Ireland. And I believe that today we stand on \nthe cusp of a truly new era of peace and reconciliation between \nCatholics and Protestants.\n  In the spirit of St. Patrick's Day, I am once again reminded of the \nwords of Seamus Heaney:\n\n       History says, don't hope on this side of the grave, but \n     then once in a lifetime, the long, far tidal wave of justice \n     can rise up, and hope and history rhyme. So hope for a great \n     sea change on the far side of revenge. Believe that further \n     shore is reachable from here. Believe in miracles and cures \n     and healing wells.\n\n  At no time in the history of Northern Ireland have Catholics and \nProtestants been so close to that point where hope and history rhyme. \nTogether with all involved parties, the American people must stand \ntogether with those whose goal is peace and reconciliation in Northern \nIreland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2136-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THEODORE O.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ncolleague of mine, Jim Bunning, who was recently inducted into the \nBaseball Hall of Fame. This is an outstanding honor and one for which \nhe and his family should be very proud. I take special interest in his \nelection because for 9 years, from 1955 to 1963, he pitched for the \nDetroit Tigers. Being a Tigers fan and a Detroit resident I had the \ngood fortune to see Jim Bunning pitch on a number of occasions. He was \na tremendous pitcher. Although Detroit's record varied through those \nyears, Jim Bunning could be counted on for a solid game. It was \nunfortunate for Detroit, but advantageous for baseball history, that \nJim left the Tigers, and the American League, and moved to \nPhiladelphia, and the National League. He would soon become the only \nplayer in baseball history to throw a no-hitter in each league. His \nlifetime statistics are similarly impressive. Jim Bunning is one of \nthose remarkable men who has succeeded not only on the field of sport \nbut in the arena of public service. Since his departure from baseball \nin 1971, he has become an adroit and respected legislator. Although we \ndon't serve on the same team here in Congress, Jim Bunning, for his \nathletic and congressional achievements will always have my deep \nrespect and admiration.{time} \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2137-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HANDS-ON/MINDS-ON TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Sandia \nNational Laboratories for its communication coordination of the hands-\non/minds-on technologies [HMTech] program in New Mexico. This program \nenhances the study of science and technology in the African-American \nstudent population and further encourages these students to enter \ntechnology related careers. Mr. President, this year the HMTech program \nreached a milestone--its 10th year of operation.\n  The HMTech project has touched the lives of more than 1,000 New \nMexico students. The project began in 1986 as a program to promote \nacademic achievement in the African-American student population and \nprovide activity based science and engineering activities. HMTech's \nprimary goal is to support the development of a scientific and \ntechnically trained student base with hands-on technology \nopportunities. HMTech's class activities include drafting, ecology, \nhealth, medicine, physics, computer science, electronics, chemistry, \nmath, and communications skills.\n  Mr. President, providing a child-centered approach to instruction, \nHMTech is an intensive 6-week evening program offered each fall and \nspring at no charge to students grades 5 through 12. African-American \ninstructors, including scientists, engineers, and technicals, staff the \nproject, volunteering their expertise and their time to the HMTech \nprogram for classroom instruction.\n  The HMTech also has a very exciting and extensive tutorial program. \nHMTech provides students after school tutorials in math and science, a \nmultidisciplinary homework hotline, scholastic aptitude test [SAT] \ntutorials, college preparatory classes, parent involvement workshops, \nand workshops for the instructors and volunteers.\n  Mr. President, for its outstanding accomplishments, sincere interest \nin expanding the minds of young people, and its outstanding service to \nNew Mexico and our Nation in education and technology, I would like to \ncommend those who make the HMTech program a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2137-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2137-S2138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RETIREMENT OF PETE CARRIL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this year March Madness will \nhave two New Jersey teams competing for the men's college basketball \nchampionship. I rise to extend my personal congratulations to the \nMonmouth University Hawks and the Princeton University Tigers, who have \nearned berths in the NCAA tournament.\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Monmouth Hawks represent one of New Jersey's fine \ninstitutions of higher learning. Monmouth University's appearance in \nthe NCAA tournament this year is its first ever, and an accomplishment \nof which the college is deservedly proud. The Hawks, led by coach Wayne \nSzoke, have amassed an impressive 20-9 record this year with their \nwell-run motion offense, long-range shooting, and tenacious defense. \nBack in November, nobody picked them to make it to the NCAA tournament, \nbut they are a team on the rise. Their next opponent is sure to find \nthat out. I am pleased that Monmouth University has this opportunity to \nget some well-deserved national recognition and wish the Hawks the best \nof luck in their game tonight.\n  The Princeton Tigers represent one of the finest universities in the \nworld and are not new to the NCAA tournament. However, this appearance \nis a special one for the Tigers as it represents the last for their \ngreat coach, Pete Carril. Coach Carril has decided to retire after 29 \nmagnificent years at Princeton and there is no doubt that Princeton and \nall of college basketball will sorely miss him. On behalf of his many \nfans in New Jersey, I wish him the best of luck in his future, and \nparticularly in Princeton's game tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/14/senate-section/article/S2137-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MODIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 2854\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
