Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Debbie Allen, a \ncongressional fellow in my office, be extended floor privileges during \nthe pendency of this action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill and report for fiscal year \n1996.\n  Mr. President, this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations \nCommittee on Wednesday. The bill recommended by the full Committee on \nAppropriations is for $11.159 billion. This is $461 million over the \nbudget request, $18 million under the House bill, and $2.424 billion \nover the level enacted last year. Compared to last year's enacted \nlevel, the budget proposed a $2 billion increase in the regular \nmilitary construction program.\n  Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within \nthe committee's 602(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and \noutlays.\n  Mr. President, it has not been easy putting this bill together. \nEarlier this year, the subcommittee received an allocation that \nprovided for a $461 million increase to the budget request. However, \n$161 million of this amount provides for a transfer from the Defense \nappropriation to the military construction appropriation for the \nPentagon renovation.\n  This account was put into the Defense bill in 1993 in the form of a \nrevolving fund. By putting it back into the military construction \nappropriation we will bring more visibility to the program. This \ntransfer means our allocation is really $180 million under the House.\n  The Committee on Appropriations in the House approved an \nappropriations bill that was $500 million over the budget request.\n  Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to mention. The bill \nfully funds the base closure and realignment accounts. This include \n$784 million for this year's round of base closures. This has been an \nextremely difficult year for many States with regard to the brac \nprocess. We made sure that there would be no impediments to moving \nforward with the decisions that the President has approved. Mr. \nPresident, this account makes up 35 percent of our appropriation.\n  However, I am extremely concerned with the growth of this program. \nThe base closure program cannot replace a regular military construction \nprogram. Our military bases that will remain open will have investment \nrequirements which must be met. But as the base closure program grows, \nit will continue to crowd out the regular military construction \nprogram.\n  In addition, the subcommittee is asking the General Accounting Office \nto help us evaluate the future requests for the base closure accounts. \nIf the Department is unable to get the cost of base closures under \ncontrol, it has a responsibility to reorient other priorities in the \nDefense budget so adequate funding is available to pay for the routine \nmilitary construction requirements of the active services and the Guard \nand Reserve.\n  We supported the Secretary's initiative to provide more housing to \nour military members. This is part of the $4.2 billion included in this \nbill for family housing.\n  We did not, however, support the Air Force's request to build new \nsenior and general officer quarters. We will not support building new \nhomes for generals\n when there are families of enlisted people on waiting lists for homes.\n\n  We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plague our Reserve \ncomponent; $263 million was added for the Reserve component. In each \ncase these funds are for quality of life or readiness.\n  Mr. President, the administration has available to it the same \ninformation the subcommittee has. The administration knows that the \nconstruction backlog of the Army Guard, the Air Guard, the Army \nReserve, the Navy Reserve, and the Air Force Reserve is billions of \ndollars and that backlog is growing, even as the force levels are being \nreduced.\n  So against this construction requirement, the administration budgeted \nonly $182 million for the entire Guard and Reserve component of the \nDepartment of Defense. We could not allow this to happen.\n  We have only reduced the administration request of $179 million for \nthe NATO Security Investment Program by 10 percent. We believe this is \na responsible reduction considering the requirements that may be put \nupon NATO in the near future.\n  Mr. President, before I close I want to thank the ranking minority \nmember for his participation and his contributions to the subcommittee \nthis year. I also want to thank Dick D'Amato of his staff as well and \nWarren Johnson and Jim Morhard on my staff. We would not have gotten \nhere without their tireless work.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor to my friend from \nNevada, the distinguished minority member.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I fully support the recommendations in this \nbill that is now before the Senate. I compliment the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for \nhis excellent work and that of his staff.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee and I have enjoyed an open and \nproductive working relationship in bringing the recommendations in this \nbill to the Senate.\n  As the chairman mentioned, this bill emphasizes quality of life, \nparticularly in family housing in barracks for single \n\n[[Page S10449]]\nsoldiers. It funds the Secretary of Defense's initiative to get the \nprivate sector into the military housing market and help relieve some \nof the tremendous backlog of needs for both new and renovated housing, \nwhich averages over 30 years of age throughout the services. We have \nhomes that people are living in that are over 50 years old in many \ninstallations throughout the United States.\n  My colleagues might wonder why this bill is the only subcommittee \nmark above the level of a fiscal year 1995 freeze. The reason is that \nthe very large amount was needed to fund the base closure and \nrealignment accounts, as the chairman has already indicated, almost $4 \nbillion, or more than a third of the entire amount recommended in the \nbill. In spite of this, we met our 602(b) allocation.\n  Without the need to fund the downsizing of the military through the \nBRAC process, the bill would be almost $2 billion below the freeze \nlevel. Otherwise, Mr. President, the bill is extremely frugal. Overseas \nconstruction has been reduced somewhat, as has NATO funding, which this \nMember believes should be the beginning of a down path to have the \nEuropean Community bear a more fair share of their burden in NATO.\n  I commend the chairman for taking the many requests from Senators to \ninclude projects in this bill. This is necessitated, in large part, \nbecause the Department of Defense has again, as it has in the past, \nrefused to adequately fund the construction projects for the National \nGuard and Reserve, requiring the subcommittee to review many worthy \nprojects suggested by Senators and the Guard and Reserves and to come \nup with a fair and equitable solution to the problem.\n  I add, Mr. President, in time of crisis, we rely heavily on the Guard \nand Reserve. During the gulf war crisis, we called upon the Guard and \nReserve to bear more than their share of the burden, especially based \non how we have funded them in the past. It simply would be unfair to \nnot give them some consideration simply because they have been ignored \nby the Pentagon.\n  The administration requested only $182 million for the Guard and \nReserve, compared to $574 million appropriated in fiscal year 1995. We \nare well below last year's level, recommending $452 million, which is a \n20-percent reduction. The subcommittee has used strict criteria for \nevaluating these projects suggested by Members, and a strong effort was \nmade to take all Members' interest into consideration.\n  While no Senator that I am aware of has been fully satisfied, I think \nthe result is as fair and equitable as possible, given the significant \nbudget constraints that we are working under.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a good product, and I hope that \nthe Senate will support it.\n  I thank at this time the staff director, Jim Morhard and his \nassistant, Warren Johnson, for their work and cooperation with my \nstaff, Dick D'Amato, a member of the Appropriations Committee assigned \nto me to work on this and other appropriations matters, and B.G. Wright \nalso of the Appropriations Committee, Peter Arapis of my personal staff \nand a congressional fellow who has been working with me for the past 6 \nmonths, Debbie Allen.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if the Senator could end her \nremarks about 25 till, because we have a Senator offering an amendment \nand we have limited time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized until 9:35.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10445-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10449-S10451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HEARINGS ON ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, because the Senate polices itself, there \nhas been much debate over the years about how the Senate should address \nallegations of misconduct. This debate has intensified in recent weeks \nbecause the Select Committee on Ethics has determined that allegations \nof wrongdoing made against a sitting Senator are supported by \nsubstantial, credible evidence.\n  With this determination, the case moved into a formal investigative \nphase. As of today, in what appears to be a break with well-established \ntraditions, no public hearings into this case have been scheduled. I \nhave written the Ethics Committee and informed them that if no public \nhearings were scheduled by the end of this week, I would seek a vote on \nthe matter by the full Senate. Mr. President, I have the legislation \nprepared and will seek to offer it next week. It is very \nstraightforward and it will require that the pending case be treated in \nthe same fashion as all other cases. I trust the Republican leadership \nwill allow me a vote on my amendment in this very important matter, \nbecause the Senate's reputation is at stake.\n  I will take some time today to explain why I believe that the Ethics \nCommittee should follow its longstanding practice and schedule public \nhearings in this case.\n  When an allegation of misconduct is received by the Select Committee \non Ethics, it conducts a preliminary inquiry, the first stage of its \nprocedures. If, at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, the \ncommittee determines that there is reason to believe improper conduct \nmay have occurred, the committee may conduct a more exhaustive review \ncalled an initial review.\n  To proceed beyond an initial review into the investigative phase, a \nrigorous test must be met. The committee must determine that there is \n``substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for \nthe committee to conclude that a violation'' within its jurisdiction \nhas occurred.\n If the committee finds that substantial credible evidence of \nwrongdoing exists, the case now enters the investigative phase. So, Mr. \nPresident, there is a preliminary inquiry, there is the initial review, \nand then there is the investigative stage.\n\n  This three-tiered process for evaluating allegations of impropriety \nwas established by this Senate in 1977. Since then, every case reaching \nthe investigative phase has included public hearings. Let me repeat \nthat, Mr. President. Since 1977, every single case reaching the \ninvestigative phase has included public hearings.\n  Mr. President, even before the formal procedures were established in \n1977, when the Ethics Committee was created, the Senate followed the \npractice of holding public hearings in cases of alleged misconduct of \nits Members. For example, in 1954, extensive hearings were held by a \nspecial committee investigating misconduct by Joseph McCarthy. And as \nlong as 65 years ago, in 1929, a special subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee held hearings to investigate alleged misconduct by Senator \nHiram Bingham, and the committee made the complete records public.\n  In other words--and I think this is important for Senators to \nunderstand--even before the three-tiered procedure was established, \ninvestigations into alleged impropriety included extensive hearings and \nfull public disclosure.\n  In 1978, shortly after the Ethics Committee was established, there \nwas alleged financial misconduct by a Member of the Senate. After \ncompleting a preliminary inquiry, the committee voted to conduct an \ninitial review, and then a full investigation. During that stage--the \nfirst in the history of the Senate--public hearings were held from \nApril 30 to July 12.\n  Following these hearings, the committee recommended that the Senator \nbe censured because his conduct tended to ``bring the Senate into \ndishonor and disrepute.'' In one day of debate on October 11, 1979, the \nSenate accepted the committee's recommendation.\n  The following year, the committee faced its most serious allegation \nof misconduct. In 1980, a Senator was indicted on nine criminal charges \nranging from bribery to fraud, stemming from the Abscam sting \noperation. The Ethics Committee deferred its investigation until the \ncriminal case was concluded. After the Senator was convicted, the \ncommittee authorized a formal investigation.\n  As has been its practice, the committee held public hearings into the \ncharges once it reached the investigative phase. The committee, then \nchaired by Senator Malcolm Wallop, found the Senator's conduct \n``ethically repugnant'' and recommended that the \n\n[[Page S10450]]\nSenator be expelled. Rather than face expulsion, the Senator resigned.\n  In 1989, a Senator was accused of financial misconduct related to a \nbook deal and his ownership and use of a condominium and was \ninvestigated by the Ethics Committee. The committee followed the same \nprocedure--a preliminary inquiry, initial review, and finally, a formal \ninvestigation.\n  In the investigative phase of that case, the Committee held public \nhearings on the allegations. One month after the hearings, the Ethics \nCommittee submitted to the Senate a resolution recommending censure for \n``reprehensible'' conduct ``in violation of statutes, rules, and Senate \nstandards.'' And the Senate upheld that decision.\n  I think it is important to note that after that investigation, some \nSenators were critical of the length of time it took to fully \ninvestigate ethics complaints--nearly 2 years in that case. Several \nSenators suggested streamlining the operations of the committee by \nreducing the number of investigative stages. But the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Howell Heflin, and the vice chairman, Senator Warren \nRudman, noted that the three-tiered procedure is designed for the \nprotection of the accused, because its first two stages are conducted \nin private, while the last stage is conducted in public. The Senate \nhistorian has summarized the arguments of the chairman and vice \nchairman as follows, and I think this is important for Senators to \nhear:\n\n       The multistage process was actually designed to protect the \n     individual being investigated. Under the committee's rules, \n     the two early portions of an inquiry were carried out in \n     closed session, and only the third stage--the formal \n     investigation and hearing--was conducted in public. In fact, \n     on a number of occasions . . . the confidentiality of the \n     procedure had protected Senators against whom unjust charges \n     had been brought.\n\n  So here we have the historian of the Senate making the case that in \nthe third stage of the investigation, it must and should go public.\n  It is clear that the Ethics Committee procedures were intended to \ninclude a public airing and disclosure of the cases, once the committee \nhas determined that the allegations were supported by substantial \ncredible evidence.\n  The most recent Ethics Committee complaint to reach the investigative \nstage involves a Senator accused of improper conduct related to the S \nindustry. In conducting its preliminary inquiry, the committee \nconducted extensive public hearings over a two-month period. That \nSenator was disciplined by a new form of reprimand, where the full \nSenate did not adopt a resolution of censure, but it was required to \nassemble on the Senate floor to hear a strongly worded committee \nreprimand.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple matter of fact: Since the Ethics \nCommittee adopted its current procedures in 1977, every case to reach \nthe investigative stage has included public hearings.\n  And furthermore, it is an indisputable matter of historical fact that \nin investigating allegations of improper conduct, the Senate has a \nwell-established practice and record of conducting hearings. This \npractice dates back to a time before the Ethics Committee was formed.\n  Now, why are public hearings important? Because they demonstrate to \nthe people--out in the sunlight--that we take seriously our \nconstitutionally mandated responsibility to discipline our own, to \ndiscipline our own for unethical conduct. Each time an allegation of \nmisconduct surfaces, the bonds of trust between the Congress and the \npeople are strained. But by facing these allegations head-on, by \nholding public hearings and supporting appropriate disciplinary \nactions, we begin to repair those bonds of trust. Covering up our \nproblems and attempting to hide them from the people only makes matters \nworse. And that is not the way we should function as a democracy.\n  Mr. President, I have taken the Senate's time today to discuss this \nissue because it now appears that the Ethics Committee is on the verge \nof abandoning its well-established procedure of conducting public \nhearings, in a case currently before it--a case that has reached the \ninvestigative stage. In my view, such a significant departure from \nestablished practice demands the attention of the full Senate and of \nthe American people.\n  For more than 2\\1/2\\ years, the Ethics Committee has been considering \nvery serious allegations against the junior Senator from Oregon. On May \n17 of this year, the committee completed its inquiry of the case and \nvoted unanimously to proceed to the final investigative stage. In \nadopting its resolution for investigation, the committee found \n``substantial credible evidence'' to support numerous allegations of \nsexual and official misconduct.\n  It is my view that the Ethics Committee should follow the normal \npractice of the Senate and hold public hearings on these allegations \npromptly. There is nothing about this case that warrants making an \nexception. I am very disappointed that a number of Senators have \nadvocated the opposite, and have indicated their desire to keep this \ninvestigation behind closed doors.\n  Mr. President, opponents of public hearings in this case have raised \nthree objections.\n  First, they say public hearings on this matter would bring the Senate \ninto disrepute. I argue that the opposite is true. As former Chief \nJustice Brandeis said, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of \ndisinfectants.'' By acknowledging problems and demonstrating a \nwillingness to discipline our own, we strengthen the Senate and the \nbonds with the people. We win confidence from the people by discharging \nour responsibilities frankly and openly--no matter how controversial \nthe issue. But we irrevocably lose the people's respect by sweeping our \nproblems under the committee room rug. The Senate is not a private \nclub; it is the people's Senate. We do not go in the back room, light \nup a cigar, and decide these cases.\n  Second, opponents of public hearings in this case say that the \nallegations are so explosive that hearings would degrade into a circus-\nlike atmosphere. I understand these concerns. However, I have \nconfidence that the committee can discharge its responsibilities with \ndignity.\n What is the message here? Is it that the more embarrassing the \ncharges, the more a Senator will be protected behind closed doors? That \nwould be a terrible message to send to the American people.\n\n  I ask another question: If all the other issues were dealt with in \npublic, is it a signal that if the issue were sexual misconduct you get \nthe safe haven of a private club? That would be a terrible message.\n  Third, some opponents of hearings in the open argue that these \nhearings would be unfair to those who make the complaints because they \ncould be subjected to uncomfortable questions and difficult cross-\nexamination. I am confident that the committee will treat all witnesses \nfairly. In fact, several of the complainants in this case traveled to \nWashington to ask the Senate to hold public hearings.\n  Moreover, the Ethics Committee can decide under current Senate rules \nto close any portion of a hearing if it decides it is necessary to \nprotect a witness. That is an important point. Under the rules of the \nSenate, the Ethics Committee may close any part of a hearing to protect \na witness.\n  If it is true that hearings in this case would be painful--and it \nprobably is--I must ask, is it the responsibility of a Senator merely \nto avoid painful issues? The Anita Hill hearings were painful, and what \ncame of it? A national debate about sexual harassment that led to \nincreased public awareness and better laws. Embarrassing? So were the \nWatergate hearings. Painful? So were the Waco hearings, where this week \na young girl went before a committee and millions of viewers and \ndescribed in detail the most despicable sexual abuse. The description \nwas so graphic, in fact, that the committee felt compelled to warn \ntelevision viewers in advance.\n  Hurtful? Think of Vince Foster's widow, who 2 years later has to turn \non the television and see that story before her again. Mr. President, \npersonal discomfort is, unfortunately, part of our job.\n  I hope I have explained why holding public hearings in this case is \nalso part of our job. There is no reason to make an exception in this \ncase and break with well-established procedures. That is what this \nissue is about.\n  I also feel obligated to discuss what this issue is not about. It is \nnot about any other Senator. It is not about partisan politics. It is \nnot about personalities. Perhaps the most shocking thing \n\n[[Page S10451]]\nto me in this process has been the private and public threats to a \nSenator who simply wants to continue the tradition of public hearings. \nI will not be deterred. I believe most Senators will support public \nhearings.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Ethics Committee again today, on this \nSenate floor, to call a meeting of their committee, which last week \nthey canceled, which this week they have not scheduled, to open this \nparticular case to the public. It is, without doubt, the right thing to \ndo.\n  However, if the committee refuses to do this, I will have no \nalternative, as I have said before, but to bring this issue to the \nSenate floor directly. My legislation is ready. It is straightforward. \nI will offer it at the earliest opportunity next week if we have no \naction.\n  In my view, a major procedural change overturning decades of well-\nestablished precedent must be debated by the full Senate. I think this \nis very, very serious. The charges are serious against the Senator, but \nequally important, is that the precedents of this U.S. Senate not be \ncast aside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10449-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10451-S10456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous-\nconsent request be amended to reflect that there be no second-degree \namendment in order, except a perfecting amendment that the Senator has \nto offer, and the hour time agreement would apply to all--to the \namendment and the perfecting amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Senator agree, if a vote is \nordered, to have a vote at the same time as the votes relating to the \nrescissions bill?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I advised the Republican manager earlier \nthat I am glad to do that, except that I think I would like to reserve \nthe right of each of the sponsors, Senators McCain and Senator Kerrey, \nto speak for a few moments about the bill.\n  If they have not had a chance to do that, I want to have that \nopportunity.\n  Mr. REID. That would be under the time that the Senator controls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1834\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce by $300,000,000 the amount appropriated by the \n                                 bill)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1834.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 127. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the total amount appropriated by this Act for military \n     construction and family housing is hereby reduced by \n     $300,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I asked that the amendment be read \nbecause I think it is very straightforward. Members should not have any \ndifficulty understanding what the amendment is. It is an amendment \noffered by myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Kerrey from Nebraska.\n  What it does is it proposes to strike $300 million from this bill and \nto bring the level of spending in this bill back to the level that the \nPresident requested. That request from the President, from the \nadministration, was not an insubstantial request. It was almost $2 \nbillion above last year's level. The budget request was for $10.698 \nbillion for military construction and family housing, which was an \nincrease of $1.963 billion over the 1995 appropriation.\n  The budget request included a major initiative on family housing, an \nincrease of $605 million above the 1995 level. It also included $1.2 \nbillion in additional funding to carry out the base closure and \nrealignment that has been ordered by current and past base closure \ncommissions.\n  So we are, in this amendment, not trying to interfere with a \nsubstantial increase in military construction funding over last year's \nlevel. The President felt that was appropriate. The administration felt \nit was appropriate. We are not, in this amendment, trying to attack \nthat. What we are saying, though, is that we need to have some limit on \nthe extent of the add-ons that we, in Congress, engage in, if, in fact, \nwe do have a concern about deficit reduction--and we clearly need to \nhave that concern.\n  The committee was able to find about $400 million to reduce in what \nthe President requested; another $57 million in rescissions from prior-\nyear appropriations. If the committee had stayed within the President's \nrequest, that would have given them an amount of $474 million to \nearmark for various items that are called to the attention of committee \nmembers of this body on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, $474 million did not appear to be enough for Member \nitems. The committee added an additional $300 million to cover those \nitems, and I believe this is a luxury that we cannot defend to the \nAmerican people at a time when deficit reduction is paramount in the \nNation's political agenda, and deserves to be paramount in the agenda \nof the Nation when our debt is ballooning to almost $5 trillion.\n  The committee will argue that the projects that they have added, the \n$747 million in all that they have added, meet the criteria which the \nSenator from Arizona, my cosponsor on this amendment, has been in the \nforefront of establishing. That is, all of these projects are in the \nPentagon's 5-year plan and they have merely moved up the execution of \nthe projects for this next fiscal year. They will argue that the \nNational Guard has come to rely on these add-ons because the Pentagon \nalways leaves out things which are necessary for the National Guard.\n  These arguments do have some merit, and I think they can be used to \njustify the most important $474 million of add-ons. But in my view, the \narguments cannot justify the marginal $300 million that has been added \nto that. Unlike the cuts which we will make in future appropriations \nbills which come before the Senate in areas such as education and \nresearch and health, the projects which are ultimately cut if our \namendment is approved will be in future defense requests, some next \nyear, some as late as the year 2001. Essentially, these are projects \nwhich the administration said are meritorious, but we cannot afford \nthem this year. What I am saying by this amendment, and what my \ncosponsors are saying, is we agree with that. We cannot afford the \nadditional $300 million this year.\n  I say to my Democratic colleagues who will bemoan cuts in various \ndomestic discretionary programs--and I will agree with them that some \nof those cuts are inappropriate--but how can we in the Congress justify \nadding funds for marginal projects in this bill while we are making \nthose cuts in domestic discretionary programs? And I \n\n[[Page S10452]]\nwould say to my Republican colleagues, many of whom, like the Senator \nfrom Arizona, feel the investment in defense is inadequate, is this the \nplace where additional funding should be spent if we have additional \nfunding to spend in defense?\n  I do not believe the American people want us to conduct business as \nusual. It is always striking to me that when the Defense authorization \nbill passes, and we generally make significant policy decisions in that \nDefense authorization bill, unfortunately, in our hometowns and in our \nhome States the headlines in the local papers are about the military \nconstruction projects that are funded in the Defense bill. So I \nunderstand there is a local imperative that drives the funding of these \nmilitary construction projects.\n  I do believe we need to at least hold the level of increase to the \nvery substantial level that the administration has asked for and not \nadd to it in this bill. The way we propose this legislation, it would \nbe up to the Appropriations Committee to make a decision as to where \nthe priority is and where it wants to spend that $474 billion of add-\nons. I have no argument with them on that. That is the nature of our \ncommittee structure, and I think they can make that decision.\n  If we do not stop business as usual in this bill, then where are we \ngoing to? Mr. President, $474 million in add-ons is enough. I, for one, \ndo not support going with an additional $300 million above and beyond \nthat. I hope a majority of the Senate will agree, after all of the \nspeeches have been made on deficit reduction, that the message sent by \nadding $774 million in add-ons is inappropriate, and the American \npeople would not support it.\n  Let me conclude by just reading a short statement from the \nadministration on this. The administration says in this statement of \nadministration policy:\n\n       The Administration is committed to balancing the Federal \n     budget by the [fiscal year] 2005. The President's budget \n     proposes to reduce discretionary spending for [fiscal year] \n     1996 by $5 billion in outlays below the FY 1995 level. The \n     Administration does not support the level of funding assumed \n     by the House or Senate Committee 602(b) allocations.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to $648 million in \n     funding for approximately 100 unrequested military and family \n     housing construction projects. With the Nation facing serious \n     budget constraints, such a spending increase is not \n     affordable.\n\n  Mr. President, let me also point out there is an item in here that I \nthink people just need to be aware of. That is, this subcommittee of \nAppropriations has been given the job of funding, as I understand it, \nthe renovation of the Pentagon. There is $161 million in this bill for \nrenovation of the Pentagon. I support that funding. Frankly, when I saw \nthe figure, I was a little bit taken aback and thought maybe this is a \nbit excessive. I know that is a big building, but $161 million is a lot \nof renovation. Then I noticed in the bill, on page 20 of the bill, a \nprovision which really did, I think, cause me to think we should focus \non this. It says, ``None of the funds appropriated in this act may be \ntransferred to or obligated from the Pentagon reservation facility \nrenovation unless the Secretary certifies that the total cost for \nplanning, design, construction, installation of equipment for the \nrenovation of the Pentagon will not exceed $1.2 billion.''\n  Mr. President, I thought the $161 million was a little excessive. Now \nI understand the $161 million is next year's installment on renovation \nof the Pentagon. It is $1.2 billion which this committee is saying is \nthe total that they are going to agree to provide.\n  So I make this point for my colleagues, just to make the point we are \nnot being stingy with the military. This is not a case of the military \nbeing totally left unfunded. They are getting nearly a 20-percent \nincrease from last year's funding in military construction. We are \nagreeing here to go up to $1.2 billion to renovate the Pentagon. In our \namendment, we are not in any way interfering with the addition of $474 \nmillion of Member interest items. We are just saying, let us draw the \nline someplace, and that someplace ought to be at the level that the \nadministration requested. That means we ought to strike $300 million of \nthose add-ons as part of this bill.\n  So that is a brief explanation. My colleagues from Arizona and Nevada \nwish to speak on this. I, therefore, reserve the remainder of my time, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New Mexico raises \na couple of good points. If you look to see what we have done in the \npast, we have been very negligent in providing housing, especially for \nour enlisted personnel in the military. When we changed the philosophy \non how we were to maintain our military forces, when we went to an all-\nmilitary Army, Navy, and Marine force, we made a covenant with those \npeople that if they are volunteering and they make this a career, we \nare going to provide some kind of quality of life. I think this is the \nfirst time that we have made an investment this large in the \ninfrastructure for the quality of life for our enlisted people.\n  I was shocked when visiting some of the bases that we actually have \npeople who are living off base, who have to go to lease a house, or \nrent a house, or even purchase a house. This has caused them to qualify \nfor food stamps. I do not think this is very good when we ask those \npeople to stand in harm's way for this country and to represent us in \nsome areas where maybe some of us would refuse to go.\n  I am very much aware that for the first time we have changed the \nthrust of military construction.\n  Then let us look at another end of it. In the base closing and the \nrealignment, we are trying to move some of the facilities that we have \nclosed into private hands, to dispose of that property. But due to some \nenvironmental laws, like third-party liability, those properties are \nnot worth anything until we clean those properties up. And that is \nwhere the big expense is coming in with base realignment. We have \nchosen to close military facilities to save money. We are having to \nshift some funds over into BRAC in order to close those facilities and \nmake them available to either private sales or to be used for some \nother part of Government operations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from Montana if \nhe would yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I want to be sure there was understanding between us. \nOur amendment does not cut any of the funds that are being appropriated \nto carry out the BRAC recommendations, either the previous BRAC \nrecommendations or these BRAC recommendations. They are strictly add-\nons in other areas and not in BRAC.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would respond to the Senator and say this: Because we \nhad to use up so much money in that, we had to have money for the Guard \nand Reserves. The President's request had very little for the support \nof our Guard and Reserves and facilities around the country outside of \nthe normal activity of our military because so much of the original \nrequest is taken up by base closure and realignment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask one additional question of my \ncolleague. He understands also that our amendment does not interfere \nwith the appropriation of $474 million in add-ons which would totally \nsatisfy the Guard money or Reserve money add-ons, as I understand it. \nWhat we are saying is that above and beyond, if the Appropriations \nCommittee chose to give that a priority, there would be funding to do \nall the Guard and Reserves. It is just a question of whether or not we \nare going to add $300 million more to that.\n  So I want to be sure that was clear, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from New Mexico, \nbut the shift of trying to direct our dollars into quality of life \ncaused some of that in some areas.\n  So with that, I really believe that there is as much fairness and \nthrust in this bill as we could possibly have and still complete the \nmission of military construction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona. \n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Burns and Senator \nReid for a very fine piece of legislation. I would like to talk about \nsome of the details of it. But the issue before us is the Bingaman \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I support the Bingaman amendment. I want to just point \nout one simple fact. If you asked the military leadership in this \ncountry what their priorities are, ``If you had $300 million, what \nwould you do with that money,'' I promise you, Mr. President, that \nmilitary construction would be somewhere around seventh or eighth on \ntheir priority list. And the fact is that we add money for military \nconstruction because it helps us as Members of the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, if I had $300 million in addition, I would take it and \nmodernize the force, I would provide more steaming hours and flying \nhours, and I would try to reduce the backlog of depot maintenance, \nwhich in some cases is 3 or 4 years. There are myriad uses that I could \nfind for this money before military construction, and the military \nleadership in this country will tell you the same thing. If they had \nrequested $300 million in addition, it is nowhere to be found.\n  So, Mr. President, the point is that it is not that these are not \ngood and worthwhile projects that the committee has earmarked for. In \nfact, they meet the criteria. And I want to congratulate Senator Burns \nand Senator Reid for adhering to the criteria that we have laid down in \nthe authorizing committee and now has been adopted by the appropriating \ncommittee. It is not that they are not good projects. It is all a \nmatter of priority as to where we spend the taxpayer dollars.\n  The Bingaman amendment, in my view, Mr. President, has nothing to do \nwith the quality of the projects for which these moneys are being \nspent. It all has to do with the priorities of where we spend taxpayer \ndollars that are earmarked for defense.\n  This bill is $300 million more than that requested by the President \nof the United States and requested by the Pentagon.\n  Mr. President, the issue is very much more complicated than that. I \nwant to say again that Senator Burns, Senator Reid, and the \nsubcommittee have come up with a good bill. They made progress over the \nlast year, and begin to limit add-ons of unrequested military \nconstruction projects.\n  Last year, the Congress added over $1 billion for specific \nunrequested military construction projects. This bill, although I \nbelieve it is too high in total, adds only about half of that amount.\n  I am particularly pleased that the committee apparently, as I \nmentioned, adhered to the stringent criteria adopted in last year's \nDefense authorization bill. And there are many laudable provisions in \nthe bill, including approval of the new family housing initiative; \nincreased emphasis on environmental restoration funding for the BRAC \naccounts; no funding for the requested Army museum; they deleted land \ntransfer language which was contained in the House bill; authorization \nfor the Services to use barracks construction funding for renovation, \nif that would be a less costly alternative; and a specific requirement \nthat all projects must be specifically authorized, since the bill \ncontains projects which are not in the Senate version of the \nauthorization bill.\n  Finally, I am particularly pleased that the Appropriations Committee \nchose to give more visibility to the ongoing efforts to renovate the \nPentagon complex.\n  There are two areas where I am very disappointed in the \nrecommendations of the Appropriations Committee. First, the $300 \nmillion add-on--and, as I repeat, I have not heard from one of the \nmilitary service chiefs that military construction is their highest \npriority. And it is about time, I say to my colleagues, that we listen \nto the military as to their priority rather than our own.\n  Mr. President, at the full committee markup, an amendment was offered \nto add another $250 million in unrequested projects to the military \nconstruction budget above the request and above the subcommittee's \nmark. I argued against the amendment at the time because I believed \nthat these additional funds would be better used for higher priority \nrequirements of our military service chiefs or to meet the must-pay \nbills for ongoing contingency operations. Secretary Perry requested $1 \nbillion in order to pay for ongoing contingencies which will not be \ncanceled in the upcoming year. We authorized $125 million, not the $1 \nbillion. That is one area where these additional add-ons could have \ngone.\n  Ultimately, the Armed Services Committee chose to authorize half that \namount, an additional $125 million of the total of $7 billion added to \nthe budget request for military construction above the total amount \nrequested in these accounts. While all of these additional projects \nalso met the established criteria, I continue to believe unrequested \nmilitary construction projects should not be funded while validated \nmilitary requirements go unfunded.\n  I will work very hard during floor consideration and conference with \nthe House National Security Committee to limit the total amount of add-\nons to not more than the level recommended by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. Therefore, I urge the appropriators to make those reductions \nin the bill today in the form of the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. President, the bill language directs the Department of Defense to \ninclude funding in 1997 budget requests for three specific projects:\n  A new national range control center at White Sands missile range in \nNew Mexico; a child development and galley facility at Fallon Naval Air \nStation in Nevada; and a new construction project at Fort Lawton, WA.\n  Mr. President, we do not need to do those kinds of things. Let us let \nthe Pentagon make the recommendations themselves.\n  Mr. President, during this first year using the evaluation criteria \nfor Member add-ons which was adopted last year, I have discovered an \noversight which I hope to correct for next year's budget review. I \nintend to add to the established criteria a requirement that requests \nfor add-ons be screened for priority against the relevant service's \nunfunded military construction priorities.\n  For this year's bills, I have asked my staff to work with the \nmilitary services to verify that each of the unrequested military \nconstruction projects added by Congress are the next highest priority \nprojects for the services. I also believe it would be useful for the \nDepartment of Defense to do their part and temporarily withhold \nobligation of funds for unrequested military construction projects \nwhich are determined to be low priority. I am preparing a letter to the \nSecretary of Defense suggesting that he request congressional approval \nto transfer any funds appropriated for low-priority projects to higher \npriority military construction projects.\n  Mr. President, the good news is that the total amount of military \nconstruction add-ons this year will be significantly less than the $1 \nbillion added last year. In just 1 year that is significant progress. \nThe bad news is that when additional funds are available for defense, \nit is difficult to argue successfully that none of these additional \nfunds should be spent for military construction projects. But even with \nthe additional defense funding, must-pay bills and high-priority \nmilitary requirements go unfunded. We still have a long way to go in \nthe fight to eliminate unnecessary spending from the military \nconstruction bill.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Burns for a good bill and the fine \nwork that he and his staff and Senator Reid and his staff have done. We \ndo not need the $300 million in addition.\n  If the Bingaman amendment fails, then, Mr. President, I will be \ncompelled to vote against the bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Arizona has 1 \nminute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time to \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  \n[[Page S10454]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina [Mr. Thurmond].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Burns and \nSenator Reid for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. \nThey have done a good job.\n  In large part this military construction appropriations bill mirrors \nthe construction priorities and criteria for projects established by \nthe Armed Services Committee. I am particularly pleased by the emphasis \nplaced on projects that will enhance the quality of life of the men and \nwomen in our military and on projects which will enhance the readiness \nof our Armed Forces. The bill also fully funds the base closure account \nrequest and provides the necessary funds to support environmental \ncompliance projects. Both are areas which have historically been used \nas sources of funds for other projects.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a sound bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Because I believe this is a good bill, I oppose the Bingaman-McCain \namendment.\n  There should no longer be any doubt that the administration's \nproposed defense budget is underfunded. Although Secretary Perry \nincreased funding for quality of life construction projects over the \nnext 6 years by $2.7 billion, there are very serious shortfalls in the \nDepartment's military construction programs. Let me identify just a few \nof the most startling:\n  According to the Congressional Research Service the current backlog \nof deferred maintenance and repair for family housing alone totals over \n$2 billion; Air Force Housing units do not measure up to contemporary \nstandards; 75 percent of the Army's family housing does not adequately \nmeet Department of Defense Standards; 80 to 85 percent of the Army \nbarracks do not meet current Department of Defense Standards; the \nNavy's current funding requirement for revitalization of family housing \nis $1.7 billion; and, at current funding levels it would take over 40 \nyears to eliminate the space and revitalization backlog for Navy and \nMarine Corps housing.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these startling figures, there are \nrequirements for new mission facilities that are not being addressed in \nthe administration's budget request. There are both active and reserve \nunits which have been assigned new missions or new equipment but have \nnot been provided the facilities to accomplish their new missions or \nsupport that equipment. This military construction appropriations bill \nprovides for some of those shortfalls.\n  Because there are always allegations that some of the projects in the \nbill may be wasteful, I had my staff review each project. They reported \nthat to the best of their knowledge each project that is in this bill \nbut not in the Armed Service Committee's bill meets the same rigorous \ncriteria that Senator McCain and Senator Glenn, the chairman and \nranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, impose on projects \nincluded in the Armed Services Committee's bill.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues may not appreciate the \nadditional funding and construction projects included in this bill. \nHowever, I am confident that the men and women of our armed services \nand their families who will benefit from these projects will be most \nappreciative.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the bill and vote against the \nBingaman-McCain amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri [Mr. Bond].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers of the bill for \ngiving me this opportunity.\n  I rise as a Senator from Missouri and, as important, as cochairman of \nthe National Guard Caucus to register strong objections to this \namendment. I appreciate very much the thoughtful comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I think his \nreport on the review done by his staff on these projects should allay \nany fears that any of our colleagues may have about the projects in \nthis bill.\n  As has already been noted, the Senate this year was again forced by \nthe administration to make sure that defense infrastructure would be \nadequately funded. Active force infrastructure has traditionally been \nadequately funded, or at least better funded, whereas the National \nGuard forces traditionally have been underfunded. Why has it been this \nway, many have asked? The answer which is whispered through the halls \nof this building is that the Department of Defense relies on \nCongressmen and Senators to take care of the Guard. It is no accident \nthat most of the people in the Pentagon are active military, and they \nrealize that if they take care of their needs, they hope those of us \nwho live in the real world will take care of our citizen soldiers. We \nhave done so before. We are trying to do so now and we will in the \nfuture, because most of us--I think a significant majority of this \nbody--care about the welfare and the readiness of the National Guard \nand the Air National Guard even if there are some who do not.\n  Now, this year the administration proposal funded the Army Guard \ninfrastructure to the tune of $18 million--$18 million for the entire \nArmy Guard infrastructure for all 50 States and Puerto Rico;\n $18 million for the entire Army Guard as against $473 million for the \nArmy, which in and of itself was shortchanged by some $38 million by \nthe administration.\n\n  If the Senators respect our citizen soldiers and the vitally \nimportant missions that they provide in our States, as well as in \nsupport of our national defense mission, then they must rectify this \nshoddy treatment of those who protect us.\n  My colleague from Montana, the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and his ranking member, the Senator from Nevada, have \ndone just that. They have done it with strict adherence to the rigorous \nset of standards for the necessary quality of life and readiness \nprojects included in the mark of the bill that came out of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The Air National Guard received $85 million, approximately half of \nthe funding required for much-needed projects.\n  Let me state that in my State of Missouri, for instance, we had \nsought money, and this bill provides money, to improve sewer systems in \norder to ensure that our disaster relief headquarters, located at an \nAir National Guard facility, can be utilized during flood disasters. Do \nthe sponsors of the amendment want to deny the citizens of Missouri \nadequate protection?\n  I found with great interest, as I looked on page 45 of this bill, \nthat the State of New Mexico has this same kind of project. It happens \nto be that the storm drainage system and other storm drainage system \nprovisions, two different provisions for New Mexico, are included \nbecause they happen to be at active bases.\n  I do not believe that our needs for disaster relief protection and \nservices are any less because they happen to be at an Air National \nGuard facility rather than an active base.\n  The distinguished chairman of this committee considered each of the \nprograms added to this military construction bill for the practicality \nof it being executed in fiscal year 1996, assured it was the highest \npriority for the base commanders and the National Guard tags, site \navailability, its inclusion in the FYDP and its overall quality of life \nand readiness importance. These are critically important projects, and \nI am very pleased that the managers of the bill decided to include \nthese measures in this appropriations measure.\n  If any of my colleagues are thinking about voting for this amendment, \nlet me assure you, it is to turn your back on our National Guard \npersonnel. Currently, this is the only place we have to maintain the \ninfrastructure readiness and the quality of life necessary to make sure \nour National Guard can function in its civil and national defense \nmission. We are trying to get the administration to acknowledge the \nGuard's requirements, but let us not hamstring our Guard for the \nadministration's shortsightedness. \n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the managers of the bill and to \ndefeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to \nreduce funding in the military construction appropriation bill by $300 \nmillion.\n  The committee used stringent criteria for producing this bill. As I \nunderstand them, projects were selected if they met one of the \nfollowing minimum criteria.\n  The project is included in the Defense Department's future year's \ndefense plan; the project can be executed in fiscal year 1996; the \nproject is authorized in fiscal year 1996; or the project is the \nhighest priority for the base.\n  Mr. President, I think these criteria are reasonable and I believe \nthe subcommittee has done an excellent job in producing this bill.\n  The 1996 budget resolution provided an additional $7 billion in \nbudget authority and $2 billion in outlays above what the President \nrequested.\n  These additional funds can only be used for defense activities.\n  Certainly some of these funds should be used to adequately fund \nmilitary construction and family housing projects which are key to \nreadiness and quality of life for military personnel--and this is \nexactly what the Appropriations Committee did.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time at \n10:20 be extended for 5 minutes; that the proponents of the bill have 5 \nminutes and those opposing the bill have 5 minutes and that will close \ndebate. We will yield back the rest of that time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the \nBingaman amendment No. 1834 immediately following the stacked votes \nrelating to the rescissions bill, which will begin at approximately 11 \na.m. this morning.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Reserving the right to object, I just want to be sure I \nwill get the opportunity to sum up and make the case for my amendment \nlast.\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the last two statements have told it \nall. I do not think anyone would consider the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the senior Senator from South Carolina, a big \nspender. I do not know of anyone in the history of the U.S. Senate that \nhas had more of a reputation for watching where the pennies go than the \nSenator from South Carolina, and he has stated that this amendment \nshould be resoundingly defeated.\n  We also have heard from the chairman of the National Guard Caucus \nand, in effect, he has also said that the Pentagon tends to protect its \nown and they do not really consider their own the National Guard and \nthe Reserve component of the military. They would rather use the money \non their own and, therefore, traditionally what they do is nothing \nregarding the Guard and Reserve. We for many years have had to be the \nspokesperson for the Guard and Reserve. That is not the way it should \nbe, but that is the way it is. The Guard and Reserve deserve more than \nwhat this administration and what the Pentagon has given them in this \nbudget and budgets gone by.\n  Mr. President, this add-on, as we call it, is not for anything that \nis lavish. What we are saying is that we believe that family housing is \nimportant. Family housing is important. We have people living in homes \nwith their families, homes over 50 years old, built during the Second \nWorld War and built to last during that war. The war is long since gone \nand people are still living in those homes.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee has announced, there are \nfacilities in the United States where people cannot live on base. They \nare living off base. Because it costs so much money, they have to draw \nfood stamps, even though they are part of the U.S. military. That is \nwrong.\n  We also are concerned in this bill about single soldier barracks. We \nthink they deserve more. Facilities were constructed very rapidly \nduring the Second World War and were to last through the war, and now \n50 years later, soldiers are living in the same places. They deserve \nmore.\n  We have been very frugal as it relates to officers housing. There \nwere numerous requests for housing for general officers that we did not \nhonor. We went and looked at family housing and single soldier \nbarracks.\n  These add-ons are not a budget buster. All Members should understand, \nwe are not busting any budget. We are totally within our 602(b) \nallocation, but we felt our Guard and Reserve deserve more than what \nthey were given by the Pentagon and by this administration.\n  The committee evaluates rather than the Pentagon. It is as simple as \nthat. That is not the way it should be, but, Mr. President, that is the \nway it is. The budget requested by the Department of Defense has, once \nagain, in past years neglected to address the military construction \nneeds of the National Guard, both Army and Air.\n  I say to the senior Senator from Arizona, there are lots of other \nplaces these moneys could be spent, but this is a Military Construction \nSubcommittee budget and that is where we are obligated to spend the \nmoney, not on giving the Navy more days to practice their specialities \nin the water, doing all the things that the Senator from Arizona \nindicated should be done. We recognize there is a lot more need in the \nmilitary, but in the Military Construction Subcommittee, we have put \nthe money where it should best be spent. I have not heard anyone say \nthese projects are not worthwhile. They are needed.\n  The administration requested only $182 million for the Guard and \nReserve, compared--listen to this--to $574 million appropriated last \nyear. This year's recommendation is 20 percent less than last year, \n$452 million.\n  Also included in this bill, as I have indicated and as has been \nspoken by the Senator from New Mexico, is a $161 million appropriation \nto begin renovation of the Pentagon.\n That, too, was put up earlier as part of the history of this country. \nIt is badly in need of repair, and we are beginning that. That is also \na burden on this budget.\n\n  This bill, I again indicate and emphasize, is a long-overlooked \nquality-of-life initiative, particularly in family housing and \nbarracks. These initiatives make up nearly one-third of the total \nmilitary construction markup.\n  We should be given some credit for that, Mr. President. These are not \nprograms that are wasteful. The chairman of the full committee, the \nArmed Services Committee, has come here and said this is important. We \nmust do a better job for the people that are defending our country. \nDuring times of crisis, the Guard and Reserve are called upon, and in \nthe future, with the cutbacks we have had, they will be called upon \neven more. We must recognize that it is necessary to fund this bill as \noutlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that the manager's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, am I correct that there is an additional \n5 minutes reserved for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make the obvious point here that \nthis is not a question of whether people support the military, or the \nNational Guard, or family housing, or money for base realignment and \nclosure. The President, in the budget sent to this Congress, asked for \nan increase of just about 20 percent in military construction from last \nyear for military construction and family housing both.\n  There is a request for $605 million--an additional $605 million--for \nfamily housing, above what we had last year. There is over $1.2 billion \nin additional funding to carry out base realignment and closure.\n  The amendment that I am offering in no way interferes with any of \nthat \n\n[[Page S10456]]\nfunding. The amendment that I am offering says that, in addition to \nwhat the President requested, the subcommittee can add $474 million of \nadd-ons. But they should not be able to go above that. It should not be \n$774 million of add-ons. That is all I am saying. Let us keep the \namount spent in this area within the confines of what the \nadministration requested.\n  Mr. President, we have two standards in this Senate and in this \nCongress. It is one standard when it is military spending and a totally \ndifferent standard when it is domestic spending. You are seeing a very \ngood example of it in the arguments being made around here right now.\n  Deficit reduction was a big issue in this Senate last month. I \nremember lots of speeches last month, the month before that, and the \nmonth before that, about how we have to make tough decisions. The time \nhas come, and business as usual cannot continue. The American people \nwant some change; they do not want excessive spending in these areas. \nWell, that is what this amendment is about.\n  All this talk about the National Guard--all of the requests for the \nNational Guard that are being funded could be funded in the $474 \nmillion of add-ons that we are not in any way interfering with. The \nfamily housing--the $605 million there--we are not interfering with \nthat. The simple fact is, Mr. President, the additional $300 million \nthat is in this bill, which I am now proposing we strike, is not a \npriority for the military; it is not a priority for the country.\n  The Senate needs to go on record about whether we are serious about \ndeficit reduction. We are very good at giving speeches, going home and \nsaying, boy, we are really doing the right thing, and we are making the \ntough decisions. This is not that tough a decision, Mr. President. This \nis $300 million that the military says is not a priority. There is no \nreason why we need to be going ahead and spending it. That is the \nsimple issue.\n  I believe the taxpayers of this country would support our amendment \nto delete this $300 million and have it available for a higher \npriority--military use, or have it able for some domestic use, which \nwould be a higher priority--or apply it to deficit reduction, which is \nwhat the amendment calls for. It essentially says let us not spend that \n$300 million which is not a priority.\n  So that is the amendment. I hope very much the Senate will support \nit. I think the people send us here to Congress to make tough decisions \nabout what our priorities are. If deficit reduction is a priority, \npeople ought to vote for this amendment.\n  I appreciate the chance to explain the amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, one-third of this BRAC is living \nconditions, and the rest of it is for readiness. We must never forget \nabout that. By a previous order, this vote will come in the stack with \nthe rescissions votes.\n  I move that this amendment be tabled, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how many \nvotes are being stacked?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from West \nVirginia that according to this agreement, there would be four.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would there be an explanation of the vote just prior to \ntaking that vote?\n  Mr. BURNS. I say to my friend from West Virginia, that has not been \nestablished. But I have no problem with that. Do we need a minute on \neach side?\n  Mr. BYRD. Four minutes equally divided, how about that?\n  Mr. BURNS. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10451-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10456-S10468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL DISASTER \n   ASSISTANCE, FOR ANTI-TERRORISM INITIATIVES, FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE \n     RECOVERY FROM THE TRAGEDY THAT OCCURRED AT OKLAHOMA CITY, AND \n                         RESCISSIONS ACT, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 1944, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1944) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for additional disaster assistance, for anti-\n     terrorism initiatives, for assistance in the recovery from \n     the tragedy that occurred at Oklahoma City, and making \n     rescissions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1995, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Wellstone/Moseley-Braun Amendment No. 1833, to strike \n     certain rescissions, and to provide an offset.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to take this \noccasion to thank Senators Wellstone and Moseley-Braun, the minority \nleader, the majority leader, the White House, and all the participants \nwho have sought to resolve this issue and bring this to a vote on the \nrescissions package. I also thank Senator Byrd, as our ranking member \nof this subcommittee, for giving leadership in every instance of this \ncommittee's activity. And I especially want to thank Senator Byrd for \nhis participation, as well.\n  Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment adds back $651 million into \nthe rescissions package, or reduces rescissions by that figure; $332 \nmillion for 8 education and job training programs; and $319 million for \nthe Low-Income Energy Assistance Program.\n  These add-backs are over and above the levels for these programs \nnegotiated with the President of the United States, the White House, \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate, as well, and this includes \nthe Democratic leadership of both the House and Senate.\n  In the case of youth training, education technology, and the \nEisenhower Professional Development Programs, the add-backs in the \nWellstone amendment exceed the levels agreed to in the so-called Dole-\nDaschle compromise. That was back when the rescissions package was \nbeing acted upon by the Senate. And the Dole-Daschle compromise became \nour point of reference, our guidelines in the conference with the House \nof Representatives. That was the original rescissions package.\n  Let me emphasize again that in those areas, the Wellstone amendment \nexceeds those levels that this Senate passed. The provisions of H.R. \n1944 are the product of extensive negotiations over several months.\n  To add back funding for these programs at this time jeopardizes the \nenactment of this bill. I say that because of the fact that if we \nchange this bill, it goes back to the House of Representatives again \nfor an action, and if the House of Representatives refuses to adopt any \nchanges that we have made in this rescissions package at this time, \nthey can demand a conference, and we would be back into that process of \na conference. Notwithstanding that, we would be thrown back in the \nsituation of negotiating again with the White House, who vetoed the \nfirst bill.\n  To add back funding for these programs at this particular time \njeopardizes the enactment of this bill, which is an emergency \nsupplement to assist in providing for disaster assistance, for \nantiterrorism initiatives, for assistance in the recovery of the \ntragedy that occurred in Oklahoma City, and for making rescissions.\n  Additionally, the Wellstone amendment jeopardizes funding for fiscal \nyear 1996 for the very programs he seeks to protect. Without enactment \nof H.R. 1944, the Labor-HHS and Education subcommittee alone will be \nforced to absorb an additional $3 billion in budget authority and $1.3 \nbillion in outlays within its already reduced allocations for 1996, \nbecause of the reduced budget resolution.\n  The committee already has a tough job ahead. Adoption of the \nWellstone amendment would make that job even more difficult by putting \noff until another day on reducing the growth of Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes did I use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager has 5 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  \n[[Page S10457]]\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Hatfield is one of the finest \nchairmen that I have had the pleasure to work with and to observe \nduring my 37--going on 37--years in the Senate. He has a bright \nintellect. He has an understanding manner. He is gracious always. He is \na gentleman. He speaks with conviction. He is one of my real profiles \nin courage that I have seen during all these years. It is a pleasure to \nwork with the Senator. I admire the Senator. I respect him, and hold \nfor him the highest, very highest, personal esteem.\n  Mr. President, as Senators may recall, many months ago the Senate and \nHouse initiated an appropriations bill for urgently needed FEMA funds \nand that measure, H.R. 1158, contained rescissions which were more than \nsufficient to cover the FEMA supplemental request as well as \nadditional, smaller supplemental items that were contained in that \nmeasure.\n  After House and Senate passage, a conference agreement on H.R. 1158 \nwas reached and, after passing the House, was taken up by the Senate on \nMay 25 and was adopted by a vote of 61-38. At the time, there were a \nnumber of Members on this side of the aisle who felt that the \nconference agreement should be defeated because it did not contain a \nnumber of the items that were included in the Senate bill, pursuant to \nthe Dole-Daschle amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I urged the President to sign the conference agreement \non H.R. 1158 because it contained the appropriations for FEMA disaster \nassistance of $6.7 billion. It also made a very sizable reduction in \nthe deficit. We were told that by the end of May, or shortly \nthereafter, FEMA would no longer be able to obligate funds to finance \nrelief efforts associated with the Northridge earthquake and with other \ndeclared disasters throughout the Nation resulting from floods and \nstorms in 40 States.\n  Nevertheless, the President chose to veto H.R. 1158 and he set forth \nhis reasons for doing so in correspondence to the Congress which \naccompanied his veto message.\n  Following that veto, the House and Senate leadership reached an \nagreement with the President on a package of changes to H.R. 1158. \nThose changes were incorporated into a new bill, H.R. 1944, which \npassed the House of Representatives some weeks ago. Senators may recall \nthat during an attempt to pass H.R. 1944 prior to the Fourth of July \nrecess, Senators Wellstone and Moseley-Braun exercised their right to \ninsist that the bill not be passed under a unanimous-consent agreement \nand that they be allowed to offer amendments to the measure.\n  Negotiations with the leadership have been ongoing since the recess \nin order to find a way to accommodate Senators Wellstone and Moseley-\nBraun and to also ensure that the Senate finally pass this very \nimportant appropriation and rescissions bill and get it to the \nPresident for his signature so that its provisions can take effect. As \na result of those negotiations, an amendment is pending which was \nproposed by Senators Wellstone and Moseley-Braun.\n  Mr. President, I fully understand the importance which Senators \nWellstone and Moseley-Braun place on the program for which they are \nproposing addbacks. I also have no qualms with their proposed offsets \nfor those addbacks--namely DOD administrative and travel expenses.\n  Mr. President, I compliment both the distinguished Senators. I admire \nthem for their pluck, their courage and for their convictions. I wish \nthat more Senators could demonstrate the same kind of courage and \nconvictions and pluck. It takes courage. It takes courage to stand up \nin the face of criticism that was directed against them. I have no \ncriticism of them.\n  I do have, as I say, a tremendous admiration for both Senators, \nfighting for what they believe in. Who can quarrel with that? After \nall, this is the Senate, the forum of the States, in which Senators can \nstand on their feet and speak as long as they wish to speak. I shall \nalways defend their rights to do that. So I fully understand the \nimportance of these programs. I share their views.\n  I will not, however, vote for the amendment because if either part of \nthe amendment is adopted, that would cause the bill to go back to the \nHouse for further consideration. I do not know what the House would do \nat that point. I do know that further delay would be inevitable. Mr. \nPresident, it is time to end the months of delay that have occurred on \nthis bill and send it to the President for his signature. He has \nindicated that he will sign it--he will sign it--in its unamended form.\n  I will reiterate the key provisions of the bill: It contains an \nappropriation of just over $6.5 billion for emergency disaster \nassistance for the victims of various disasters; under the Byrd \namendment, the bill will reduce the deficit by approximately $9 \nbillion; and the rescissions contained in the bill will result in a \nfreeing-up of approximately $3.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year \n1996 appropriation bills, which can be used for other purposes. This is \nso because the outlays which would have occurred in 1996 from the \nappropriations for which these funds are rescinded will no longer be \nrequired. This will help ease the pain for the various appropriation \nsubcommittees with jurisdiction over important discretionary programs \nin achieving the deficit reduction targets for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, I once again congratulate the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatfield, for the tireless effort he has put forth \nin helping to resolve the differences between the President, the House, \nand various Senators on these difficult matters. I know that a number \nof Senators are still displeased with this bill but, on balance, I \nbelieve that it deserves the support of the Senate for the reasons I \nhave set forth.\n  The need to pass this rescission bill cannot be overstated. The \nAppropriations Committee has begun its work on the fiscal year 1996 \nbills. Failure to capture the outlay savings contained in this bill \nwill make things even more difficult in the weeks ahead when the Senate \ntakes up the fiscal year 1996 bills.\n  Several subcommittees are planning to mark up their bills next week. \nHowever, whether they are in compliance with their allocations is \nlinked to action on this bill. In the case of the Interior bill, for \nexample, it means a difference of over $100 million. So if we don't \npass this bill, the Interior Subcommittee will have to go in and cut \nover $100 million in addition to the over $860 million already being \ncut below this year's level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that the Senators from \nIllinois and Minnesota have 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of the \nSenator from West Virginia, I thank the Senator for his gracious \nremarks. It means a great deal to me personally and I am sure to \nSenator Moseley-Braun as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, principle and people, not power and \nprerogatives, that is what this debate is about.\n  Two Fridays ago we came to the floor and we said, regarding these \nkinds of cuts in programs that have such a dramatic impact on people's \nlives in our States and around the country, this cannot be a Stealth \nSenate, we demanded the right to have debate, to introduce amendments, \nand to have those amendments voted on. Now that will happen. That is a \nvictory.\n  There would have been more amendments, but in one area, where I could \nnot understand why in the world the Senate was making cuts, a \ncounseling program for elderly people so they do not get ripped off on \nsome of the health care plans that are presented to them, that money \nhas been restored through reprogramming--a victory.\n  But it is about more than power and prerogative, it is about \nprinciple and it is about people. We gave our word from the very \nbeginning that we wanted the opportunity to have these amendments on \nthe floor. It has taken 2 weeks of tough negotiations for that to \nhappen. We wanted this to be done in an accountable way. And we live up \nto our word.\n  But there is more than power and prerogative here. Last night the \nmajority leader--it is his prerogative--decided we would get started on \nthis bill at 10:30 or 11 o'clock at night, to use up time. Why not have \nmore of the debate during the day when people in the country can \nobserve it and make up \n\n[[Page S10458]]\ntheir own mind? That is prerogative. That is power.\n  The majority leader has also made it clear to everyone in this \nChamber that if his motion to table our amendments--there will be two \nseparate votes--does not succeed, he will pull the bill. What is this \nall about? The majority leader says, and I want to make it clear: If \nyou should succeed, Senator Wellstone and Senator Moseley-Braun, I will \npull the bill. That is power and prerogative.\n  But let me please talk about people. The Low-Income Energy Assistant \nProgram, the total cost was $1.3 billion--about the cost of one B-2 \nbomber. And Senator Byrd and Senator Hatfield and Senators, when you \nvoted this bill initially out of the Senate, you voted for that full \nexpenditure. You have not contradicted your vote when you vote on low-\nenergy assistance today. But in this deal, that we in the Senate had \nnothing to do with, we saw a 25-percent cut, $319 million.\n  Mr. President, I come from a cold-weather State. For most of the low-\nincome energy assistance people it is not an income supplement, it is a \nsurvival supplement. Mr. President, 53 percent of them work at low \nwages; 32 percent are senior citizens; 41 percent are households with \nsmall children; 50 percent earn under $6,000 a year. And there are \nabout 300,000 people in my State that depend on this, and many more \nwould be eligible but the funding levels have been cut so dramatically \nover the years we cannot even help all the people that need some \nassistance.\n  I thought we are all our brothers' and sisters' keeper. But please \nremember it is not just heating assistance, it is cooling assistance. \nMy God, 450 people in our country have died in the last week and a \nhalf, 2 weeks; elderly, most of them poor, no air-conditioning, no \ncooling assistance. And we are cutting this program. What does this say \nabout our priorities? GAO report: ``Travel Process, re: Engineering. \nDOD Faces Challenges in Using Industry Practices to Reduce Costs.'' All \nabout waste in Pentagon travel budget.\n  Washington Post series, ``Billions Go Astray, Often Without A Trace: \nDefense Department.''\n  In the LIHEAP amendment I just say, can we not transfer $319 million \nfrom all this waste and put it into the Low-Income Energy Assistance \nProgram? Mr. President, my colleague from Illinois will talk with \neloquence and power about job training programs for dislocated workers, \nabout job training programs for veterans, about children's programs, \neducation programs. I have not met one Minnesotan in one cafe who has \nsaid to me, ``Senator, when you do this deficit reduction, cut those \njob training programs for dislocated workers.'' Mr. President, all of \nmy colleagues need to understand, when we talk about the Low-Income \nEnergy Assistance Program, which will be the first vote, the House of \nRepresentatives has zeroed it out. They did it at 3 a.m. last week. \nThey zeroed the program out. This vote today is all about whether we \nare going to continue it. That is the meaning of this vote.\n  There is power and prerogative, and some people here are saying, ``If \nI loose, I will pull the bill.'' But what about the people in the \ncountry who lose? Many Senators signed a letter saying there ought to \nbe the $1.3 billion, that is not too much. Forget the power and \nprerogative, forget the deal, I say to my colleagues. If we restore \nthis funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, it will \ngo to the House of Representatives and it could be back here at 1 p.m. \nWe all know that. And you cannot say to the people you represent: I am \nsorry, you go without heating assistance, you are going to be homeless, \nor you are going to be cold, or you are going to die because of summer \nheat, because we made a deal with the House and it will take us a few \nextra hours to pass this bill. My God, I do not see the values behind \nthat kind of position.\n  I am sorry the White House was a part of this deal. I am sorry the \ndeal was made late at night and then it came over here. And we made it \nclear we were not going to just let it sail through.\n  But I say to my colleagues, you do not represent the White House. It \ndoes not matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican, we took the \nposition before in the Senate that there ought to be adequate funding. \nYou represent the people back in your States. And people are counting \non you.\n  So I say to my colleagues, this is not about power and prerogative. \nThis is about people and principles. I appeal to every Democrat and \nevery Republican, please, Senators, do not be generous with the \nsuffering of other people.\n  Let me repeat that. These are not statistics, these are not charts, \nthese are not deals, these are not abstractions. Whatever State you \ncome from, hot weather or cold weather, whether you are a Democrat or \nRepublican: Please do not be generous with the suffering of other \npeople. Vote your principles. Vote for what you believe in. We should \nwin this vote.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair assumes you are dividing the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In which case you would have 5 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will reserve that time. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator \nWellstone, for that passionate speech, and one which, I think, sets the \ntone for the debate on this amendment.\n  At the outset, I want to add my thanks to the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, for his kind and complimentary remarks. \nFrankly, I can think of no higher compliment than to be commended by a \nSenator who is known worldwide as the dean of the Senate and, indeed, \nthe historian of the Senate. And I can think of no one who has a \ngreater respect for the traditions of this institution and the \nimportance of that tradition than he. So, to have him give such a kind \ncompliment this morning is a singular honor, and I am very grateful to \nhim for it.\n  I also thank the Senator from Oregon for his diligence in working \nwith us on this matter, because it is something about which both \nSenator Wellstone and I, and I hope many other Senators, feel strongly.\n  Mr. President, I spoke to the issue of priorities last evening, and I \nwill touch on that again. But I want to speak, really, more in a \nlegislative context, about what it is that is going on here and what we \nhave done and what we are attempting to do. There is an old expression \nthat those who love the law and who love sausages should not watch \neither of them being made.\n  So it is with H.R. 1944. To read the title of this bill, it says, \n``Making emergency supplemental appropriations for additional disaster \nassistance.'' Nobody can be against disaster assistance--for \n``antiterrorism initiative''--something we all would applaud--for \n``assistance in the recovery from the tragedy that occurred at Oklahoma \nCity.'' Again, something for which I know there must be unanimous \nconsent.\n  And here comes the poison pill: And ``making rescissions for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 1995, and for other purposes.'' That \nis the rescissions portion of this legislation that gives rise to this \namendment and the controversy that we have had over the last few weeks.\n  The rescissions portion of this legislation has several aspects to it \nthat I think all Senators ought to a pay attention to. In the first \ninstance, it is, as Senator Wellstone points out, a matter of \npriorities, a matter of principle, a matter having to do with the \ndirection we take as we proceed on the glidepath toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  In this Senate the members of the Budget Committee adopted a budget \nresolution which had, on the one hand, the good news that it began to \nput us on a glidepath toward a balanced budget and began to assert that \nwe were going to begin to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Mr. President, as a supporter of the balanced budget amendment I \ncould not have been more pleased that we had started in the direction \nof getting our fiscal house in order and beginning to achieve budget \nbalance. However, Mr. President, this is why this amendment is so \nimportant. I was very concerned with the budget resolution, as I am \nwith H.R. 1944, that the approach that we take toward a balanced budget \n\n\n[[Page S10459]]\ndoes not fall on one segment of Americans, particularly the most \nvulnerable Americans, to make more sacrifice, to give more than they \ncan afford to give than any other group of Americans. That is \nessentially the issue of priorities that is raised in this Wellstone/\nMoseley-Braun amendment.\n  Some 62 percent of the cuts in this rescissions portion of this bill \ncome from programs that serve low-income individuals. As we approach \nbalanced budget, I think we have to, as we take the first step toward a \nbalanced budget, ask ourselves a question: As a nation, are we going to \ncall on low-income individuals to make more of a sacrifice than middle-\nincome individuals, than middle-income communities, more than the \nwealthy?\n  Without talking about class warfare--this is not intended to be class \nwarfare, Mr. President--the point is we have to take a look at the \nwhole of what we do because a budget is not just about numbers. It is \nnot an abstract exercise. A budget is about people and about \npriorities, and it makes some very profound statements about the \ndirection in which we intend to have this country go.\n  Unfortunately, the cuts in this bill, as the first step to the budget \nexercise, suggest a set of priorities and a direction that I think is \nmost unfortunate. In the first instance, Senator Wellstone talked about \nthe cut in low-income heating assistance. That can have real dramatic \nand particular effect on hundreds of thousands of low-income \nindividuals, particularly senior citizens, all over this country.\n  The second place that concerns me greatly has to do--and this is the \nsecond division of this amendment--with the cuts specifically in the \narea of education and job training. We are calling upon our children to \nmake sacrifices and to make cuts that we are not calling upon our \ngenerals to make, Mr. President. And that, it seems to me, is poor \npublic policy.\n  Specifically, the bill eliminates the education infrastructure \nprogram which is designed to help rebuild some of the dilapidated \nelementary and secondary schools around this country and the safe and \ndrug-free schools and communities program. These cuts do not take into \naccount that thousands of young people in many communities across this \ncountry cannot learn, cannot get to school because of the drug wars \nthat rage in too many of our urban centers and our communities across \nthis Nation overall.\n  This bill would cut the Education Technology Program--who would argue \nthe point but that we need to make certain that our young people are \nequipped to go into the 21st century with the same access to education, \ntechnologies, and innovations of the information age as any other group \nof youngsters anywhere else in the world? We are relegating and, \nfrankly, dooming our own youngsters to be in a second-class position \nwhen it comes to competing in this international economy if we do not \nprovide them with the tools, with the capacity, and with the access to \ntechnologies that they will need to be able to access in the 21st \ncentury.\n  The Eisenhower Professional Development Program--another education \ncut. Who would argue with the notion that we ought to promote the \ntraining of teachers so that the people who train our young people will \nbe able to give them a world-class education.\n  Those are where the education cuts come from, Mr. President, in this \nrescissions bill. And that is one of the reasons why we have argued \nthat as a matter priority, we ought to send a signal that it is not \nacceptable to us that our youngsters take these kinds of cuts, that the \ninitiatives that we have for education, which is our investment not \nonly in the future but our investment in the present, in our human \ncapital, in our human infrastructure, that these are not cuts that \nought to be made in this legislation.\n  To go further, the second part of the cuts in this division of the \namendment has to do with job training. If you want to talk about \nvulnerable populations, I would point out at the outset that one of the \nfirst cuts that this second part of the rescissions bill makes is \nagainst job training for homeless veterans. How we can say it is OK to \ncut job training for homeless veterans and not offset those cuts with \nmoney from the travel and administrative budget out of the Department \nof Defense is incomprehensible to me.\n  Homeless veterans programs get cut in this legislation as does \ndisplaced worker training. Displaced workers, people laid off from \ntheir jobs from the base closings, or from some event in the various \ndownsizing going on, need assistance to make the transition so their \nfamilies do not have to go through the trauma of being dependent on \nwelfare and public assistance. Yet, we are going to cut displaced \nworker training in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I know areas certainly in my State of Illinois in \nwhich there is 1 percent private sector employment--1 percent. It \nsounds almost incomprehensible that we could have that kind of economic \nmeltdown in any part of our Nation. With 1 percent private sector \nemployment, and in some instances as high as 89 percent unemployment \namong teenagers, how then do we say, well, we have to get this bill \npassed because we do not want it to go back to the House and then go \nahead and cut some $272 million out of job training for teenagers who \ndo not have any other option.\n  That is what is at stake, Mr. President, with this legislation. And I \nsubmit to my colleagues, as I did last night, and I spoke to this bill \nlast night, that the real significance --the cuts are bad enough--but \nthe real significance is the direction that this puts us. Our assent to \nthis legislation as it is currently written suggests that it is OK for \nthe budget debate to go forward allowing for these kinds of cuts in \nthese kinds of sensitive areas in which, if anything, we ought to \ninvest our energies as opposed to withdraw our support, and that is the \npriority debate that we ought to be able to engage at this time.\n  An interesting thing happened here, Mr. President. This is one of the \nreasons for the emergency nature of this legislation. The budget that I \nreferenced that has been adopted presumed that this legislation is \nalready passed. The budget presumes that this is already done and it is \nOK, and we are just going to go forward down the path of trying to \nachieve balance based on not only these cuts but cuts that are slated \nto happen in future.\n  I would just point my colleagues to what has already happened in the \nHouse of Representatives with regard to education, with regard to job \ntraining, with regard to investment in people, and say, if this is not \na precursor of things to come, if this is not the ghost of Christmas \npresent, then what is coming out of the House certainly is the ghost of \nChristmas yet to come. And it will not be a very nice Christmas at all. \nIndeed, if anything, I believe that it will cause great strains in the \nsocial fabric of our country. I believe that it will put us on the \nwrong path and exacerbate not only wealth disparity, but exacerbate our \ninability to provide for a strong America in the future.\n  That, it seems to me, is the issue. There is no question, Mr. \nPresident, that as we address the whole issue of how we get on the \nglidepath to a balanced budget but that everybody is going to have to \nmake a sacrifice.\n  I served on the President's Commission on Entitlements and Tax \nReform. There is just no question but that we are going to have to have \nsome budget discipline, but that we all are going to have to tighten \nour belts a little bit, but that we are going to have to have cuts in \nsome areas.\n  I ask you if it is at all appropriate to have the cuts in areas that \nprovide job training for homeless veterans? I ask you if it is \nappropriate for us to have the cuts in areas that have to deal with \ntechnology training for students? I ask you if it is altogether \nappropriate to cut the funding for heating assistance for low-income \nindividuals in winter?\n  The Senator from Minnesota referenced the heat wave that we had in \nIllinois recently. Quite frankly, we have had over 376 deaths come from \nthe heat wave. Illinois does not have a heating program under LIHEAP, \nalthough, frankly, it could. The point I make, there have been 376 \ndeaths from heat this summer, but anybody who knows anything about this \nUnited States knows that we have a saying in Chicago: ``If you don't \nlike the weather in Chicago, wait a minute.''\n  So this next winter is likely to be as cold as it was hot last week. \nAre we going to sit back and say, well, it is OK \n\n[[Page S10460]]\nthat it is just too bad that those 376 people died. Is that part of the \nbrutal equation that we are buying into as part of our approach to \nbudget discipline? I do not think so.\n  I think, as Senator Wellstone has eloquently said, we should not be \ntoo generous with the suffering of others. Yes, we should make cuts, \nbut those cuts should be fairly spread out; that sacrifice should be \nshared, and it should not fall on any segment of Americans, \nparticularly the most vulnerable communities and constituencies in our \ncountry, to give more than their fair share.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 1944 calls on the most vulnerable to give the \nmost; those who have the least have to give the most under this bill. I \nhope this is not the direction that we will take as we engage in this \nbudget debate.\n  I call upon my colleagues to look closely at what is in this bill. I \nread the title but look at what actually goes on here. I am not going \nto get into the debate about what it does for the environment. It has \nsome environmental language that is in my opinion, atrocious. I will \nnot get into that because that was not the focus of these amendments \nand we have limited time this morning, limited time that I will add, by \nthe way, is unfortunate also because this ought to be a debate in which \nevery Member of the Senate engages.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the legislation. Read the bill. It may \nsound phenomenal but read the bill. It is not too much to ask. And then \ntake a look at exactly where the fine print takes you. The fine print, \nin my opinion, takes you on a path on which we do not need to go, that \nfrankly is beneath this great body.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, allow us to go back \nand revisit the issue of priorities, allow us to go back and revisit \nthe shared sacrifice and have rescissions legislation and then as we go \nforward a budget that accurately reflects a vision for America that \nwill give us a stronger America going into the 21st century and not one \nthat is weakened by a shortsighted approach such as this.\n  The division we are debating here today would restore $319 million \nfor the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP].\n  I strongly support the LIHEAP program. This program helps \neconomically disadvantaged individuals pay their heating bills during \nthe winter. It also helps these individuals pay their cooling bills \nduring unbearable heat waves like the one which recently swept across \nthe country and is being blamed for up to 376 heat-related deaths in \nChicago alone.\n  Last year, the LIHEAP program assisted 5.6 million households--\nincluding 200,000 households in Illinois--with an average income of \n$8,257.\n  Of these households, 55 percent included at least one child under 18 \nwhile 43 percent included at least one senior citizen.\n  Although the LIHEAP program is designed to help the neediest members \nof our society, its funding has steadily declined from $2.1 billion in \nfiscal year 1985 to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1995. As a result, \n20,000 eligible households in Illinois were denied assistance last year \ndue to a shortage of funds.\n  I am convinced that further cuts in the LIHEAP program will force \neven more of our Nation's elderly to have to choose between putting \nfood on their tables and heating their homes.\n  These cuts will also force energy providers to have to choose between \nnot getting paid for the energy they provide and cutting off their \nneediest customers.\n  I voted for the original Senate rescission bill which did not propose \nany cuts in the LIHEAP program.\n  I voted against the conference report on H.R. 1158 in no small part \nbecause of the $319 million cut it would make in the LIHEAP program.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this cut by supporting the division \nthat Senator Wellstone and I have introduced.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Wellstone \namendment, which will restore funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  Over 6 million people received aid with heating costs under the \nprogram last winter, including 143,000 households in Massachusetts. It \nalso provided urgently needed relief in the previous winter, which was \nextremely harsh.\n  Three-quarters of the families receiving LIHEAP have incomes below \n$8,000. These families spend an extremely burdensome 18 percent of \ntheir income on energy costs, compared to the average middle-class \nfamily, which spends only 4 percent.\n  Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented the heat-or-eat \neffect--higher utility bills during the coldest months of the year \nforce low-income families to spend less of their money on food and more \nof it on heat. The result is increased malnutrition among children.\n  The study found that almost twice as many low-weight and under-\nnourished children were admitted to the Boston City Hospital emergency \nroom immediately following the coldest month of the winter. No low-\nincome family should have to choose between heating and eating.\n  But it is the low-income elderly who are at the greatest risk if \nLIHEAP is cut back, because they are the most vulnerable to \nhypothermia. In fact, older Americans accounted for more than half of \nall hypothermia deaths in 1991.\n  In addition, elderly households are much more likely than other \nfamilies to live in homes built before 1940. These homes tend to be \nless energy efficient, and the elderly who live in them are at greater \nrisk.\n  In addition, low-income elderly who have trouble paying their energy \nbills are often driven to rely on room heaters, fireplaces, ovens, and \nwoodburning stoves in order to save money on central heating. Between \n1986 and 1990, heating sources like these were the second leading cause \nof fire deaths among the elderly. In fact, the elderly were up to \ntwelve times more likely to die in a heating-related fire than adults \nunder 65.\n  LIHEAP is a program that makes a difference in all these cases. It \nmakes a difference in human terms. It has been a lifeline to Edythe \nAston, an 81-year-old elderly woman living in Melrose, MA. She received \nfunding under the program to replace a dangerously defective furnace in \nher basement. Her furnace was in such disrepair that she said it could \nhave either shut down altogether or exploded. The LIHEAP assistance she \nreceived not only allowed her to heat her house, it also gave her peace \nof mind that she was safe in her home.\n  Finally, LIHEAP also benefits communities through its job-creating \nimpact on the local economy. As Robert Coard, president of Action for \nBoston Community Development, wrote in a Boston Globe article last \nmonth, LIHEAP ``employs large numbers of community people who may have \ntrouble finding work in industries requiring sophisticated high-\ntechnology skills. Many are multilingual--a major asset for this \nprogram. The oil vendors who work with the program include many mom-\nand-pop businesses that depend on fuel assistance to survive. The \ndollars spent go right back into the economy.''\n  The winter of 1993-94 was an especially harsh one. For the entire \nmonth of January 1994, the average temperature in Boston was only 20 \ndegrees, and the price of oil rose to meet the increased demand for \nheat.\n  LIHEAP should not be a partisan issue. If Senate Republicans are \nserious about helping and not hurting the elderly and low-income \nfamilies, they will join us in restoring these funds. They will stop \nraiding the wallets and the furnaces of those who need help the most.\n  I urge my colleagues not to freeze out the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, and to support the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 5 minutes and \n50 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there any \nother time on the opposing side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only time remaining is the time of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just say to my \ncolleague from Illinois that it has been a \n\n[[Page S10461]]\nreal honor to be in the Chamber of the Senate with her throughout this \nlast couple weeks.\n  I say to my colleague from Illinois that I think she is quite right \nabout process. This is just a glimpse of what is to come in terms of \nreally a lack of standard of fairness when it comes to who is asked to \ntighten their belt. And perhaps it is also a glimpse of what is to come \nin terms of trying to have a stealth Congress, where you make these \ncuts at 3 a.m. in the House, you make deals, and come over to the \nSenate.\n  I say to the Senator I believe, since this is a glimpse of what is to \ncome, that for us this is just the beginning. This is just the \nbeginning. This will become, I believe, a very important, historic \ndebate in the Senate. I know we are very determined to make sure that \nhappens.\n  Mr. President, I wish to just summarize because I had a chance to \nspeak earlier, and I wish to speak to one thing I have heard said \nseveral times that I really want Senators to think about before they \nvote. I am just going to take the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program \nbecause we are going to have two votes, two different amendments will \nbe voted on.\n  Mr. President, many Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, are on \nrecord supporting the LIHEAP program. This $319 million that we are \ntrying to restore from the Pentagon travel administrative budget is \nmoney that we voted for in the Senate. Senators are for this. The House \nhas now zeroed it out after this deal was made. They have zeroed it \nout.\n  This is a vote that could very well determine the future of this \nprogram. But to vote to restore this funding is consistent with the \nposition I think of a majority of Senators in this Chamber. It has \nnothing to do with contradicting the prior vote.\n  Second, Mr. President, just because the majority leader says if I \nshould fail in my attempt to table these amendments--let us start with \nthe one on LIHEAP--I will pull the bill, I doubt it. We have disaster \nrelief for Oklahoma and California. Senator Moseley-Braun and I have \nbeen very consistent about this. That is why we said we wanted the \nright to have these amendments. We want some democracy; we want some \nopenness here, and that is why we made it clear once we were able to \nobtain that right we will go forward. I doubt the majority leader will \npull this bill.\n  Third, I say to my colleagues, it is a difficult argument for you to \nmake back home to the people you represent, and I know you care about, \nthat somehow you had to vote for these cuts in the Low-Income Energy \nAssistance Program that you do not support because this bill would then \nhave to go back to the House and it would take a few more hours. This \nbill could go back to the House, and it could be back here at 1 \no'clock.\n  Forget the deals, forget inside Washington politics and think about \nthe people who we represent even if those people do not have the big \nbucks, even if they are not the heavy hitters, even if they are not the \nbig players.\n  This vote goes to the whole question of the heart and soul of the \nSenate. Mr. President, 450 people have died in the last 2 weeks. \nCooling assistance is part of this program. My colleague from \nPennsylvania is one of the champions of this program. He would be the \nfirst to say that. Why are we cutting this program?\n  Mr. President, I just say this one more time. Whether it is a cold \nweather State, where this is not an income supplement, this is a \nsurvival supplement, whether we are talking about heating assistance or \ncooling assistance, the total appropriations for this bill were less \nthan one B-2 bomber. And we want to take just $319 million out of a \nPentagon travel administrative budget that the GAO says is bloated and \nwasteful, with all sorts of articles: ``Billions Go Astray, Often \nWithout a Trace,'' and just make sure we have a modicum of funding for \nlow-income energy assistance.\n  That will be the first vote. I will say it one more time to my \ncolleagues. Before you vote, please think deeply about this. I appeal \nto Senators: Do not be too generous with the suffering of other people. \nWe can restore this $319 million and we can send this bill over to the \nHouse, and it will be back here at 1 p.m. Convenience between House and \nSenate is an inside process and deals have nothing to do with justice \nand fairness and what we stand for.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if the \nSenator is going to speak against our position, then I would ask for \nmore time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would object unless we could have a unanimous \nconsent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 4 minutes and if the Senator from Minnesota \nchooses 4 more minutes, it be up to his discretion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada objects.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would not object at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would object, but I would be pleased \nto have 3 minutes for the Senator from Pennsylvania and 3 minutes for \nthe Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like the record to show that we were for all \ndebate today. We wanted it during the daytime. This was not our \ndecision.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak up to 2 minutes. This is my subcommittee's bill, and \nI have things to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object unless we have 2 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I would like to clarify one important \nquestion regarding additional legislative language in this bill \ngoverning the Community Schools Program passed last year in the crime \nbill. I appreciate the assistance of the chairman in ensuring that $10 \nmillion of the $26.5 million originally appropriated will remain \navailable to assist communities that have designed programs to use \nschool buildings for constructive activities for young people to keep \nthem safe and out of trouble during the afternoons, evenings and \nweekends.\n  Additional language was added to the House limiting the use of funds \nsomewhat further than in the authorizing legislation. After this \nrescission becomes law, funds may be used only for entrepreneurship, \nacademic, or tutorial programs, or for workforce preparation. Although \nthis is a slightly narrower definition than in the original \nauthorization, it follows closely my original intent in developing the \nprogram, which was not to encourage purely recreational activities.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has done a wonderful job \nof getting this program underway. Despite a tight deadline, more than \n700 applications were received by the May 5 deadline.\n  Almost all of these applications feature the components that are \nidentified as permissible under the modified requirements in this \nlegislation. However, some of the best applications put these \nactivities in a broader context, including activities such as mentoring \nand conflict resolution, in keeping with the purpose of crime \nprevention. Other applications focus on academic and tutorial \nactivities, but address topics outside the underlying school \ncurriculum, which is in keeping with the intent of the legislation, \nsince we did not want to duplicate or subsidize existing school \nactivities.\n  All of these applications were prepared and the initial evaluation \nconducted under the original, slightly less restrictive, authorizing \nlanguage. I would be greatly concerned if HHS were required to start \nfrom scratch, reopening the application and evaluation process, in \norder to meet the most restrictive interpretation of these new \nconstraints.\n  Therefore, I would like to ask whether it is the chairman's \nunderstanding that, under this new language, more comprehensive \nprograms that center around the activities described, but set those \nactivities in the context of a broader program of mentoring or related \nmethods, would be permissible?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his inquiry. My \nresponse is that, he is correct in his reading of this language. The \nintent is to ensure that academic, tutorial, or work and \nentrepreneurship programs constitute the primary feature of any local \ninitiative funded through the Community Schools Program. I appreciate \nthat there may be other activities or methods, such as mentoring, that \nare necessary as part of a more comprehensive program for youth. \nCommunity organizations that have already developed applications under \nthe original authorization language should not be required to rewrite \ntheir applications to eliminate all mention of such incidental \nactivities.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I thank the Senator. I believe this will provide needed \nclarity to the Department and to the 700 community applicants. This \nsaid, however, I would reiterate the intent of this restrictive \nlanguage: in making these grants, the Department of Health and Human \nServices should not fund programs that are primarily recreational in \nnature, or whose primary feature is not academic, tutorial, or directed \nat developing the potential of young people as workers or \nentrepreneurs.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. This is my view also, and I believe it will help to \nmake this program successful.\n                center for ecology research and training\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am concerned about the rescission \ncontained in H.R. 1944 for the EPA Center for Ecology Research and \nTraining in Bay City, MI. The bill rescinds $83 million from this \nplanned facility, leaving about $10 million for close-out costs only.\n  This facility is very important to my State and I would hope the \nAppropriations Committee would consider at a minimum funding for the \ndocking and maintenance facility component of the project in the fiscal \nyear 1996 VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill. A \ndocking and maintenance \n\n[[Page S10463]]\nfacility is needed for EPA's Lake Guardian research vessel, which \nprovides important monitoring and research in the Great Lakes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his remarks. Let me \nassure him that I understand how important this project is to his \nState.\n  The bill rescinds funds for this project primarily because EPA is in \nthe midst of a major reorganization of its research laboratories. EPA \nalready has 39 laboratories, and there is great concern as to whether a \nnew facility is needed or can be afforded at this time.\n  I understand the plans for the center include a super computer \ncenter, a training center, a docking and maintenance facility, and \nenvironmental research and analytical chemistry laboratories.\n  As part of the Agency's laboratory reorganization, EPA should study \nwhether the docking and maintenance facility is critically important in \nBay City, and if so, determine the associated construction and \noperating costs. This information should be provided to the \nAppropriations Committee as soon as possible so that it may be \nconsidered in the fiscal year 1996 appropriation bill for EPA.\n  The committee will give close consideration to the Senator from \nMichigan's recommendation for this project, as well as information from \nthe EPA. While I cannot provide any guarantees for funding. I ensure my \nfriend from Michigan that it will receive our serious and careful \nconsideration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the assurances of the distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee. I hope he will also work with me to \nensure that EPA is able to fulfill its legal and moral obligations to \nacquire and remediate, if necessary, contaminated properties where \nacquisition by EPA has begun.\n  Mr. BOND. I will make every reasonable attempt, within available \nfunds, to provide EPA with the ability to satisfy the Agency's \nobligation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Missouri. His assurances and \nthose expressed by Congressman Livingston regarding this project, \nimprove the future prospects for the dock and maintenance facility, if \nnot the entire project.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to adopt, and \nsend to the President for his signature, H.R. 1944, the revised fiscal \nyear 1995 rescission bill. The legislation before the Senate today is \nan important first step toward a balanced budget. Once we get to that \nbalanced budget--roughly 7 years from now--the Nation will be relieved \nof a terrific burden on its people and our economy. There's another \nform of relief in the rescission bill before us today, and its \nspecifically targeted at natural resource based communities across our \nNation that have been destroyed by misguided Federal policies.\n  The emergency salvage timber provision in this legislation, which has \nbeen the subject of many intense negotiations over the past few days, \nwas included in the original rescission bill vetoed by the President, \nas a way to provide some short-term relief to timber communities in my \nState.\n  For 6 long years, rural timber communities in my State have been \nunder siege from their Federal Government, and the implementation of \nenvironmental laws that have neglected to consider the impacts of these \nlaws on people. Federal agencies have gone literally unchecked in their \nimposition of regulations, and restrictions on people and their \nproperty, and, the cumulative effects of these actions have resulted in \nthe destruction of rural communities and their way of life.\n  Mr. President, I know the people who live and work in these \ncommunities--Forks, Morton, Aberdeen Port Angeles, Colville--and I am \nproud to call them my friends. I get angry when actions by the Federal \nGovernment result in the destruction of their way of life. Forks, \nWashington is no different than any other rural community across \nAmerica. What is different about Forks is that the community has \nlargely been shut down. And what is different about Forks is that the \nFederal Government has done little, if anything, to acknowledge the \nfact that this community has forever been changed.\n  Today timber communities must fight for every log that gets to their \nmill. Timber communities fight against clever--and not so clever--\nenvironmental attorneys that file lawsuits to block Federal timber \nsales. If success is measured in the number of sawmills shut down, the \nnumber of small business with closed doors, the number of workers \ncollecting unemployment checks, and number of close-knit families that \nhave unraveled, then environmental extremists have been hugely \nsuccessful.\n  It is fundamental to our ideal of the American dream that an \nindividual have the ability to choose his or her livelihood. As a \nfather and a grandfather, I see endless opportunities for my children \nand grandchildren, to pursue a career or life's work that will bring \nthem great happiness. I believe this to be a tenet of our American way \nof life that should not be undermined or\n compromised, and this Senator will fight to protect and enhance such \nopportunities, not compromise them.\n\n  But Federal agencies and Federal environmental laws have \ncompromised--if not sold out--the dreams of people in timber towns \nacross my State. It was not enough that an individual's life's work was \ncasually disregarded by his Government, but the response from the \nFederal Government--and from urban area leaders--to their plight was to \nsimply suggest that timber workers just find another job. The arrogance \nof this statement speaks for itself.\n  To add insult to injury, this administration put forward a plan--\nOption 9--that would pour money--hundreds of millions of dollars--into \nmyriad bureaucracies, training programs, forms, and procedures that was \nsupposed to ease the pain of a policy designed to essentially eliminate \na vital part of our region's workforce and economy.\n  Mr. President, it is crystal clear to this Senator, and I hope to \nmany of his colleagues, that the answer to this problem is not arrogant \nstatements that look down upon the time honored way of life in our \nrural communities, or throwing money at the problem and hoping it will \ngo away. The answer to this problem is simple, we must change the laws \nthat have brought us to this point.\n  The legislation before us today is an emergency measure that will \nbring a degree of relief to people in timber communities in my State. \nIt's a good starting point, but this Senator intends to address the \nunderlying statutes that have brought us to this point in the first \nplace.\n  The history of the emergency salvage timber provision dates back to \nwhat is commonly known as ``section 318'' of the fiscal year 1990 \nInterior appropriations bill. That provision was crafted by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, together \nwith other members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation, \nto address the timber supply shortage in our region. The provision \nincluded what is commonly known as ``sufficiency language''--language \ninsulating timber sales from frivolous legal challeges filed under \nvarious environmental statutes. The sufficiency language included in \nSection 318 was ultimately challenged all the way to the Supreme Court, \nwhere the Court ruled in favor of the goals and principles put forward \nin the legislation.\n  The emergency salvage timber provision in the rescission bill before \nthe Senate today includes sufficiency language that was carefully \ncrafted to mirror the sufficiency language in section 318. Why? Section \n318 has been tested by legal challenge, and it has survived. The \nsufficiency language in H.R. 1944 does not attempt to chart new \nterritories on this front, but to follow the carefully crafted language \nthat has been held up under close scrutiny.\n  In 1992, this Senator offered an amendment on the Senate floor to the \nfiscal year 1993 Interior appropriations bill that would have granted \nthe authority to the Secretary to move forward with salvage timber \nsales. During the Senate debate on that amendment, I cautioned the \nSenate that to allow salvage timber to continue to build up on the \nfloor of our Nation's forests would result in devastating wildfires in \nfuture years. The Senate rejected that warning, and my amendment was \nsoundly defeated.\n  And again, just last year, during the House-Senate conference on the \nfiscal year 1995 Interior appropriations bill, I attempted to offer an \namendment that would give the Secretary the authority to offer salvage \nsales to improve forest \n\n[[Page S10464]]\nhealth conditions in our Nation's forests. My amendment was soundly \nrejected by the Democratic-controlled Congress.\n  But this year, things are different. Today, after years of struggle \nand suffering, the voices of timber families in Washington State have \nfinally been heard. Today, the Senate will finally pass legislation, \nand send it to the President that will result in real relief for people \nin my State. Real relief, Mr. President, not simply promises on paper \nto be waved around at press conferences.\n\n\n                   emergency salvage timber provision\n\n  The provision in H.R. 1944 is virtually identical to that which \npassed the House and Senate in the conference report to H.R. 1158. The \nconference report to H.R. 1158 was, of course, vetoed by the President. \nThe legislation before the Senate today includes four key modifications \nto the timber language included in the conference report to H.R. 1158. \nAllow me to briefly explain these changes, and the rationale behind \neach.\n  First, in subsection (c)(1)(A) of H.R. 1944, the change worthy of \nnotice was included at the request of the administration. This Senator \ndid not believe that this change was necessary because of the way that \nthe entire provision is drafted. The fundamental concept of the timber \nlanguage is that the Secretary has the discretion to put forward the \nsalvage timber sales of which he approves. Consequently, I was baffled \nby the administration's demand that in this subsection language be \nincluded to give direction to the Secretary ``to the extent the \nSecretary concerned, at his sole discretion, considers appropriate and \nfeasible'' that timber salvage sales ``be consistent with any standards \nand guidelines from the management plans applicable to the National \nForest or Bureau of Land Management District on which the salvage \ntimber sale occurs.'' The administration demanded that some mention of \n``standards and guidelines'' be included in this section. After a \nseries of negotiations this is the compromise that the House and Senate \nworked out with the administration.\n  Subsection (c)(1)(A) gives the administration the broadest latitude \nto prepare the salvage timber sales that it deems appropriate. It \nalready has the discretion to make the decision of whether or not to \nput forward a sale that is consistent the standards and guidelines of a \nparticular forest unit or BLM district. Essentially this request by the \nadministration and the language ultimately included at its request is \nnothing more than redundant.\n  Subsection (k) releases sales that were authorized under section 318 \nof the fiscal year 1990 Interior appropriations bill. Roughly 300 mbf \nof timber sales have been held up due to agency gridlock over the \nmarbled murelett. The administration asked the House and Senate to \ninclude in (k)(2) its definition of ``occupancy.'' That change in \nsubsection (k)(2) of the Emergency Salvage Timber provision would \nundermine the ability to move these sales forward. That suggestion was \nsoundly rejected by the House and Senate authors of the provision.\n  The language of (k)(2) requires that if a threatened or endangered \nbird species is ``known to be nesting'' in the sale unit that the \nadministration not harvest that unit, but come up with an equal\n amount of timber in exchange for preserving that unit. This was \nwritten to give the administration flexibility to protect that \nindividual sale unit in which the bird resides.\n\n  I wish to clarify that it is the intention of the House and Senate \nauthors of this provision that the administration must provide physical \nevidence that the bird is ``nesting'' in that unit before the \nadministration may enact (k)(3) to avoid the harvest of that sale unit.\n  The administration also requested that the date in subsection (k) be \nchanged from 30 days for the release of the sales, to 45 days. The \nHouse and Senate authors of the provision included this request in H.R. \n1944.\n  The third change included at the request of the administration \nrelates to subsection (l)--Effect on Plans, Policies, and Activities--\nof the Timber provision. The subsection addresses the effect that \nsalvage timber sales have on other multiple use activities. The \nprovision was revised to create a limited exception to language that \nprohibits modifying land plans and other administrative actions as a \nconsequence of implementing the section. The change, as requested by \nthe administration, allows for modifications under extremely limited \ncircumstances when needed to meet the salvage program agreed to by the \nconferees, or to reflect the particular effect of the salvage sale \nprogram.\n  It is critical to note that this modification expressly prohibits the \nadministration from using salvage timber sales as the basis for \nlimiting other multiple use activities. If the administration does need \nto modify an existing plan or program, project decisions, such as \nsalvage sales, or other activities, cannot be halted or delayed by the \nmodification. This is a critical point. This provision, as included in \nthe conference report to H.R. 1158, was requested by the U.S. Forest \nService as a way in which to ensure that the Forest Service would not \nbe subject to legal challenge for the ``cumulative effects'' of a \nsalvage sales when combined with another multiple use activity.\n  Last, the fourth change requested by the administration is, perhaps, \nthe most interesting. The administration requested that the expiration \ndate of the timber language be changed from September 30, 1997 to \nDecember 31, 1996. The administration aggressively pursued this \nrequest, with the express knowledge that its own agency officials in \nthe Forest Service specifically asked the House and Senate conferees on \nH.R. 1158 to extend the Senate passed date of September 30, 1996 to \nSeptember 30, 1997. The Forest Service made this request of the \nconferees for budgetary and planning purposes. Despite this fact, the \nadministration was undaunted, however, in their desire to change the \ndate to December 31, 1996.\n  When asked why the administration needed the date to be changed to \nDecember 31, 1996, the response was this: the current administration \ncannot control the actions of future administrations.\n  This is certainly an interesting concept, and an idea that I totally \nreject. Why? We cannot predict what will happen between now and the \nnext election. Will we continue to have a Republican controlled House \nand Senate? Will one body return back to Democratic control? This is \nthe subject of elections, and should not be the subject of policy \ndiscussions. But this\n President, unlike almost any other in recent history, has made \nelection politics a consideration in nearly every one of his policy \ndeliberations.\n\n  Aside from these changes the principle of the timber language in this \nlegislation remains the same. The timber language simply provides the \nPresident the ability to keep the multitude of promises that have been \nmade and broken to the people who live and work in timber communities \nin the Pacific Northwest. It's just that simple.\n  Briefly, the three components of my amendment are: emergency salvage \ntimber sales, Released timber sales, and option 9.\n  Emergency salvage timber sales: An emergency situation exists in our \nNation's forests created by past wildfires, increased fuel load, or bug \ninfested and diseased timber stands. Time and again, the administration \nhas publicly committed to putting together an aggressive salvage timber \nprogram. My amendment gives the administration the ability to do just \nthat.\n  The bill language directs the Forest Service and BLM expeditiously to \nprepare, offer and award salvage timber sale contracts for the thinning \nand salvaging of dead, dying, but infested, downed, and burnt timber on \nthese Federal lands nationwide, and to perform the appropriate \nrevegetation and tree planting operations in the areas in which the \nsalvage operations have taken place.\n  The bill language deems the salvage timber sales to satisfy the \nrequirements of applicable Federal environmental laws. It also provides \nfor an expedited process for legal challenges to any such timber sale, \nand limits administrative review of the sales.\n  Released timber sales: Language has also been included to release a \ngroup of sales that have already been sold under the provisions of \nSection 318 of the fiscal year 1990 Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act. The harvest of these sales was assumed under the \nPresident's Pacific Northwest forest plan, but their release has been \nheld up due to extended subsequent review by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n\n\n[[Page S10465]]\nService. Release of these sales will remove tens of millions of dollars \nof liability from the government for contract cancellation. The only \nlimitation on release of these sales is in the case of a nesting of an \nendangered bird species with a known nesting site in a sale unit. In \nthis case, the Secretary must provide substitute volume for the sale \nunit.\n  Option 9: First, let me make clear that I do not agree with, or \nsupport, option 9. I do not believe it comes close to striking an \nappropriate balance between the needs of people and their environment. \nMy amendment simply provides the Forest Service and Bureau of Land \nManagement the authority to expedite timber sales allowed for under \noption 9. The administration promised the people in the region of \noption 9--Washington, Oregon and California--an annual harvest of 1.1 \nbillion board-feet, and the time has come for it to keep its promise.\n  My amendment specifies that timber sales prepared under the provision \nsatisfy the requirements of Federal environmental laws, provides for an \nexpedited process for legal challenges, and limits administrative \nreview of such sales. Let me make clear that my amendment does not \nindependently validate option 9 and does not restrict future legal \nchallenges to option 9.\n  Mr. President, although I believe that the negotiations that have \ngone on over the timber language were unnecessary given the broad \nlatitude that the administration has in this legislation, it is a part \nof the legislative process. More important than these negotiations, and \nthe last minute interest of this administration in the legislation, in \nthe opinion of this Senator, are the people in timber communities. The \npeople in timber communities across my State will have won their first \nvictory when the President signs this bill. It's a victory they deserve \nand one we should give to them. I encourage my colleagues to support \nH.R. 1944.\n                     subsection (i) of section 2001\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to share with my \ncolleagues my understanding of subsection (i) of section 2001 of H.R. \n1944. This subsection contains references to several specific Federal \nstatutes as well as general references to Federal laws, including \ntreaties, compacts, and international agreements. It is my \nunderstanding that the reference to treaties is made in response to \nallegations that passage and implementation of section 2001 would \nresult in violation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement or the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\n\n                             forest health\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I voted for the rescission bill that \npassed the Senate earlier today because I believe so strongly that we \nmust bring our Federal budget under control, and hopefully balance it \nin the near future. The longer we delay this process the more difficult \nour choices become in cutting spending for truly important Federal \nprograms. But I remain strongly opposed to the provision in this \nrescission bill to exempt Federal logging from all Federal \nenvironmental laws for 2 years under the justification of salvage \nharvests. Not only is this provision unrelated to spending cuts--and \nprobably will be budget negative--it sets very inadvisable policy and \nprecedent.\n  ``Timber salvage'' in this provision is defined broadly to include \nvirtually all Federal forests, potentially including areas set aside or \nmanaged scientifically for critical watersheds, endangered species, \nroadless areas, or special recreation uses. It defines salvage to \ninclude ``dead, dying, and associated trees''--which may include \nvirtually all mature timber. And, it provides exemptions from citizens \nsuits, appeals, and judicial review of agency actions. These actions do \nnot appear warranted based on timber harvest data from public lands.\n  According to U.S. Forest Service data, since 1992 less than one-half \nof 1 percent of forest sales by volume have been delayed by citizen \nsuits, and less than 3 percent by\n litigation. In the first 11 months of 1994 over 1 billion board feet \nof timber was harvested from the ``Option 9'' areas developed for \nsalmon and spotted owl protection--very close to the 1.2 billion board \nfeet promise made for the 12 month period of 1994. Further, U.S. Forest \nService data shows that a substantial number of timber sales in this \nregion have been offered but not taken due to lack of demand.\n\n  In a recent issue of Random Lengths, industry's weekly report on \nNorth American Forest Products Markets, the lead story states that:\n\n       Consensus has developed that there is simply too much \n     production chasing too few orders. Most buyers and sellers \n     now agree that unless demand revives in a big way, and soon, \n     the industry is headed for widespread shutdowns and \n     curtailments.\n\n  Futures prices for softwood continue to be very low in relation to \npast years, further indicating low demand relative to supply.\n  Many experts believe that the timber industry faces a crisis of \ndemand, not supply. Even if this were not the case, it is doubtful that \nexemptions from Federal environmental laws would help smaller mills \nfacing log shortages. Mills that are most threatened by log shortages \nfrom public lands often cannot outbid larger mills at auction. Auctions \ntend to be won by deep pockets, with no guarantee that mills needing \nlogs the most will get them.\n  During debate over original passage of this bill Senator Murray \noffered a moderating amendment, which I voted for, that would have \nexpedited but not eliminated implementation of environmental laws on \nFederal forest lands. It failed by only one vote. The timber provision \nthat finally passed contains a change over previous language to expand \nthe role of the Secretary of Agriculture to require his signature in \norder to implement new sales. Although I do not think this is a \nsufficient fix to this legislation, I do think it is essential for the \nadministration to faithfully execute this authority in order to prevent \nserious abuse of the legal exemptions in this provision.\n  This timber provision is an unrelated, inadvisable and unnecessary \naddition to the rescission bill that will only further confuse our \nefforts to bring thoughtful, balanced reform to Federal environmental \nprotection, without sacrificing important safeguards.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, over 2 months ago, the President first \nannounced his determination to veto H.R. 1158, the rescission and \nsupplemental appropriations bill agreed to by the joint House-Senate \nconference committee. In part, he decried the agreement on the basis of \nthe rescission proposed for HUD. At the time, I said that rationale for \nthe veto was groundless. It is ironic, and very significant, that this \nmeasure, H.R. 1944, which the President now finds acceptable, rescinds \n$137 million more from HUD than did the bill which he vetoed.\n  Some have questioned why HUD is being cut by nearly $6.5 billion, \nmore than three-quarters of a total rescission of $8.4 billion for the \nsubcommittee. The answer is simple: That cut is roughly proportionate \nto that Department's available budgetary resources. Although HUD \nreceived new appropriations for fiscal year 1995 of $25.7 billion, \nabout 39 percent of the funding for our major agencies, it also carried \ninto this fiscal year $35.2 billion in unobligated prior year balances. \nIn other words, it more than doubled its total available budgetary \nresources with this massive influx of unspent, unobligated funding.\n  We must cut HUD, and we must begin now if there is to be any hope of \nsurviving the very constrained freeze-minus future for discretionary \nspending reflected in the budget resolution. The Congressional Budget \nOffice analysis of the cost of the President's original budget \nsubmission for subsidized housing demonstrated a 50-percent expenditure \nincrease over the next 5 years. This is a crisis. Unless we act now to \ncurb the spiraling growth in outlays, we will have to make truly \ndraconian cuts in the forthcoming fiscal year, including\n widespread evictions of low-income families from subsidized housing \nand accelerated deterioration in public and assisted housing across the \ncountry.\n\n  The solution is simple: Turn-off the pipeline of new subsidized \nunits. That is the fundamental focus of the rescission bill. We have \nalso restored cuts proposed by the House in CDBG, modernization, and \noperating subsidies, and redirected available resources toward another \nurgent aspect of restoring budgetary sanity to this out of control \nDepartment: demolish the failed housing developments, and put the rest \n\n[[Page S10466]]\non a sound footing to survive the competition and subsidy reductions \ncoming down the pike.\n  Amid all the debate over the future of HUD, it's important to keep in \nmind that over 4.8 million families receive Federal housing assistance, \nand half of them are elderly and disabled. It's also important to note \nthat such housing assistance is expensive. This year HUD will expend \n$26 billion for these programs, and costs are rising. In fact with the \nlong-term contractual commitments previously made by HUD, the \nGovernment is currently obligated to pay over $187 billion over the \nlife of these contracts, some stretching out 40 years.\n  Given the long-term nature of these obligations and commitments, \nhalting the budgetary growth of the Department can only be accomplished \nwith a focused, determined, multiyear effort. Unless we begin now, with \nthis bill, we will lock ourselves into another multi-billion-dollar \nincrement of long-term budget obligations. And this is only a first \nstep, one of many in which we will go beyond the limited fixes and cuts \nthat can be accomplished in a rescission bill. We must enact major \nreform legislation later this year, but this is a good, and very \nnecessary beginning.\n  The program reforms and initial reductions contained in the \nrescission bill are desperately needed to avoid a budgetary train wreck\n with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Immediate \nenactment of this bill, and the enactment of further budgetary and \nlegislative measures to address this crisis later this summer, provide \nus our best and perhaps only opportunity to avoid the displacement of \nthousands of low-income families, as well as further deterioration and \nloss of desperately needed affordable housing stock.\n\n  The President criticized a number of specific actions contained in \nthe original conference agreement. Frankly, there are a number of \nrecommendations in the revised measure before us which are even more \ntroubling. But this bill is a compromise, not only between what was \noriginally passed by the House more than 3 months ago and what was \nworked out in conference 2 months ago on H.R. 1158, but also with what \nthe administration has subsequently demanded. I believe the agreement \ngoes a long way toward minimizing adverse program impacts while \nincreasing our contributions to deficit reduction. The bottom line, \nhowever, is that it provides almost $8.4 billion in deficit reduction \nwhile protecting funding for activities critical to our Nation's \nveterans, investments in science and technology, the environment, and \nto meet the housing needs of lower income families.\n  For example, the rescission agreed to for national service was cut in \nhalf to $105 million. While many of us are dubious of the whole premise \nof paying people to become volunteers, regardless of their financial \nresources, and we have heard of instances where excessive payments have \nbeen made, the conferees decided to hold this program closer to the \nfunding level established for fiscal year 1994. I might add that the \nrescission is only a quarter of the original House-passed rescission of \n$416 million. The GAO is completing its report on the cost of this \nprogram which appears to confirm many of the concerns some of us have \nexpressed. This report will serve as an important new factor in our \nconsideration of funding for this program for fiscal year 1996.\n  In the case of housing for AIDS victims, the current rescission \ntotals only $15 million, a small fraction of $186 million included in \nthe House bill. Moreover, the rescission provides an increase in \nfunding over the level requested by the President for this fiscal year.\n  The bill includes $6.6 billion requested by the President for the \ndisaster relief fund. This will enable FEMA to respond to needs in \nCalifornia resulting from the Northridge earthquake and disasters in \nother States, and to meet emergency needs arising out of the terrorist \nbombing in Oklahoma City and flooding in the Midwest.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that the bill contains $5 million \nrequested by the administration to enable FEMA to initiate flood \nmitigation activities authorized by the National Flood Insurance Reform \nAct of 1994. So this bill not only provides the resources to help flood \nvictims recover from these disasters, but we are also taking steps to \nhelp avoid such flood damage in the future.\n  The bill also rescinds $81 million from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, including $50 million from excess personnel costs and $31 \nmillion from excess project reserves. This rescission will not impact \nVA's ability to provide patient care in any way. The rescission to \npersonnel costs does not affect staffing. Simply, VA's budget included \n$50 million more than they now estimate they need to pay salaries. \nDespite the assertion in the President's previous statement, no funding \nis being rescinded for medical equipment needs of VA hospitals and \nclinics.\n  In terms of the construction account, funds are rescinded from \nprojects which are costing less than what was originally appropriated. \nRescinding the funds ensures more careful management of the VA \nconstruction budget.\n  This measure rescinds a total of $1.3 billion from EPA. Of the total, \n$1.1 billion is rescinded from the drinking water State revolving fund. \nBecause this program has not been authorized, EPA has been unable to \nobligate the funds. While I support the need for this program, until it \nis authorized no funds may be spent. The rescission bill leaves $225 \nmillion for the drinking water State revolving fund should authorizing \nlegislation be enacted.\n  Within the Superfund Program, $100 million is rescinded. Because EPA \nfails to obligate on average $100 million in Superfund appropriations \neach year, this rescission is not expected to have a dramatic effect on \nprogram activities. On the other hand, it is intended to slow program \nspending pending enactment of major reform legislation which will \nlikely change the scope and nature of cleanup activities previously \nplanned.\n  This measure contains number of legislative provisions impacting EPA \nprograms including the automobile inspection and maintenance program to \nensure EPA is flexible in reviewing States' plans for I/M programs and \nconsiders assigning additional credits for effective decentralized \nprograms.\n  Also included are two key EPA reforms: first, a moratorium on new \nSuperfund site listings for the balance of this fiscal year, unless \nrequested by the Governor or unless reauthorization legislation is \nenacted, and second, a prohibition on EPA from enforcing vehicular trip \nreduction programs.\n  Mr. President, this compromise bill is a good one. Rescissions for \nprograms under the jurisdiction of the VA, HUD, and Independent \nAgencies Subcommittee total $8.4 billion. The contribution toward \ndeficit reduction is $1.5 billion more than the level originally passed \nby the Senate, but is $900 million less than that passed by the House. \nIt is a compromise, but one which fairly balances the differing \npriorities of the two Houses and still maintains funding for critical \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, this bill must be enacted without further delay to \nassure timely delivery of assistance to disaster victims in 41 States, \nincluding my own, as well as the Federal response in Oklahoma City. \nPerhaps equally important, immediate enactment of this measure is \nabsolutely critical to beginning the process of expenditure reduction \nto prevent widespread disruption and dislocations as we enact the \nlegislation necessary to bring the Federal budget back into balance in \n7 years. We must eliminate this spending before Federal agencies \nobligate even more of the funds we have identified for rescission, \nmaking the task of saving money in low priority programs even more \ndifficult.\n  This is a responsible bill. It cuts funding and contributes to \ndeficit reduction. It provides emergency funding which is urgently \nneeded to assist victims of disasters. It makes long overdue reforms \nand corrections in programs which need fixing. And this bill needs to \nbe enacted without further delay. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \naddressed to the Democratic leader, which is identical to the letter \nsent to the Republican leader, from Alice Rivlin indicating the \nadministration's full support for the bill as it was passed by the \nHouse, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1995.\n     Hon.

The Administration supports \n     H.R. 1944, as it passed the House.\n       H.R. 1944 provides an important balance between deficit \n     reduction and providing funds to meet emergency needs. This \n     legislation provides essential funding for FEMA Disaster \n     Relief, for the Federal response to the bombing in Oklahoma \n     City, for increased anti-terrorism efforts, and for providing \n     debt relief to Jordan in order to contribute to further \n     progress toward a Middle East peace settlement. H.R. 1944 \n     reduces Federal spending by $9 billion.\n       The Senate is urged to pass H.R. 1944, as it passed the \n     House. With only ten weeks remaining in the fiscal year, it \n     is essential that this legislation be presented to the \n     President as soon as possible. Therefore, the Administration \n     opposes any amendments to the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M.

Mr. President, the Senate passed a rescission bill today \nthat I wish was not needed. Unfortunately, too often disasters like the \nCalifornia earthquake and the Oklahoma City bombing occur that we \ncannot foresee or prevent. Those events are tragedies, and we must do \nwhat we can to assist the victims.\n  But there is another disaster that made this bill necessary--a \ndisaster we could have stopped, one that will affect every American for \nyears to come. That disaster is the Republican's budget resolution. \nThere is not a Member of this Congress that doesn't want to balance the \nFederal budget, but there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The \nbudget resolution passed by Congress tries to right 30 years of \noverspending with 7 years of draconian cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, \neducation, affordable housing, heating assistance, and just about every \nprogram hard-working American families depend upon.\n  This was not a bipartisan budget resolution. Republicans rejected \nPresident Clinton's more moderate approach. I voted against that \nresolution. Unfortunately, not enough Senators joined me to block this \ndisastrous budget that has created the need for the cuts we are making \ntoday.\n  In April, I came to the Senate floor to vote against H.R. 1158, the \nearlier rescission bill that focussed its cuts on the poor, the hungry, \nand on our children. I said then that I hoped Republicans and Democrats \ncould find a way to work together to develop a bipartisan bill that \nbalanced those cuts more evenly. We have done that, and I believe the \nbill we have passed today is more equitable than the rescission bill \nthat I voted against a few months ago.\n  The cuts to education programs, to AmeriCorps, and to programs \nfighting drug use in our schools and communities, have been reduced. To \noffset those cuts, administrative costs for the Federal Government were \ntrimmed.\n  This is not a perfect bill. I am deeply concerned about many of the \ncuts included in the rescission package, most importantly the cut of \n$319 million to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. \nI fought to restore funding to LIHEAP in the original Senate rescission \nbill, and I have continued to oppose cuts to this important program as \nthe House and Senate worked on a compromise.\n  This cut will hurt Vermonters who cannot afford to heat their homes \nduring our long New England winters. I do not believe that most \nAmericans would choose to let those people freeze so that the budget \ncan be balanced in 7 years as opposed to 10, or so that wealthy \nAmericans can get a bigger tax break next year. Certainly I would not.\n  I am also extremely disappointed with a timber provision, pushed \nthrough by special interests, that could be devastating to our Nation's \nforests. There is no justification for this timber legislation. It is a \ngift to special interest, powerful PAC money, and the champions of \nmisinformation. The letter I will include for the Record makes this \nclear.\n  I commend Senator Murray for the work she has done to establish a \nsustainable forest-based economy in the State of Washington, while \ncreating 3,500 new jobs in the lumber, wood manufacturing, and paper \nindustries. I applaud her for having the courage to stand up to this \nbackdoor attempt to weaken the laws protecting our forests without \nhearings, without committee mark-ups, without public participation, or \nopen floor debate. I hope that this is not an indication of the way \nthis Congress intends to address our environmental laws. The American \npeople did not vote for that kind of change, and they will not stand \nfor it any more than I will.\n  I voted for this rescission bill today--not because it is a good \nbill, but because it is a necessary bill. It is necessary to pay for \nthe disasters in California, in Oklahoma, and for the disaster that the \nRepublicans have created with their budget resolution.\n          regarding the national bankruptcy review commission\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to congratulate my colleagues, Senator \nHatfield, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator \nByrd, the ranking member of the committee, for the hard work they have \nput toward resolving the differences in this bill. I hope that the \npassage of this bill will help to put this country on her way back to a \nbalanced budget. Included in the bill is the appropriation for funding \nfor the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. This Commission was \nestablished pursuant to enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 \nwhich both the House and Senate passed unanimously. I wish to ask my \ndistinguished colleague from Alabama to clarify a few issues regarding \nthat Commission, since he managed the authorizing legislation last \nsession. First, is it not correct that pursuant to section 608 of the \nact, the 2-year period for submitting its report should be based on the \ndate on which the first meeting is held.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. The Senator is correct. Although the language in the act \nenvisions that the first meeting of the \n\n[[Page S10468]]\nCommission would take place within 210 days of enactment of the act. It \nis clear that first meeting as well as the actual 2-year duration of \nthe Commission should be based on the date on which the first formal \nmeeting, is held. This is the practical effect of the budgeting \nprocess, to which the Commission is bound.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are all bound by the budgeting process and must \nadjust our actions accordingly. I have one other question for my \ncolleague, regarding the Commission membership requirements. I \nunderstand that the membership provision of the Commission was intended \nto preclude from continued membership a person who had been appointed \nto that position due to his or her capacity as an officer or employee \nof a government. Would the Senator from Alabama explain to me who this \nprovision is meant to preclude from membership on the Commission?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I will be happy to help to clear up any questions which \nmay have been raised regarding membership on the Commission. It is my \nunderstanding that this provision is intended to preclude from \ncontinued membership on the Commission those Commissioners who are \nappointed based solely on the capacity of the governmental office for \nwhich they hold. If that Commissioner should leave the governmental \nposition during their term then they can no longer serve on the \nCommission.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10456-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think we have 4 minutes equally divided. \nI yield 1 minute to the Senator from Idaho, [Mr. Kempthorne].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bingaman \namendment. During a hearing before the Armed Services Committee earlier \nthis year, Defense Secretary Bill Perry testified that under the \npresent budget, it will take over 50 years to renovate many of the \nfamily housing units currently in use by the armed services of America. \nWe know we are falling behind in readiness. The military construction \nprojects that will be canceled by the proposed amendments will help \naddress these quality-of-life and readiness problems.\n  We have just gone through three difficult rounds of the base closure \nprocess. The bases and the facilities that have survived are the \nkeepers. We need to make investments to maintain the infrastructure \nthat literally serves as the foundation of our armed services. \nTherefore, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to table the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my cochairman of the State National \nGuard Caucus, Senator Bond of Missouri, and our colleagues in opposing \nthe Bingaman amendment. The military construction funds this amendment \nseeks to delete are not frivolous. They are necessary to the very \nbackbone of our military.\n  In my State alone, these funds go to build barracks to move our \nsoldiers out of the World War II clapboard barracks. Why is it not a \nPentagon priority to replace these barracks and provide a better \nquality of life for our soldiers?\n  The citizens of this country are well aware of the military drawdown \nin this country, but they have not asked our young men and women to \nstop volunteering their services, whether it be full-time active duty \nor part time as a reservist or guardsman.\n  Mr. President, I have watched them leave our communities, and many of \nthem do not come back. I watched the best surgeons in my State and \nscrub nurses go to the Persian Gulf, and they did their job. Let us not \nturn our back on these people now. Vote to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Feingold be added as a cosponsor on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Arizona, who is \nalso a cosponsor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the fact is that these are nice projects. \nThey are in the 5-year plan of the Pentagon, but they are not required \nat this time. There is simply additional spending that is not \nnecessary. There are far higher priorities for us to be able to meet \nour national security challenges than adding money for military \nconstruction at this time. They are good projects. They are not needed \nat this time, and if we are going to spend $300 million additionally, I \ncould find seven other areas that are much higher in priority than this \none. If we are going to show some fiscal responsibility, we ought to \nstart now.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are spending extra time voting on \nthis amendment since we just voted to rescind $16.4 billion in domestic \nspending. I think that was a courageous vote; it was a hard choice.\n  What this amendment that we are now considering does is it says that \nwe will allow $474 million of add-ons to military construction, but we \nwill not allow an additional $300 million above that. This is not a \nquestion of funding the National Guard. There is plenty of money in \nthis bill to fund the National Guard needs. This is not a question of \nfamily housing. There is plenty of money in this bill to fund the \nfamily housing needs of the military.\n  What we are saying is deficit reduction has to matter, even when you \nare \n\n[[Page S10469]]\ntalking about defense dollars, as well as when you are talking about \ndomestic dollars.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasonable amendment. It brings the bill \ninto line with the President's request. It is fiscally responsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against tabling the amendment.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1834\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1834 offered by the Senator from New Mexico, [Mr. \nBingaman].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], \nand the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], the \nSenator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], and the Senator from Georgia \n[Mr. Nunn] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as we consider the fiscal year 1996 Milcon \nappropriations bill, I wish to commend Senator Burns, the chairman of \nthe Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator \nReid, the subcommittee's ranking member, for their hard work in \npreparing this bill for floor action. It is evidence of the able \nleadership of Chairman Burns and Chairman Hatfield that we can consider \nthis bill so quickly. I would also like to commend Jim Morhard and \nWarren Johnson of the subcommittee staff for their efforts in crafting \na comprehensive and responsible bill.\n  Mr. President, this is an important bill. It provides the Armed \nForces with funds to construct facilities which are necessary in \npreparing them to protect the United States and our interests around \nthe world. It also fully funds the requested amounts for BRAC II, BRAC \nIII, and BRAC IV. In addition, the bill provides funds for the \nrenovation and construction of barracks and family housing. The \nmilitary's most important assets are the men and women who sacrifice \nevery day to ensure the security of this great Nation. It is the least \nwe can do to provide them and their families with quality housing.\n  I am pleased that the bill also provides funding for the Department \nof Defense's initiative to develop private sector solutions to the \ncurrent military housing shortfalls. It is a viable option as we \nconsider how to better meet the needs of our service men and women. I \nencourage the Department to work with Congress and with the Military \nAppropriations Subcommittee so that this program might move forward \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to commend Chairman Burns and \nChairman Hatfield for their efforts to meet the construction needs of \nthe Reserve components. Last year, during consideration of the fiscal \nyear 1995 military construction bill, I expressed my disappointment \nwith the President's budget and its lack of funding for Guard and \nReserve construction projects. At that time, I expressed my hope that \nthis year's budget would more adequately address the needs of the \nReserve component. The Department of Defense did include some Guard and \nReserve projects in the fiscal year 1996 budget. Chairman Burns went \nfurther to ensure that additional Guard and Reserve projects were \nfunded. In my view, that is a crucial step. As the Active Force \ncontinues to draw down, the Guard and Reserves will be asked to take on \nmore day-to-day missions. In my view, it is our responsibility to \nensure that they have the necessary facilities to meet these growing \ndemands.\n  I am aware that the committee has added projects that were not \nincluded in the President's request. The committee judged each of these \nprojects by strict criteria in an effort to ensure that military \nconstruction dollars are used wisely. The projects that have been added \ndirectly impact the readiness and quality of life for our Armed Forces.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I again commend my colleagues for their \nhard work on this bill. I thank them for their assistance in moving \nthis bill forward and urge my colleagues to support it.\nair force reserve and michigan air national guard military construction \n                                projects\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I would like to engage \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction in a brief \ndiscussion regarding the impact of H.R. 1817 on this year and future \nyear's military construction projects. The committee report \naccompanying H.R. 1817 recommends $6.4 million for airfield pavement \nadditions at the Phelps-Collins Air National Guard Base in Alpena, MI. \nThe requirement justification report for this project states this \nprogram will increase sortie generation and allow the military to \nconduct much more realistic training operations.\n  I also understand an air combat maneuvering instrumentation range for \noperations at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center was \nauthorized by the 1995 Defense Authorization Act and is contained in \nthe Air National Guard future year defense plan for initial \ninstallation starting 1997. If the Air National Guard were to support \nthis future year plan and request an appropriation for the equipment \nhousing construction, would you view this project as a reasonable step \ntowards providing the needed improvements in operational effectiveness \nat the Phelps-Collins Air National Guard Base and the Alpena Combat \nReadiness Training Center?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes I do. The committee allowance for the Phelps-Collins \nAirfield pavements additions project was done in order to reduce the \npotential for an aircraft mishap, increase sortie generation, improve \nthe utilization of the base and the training center, and allow for the \nfuture expansion of this facility for full operational training, \nincluding an air combat maneuvering instrumentation range expansion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to follow up on my colleague's \nquestion in asking the ranking member whether he agrees that a modern \nCombat Readiness Training Center is warranted given the training \ndeployments to Europe have been reduced with the closure of many \noverseas bases, and the fact that the Alpena facility is the only Air \nNational Guard Combat Readiness Training Center that does not have an \nair combat maneuvering instrumentation system? I would think that the \nunencumbered supersonic training airspace available for this range \nwould make it a uniquely valuable training resource.\n  Mr. REID. I am aware that both of my colleagues from Michigan and \nfrom elsewhere in the Great Lakes region are strongly supportive of \nexpanded \n\n[[Page S10470]]\ntraining opportunities for their Air National Guard and Air Force \nReserve units. The Air National Guard made a strong case for expanding \nthe operations at Alpena given the projected force levels and expected \nmilitary construction funding priorities. Because of that we funded the \nproject the subcommittee chairman referred to. I believe the \nsubcommittee would entertain such a budget submission by the Air \nNational Guard and would follow a logical program for expanding \noperations at Alpena.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for their support and I believe I speak for both myself \nand my colleague from Michigan when we say we look forward to working \nwith them on this issue during the 1997\n budget cycle. Mr. President, I wish to continue this discussion with \nthe chairman on the issue of the fuel systems maintenance dock at the \nSelfridge Air National Guard Base in Mount Clemens, MI. The Air Force \nReserve unit here has converted from an C-130 to a KC-135 mission, but \nis forced to tow its aircraft over 2 miles to perform critical fuel \ncell and corrosion control work. A project to provide a facility \nadequate to handle these repairs much nearer to the aircraft flight \nline will preclude major repair scheduling conflicts, sustain aircraft \nmaterial condition, and improve flight safety. Would the submission by \nthe Air Force Reserve for this project in the 1997 budget be reviewed \nfavorably?\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I believe if current budget projections hold forth, such a \nproject would be strongly supported. Considering this project is \nalready in the 1997 future year defense plan, I invite the Air Force \nReserve to submit this project for congressional review.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their time today and this opportunity to discuss these vital \nmilitary construction projects. I join my fellow Senator from Michigan \nin calling upon the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to submit \nthese two vital projects for congressional approval. These two projects \nrepresent initiatives vital to the operating efficiency of the few \nremaining Michigan Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units. \nFurthermore, it which will significantly improve the operating \ncapabilities of not only these units, but any other aviation unit that \nwishes to utilize this unique facility. I therefore join with my \ncolleague from Michigan in calling upon the Air National Guard and the \nAir Force Reserve to submit these two projects, in accordance with \ntheir future year defense plans, as part of their 1997 budget \nsubmission.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering H.R. 1817, \nthe fiscal year 1996 military construction appropriations bill.\n  The bill provides a total of $11.2 billion in budget authority and \n$3.1 billion in new outlays for the military construction and family \nhousing programs of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1996.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $11.2 billion in budget \nauthority and $9.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, the bill provides for readiness and quality of life \nprograms for our servicemen and women. The bill falls within the \nsubcommittees 602(B) allocation.\n  I want to convey my thanks to the committee for the support given to \nseveral priority projects in New Mexico.\n  I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the senator from \nMontana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's \nsection 602(B) allocation.\n  I urge the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to point out to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee that the recent approval of the 1995 base closure list by \nthe President has changed the circumstances surrounding one of the \nprojects in this legislation. The bill is based on recommendations the \nsubcommittee received from the Defense Department, and as a result this \nbill has insufficient funding to complete the construction of the \ndistribution facility at Red River Army Depot. Because the Defense \nLogistics Agency suspended work on the distribution facility pending a \ndecision by the Base Closure Commission and just recently resumed work \non the project, an adjustment to the funding level will be required. \nLess than 1 week ago, the Defense Department formally asked the \nbuilding contractor for an estimate of any costs resulting from the \ntemporary delay in construction, and an answer is expected within 1 \nmonth. Because we do not yet know how the total cost of the \ndistribution facility will change, I ask the chairman and ranking \nmember to work with me and the Defense Department in conference to be \nsure this vital Red River Army Depot project has sufficient funds to \nensure its completion.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am aware of the situation at Red River \nArmy Depot, and I want to assure my colleague that our subcommittee has \nno intent to impede the progress of this project. We will be happy to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Texas to ensure this project \nis fully funded so that it may be completed without further \ninterruption or delay.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee, Senators Burns and Reid, for their \nhard work in producing this appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  Included in the bill is $18 million for phase 2 of the Strategic \nMaritime Research Center at the Naval War College in Newport, RI. The \nNaval War College boasts a long and proud tradition of excellence in \nmilitary education and state-of-the-art wargaming.\n  Unfortunately, though, the War College's library is badly undersized, \nand its wargaming facility is unsuited to today's technological \ndemands. The Strategic Maritime Research Center will jointly house the \ncollege's wargaming department and library in one modern facility.\n  This facility will help continue to provide our military with the \nbest-educated, best-prepared officers who will be able to meet the \nincreasingly complex national security challenges our Nation faces. It \nwill also help us continue an important diplomatic mission, as the \nNaval War College very often hosts military officers from abroad who \nparticipate in a number of wargaming and educational endeavors.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senators Burns and Reid in bringing this \nbill to the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as a member of the Appropriations Committee \nand the Military Construction Subcommittee, I voted to have the fiscal \nyear 1996 military construction appropriations bill brought to the \nSenate floor.\n  The military construction bill is $2.4 billion more than what we \nspent last year on military construction and $461 million more than the \nadministration's requested level of spending for military construction. \nIf we truly intend to reduce the budget deficit, we cannot exempt the \nmilitary construction account from cuts. Especially given that the \nBingaman amendment to eliminate $300 million in add-ons failed, I will \nbe voting against final passage of the fiscal year 1996 military \nconstruction appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, it is with regret that I must cast my \nvote against the fiscal year 1996 military construction appropriation \nbill. We simply cannot justify the level of spending contained in this \nlegislation.\n  This bill funds many worthy projects. For example, I strongly support \nefforts to improve the quality of life for our service men and women. I \nsupport the infrastructure construction that is absolutely necessary to \nkeep our military in fighting shape. I have long supported the military \nvalue of McGuire AFB in my own State of New Jersey. Indeed, I worked \nhard and successfully to keep McGuire open and performing its vital \nmilitary missions. I will support the spending that McGuire needs to \nprosper.\n  But all of these worthy projects are embedded in a bill larded with \npork. It is $461 million higher than the President's budget request, \nand over $2.4 billion above last year's funding total. It contains \nhundreds of millions of dollars in unauthorized spending. At a time of \nbudget stringency, when we are asking all Americans to make sacrifices, \nI simply cannot support a 28-percent increase in spending for military \nconstruction.\n                           Amendment No. 1835\n\n  Mr. SIMON. I have an amendment offered by Senator Moseley-Braun and \n\n[[Page S10471]]\n  myself that I send to the desk for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] for himself and Ms. \n     Moseley-Braun proposes an amendment numbered 1835.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following.\n\n     Sec.  . Fort Sheridan.\n\n       (a) In order to ensure the continued protection and \n     enhancement of the open spaces of Fort Sheridan, the \n     Secretary of the Army shall convey to the Lake County Forest \n     Preserve District, Illinois, (in this section referred to as \n     ``the District''), all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States to a parcel of surplus real property at Fort \n     Sheridan consisting of approximately 290 acres located north \n     of the southerly boundary line of the historic district at \n     the post, including improvements thereon.\n       (b) As consideration for the conveyance by the Secretary of \n     the Army of the parcel of real property under subsection (a), \n     the District shall provide maintenance and care to the \n     remaining Fort Sheridan cemetery, pursuant to an agreement to \n     be entered into between the District and the Secretary. The \n     Secretary of the Army shall be responsible to continue \n     interments at the cemetery for the remainder of its use.\n       (c) The Secretary of the Army is also authorized to convey \n     the remaining surplus property at Fort Sheridan to the \n     negotiating agent, or its successor, for an amount no less \n     than fair market value (as determined by the Secretary of the \n     Army) of the property to be conveyed.\n       (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property (including improvements \n     thereon) to be conveyed under subsections (a) and (c) shall \n     be determined by surveys satisfactory to the Secretary. The \n     cost of such surveys shall be borne by the Lake County Forest \n     Preserve District, and the Fort Sheridan Joint Planning \n     Committee, respectively.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interest of the United \n     States, except for consideration previously provided for in \n     paragraph (c).\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is an amendment I discussed with \nSenator Burns. It solves a problem that has been festering in regard to \nan abandoned military base.\n  Everyone--Congressman Porter from the House side--everyone has agreed \nto it. I understand there may be some problems. I yield to Senator \nBurns.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. We do \nhave some problems on this side with it. We will work with the Senator \nand the Illinois delegation on this as we move through conference.\n  I am reluctant to accept the amendment at this present time.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1835 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SIMON. With that assurance, I will withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1835) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I know of no further amendments to this \npiece of legislation. I believe that we are ready to move to third \nreading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \ncommittee amendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I appreciate their \nhelp at every turn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I wish to take just a couple minutes to \nindicate my congratulations and my commendation to the Subcommittee on \nMilitary Construction. I would like to remind the Senate that this is \nthe first action of the Appropriations Committee in the Chamber under \nthe new majority rule. We came to the floor with very great efficiency \nconsidering that we were required to wait until the conference \ncommittee had completed work on the Budget Committee budget resolution.\n  We were only able to issue our 602(b) allocations at the first of the \nweek. We have now completed two appropriations bills on the floor. We \nwill report four more out next week.\n  I wish to also acknowledge the efficiency and smooth operation that \nhas thus far characterized these two bills. In great part, it is \nbecause of the professional staff. I raise that first instead of the \nnormal way of talking about the Members. I wish to make that a point \nbecause our staff has been so focused on professionalism on our \ncommittee and a nonpartisan approach. You can note very little \ndisturbance or confusion in the readjustment of moving from the \nmajority to the minority or the minority to the majority; our staffs \nhave that continuity and expertise.\n  I refer specifically to Jim Morhard on our side and Dick D'Amato on \nthe minority side. Not only are they experts and have the continuity of \nservice, but they really provide us with stability and efficiency \nwithin this committee.\n  Needless to say, the leadership of the committee is in the hands of \nvery capable people, Senator Burns of Montana and Senator Reid of \nNevada. Both of them are veterans on that committee and both of them \nhave provided leadership as they have been on that committee, Senator \nReid first as a part of the majority and now the minority, Senator \nBurns in the minority and now the majority. If you see these two \ngentlemen work in their committee, you \n\n[[Page S10472]]\nwould have no way to detect any difference of performance, any less \ndedication or any less efficiency.\n  So I wish to commend the leaders for providing that kind of virus \nthat infects our staff and creates a harmonious committee. Senator \nByrd, the ranking member of our committee, certainly has become again a \npart of that overall philosophy and that kind of performance of our \ncommittee, and I wish to take this time to thank Senator Byrd as well, \nthe ranking member of the full committee.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take just a moment to respond \nto the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], who has been \nworking to achieve public hearings on the sexual misconduct case \nagainst Senator Packwood.\n  Mr. President, on July 10, several Senators wrote to me and the vice \nchairman urging the committee to convene public hearings. Several days \nlater, my friend from California wrote to us on her own to inform us if \nthe Ethics Committee had not voted to hold public hearings within a \nweek of her July 14 letter, she would seek a vote of the full Senate on \nthe issue of public hearings in the Packwood case.\n  Today, the Senator said that if the committee has not met by the \nclose of business today, she will bring her legislation to the floor at \nthe first opportunity next week.\n  Mr. President, I think I speak for all committee chairmen and \nchairwomen as well as previous chairmen and chairwomen when I say our \ncommittee schedule and agenda must not be dictated by another Senator. \nAs strongly as the Senator from California believes there should be \nhearings in the Packwood case, I strongly believe that the Ethics \nCommittee's timetable must not be set by a single Senator.\n  One thing is certain. The Ethics Committee will not meet today and \nwill not schedule a future meeting today. We will not respond to any \nattempts to threaten the committee. If we open the door to that, in the \nfuture there could well be numerous efforts to bring ethics matters to \nthe full Senate, and that is a dangerous road to take, Mr. President.\n  The committee would like to complete work on the Packwood case but \nperhaps everyone needs a cooling-off period. As long as Senator Boxer's \nthreat remains, the cooling-off period will continue.\n  The one issue Senator Boxer and I agree upon is that the case before \nthe committee is a serious one. It is one which has commanded the \nattention of committee members for countless hours over the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears. The committee members have labored long and hard, and they know \nmuch more about this case than any other Member of the Senate.\n  There is much to say about the Packwood case. Now is not the time to \nsay it. I can assure my colleagues and the Senator from California that \nat the appropriate time, I will speak fully about the case and about \nthe committee's work. At that time, I hope my colleagues will have a \nbetter understanding of the significance and the dimension of the \nmatter.\n  The Senator's efforts are ill-informed and badly timed. After all, \nthe committee lost practically a year in a legal dispute over obtaining \nSenator Packwood's diary as evidence in the case. If Senator Boxer \ntakes us on another such frolic and detour, it will only further \ndistract us and prevent us from concluding this important case, and it \nwill interfere with the Senate's agenda and the work the American \npeople sent us here to do.\n  So if we find ourselves on the floor in the coming days debating \nlegislation regarding hearings in the Packwood case or any other \nsubject related to Ethics Committee procedures, I will be prepared, and \nI am sure others will be prepared, to discuss and debate congressional \naction on misconduct cases in the past and other relevant issues.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10472-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10472-S10473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RESCISSIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had sought recognition prior to the \nvotes on the amendments offered by the Senator from Illinois, Senator \nCarol Moseley-Braun, and the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Paul \nWellstone, prior to those votes. But since all time had expired and \nthere was a tight timetable because other Senators wished to catch \nplanes, there was not an opportunity to speak, and I would like to make \na few brief comments at this time.\n  I opposed those amendments not because I would not have preferred to \nhave seen the additional funding in those important accounts, but \nbecause those issues had been resolved in a very extensive negotiation \nsession with the House of Representatives and further proceedings with \nthe White House.\n  When Senator Moseley-Braun made the statement, yes, we have to make \ncuts, that they have to be made fairly, I certainly agree with her \ntotally. The measure which came out of the subcommittee which I chair, \nthe Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, was \na vigorous, incisive, strenuous effort to make those cuts as fairly as \nwe could and to establish priorities.\n  When the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone and Senator Moseley-\nBraun included veterans job training, displaced workers job training, \neducation infrastructure, safe and drug free schools, education \ntechnology, Eisenhower professional development, job training \npartnership youth job training and the job training partnership adult \njob training, I would have wanted very much to have included those \nadditional sums. My voting record is plain on that subject.\n  In fact, when the House of Representatives sent over a rescissions \npackage of $5.9 billion, as a result of action taken by the Senate \nsubcommittee which I chair and then the full Senate in extended \nproceedings, that $5.9 billion in cuts was reduced by some $3 billion \nso that we did restore a tremendous amount of money.\n  When it comes to the question of LIHEAP, low-income heat and energy \nassistance, as Senator Wellstone noted--I was on the floor at the \ntime--he referred to the Senator from Pennsylvania as a champion of \nLIHEAP, which I thank him for and I think the record of the last 15 \nyears will support.\n  When the House of Representatives had sent over $5.9 billion in cuts \nand had zeroed out $1.319 billion, I made a fight of it. I started that \nfight and won it by reinserting $1 billion of those funds and seeing to \nit that we added an additional $300 million to the President's \nemergency fund. That means \n\n[[Page S10473]]\nthat we brought the amount practically to the full $1.319 billion. I \nwould have to say that was a total victory.\n  So when Senator Wellstone and Senator Moseley-Braun seek an amendment \nto add $319 million, I would like to see that extra funding. I have \nsaid on the Senate floor that when it comes to the poor and the \nelderly, that it is a matter of heating or eating. Those funds are \nreally very, very important. But we are going to have further \nnegotiations with the House of Representatives, and the House has \nalready indicated that they want to eliminate all funding for LIHEAP in \nthe future.\n  It was not easy for me to vote to table the amendment adding $319 \nmillion for LIHEAP funding, but I did so because we had already crafted \na hard-fought-out compromise which had, in effect, restored $1.3 \nbillion, leaving only $19 million short. I am going to have to go back \nand deal with the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education and try to work the matter out. So I am hardly \nin a position to support Senator Wellstone and Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  We are looking at a very, very difficult budget, Mr. President, as we \nall know. I am convinced that we need to balance the budget. We have a \n7-year glidepath to get that done. These votes are not easy to explain, \nand it is not difficult for other Senators, after seeing the work done, \nto come in and say, ``I'd like to add some more money here.'' We all \nwould. But it is simply not realistic to do.\n  The final budget, the final figure was worked out. After we looked at \nthe House figure of $5.9 billion in cuts, we reduced it very \nsubstantially in the subcommittee. The cuts were reduced further by an \namendment which was sponsored by the leadership, the Dole-Daschle \namendment, which the Senator from Minnesota voted for. Then the measure \nwas vetoed and came back, and then it was approved after difficult \nnegotiations with the White House. So that the net effect was, looking \nat the first cut of $5.9 billion, we reinstated $3 billion of those \nfunds.\n  On this date of the record, I think that it was just too much to come \nback and say let us add in more money for these projects and these \nprograms, important as they may be.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senate stands in morning business. \nThere is an order pending to go to the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak for 20 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10472-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10473-S10474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this week we received some additional news \nabout our trade deficit in the United States. This news, for almost \neveryone who reads about our trade deficit, provokes one giant yawn, a \nturn of the page, and we hear nothing about it.\n  In contrast, we have, since the first part of this year, been very \nworried about the Federal budget deficit. We have had hour after hour \nand day after day of debate about what to do with the budget deficit. \nThat is an enormously serious problem for this country. We must deal \nwith it.\n  In fact, an hour or so ago, we passed a rescissions bill, cutting \nsome $16 billion in Federal spending as a first step. It is not nearly \nenough, but it is a pretty good first step before we get to the \nreconciliation bill to address the Federal budget deficit.\n  It is interesting that there is almost a conspiracy of silence in \nthis country about the trade deficit. I wonder why? The trade deficit \nmust be and will be some day repaid with a lower standard of living in \nthe United States. That is a fact.\n  What is causing all of these problems with respect to trade? What \ndoes it result in for the American family? The circumstances, it seems \nto me, are these: We have in this country now record corporate profits. \nThey have never been higher. The largest corporations in this country \nare making the highest profits they have ever made in history.\n  Wall Street is having a big old party--and God bless them, I think \nthat is just wonderful. There are record highs on Wall Street. But \nwhile corporate profits reach new heights, and while the Wall Street \ncrowd celebrates record highs, the question is, What about the family \nthat sits down for dinner at home tonight and has to assess the \nfamily's economic circumstances?\n  The answer for the family is not record profits, and not new highs. \nThe answer for 60 percent of the American families, when they sit down \nfor dinner and talk about their circumstances, is that they are working \nharder and making less money. Mr. President, 60 percent of the American \nfamilies now have less income than they had 20 years ago, when adjusted \nfor inflation.\n  The other interesting thing is, in addition to the information \nproduced about the trade deficit each month, there is another piece of \ninformation that is produced about wages. It gets almost no attention. \nNearly every month, wages are falling. In other words, corporate \nprofits are going up, stock prices are going up, investors are doing \nwell. Wealth holders are celebrating, and folks out there working for a \nliving are working for less wages. Why is that the case, and how does \nit relate to our trade deficit?\n  They are all part of the same circle. Corporate profits are at a \nrecord high. I think that is fine in some respects, except that if it \ncomes at the expense of workers' incomes, there is a disconnection \nabout what is important in this country. We now have what is called a \nglobal economy. What that means is American corporations and \ninternational corporations, for that matter, are told that it is just \nfine to go find a place to produce where you can produce dirt cheap, \nand hire folks for $1 a day or a dime an hour, and sell that production \nback to Pittsburgh or Fargo or Denver or San Diego.\n  What we have are good manufacturing jobs moving out of this country \nat a wholesale pace, and those manufacturing jobs are now in Indonesia, \nin Malaysia, in China, and yes, even on the Maquiladora border of \nMexico, where two or three new plants every day are approved for \nmanufacturing products, many of which used to be manufactured in this \ncountry.\n  Corporations find, in some parts of the world, you can hire a 12-\nyear-old to work 12 hours a day for 12 cents an hour and produce a \nproduct that is shipped back to this country. It means we have lost \ngood jobs in this country that used to produce good income. That is the \ndisconnection.\n  It seems to me that we ought to measure success in our economic \nsystem in this country by how an economy produces a better standard of \nliving for all Americans--all Americans, not just corporate America, \nall Americans--especially those who work for a living.\n  We have folks who sit on the front porch and smoke pipes and watch \nthe grass grow. They hold bonds or stocks, they get dividends or \ninterest, and God bless them. Some of them earn millions every year \ndoing that. Some of them earn millions and pay almost nothing in taxes. \nBut the question is, What is the fortune of the person who does not \nhave stocks or bonds, but who works every day? What about someone who \nworks every day, makes a wage, and then finds that every month, their \nwages are eroding because profits are up but wages are down?\n  We need to change that kind of economic system. The sum total of \neverything we do in this Chamber ought to be to try to restore economic \nhealth to this country, sufficient so that every American family--every \nAmerican family--finds its standard of living improving.\n  Mr. President, 50 years after the Second World War, during the first \n25 years, virtually all American families found better circumstances, \nbetter opportunities, higher wages. The second 25 years, what have we \nseen? Trade deficits, with American corporations moving overseas, \nleaving this country, taking their jobs to other parts of the \n\n[[Page S10474]]\nworld, where they can produce cheap and sell here. What has that meant? \nIt has meant a choking trade deficit for America, and lower wages for \nAmerican workers. We ought not put up with it.\n  We fought for 50 years on the question of what is a livable wage. We \nhave minimum wages in this country. We have worker safety standards. We \nhave laws against child labor. You cannot hire 12-year-olds and pay 12 \ncents an hour and work them 12 hours a day. Those are successes in this \ncountry, that we have prohibited those kinds of things. Yet, all too \noften, we are choking on a trade deficit caused by producers who \nproduce in circumstances where they could not produce in this country, \nand then ship their product here.\n  What it is doing is drying up economic opportunities for American \ncitizens, and it ought to stop. We ought to say to every one of those \ncountries, China especially--we have a $30 billion trade deficit with \nChina--it is unthinkable we allow that to continue. We have a $65 \nbillion trade deficit with Japan. We cannot get American products into \nJapan in any significant quantity, but we are a sponge for Japanese \nproducts. We buy all this material from China and when they want to buy \nwheat, they are off price shopping in Canada someplace.\n  The fact is, this country ought to start standing up for its own \neconomic interests and start doing it soon. This trade policy is \ncompletely out of whack. It is hurting American families.\n  I am not suggesting isolationism or building walls around our \ncountry. But I am saying that America ought to stop getting kicked \naround with unfair trade practices. If our market is open to other \ncountries' products, then their markets ought to be open to ours. If we \nwill not allow the employment of 12-year-old kids at 12 cents an hour, \nwe ought not to allow products from countries that do, to come to the \nAmerican marketplace to undercut American jobs.\n  It is that simple. I have been on the floor almost weekly since the \nfirst of this year, and yearly in my time in Congress, to talk about \nthis. One day, one way, we will change these policies and start \nstanding up for the economic interests of this country--not just \ncorporate profits, but also wages for American families.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10473-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to another subject. I talked \nabout the fiscal policy, the budget deficit, when I began. It is a \nserious problem. I have voted for many ways to try to address the \nbudget deficit.\n  I headed a task force in the House on Government waste. I have worked \non a waste task force here in the Senate. I have cast dozens of votes \nto cut spending. I just voted for a rescissions bill to try to cut \nFederal spending.\n  I did not cast a vote for the proposal that eventually went down by \none vote here in the U.S. Senate on a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I did vote for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. We had two of them. One was the right one and one \nof them was the wrong one. The one that was the main proposal would \nhave taken $1.3 trillion in Social Security trust funds over many, many \nyears and used it to balance the budget. I happen to think that is \nthievery. I happen to think that is taking things under dishonest \npretenses, because it is taking money that comes from a paycheck and is \npromised to go into a Social Security trust fund to be saved for the \nfuture. Then they say, ``I know we say that, but we want to use that \nmoney instead to balance the budget.'' That is dishonest budgeting, and \nI would not vote for that.\n  But one element of dealing with the Federal budget deficit is an \nissue called the line-item veto. It, by itself, will not solve the \ndeficit problem, but it will help with respect to those spending \nproposals that have never been the subject of hearings are stuck in \nbills that come through here. So I support a line-item veto and I have, \nfor a dozen or 15 votes over the years, voted for a line-item veto.\n  One of the things I think is interesting about the line-item veto \nissue is this. The House of Representatives passed a line-item veto in \nFebruary. We in the Senate passed a line-item veto in March. It is now \nthe end of July and we have no line-item veto. Why? Because there has \nbeen no conference committee appointed to resolve the differences \nbetween the House and the Senate versions.\n  Why has there not been a conference appointed? The Contract With \nAmerica included the line-item veto as one of their major elements. I \nsupported it. I have always supported it. I think it makes sense.\n  But it is interesting to me that the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives has recently said that he does not think they are going \nto get around to the line-item veto this year. He wanted to talk about \na line-item veto, he wanted to push a line-item veto, so he had a vote \non a line-item veto in February. But he did not want a line-item veto \nto pass because he did not want a Democratic President to have a line-\nitem veto.\n  I supported line-item vetoes when a Republican was in the White House \nbecause I do not think it matters who is President. A Republican \nPresident should have had a line-item veto when the Congress was \nDemocratic and a Democratic President ought to have a line-item veto \nwhen the Congress is controlled by Republicans.\n  The other day I held up a little report from a newspaper that said, \n``Gingrich Gets $200 Million in New Pork,'' just as an example. The \nquestion is, are the people who talked about a line-item veto more \ninterested in producing pork or are they more interested in producing a \nline-item veto? I think the evidence is starting to suggest the former.\n  It is very simple for us to move on the line-item veto. If the \nSpeaker of the House is unable, at this point, to understand how one \ngets to a conference, I have some step-by-step instructions.\n  First, think of the names of some U.S. House Members. Probably some \nof your friends.\n  Second, pick a few. That is not rocket science. Think of some names \nof your friends; pick a few.\n  Third, send the list to the House floor for action.\n  Let us have a conference and bring a line-item veto back to the floor \nof the House and the Senate and get it voted on, get it to the \nPresident, so before these appropriations bills come down to the \nPresident this year and before the reconciliation bill is sent to the \nPresident this year, this President has a line-item veto. If we are \nserious about the Federal deficit, let us deal with the issue called \nthe line-item veto.\n  It is one thing to talk about it. It is another thing to do something \nabout it. I see that the Speaker has indicated that maybe he will not \nbe able to get to the line-item veto this year. The chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee said yesterday it looks like they are \nnot real anxious to move on that. It seems to me it is now time for us \nto ask the question: If you are serious about a line-item veto, this is \nthe time to bring a line-item veto to conference, to the Senate and the \nHouse, and make it law, give it to this President, and let us use that \nto seriously reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats have a stake in fiscal policy that \nadvances the economic interests of this country. That means reducing \nthe Federal deficit and no longer including projects that have not \npreviously been authorized in appropriations bills.\n  I support a line-item veto because it is the tool that is best \nequipped to stop that sort of practice, to save money, and reduce the \nFederal budget deficit.\n  I do hope in the coming days that we will discover that those who \nwere so interested in the line-item veto early in this year continue to \nretain an interest in giving this President the line-item veto this \nyear, the sooner the better.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 4 minutes remains.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10474-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10474-S10475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are nearing, now, the 30th anniversary \nof Medicare, in another week or so. Recently we have been discussing on \nthe floor of the Senate, at great length, a range of Government \npolicies that have been failures, and there are plenty. We have done a \nlot wrong and we need to \n\n[[Page S10475]]\nchange that and address that. It is funny that we do not discuss \nsuccess much. Success is not very sexy, not very interesting. Nobody \nwrites about it.\n  There is an old saying that bad news travels halfway around the world \nbefore good news gets its shoes on. That is the way life is. You are \nnot going to turn on a television program today and hear somebody say: \nDo you know what that Government did? That Government did this: In the \nlast 20 years, this country, the United States of America, uses twice \nas much energy as it used 20 years ago and it has cleaner air. Do you \nknow what that Government did? That Government put in place regulations \nthat said polluters cannot keep polluting. We are going to require the \nair in America to be cleaned up. And 20 years later we have cleaner air \nand less smog. Things are not perfect yet, but 25 years ago people were \ntalking about where we were headed and it was doom and gloom, an awful \nscenario, with degraded air and degraded water, a desperate situation. \nWe have cleaner rivers, cleaner streams, less acid rain, and cleaner \nair, 20 years later.\n  That is a success. Nobody is going to celebrate much success, but we \nhave done a lot of the right things. One of the things that we have \ndone that is an enormous success in this country, in my judgment, is \ncreate a Medicare system for America's elderly. We have decided that if \nyou get old, if you reach that age of retirement, we will give you some \nassurance that you are not going to suffer for lack of health care when \nyou are sick.\n  This health care system has worked for the elderly in this country in \na remarkable way, in a wonderful way. The fact is, a lot of people did \nnot like it. A substantial part of one party voted against it when it \nwas initiated. Some would say they are against everything for the first \ntime. Then later on they support it when they find it works.\n  But now we are in a situation where some say, ``Let us threaten the \nunderpinnings of Medicare because we do not like it, we never did like \nit, and we would like to privatize it.'' The fact is, the Medicare \nsystem works. We have folks here who bring priorities to the floor of \nthe Senate, who say, we do not have enough money for Medicare. We want \nto take Medicare apart and dismantle it. We are going to threaten the \nvery existence of Medicare. And we also, by the way, want to give a tax \ncut, the bulk of which goes to the richest Americans.\n  I brought charts to the floor to talk about the tax cut that has been \nproposed over in the House. We do not have numbers over in the Senate \nyet, but in the House it says if you are earning $30,000 or less, your \ntax cut is $112 a year. But if you have $200,000 or more in income, you \nget $11,000 a year in tax cuts. That is quite a deal, I suppose. If you \nare somebody who makes over a couple of hundred thousand dollars a \nyear, especially if you are somebody who does not get your money from \nwages--if you get your money from interest and dividends--you are \nreally doing well out of that plan.\n  But my point is, we say, at this point in our life as a country, that \nwe have an enormous Federal budget deficit and the way to address that \nis to give a big tax cut to the wealthiest Americans and then turn \naround, after we have given the tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, \nand say, by the way, we do not have enough money for Medicare. We do \nnot have enough money for what I think is an enormous, successful \nprogram in this country?\n  It does not make any sense to me. We have to be smart enough, it \nseems to me, to distinguish between what works and what does not, and \nkeep what works and strengthen and improve it, and get rid of what does \nnot. And we ought to take a look. We have been delaying clean air and \nclean water regulations and safe food regulations. Let us keep those \nthat work. And let us keep the Medicare system, and, yes, let us \nimprove it.\n  But let us not cut out the foundation from a program as important as \nthe Medicare Program has been to this country. Let us especially not do \nthat so we can give a big tax cut to the wealthiest Americans.\n  I live in North Dakota, in the northern Great Plains, the Old West. \nAnd we know about the wagon trains, because they crossed North Dakota \nnot so long ago. Wagon trains did not move unless all the wagons moved. \nThey did not make progress by leaving some behind.\n  The point with respect to the economic issues I have mentioned, \nincluding Medicare, is that at a time when corporations have record \nprofits, the highest in history, the stock market is reaching record \nhighs, and we see lower wages for American families. And then we hear \nthe suggestion that the rich need a tax cut and that we ought to \nundercut the pinnings of Medicare. It just does not make any sense.\n  We ought to try to get all of these wagons moving along. We ought to \ntry to get the standard of living for the average American family \nincreasing--not decreasing. We have to support the things that work. \nYes. Let us celebrate a little bit of success. And that is what I hope \nthis debate will be about in the coming days and months. There is no \ndebate about whether we should have regulatory reform. We have silly, \nfoolish regulations that in my judgment hinder the work of small \nbusinesses and others. Let us get rid of them. But let us not roll back \nimportant regulations with respect to safe food and clean air and clean \nwater.\n  Let us celebrate the success of programs that work and decide that \nthese programs are going to strengthen--not undercut. That is what I \nhope this debate will be about between Democrats and Republicans. There \nought not be such a great divide between the two parties in this \nChamber. We want the same things. We have different approaches for \ngetting there perhaps. But let us have a healthy, aggressive, robust \ndebate and decide to celebrate things that work and change those that \ndo not. Let us decide that we want a country whose economic system \nprovides opportunity for all, which lifts all Americans, so that when \nthey roll up their sleeves and want to improve their lives, they are \nable to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10474-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10475-S10476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE LOBBYING DISCLOSURE AND GIFT BAN BILL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just want to provide a very brief \nanalysis to people in our country about a very important reform bill \nthat is going to be coming to the floor on Monday, the lobbying \ndisclosure and gift ban legislation, S. 101.\n  Mr. President, we will start the debate, and actually each section of \nlobbying disclosure and gift ban will be taken up separately. There is \nno question in my mind, Mr. President, that people in our country yearn \nfor a political process that they believe in, and there is no question \nin my mind that people in our country--in Minnesota, Idaho, \nMassachusetts, all across the Nation--really want to see an open, \nhonest, accountable political process. There are several critical \ningredients to this, and two are certainly lobbying disclosure--Senator \nLevin has been an extremely capable legislator in taking the lead in \nthis area, with Senator Cohen--and also the gift ban. Senator Feingold, \nSenator Levin, Senator Lautenberg, and myself have all been very \nactive.\n  The reason I come to the floor is that there is a development people \nought to know about--an attempted substitute bill. This will be a \nMcConnell-Dole initiative. Mr. President, I think people need to know \nabout this initiative because I think it represents not a step forward \nbut a huge leap backward.\n  Mr. President, this substitute bill is full of enough loopholes for \nmany huge trucks to drive through. To give but just a few examples, \nlobbyists would be able to take you or me out to dinner one night, as \nlong as it is anything under $100; the next time, maybe we could be \ntaken to a Bullets game; the next time, we could go to an Orioles game; \nthe next time, we would just be given a gift. It goes on and on and on, \nand there is no aggregation limit.\n  Actually, it is not per day but per occasion. Lobbyists, three times \na day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but take us out as long as it is \nunder $100 or give us some other gift, as many times as this lobbyist \nwanted to. It never would be counted and never would be disclosed. This \nis not comprehensive, sweeping gift ban legislation.\n  Second, to give but another example, the whole issue of charitable \ntravel. I think it is important that Senators and Representatives, when \nthey care about a charity, travel to an event. We should be there to \nsupport it. But to \n\n[[Page S10476]]\nhave lobbyists pay for Members to be there with our spouses and with \nour families--and, by the way, playing golf and tennis at the same \ntime--is inappropriate.\n  We ought to be letting go of this. I do not understand why Senators, \nregardless of their party, do not understand that if we want people to \nbelieve in the political process, and we do not want to see bashing of \npublic service, we all believe in public service, we ought to let go of \nthis.\n  This Dole-McConnell initiative, again, has a huge loophole. Likewise, \nSenators can set up legal defense funds and lobbyists can make \ncontributions to those defense funds. That was prohibited in the \noriginal bill that we passed. Likewise, Senators can ask lobbyists to \nmake contributions to different foundations. That was prohibited. \nLikewise, Senators can set up contributions and have lobbyists \ncontribute money.\n  Mr. President, this is not reform. This is not a step forward. This \nis a step backward. This is an attempt to make an end run around \nreform. I just want people in the country to know about it. I do not \nunderstand what happened between last year and this year.\n  Last year, before the November election, the Senate voted 95-4 for \nthe gift ban legislation, virtually identical to S. 101. Mr. President, \n85 of those who voted for the measure have returned to the Senate. \nThree new Senators voted for a similar gift ban in the House. Now we \nsee this effort to essentially eviscerate--if that is the right word--\nreform through this, through this measure to be introduced as a \nsubstitute by Senator McConnell and Senator Dole which, quite frankly, \nis unconscionable. It passes no credibility test.\n  Mr. President, last October 5, the majority leader said, ``I support \ngift ban provisions. No lobbyist lunches, no entertainment, no travel, \nno contributions to legal defense funds, no fruit baskets, no \nnothing.''\n  What has happened? Mr. President, I just come to the floor because I \nwant people in the country to know about this. The debate starts \nMonday. I think, given this substitute that I gather is going to be \nlaid out sometime on the floor--no question but it will--there is going \nto be, I think, really a historic, very intense debate, because 99.9999 \npercent of the people want comprehensive gift ban reform. That is what \nI think many are determined to make happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nMinnesota, I say I am sure there will be a thorough debate once the \nfacts of the legislation are down and before the Senate. I think we all \nshare some similar goals.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10475-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10476-S10481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 641, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 641) to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act of \n     1990, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer to the Senate \nfor its consideration S. 641, the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act. \nThis bipartisan legislation, which cleared the Labor and Human \nResources Committee on a voice vote, is cosponsored by the ranking \nmember of the Labor and Human and Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy, \nand 63 other colleagues. The act reauthorizes critical health care \nprograms which provide services for individuals living with HIV and \nAIDS. Accordingly, I urge the Senate to move expeditiously to pass this \nreauthorization legislation.\n  Mr. President, if I will just describe what this legislation is all \nabout. The Ryan White CARE Act plays a critical role in improving the \nquality and availability of medical and support services for \nindividuals living with HIV disease and AIDS. As the HIV epidemic \ncontinues, the need for this important legislation remains.\n  Title I provides emergency relief grants to eligible metropolitan \nareas [EMA's] disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. Just \nover one-half of the title I funds are distributed by formula; the \nremaining amount is distributed competitively.\n  Title II provides grants to States and territories to improve the \nquality, availability, and organization of health care and support \nservices for individuals with HIV disease and their families.\n  Sometimes I think we do not think, when we are doing legislation such \nas this, about the stress that the families are under with such a \ntragic disease. This is why this initially came about, Mr. President, \nand this is why I think it does fill an enormously important niche.\n  The funds are used: to provide medical support services; to continue \ninsurance payments; to provide home care services; and to purchase \nmedications necessary for the care of these individuals. Funding for \ntitle II is distributed by formula.\n  Title III(b) supports early intervention services on an out-patient \nbasis--including counseling, testing, referrals, and clinical, \ndiagnostic, and other therapeutic services. This funding is distributed \nby competitive grants.\n  Finally, title IV provides grants for health care services and the \ncoordination of access to research for children and families.\n  This legislation also includes many important changes to take into \naccount the changing face of the HIV epidemic. When the CARE Act was \nfirst authorized in 1990, the epidemic was primarily a coastal urban \narea problem. Now it reaches the smallest and most rural areas of this \ncountry. In addition, minorities, women, and children are increasingly \naffected.\n  Chief among these improvements are changes in the funding formulas \nwhich are based on General Accounting Office [GAO] recommendations. The \npurpose of these changes is to assure a more equitable allocation of \nfunding. These formula changes would better allocate funding based on \nwhere people currently live with this illness, rather than where people \nwith AIDS lived in highest proportion in the past. In addition, the \nfunds are better targeted based on differences in health care delivery \ncosts in different areas of our country.\n  Based on a request from Senator Brown and myself, the GAO has \nidentified large disparities and inequities in the current distribution \nof CARE Act funding. This is due to: a caseload measure which is \ncumulative, the absence of any measure of differences in services \ncosts, and the counting of EMA cases by both the titles I and II \nformulas.\n  To correct these problems, the new equity formulas will include an \nestimate of living cases of AIDS and a cost-of-service component. The \nAIDS case estimate is calculated by applying a different weight to each \nyear of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention over the most recent 10 year period. The cost index uses the \naverage Medicare hospital wage index for the 3 year period immediately \npreceding the grant award.\n  In addition, the new title II formula includes an adjustment to \noffset the double-counting of individuals by states, when such States \nalso include title I cities.\n  Mr. President, with any formula change, there is always the concern \nabout the potential for disruption of services to individuals now \nreceiving them.\n  There is also a concern that someone will be getting more or someone \nwill be getting less than they had before.\n  To address this concern, the bill maintains hold-harmless floors \ndesigned to assure that no entity receives less than 92.5 percent of \nits 1995 allocation over the next 5 years.\n  This reauthorization legislation also establishes a single \nappropriation for title I and title II. The appropriation is divided \nbetween the two titles based on the ratio of fiscal year 1995 \nappropriations for each title. Sixty-four percent is designated for \ntitle I in fiscal year 1996. This is a significant change which should \nhelp unify the interests of grantees in assuring funding for all \nindividuals living with AIDS--regardless of whether these persons live \nin title I cities or in States. \n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\n  Because the face of the AIDS epidemic is changing so rapidly, the \nSecretary is authorized to develop and implement a method to adjust the \nratio of funding for title I and title II. This method should account \nfor new title I cities and other relevant factors. If the Secretary \ndoes not implement such a method, separate appropriations for titles I \nand II are authorized, beginning in fiscal year 1997.\n  In an effort to target resources to the areas in greatest need of \nassistance, the bill also limits the addition of new title I cities to \nthe program. The current designation criteria for title I cities was \ndeveloped to target emergency areas. Five years after the initial \nenactment of the Ryan White CARE Act, the epidemic persists. However, \nthe needs of potential title I cities are not the same as the original \ncities.\n  This is so because title II funding has been used to develop \ninfrastructure in many of these metropolitan areas. This decreases the \nrelative need for new cities to receive emergency title I funding.\n  The growth of new title I cities would be slowed beginning in fiscal \nyear 1998. At that time, current provisions which establish eligibility \nfor areas with a cumulative AIDS caseload in excess of 2,000 will be \nreplaced with provisions offering eligibility only when over 2,000 \ncases emerge within a five-year period.\n  I believe this change will truly allow us to target these limited \nresources to areas where the real emergencies exist. As I talked with \npublic health experts about this proposal, they indicated a rapid \ngrowth of AIDS cases over a five year period would truly stretch the \nlimits of their existing public health infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, the legislation makes a number of other important \nmodifications:\n  First, it moves the Special Projects of National Significance program \nto a new title V, funded by a 3 percent set-aside from each of the \nother four titles. In addition, it adds Native American communities to \nthe current list of entities eligible for projects of national \nsignificance.\n  Second, it creates a statewide coordination and planning process to \nimprove coordination of services, including services in title I cities \nand title II states.\n  Third, it extends the administrative expense caps for title I and II \nto subcontractors.\n  Fourth, it authorizes guidelines for a minimum state drug formulary.\n  Fifth, it modifies representation on the title I planning councils to \nreflect more accurately the demographics of the HIV epidemic in the \neligible area.\n  Sixth, for the title I supplemental grants, a priority is established \nfor eligible areas with the greatest prevalence of co-morbid \nconditions, such as tuberculosis, which indicate a more severe need.\n  I believe that the changes proposed by this legislation will assure \nthe continued effectiveness of the Ryan White CARE Act by maintaining \nits successful components and by strengthening its ability to meet \nemerging challenges. Putting together this legislation has involved the \ntime and commitment of a wide variety of individuals and organizations. \nI want to acknowledge all of their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to say that this is a controversial \nbill. It has been ever since it was approved and became law in 1990. I \nthink this is so largely because of the fear of AIDS, the concern about \nHIV, where it may strike next, and as I mentioned earlier, the changing \nface of this tragic disease, particularly when it strikes children. I \nthink we wonder how can this be.\n  We have in the past had infected blood transmitted by blood \ntransfusions. We are beginning to try to gain control over that so that \nthe frequency of that does not occur. But it becomes a ripple effect \nthat goes down through families.\n  It is a tragic disease, and it is one for which I think we all want \nto be able to help provide some support for a population that is viewed \nwith great uncertainty and great concern, and as I said, great fear. \nThat is why we always have a hard time with this legislation, Mr. \nPresident. We have a hard time making the case, even though there are \n63 cosponsors, that this is an important piece of legislation; it will \nhelp a large number of people.\n  I am particularly appreciative of the constructive and cooperative \napproach which the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, Senator Kennedy, has lent to the development of this \nlegislation. I also wish to thank the other 63 cosponsors of this bill \nfor assisting me in bringing this important legislation to the floor. I \nam not without an understanding of those who oppose this legislation \nand their concerns. These are about our limited resource dollars, our \nlimited support of those in need in the health care area, and the \nquestion of why we are targeting this money to this particular arena.\n  I hope that the Senate can act promptly and approve this measure.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me say at the outset how much I think \nall of us on this side of the aisle appreciate the leadership of \nSenator Kassebaum and her colleagues, our colleagues on the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee and in the Senate, in support of this \nlegislation, the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, at times of human suffering or great \nnational tragedies or epidemics, it has always been the leadership of \nthe Federal Government that has helped our fellow citizens deal with \ndifficulties. It is in that very important tradition that this \nlegislation was created and I urge the Senate to accept it today. This \nis critically important legislation. I am pleased that it is the first \nLabor Committee initiative to reach the full Senate.\n  For 15 years, America has been struggling with the devastating \neffects of AIDS. More than a million citizens are infected with the \nAIDS virus. AIDS itself has now become the leading killer of all young \nAmericans ages 25 to 44. AIDS is killing brothers and sisters, children \nand parents, friends and loved ones--all in the prime of their lives.\n  From the 10,000 children orphaned by AIDS in New York City alone, to \nthe 18-year-old gay man with HIV living in the Ozarks of Oklahoma, this \nepidemic knows no geographic boundaries and has no mercy.\n  Nearly 500,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Over half \nhave already died--and yet the epidemic marches on unabated.\n  The epidemic is a decade-and-a-half old--almost 40 percent of the \nAIDS cases in the country have been diagnosed in the last 2 years. One \nmore American gets the bad news every 6 minutes. And each day, we lose \nanother 100 fellow citizens to AIDS.\n  As the crisis continues year after year, it has become more and more \ndifficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else's problem. In a \nvery real way, we are all living with AIDS. There are few of us, even \nhere in the Senate, who do not know someone who is either infected with \nAIDS or directly touched by AIDS.\n  The epidemic has cost this Nation immeasurable talent and energy in \nyoung and promising lives struck down long before their time. And our \nresponse to this plague--and the challenges it presents--will surely \ndocument in the pages of history what we stood for as a society.\n  Five years ago, in the name of Ryan White and all the other Americans \nwho had lost their battle against AIDS, Congress passed and President \nBush signed into law the Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act. In \ndedicating this bill to the memory of Ryan White, the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee stated in its report:\n\n       Beginning at the age of 13, Ryan White valiantly fought not \n     only the AIDS virus, but also fear and discrimination based \n     on ignorance. With dignity, patience and unwavering good \n     cheer, Ryan White introduced America and the world to a face \n     of AIDS that caring human beings could not turn their back \n     upon. First through his courageous fight to go to school with \n     his peers, then through his tireless efforts to educate \n     others about the realities of his illness, young Ryan White \n     changed our world. By dedicating this legislation to Ryan, \n     the Labor Committee affirms its commitment to providing care \n     and compassion and understanding to people living with AIDS \n     everywhere. Ryan would have expected no less.\n  America can take satisfaction that--in these difficult times--\nsometimes we get it right. In the case of the CARE Act--I think we \nhave.\n  AIDS has imposed demands on our health care system that were totally \nunanticipated a decade ago. In 1980, no Federal, State, or local public \nhealth \n\n[[Page S10478]]\nagency could possibly have foreseen the introduction of a novel and \nlethal infectious disease into 20th century society. Yet without \nwarning, communities across this country were faced with an ever-\nexpanding epidemic--creating the need for essential health and support \nservices for hundreds of thousands of Americans who previously had \nlittle contact with the health care system.\n  In preparing to respond, the committee heard horror stories of people \nwith AIDS waiting 10 or 12 days in overflowing emergency rooms--only to \ndie before they were seen. I visited these hospitals and I talked with \nthese families. We held hearings across the Nation. We took testimony \nin an old school house in a southern rural town, where we heard from a \nperson with AIDS who traveled for many hours to reach an urban clinic--\nfor fear that if anyone in his home town knew his HIV status, he would \nbe banished, or killed. The human tragedy brought about by AIDS was \nstaggering, even unfathomable--and cried out for national relief.\n  In 1990, advocates, organizations, and frontline service providers \ngave us the sound advice that the development and operation of \ncommunity-based AIDS care networks could help shore up the Nation's \noverburdened health care delivery system, while improving the quality \nof life and efficiency of services for individuals and families with \nAIDS.\n  These principles were affirmed in recommendations made by two \nsuccessive commissions on AIDS--one appointed by President Reagan and \nchaired by Adm. James Watkins, the other created by Congress and \nchaired by Dr. June Osborn.\n  In a report to President Bush, the National Commission on AIDS \nstated:\n\n       Federal disaster relief is urgently needed to help states \n     and localities provide the HIV treatment, care, and support \n     services now in short supply. The Commission strongly \n     supports the efforts in Congress to address this need. The \n     resources simply must be provided now or we will pay dearly \n     later.\n\n  With broad bipartisan support, and 95 votes in the U.S. Senate, we \npassed the landmark Ryan White CARE Act. We joined together in the \ninterest of the Nation. We put people before politics. We took \nconstructive action that has made a world of difference.\n  The CARE Act contains a series of carefully crafted components that \ntogether form the strategy that has reduced inpatient hospitalization \nand emergency room visits--and allowed more than 300,000 Americans with \nHIV disease this year to live longer, healthier, and more productive \nlives.\n  Let me for a minute mention the various aspects of the program that \nform the CARE Act.\n  Title I provides emergency relief for cities hardest hit by AIDS.\n  Basically, we establish a threshold of 2,000 cases. Once the cities \nreach that threshold in terms of diagnosed AIDS cases, they will be \neligible for help and assistance. That is why a continued expansion of \nthe program is necessary, as more and more cities are reaching that \n2,000 level.\n  As more and more reach that 2,000 level and become eligible, we will \nneed additional resources to meet this growing need.\n  Title II provides funding for all 50 States to organize and operate \ncare consortia, to offer home care services and lifesaving \ntherapeutics, and to assist in the continuation of private insurance \ncoverage for those who would otherwise be bankrupted.\n  We have a funding stream targeted to the areas hardest hit by HIV. We \nalso have grants that go to all 50 States to permit the States to \ndevelop programs to meet their growing need. As Senator Kassebaum \npointed out, we are seeing an increasing incidence in many of the rural \nareas of this country.\n  The basic thrust of these programs is to develop humane and \ncompassionate ways to provide essential services to individuals and \nfamilies with HIV. This approach is also cost-effective and reduces \npressure on the health care systems in these seriously impacted \ncommunities.\n  Title III provides funding for community health centers and family \nplanning clinics to offer primary care and early intervention services \nto men, women, and children with HIV in underserved urban and rural \ncommunities which face an increasing demand for care.\n  Title IV links cutting-edge pediatric AIDS research with family \ncenter health and support services to meet the unique needs of \nchildren, youth, and families with HIV.\n  One of the great human tragedies is the number of babies born HIV \npositive, infants born into this world with HIV. We are providing help \nand assistance to those children as well.\n  There has been some enormously significant and important research \nthat has been done that has offered great hope and opportunity with \nearly intervention of freeing these infants from transmission by \nproviding their mothers with AZT during pregnancy and delivery.\n  There has been important progress made. It is the kind of research \nthat is also being done out of NIH in a coordinated way. We want to be \nable to be responsive to the needs of children, youth and families that \nhave been affected and infected. This is enormously important.\n  I had the opportunity to visit a center at Boston City Hospital. It \nwas really one of the most moving and tragic visits I have ever made. \nBut the people who are working with these infants, the volunteers that \ngo in there and give care and attention to these babies is one of the \nmost inspiring examples of selflessness. We want to try and at least \nmaintain, as title IV does, cutting edge pediatric research with family \ncenters in our country.\n  Title V provides funds for national demonstration projects targeted \nto HIV populations with special needs, including minorities, the \nhomeless, and Native Americans.\n  Together these titles function to put in place a strong national \nresponse with a proven track record of success. In a very real way, the \nCARE Act has saved both money and lives.\n  In Boston, the CARE Act has led to dramatically increased access to \nessential services. This year, because of Ryan White, 15,000 \nindividuals are receiving primary care, 8,000 are receiving dental \ncare, and 9,000 are receiving mental health services. An additional 700 \nare receiving case management services and nutrition supplements.\n  This assistance is reducing hospitalizations, and is making an \nextraordinary difference in people's lives.\n  In Newark, pediatric admissions at Children's Hospital decreased by \n33 percent and the length of stay has decreased by half because of the \ncoordinated family-based care offered through the act.\n  I think primarily San Francisco, which experimented with a variety of \nways of providing community based care, has been a model from which \nother cities have drawn and made a very important difference. San \nFrancisco has increased the quality of life of people living with HIV \nand also has diminished, in a very significant way, the financial cost \nof treatment.\n  In Denver, emergency room visits have been reduced by 90 percent and \nhospitalizations by 60 percent as a result of a home care program for \nthe uninsured paid for by the CARE Act.\n  In Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin; the State saved more than $1 \nmillion--or nearly $10,000 for each person with AIDS--by using CARE \ndollars to help individuals continue their private health insurance \ncoverage.\n  While much has changed since 1990, the brutality of the epidemic \nremains the same. When the Act first took effect, only 16 cities \nqualified for ``emergency relief''. In the past five years, that number \nhas more than tripled--and by next year it will have quadrupled.\n  This crisis is not limited to major urban centers. Caseloads are now \ngrowing in small towns and rural communities, along the coasts and in \nAmerica's heartland. From Weymouth to Wichita, no community will avoid \nthe epidemic's reach.\n  We are literally fighting for the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nour fellow citizens. These realities challenge us to move forward \ntogether in the best interest of all people living with HIV. And that \nis what Senator Kassebaum and I have attempted to do.\n  The compromise in this legislation acknowledges that the HIV epidemic \nhas expanded its reach. But we have not forgotten its roots. While new \nfaces and new places are affected, the epidemic rages on in the areas \nof the country hit hardest and longest.\n  The pain and suffering of individuals and families with HIV is real, \nwidespread, and growing. All community-\n\n[[Page S10479]]\nbased organizations, cities, and States need additional support from \nthe Federal Government to meet the needs of those they serve.\n  The revised formulas in this legislation will make these desperately \nneeded resources available based on the number of people living with \nHIV disease--and the cost of providing these essential services.\n  The new formula will increase the medical care and support services \navailable to individuals with HIV in many cities, including Boston, Los \nAngeles, Philadelphia, and Seattle, and in many States.\n  Equally important, the compromise will ensure the ongoing stability \nof the existing AIDS care system in areas of the country with the \ngreatest incidence of AIDS. The HIV epidemic in New York, San \nFrancisco, Miami, and Newark is far from over--and in many ways, the \nworst is yet to come.\n  This legislation represents a compromise, and like most compromises, \nit is not perfect and it will not please everyone. But on balance, it \nis a good bill--and its enactment will benefit all people living with \nHIV everywhere in the Nation.\n  We have sought common ground. We have listened to those on the \nfrontlines. And we have attempted to support their efforts, not tie \ntheir hands.\n  Congress must now once again put aside political, geographic, and \ninstitutional differences to face this important challenge squarely and \nsuccessfully. The structure of the CARE Act--affirmed in this \nreauthorization--and its well-documented effectiveness provide a sound \nand solid foundation on which to build that unity.\n  Hundreds of health, social service, labor, and religious \norganizations helped to shape the reauthorization's provisions. The \nreauthorization has been praised by Governors, mayors, county \nexecutives, and local and State AIDS directors and health officers. It \nhas required all levels of government to join together in providing \nservices and resources. And success stories of this coordination are \nnow plentiful.\n  Community-based AIDS service organizations and people living with HIV \nhave had critically important roles in the development and \nimplementation of humane and cost-effective service delivery networks \nresponsive to local needs.\n  Although the resources fall far short of meeting the growing need, \nthe Act is working. It has provided life-saving care and support for \nhundreds of thousands of individuals and families affected by HIV and \nAIDS. Through its unique structure, it has quickly and efficiently \ndirected assistance to those who need it most.\n  The Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act, however, is about more than \nFederal funds and health care services. It is also about the caring \nAmerican tradition of reaching out to people who are suffering and in \nneed of help. Ryan White would be proud of what has happened in his \nname. His example, and the hard work of so many others, are bringing \nhelp and hope to our American family with AIDS.\n  The CARE Act has been a model of bipartisan cooperation and effective \nFederal leadership. Today that tradition continues. Sixty-three \nSenators join Chairman Kassebaum and me in presenting this bill to the \nSenate. It has been unanimously reported by both the Labor and Human \nResources Committee in the Senate and the Commerce Committee in the \nHouse.\n  We must do more and do it better to provide care and support for \nthose trapped in the epidemic's path. And with this legislation, we \nwill.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank our chairperson, Senator Kassebaum, for \nher leadership and for working through a number of recommendations and \nchanges. There have been changes in the way the funding will be \ndistributed, and any time you engage in that, there will always be some \nwinners and some losers.\n  It is a compromise which I support. It took a good deal of time to \nwork this through, but I commend her for her diligence and for her \nability to bring us all together on to some common ground.\n  Finally, I think those individuals who are looking to this \nlegislation for some hope ought to find it as we go forward. It has \nbroad bipartisan support. We expect that, as the majority leader has \nindicated, we will pass this in the very near future --certainly in the \nperiod of time before the August recess. If you take the progress being \nmade in this area, the progress being made in the Office of AIDS \nresearch at the NIH, and the progress we have made with the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act in the not too recent past, I think what \nAmericans can take some satisfaction in is that we are trying to deal \nwith this issue as a public health issue. We are trying to deal with it \nin a humane fashion. We are putting aside, during this debate, ideology \nand rhetoric in dealing with the facts at hand. We should follow \nscientific, and medical judgements and reflect caring and compassionate \nleadership, which we are about when we are at our best.\n  So this is really a hopeful piece of legislation. It will make a \ndifference to tens of thousands of our fellow citizens. It is an area \nof important need. It is building on solid records of achievement and \naccomplishment. It reflects a number of the recommendations that have \nbeen made by Republicans and Democrats alike. It is a reflection of \nmany of our colleagues' good recommendations and suggestions. We are \nvery grateful to all of those that have been a part of this \nlegislation. I am very hopeful that the Senate will pass it in the very \nnear future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nRyan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency [CARE] Act \nreauthorization. This act that honors the memory of a teenager who \ntouched the lives of all Americans by bringing to the public's \nconsciousness the need to respond to people living with AIDS. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in keeping the ``care'' in the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  My home State of Maryland, and Baltimore in particular, has benefited \ngreatly from the services funded under the Ryan White CARE Act. Many \nMarylanders with AIDS would have gone without care or received \nsubstandard care if this law was not in existence. The CARE Act has \nprovided primary care services and specialized HIV/AIDS care \nspecifically for children, adolescents, women, men, and families \nthrough cost-effective community-based, family-centered comprehensive \nsystems. In Maryland alone, the number of reported AIDS cases has \nincreased every year since 1990 when the Ryan White CARE Act was first \npassed. In 1990, the number was 923, in 1992 it was 1,242, in 1993 it \nwas 2,483, and last year it was 2,810.\n  As we have seen in Maryland, the AIDS epidemic is far from over. The \ngreatest spread of the disease in Maryland has been in the Baltimore \nmetropolitan area. In Baltimore City alone in 1993. there was a 64.4 \npercent increase in the AIDS caseload. The number of AIDS cases in \nBaltimore has multiplied more than 21 times since 1985. Sixty-one \npercent of AIDS cases in Maryland are in Baltimore.\n  The Federal Government has always responded to national tragedies and \nepidemics with targeted assistance--AIDS is no different. We must make \nsure that the Ryan White CARE Act continues to provide community-based \ncare as well as new care and prevention programs. I believe this Act as \nreauthorized accomplishes this goal.\n  We cannot ignore the human element of this disease and the \nindividuals whose lives have been affected by it. We cannot forget \ntheir personal plights and how this law has affected their lives. We \nhave an opportunity today to do the right thing by reauthorizing this \nAct. We need to ensure that those affected by HIV and AIDS receive help \nin coping with the ravages of this dreaded disease.\n  AIDS is a disease that does not discriminate among children and \nadults, rich or poor, Democrats and Republicans. It affects everyone. \nNow is the time to come together in a bipartisan way to show Americans \nliving with AIDS and their families that their elected officials--their \nCongress--is standing firmly behind them in their time of need. Let's \nkeep the ``care'' in the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  \n[[Page S10480]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for quick \naction to approve the funding for the Ryan White CARE Act. The Ryan \nWhite CARE Act is an example of Government at its best. It is an \ninitiative that has worked well in spite of the unfortunate and tragic \ngrowth in the number of AIDS and HIV. This has been a difficult disease \nfor the country to deal with and an even greater challenge for the \nindividuals and families of individuals stricken with the disease.\n  When Ryan White was first enacted, about 128,000 Americans were \ndiagnosed with HIV. Now, unfortunately, there are more than 480,000 \ndiagnosed cases.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, and probably predictably so, AIDS is \none of those things that none of us like to talk about. It is a subject \nthat brings fear in the hearts of anyone who even raises the question. \nBut it is, I think, vitally important that we talk about it, and it is \nvitally important that we engage in debate about priorities and how we \ngo about responding to what is truly an American emergency.\n  AIDS is just such an emergency. HIV is just such an emergency. Ryan \nWhite has been there to respond in a comprehensive and sensible way to \nthat emergency. It is cost effective. It is working. It is responsive. \nAnd again, it represents the best of America.\n  Let me say at the outset that Ryan White funding plays a critical \nrole in ensuring that people with HIV and AIDS receive not just health \nservices but case management, home services, housing services, \ntransportation, and it is a comprehensive approach to dealing with the \nentire individual and the entire community.\n  The funding goes to State and local governments to deal with HIV-\ninfected populations within that community, as well as to provide \nsupport for community initiatives designed to try to provide the kinds \nof supports that will be responsive to the particular health needs of \nthat community.\n  One of the things that needs to be talked about during the health \ncare debate is the fact that here in America no one goes without health \nservices.\n  If you think about it, everyone gets services in one form or another. \nIf somebody falls out in the middle of the street or someone gets sick, \nsomewhere, somehow or another, they will get served. The question \nbecomes, how does it get paid for?\n  Unfortunately, our health care system is broken--we have the finest \nhealth care in the world, but in many ways it is a broken one. The fact \nis, the way the system works now, uncompensated care costs get shifted \nback and forth, and so in many instances, people who go to the hospital \nand pay private pay for health coverage, for health services, wind up \npaying $100 for aspirin, and that is just an apocryphal example. But \nthe reason aspirin costs $100 is because of uncompensated care provided \nto people in other points in the system.\n Hospitals have provided the care. They have to recover that cost in \nsome way and very often those costs get shifted to people who have \nprivate insurance and the like.\n\n  What Ryan White does, then, if you look at it in the scheme of \nthings, Ryan White says here is a particular population with particular \nhealth needs and a community need to have these health needs met. We \nare going to provide funding to State and local governments, to health \ncare institutions, to research institutions and the like, to try to \naddress this specific problem so these costs will not be shifted and \nthese costs will not be spread and we can be responsive in a \ncomprehensive way.\n  So Ryan White-funded health care services help not only keep people \nhealthy, and of course I know some of my colleagues have spoken to the \nhuman dynamic that is involved with Ryan White, but it also helps to \nprovide a way of providing health care services in a way that does not \ncall for this unaccountable kind of cost shifting that we might see in \nour health care system overall in the absence of Ryan White.\n  Mr. President, my State, Illinois, received in Federal funding for \nAIDS programs a total in 1994 of about $60 million. This is a lot of \nmoney. But certainly the fact is that the population is large and is \ngrowing and Ryan White has been responsive to a number of different \ninstitutions in the State of Illinois to provide for health care \nservices: Emergency funds for care services, funds to the State health \ndepartments for support and care services, funds to community-based \nclinics and migrant health clinics to provide outpatient early \nintervention and primary medical services, funds to support pediatric, \nadolescent, and family programs.\n  All of these are vitally important, particularly given the fact that \nthe AIDS population and HIV population is growing with regard to \npediatrics, with regards to the children--that population is expanding. \nI think we have every obligation to see to it that we respond to the \nhealth needs of the community and the health needs of the individuals \nwho are suffering with this dread disease in a way that is efficient. \nCertainly, Ryan White is that cost-effective, that efficient approach \nto health care funding for AIDS and HIV.\n  Finally, I would like to make a special appeal to my colleagues to \nlook at this program and not allow us to get into a tradeoff between \ndiseases, if you will. The fact is, we have a universal interest in \nseeing to it that the health care of America is something that we \nrespond to as a society, not just because it is good for the \nindividuals but because it is good for our society as a whole.\n  I do not think it can ever be argued that one disease versus another \ndisease should be competitive. Indeed, if anything, we have, I think, \nan obligation to provide people with quality health care and access to \nhealth care and the availability of funding for that health care in a \nsystem of health care that is responsive to our total population needs.\n  I understand this legislation has broad-based bipartisan support and \nso this is not a partisan issue. This is certainly not an issue that \nshould be controversial in any way. I hope there will not be any \ncontroversy.\n  I certainly want to applaud Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for \nworking through the issues surrounding this legislation. Senator \nKassebaum has been a leader in the health area for a long time and I \napplaud her for her efforts in this regard and applaud her for this \nlegislation, and I urge its quick passage by the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now \nconsidering S. 641, the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \nEmergency, CARE, Reauthorization Act of 1995. In 1990, Congress enacted \nthe Ryan White CARE Act, named in honor of the young hemophiliac who \ndevoted enormous energy educating Americans about the need for a \ncompassionate response to people living with AIDS.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act is the cornerstone of Federal funding for \nAIDS-specific care and has played a critical role in improving the \nquality and availability of medical and support services for \nindividuals with HIV and AIDS. Since its enactment, the CARE Act has \nprovided life-sustaining services to over 300,000 people with HIV/AIDS, \nincluding primary health care, prescription drugs, home health care and \nhospice care, dental care, drug abuse treatment, counseling, case \nmanagement, and assistance with housing and transportation.\n  I commend the sponsors of this legislation, Senators Nancy Kassebaum \nand Edward Kennedy, for their leadership on this issue of national \nimportance. S. 641 would amend the CARE Act and extend authorization of \nthe grant programs, which expire on September 30, 1995. As AIDS is the \nleading cause of death of young adults, we cannot let reauthorization \nof the CARE Act be delayed any longer nor diluted through negative \namendments. I am a cosponsor of this legislation and believe that it \nwill strengthen the CARE Act and enhance our ability to be responsive \nto the evolving nature of this epidemic. The measure, which enjoys \nbipartisan support, was favorably reported out of the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee by a unanimous vote on March 29, 1995.\n  The sponsors of this legislation recognize that the changing \ndemographics of the AIDS epidemic require a more \n\n[[Page S10481]]\nequitable distribution of funding in order to balance the needs of \npeople across this country living with HIV and AIDS. Accordingly, S. \n641 builds on the program's strengths and makes significant \nimprovements by modifying the funding formulas to reflect the changing \nnature of the AIDS epidemic. The legislation before us would assure a \nmore equitable allocation of funding as it restructures formulas based \non an estimation of the number of individuals currently living with \nAIDS and the costs of providing services\n  I urge my colleagues to support, without amendment, S. 641, the Ryan \nWhite Care Reauthorization Act of 1995.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii and \nprior to the Senator from Hawaii speaking, the Senator from Illinois, \nSenator Moseley-Braun, for their cosponsorship and assistance with this \nlegislation as we have been putting it together and as it is now ready \nto be considered by the full Senate.\n  I just wish to thank the Senator from Hawaii for his support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act.\n  Today, AIDS is the leading cause of death among Americans between the \nages of 25 to 44 years. Truly, a staggering statistic.\n  Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981 through June of 1994, the \nnumber of reported AIDS cases in Vermont is 213. Eighty-two of these \ncases were reported in the previous year alone. This represents an \nincrease of 242 percent over the reported total in 1991-92.\n  AIDS knows no gender, sexual orientation, age, or region of the \ncountry. AIDS is something that affects all of us.\n  Since its enactment in 1990, the Ryan White CARE has done so much to \nhelp provide health care and services to the growing number of people \nwith HIV/AIDS. I hope that we can work toward a speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10476-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10481-S10484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SUPPORT FOR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST LANDMINES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 16 I introduced S. 940, the \nLandmine Use Moratorium Act. My bill, which calls for a 1-year \nmoratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines, aims to exert U.S. \nleadership to address a problem that has become a global humanitarian \ncatastrophe, the maiming and killing of hundreds of thousands of \ninnocent civilians by landmines.\n  Landmines are tiny explosives that are concealed beneath the surface \nof the ground. There are 100 million of them in over 60 countries, each \none waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep. Millions more \nare manufactured and used each year. The Russians are scattering them \nby air in Chechnya. They are being used by both sides in Bosnia, where \n2 million mines threaten U.N. peacekeepers and humanitarian workers \nthere, as well as civilians.\n  In Angola there are 70,000 amputees, and another 10 million \nunexploded mines threatening the entire population. Mines continue to \nsow terror in dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and \nthe former Soviet Union.\n  Again, my bill calls for a 1-year moratorium on the use of \nantipersonnel mines. Not because the United States uses landmines \nagainst civilian populations the way they are routinely used elsewhere, \nbut because without U.S. leadership nothing significant will be done to \nstop it.\n  Like the landmine export moratorium that passed the Senate 100 to 0--\n2 years ago--and like the nuclear testing moratorium, my bill aims to \nspark international cooperation to stop this carnage. Time and time \nagain we have seen how U.S. leadership spurred other countries to act.\n  The Landmine Use Moratorium Act has 45 cosponsors--37 Democrats and 8 \nRepublicans. They are liberals and conservatives. They understand that \nwhatever military utility these indiscriminate, inhumane weapons have \nis far outweighed by the immense harm to innocent people they are \ncausing around the world.\n  Every 22 minutes of every day of every year, someone, usually a \ndefenseless civilian, often a child, is horribly mutilated or killed by \na landmine. It is time to stop this. My bill takes a first step.\n  Mr. President, in recent weeks, newspapers around the country have \npublished editorials and articles about the landmine scourge and the \nneed for leadership by Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several newspaper articles about the \nLandmine Use Moratorium Act from Maine, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and \nelsewhere, as well as several defense publications, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Gorton be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 940.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Defense News, July 10-16, 1995]\n\n                           Land-Mine Ban Woes\n\n       In 1994, about 100,000 land mines were removed from former \n     war zones at a cost of $70 million. At the same time, another \n     2 million mines were deployed elsewhere.\n       These and other sobering, frustrating statistics came out \n     of a three-day international conference in Geneva last week \n     on mine-clearing.\n       The daunting prospect of new mines being sown at a rate 20 \n     times faster than they can be removed is matched by the \n     apparently futile attempts to ban the sale and manufacture of \n     these inexpensive weapons.\n       There is some momentum to enact an international ban, with \n     25 nations adopting moratoriums on mine exports and three--\n     Mexico, Sweden and Belgium--calling for comprehensive bans on \n     their sale and manufacture. But in Geneva, it was concluded \n     that banning land mines must be a long-term goal.\n       Despite the clear evidence that these weapons often can \n     serve as everlasting and deadly vestiges of wars long \n     resolved, some countries demand the right to keep them in \n     their inventories.\n       The nations that want to have land mines in their \n     inventories typically are not the same 64 countries where \n     collectively 100 million land mines kill or maim 500 persons \n     each week. If they were, perhaps a comprehensive ban would \n     not be so elusive.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Bury Mine Violence\n\n       While international support is growing for a comprehensive \n     ban on the sale and manufacture of antipersonnel mines, \n     Western leaders must speak with one voice in demanding \n     stronger curbs on these weapons that kill about 70 people \n     each day.\n       Following the U.S. lead, 18 countries have declared \n     moratoriums on the export of antipersonnel land mines and a \n     U.N. conference beginning in September in Vienna will examine \n     how and where antipersonnel land mines may be used.\n       Despite these and other promising signs, a worldwide ban on \n     these mines that kill or maim 26,000 people each year remains \n     an unlikely outcome of the U.N. meeting.\n       Even the European Parliament, which is hoping to influence \n     the U.N. decision by soon adopting its own resolution calling \n     for an antipersonnel mine ban, may have trouble achieving \n     consensus.\n       While Belgium, for instance, banned all production, sale \n     and export of antipersonnel mines last month, officials from \n     other countries, such as Finland, insist that antipersonnel \n     mines are a vital asset in national defense.\n       Because of these widely divergent views, a strong European \n     Parliament resolution renouncing antipersonnel mines may be \n     an elusive goal.\n       Even the United States, which had been a leader in the \n     drive to rid the world of antipersonnel land mines, is \n     falling off the pace. Despite a landmark speech by U.S. \n     President Bill Clinton to the U.N. General Assembly in \n     September in which he stressed the elimination of \n     antipersonnel land mines, the government would allow the sale \n     of certain high-tech antipersonnel land mines if the \n     congressionally imposed export ban that ends in 1996 is not \n     extended.\n       The U.S. military wants to keep high-tech antipersonnel \n     mines that are self-deactivating. And a multilateral mine \n     control regime being touted by U.S. officials concentrates on \n     eliminating long-lived antipersonnel mines that do not self-\n     destruct or self-deactivate.\n       While the newer high-tech mines offer great improvements \n     over many of their predecessors, they nonetheless are \n     dangerous \n\n[[Page S10482]]\n     weapons that should be included in a global ban.\n       Antitank mines, however, are vital weapons in the modern \n     battlefield and do not cause the civilian casualties that \n     antipersonnel mines do.\n       As Sen. Patrick Leahy and Rep. Lane Evans said in a letter \n     to Mr. Clinton after his September speech, ``* * * land mines \n     undoubtedly have some military use, that must be weighed \n     against their advantage as a force multiplier for potential \n     enemies in countries like Somalia or Iraq, where our troops \n     increasingly are being sent.''\n       But soldiers are not the most frequent victims of these \n     mines. Civilians, often children, are.\n       More mines are being scattered each day in places like \n     Chechnya and the former Yugoslavia. The global landscape \n     already is littered with 85 million to 100 million unexploded \n     antipersonnel mines.\n       Western leaders must act now to ensure more of these mines \n     are not sown and that programs are put in place to verify \n     compliance to the ban.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    [From Navy Times, July 24, 1995]\n\n                Sanity May Take Root in Land Mine Debate\n\n                         (By George C. Wilson)\n\n       Far too many of us still see the hurt and disbelief in the \n     eyes of someone who has just been hit by a land mine. The \n     eyes that still bore into my mind are those of a little \n     Vietnamese girl who set off a mine while washing clothes on \n     the bank of the Perfume River in Hue in 1990--a full 15 years \n     after the war was supposed to be over for her and everyone \n     else.\n       The girl lay in a hospital bed in Hue with bandages over \n     most of her body. Her mother was attending her because of the \n     shortage of nurses. The mother looked up from her bedside \n     chair and asked me through a translator why the ``booms'' \n     were still going off. Her daughter just stared at me in \n     searing silence.\n       I had no answer then, but have something hopeful to say \n     now. The U.S. Senate, perhaps this week but certainly this \n     summer, will confront the scourge that maims or kills \n     somebody in the world every 22 minutes. As many as half of \n     the victims are children like the one I saw in Hue.\n       Soldiers know how to detect and disarm mines. Children \n     don't. Sowing mines is like poisoning village wells: The \n     soldiers on both sides realize the danger, drink from their \n     canteens and move on. Not so with the villagers.\n       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and more than 40 Senate co-\n     sponsors have drafted legislation that would declare a one-\n     year moratorium on sowing mines on battlefields, starting \n     three years from now. Claymore mines, which infantrymen \n     spread around their positions at night and use in ambushes, \n     would be excluded from the experimental, one-year ban. So \n     would anti-tank mines. Also, international borders, like the \n     demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, could still \n     be sown with mines.\n       The Leahy proposal is but a short step toward the goal of \n     inspiring an international agreement to ban land mines the \n     way the nations managed to ban the use of poison gas and dum-\n     dum bullets. But it is a symbolic step. It will at least \n     force the Congress, the military and the public to confront \n     this uncontrolled sowing of poison seeds.\n       In the Senate, Leahy plans to tack the moratorium \n     legislation onto another bill on the floor, perhaps the \n     defense authorization bill.\n       In the House, Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a Marine grunt from \n     1969 to 1971, is pushing a similar measure but has not \n     decided when to push for a vote. The hawkier House--which \n     seems determined to give the military almost anything it \n     wants--almost certainly will reject the amendment until the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff say they favor it.\n       This hasn't happened despite expert testimony that it would \n     do the U.S. military more good than harm if land mines were \n     banned. No less a soldier than Gen. Alfred Gray Jr., former \n     Marine Corps commandant, has said:\n       ``We kill more Americans with our mines than we do anybody \n     else. We never killed many enemy with mines . . . What the \n     hell is the use of sowing all this [airborne scatterable \n     mines] if you're going to move through it next week or next \n     month . . . I'm not aware of any operational advantage from \n     broad deployment of mines.''\n       Leahy warns that ``vast areas of many countries have become \n     deathtraps'' because 62 countries have sown between 80 \n     million and 110 million land mines on their land. ``Every day \n     70 people are maimed or killed by land mines. Most of them \n     are not combatants. They are civilians going about their \n     daily lives.''\n       Yet mines are so cheap--costing as little as $2--that small \n     armies all over the world are turning to them as the poor \n     man's equalizer. American forces increasingly are being sent \n     to these developing areas and would be safer if land mines \n     were banned.\n       ``The $2 or $3 anti-personnel mine hidden under a layer of \n     sand or dust can blow the leg off the best-trained, best-\n     equipped American soldier,'' Leahy notes.\n       At the United Nations last year, President Clinton called \n     on the world to stop using land mines. He could weigh in \n     heavily on the side of the one-year moratorium and push the \n     chiefs in that direction. But don't count on it. He seems \n     determined during his re-election drive not to offend the \n     military and its conservative champions.\n       Belgium and Norway this year forbade the production, export \n     or use of land mines. Leahy and Evans hope the upcoming \n     debate will create a climate for a similar stand by the \n     United States. Lest you conclude the land mine moratorium is \n     being pushed by peacenik lawmakers, note that among the \n     senators supporting it are decorated war veterans Daniel K. \n     Inouye, D-Hawaii, J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., John F. Kerry, D-\n     Mass., and Charles S. Robb, D-Va.\n       The case for the Leahy-Evans moratorium is overwhelming. \n     Even so, Congress probably will lose its nerve and refuse to \n     enact the moratorium this year. But I think I could tell that \n     little girl in Hue, if she lived through her maiming, that \n     reason is beginning to assert itself. Man is beginning to see \n     the folly of fouling his own nest with mines. There is at \n     least a dim light at the end of the tunnel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 9, 1995]\n\n                          Killers in the Earth\n\n                   (By Anne Goldfeld and Holly Myers)\n\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Rep. Lane Evans of \n     Illinois have just introduced a bill to establish a year-long \n     moratorium on the use of land mines. This legislation is a \n     critical step toward the goal of an eventual international \n     ban on the production, stockpiling, trade and use of these \n     weapons. Passage of this amendment is a humanitarian \n     imperative as, day by day, the public health and \n     environmental crises of land mines spin out of control.\n       At as little as $3 apiece, land mines have become the \n     cheapest choice weapon in the civil war conflicts that plague \n     our planet. In the former Yugoslavia alone, as many as 5 \n     million land mines have been dug into the earth since the \n     outbreak of fighting. In Rwanda, tens of thousands of mines \n     newly laid in the last year will target the poorest in \n     society--the children and women who must collect firewood or \n     fetch water for survival. As elsewhere, women and children \n     make up 30 percent of land mine victims, and because of their \n     small size, children rarely survive a blast. Tragically, \n     children too frequently perceive land mines to be brightly \n     colored toys.\n       Land mines are an epidemic more deadly than the Ebola \n     virus, killing or maiming at least 26,000 people a year, 90 \n     percent of whom are noncombatant civilians. However, unlike \n     Ebola, this scourge has spread to nearly every continent on \n     the globe: 10 million land mines in Afghanistan (where the \n     technique of scattering mines from the air was perfected), 10 \n     million mines in Angola, 130,000 mines in Nicaragua, 4 \n     million mines in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n       Mines were laid in the recent Peru-Ecuador border dispute, \n     and new mines are being laid with a ferocity in current hot \n     spots such as Chechnya and Bosnia. The cost of clearing a \n     single mine ranges between $300 and $1,000 and requires a \n     brave man or woman to work on hands and knees, meticulously \n     removing one mine at a time.\n       In Cambodia, a country of 8 million people, there are an \n     estimated 8 million land mines. Twenty percent of the land in \n     the country's fertile northwest provinces is now not \n     cultivable because of mines. Approximately one out of every \n     200 people is an amputee, the highest percentage in the \n     world; in the United States the comparable ratio of amputees \n     to the general population is one out of 22,000. At the \n     current rate of clearance, Cambodia will not be free of mines \n     for 300 years.\n       According to the U.S. State Department, there are an \n     estimated 100 million land mines in the earth today and at \n     least another 100 million stockpiled in arsenals. Like Ebola \n     between outbreaks, they remain hidden and await their victims \n     patiently for decades. With each passing day, they turn once-\n     fertile fields into abandoned wastelands and destroy lives, \n     limbs and futures.\n       There is no possible military objective or argument that \n     can justify the human toll and the pollution of the earth \n     exacted by the continued use of land mines.\n       Land mines, ``weapons of mass destruction in slow motion,'' \n     have claimed more victims than nuclear, chemical and \n     biological weapons together. The indiscriminate chemical and \n     biological weapons systems are now banned, and land mines \n     must also be banned. President Clinton, at the 50th \n     anniversary of the United Nations, proposed that the \n     elimination of land mines be a common goal of member nations. \n     Let's put this theoretical position into action. Active \n     support of the Leahy-Evans bill represents a crucial start.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, May 23, 1995]\n\n                        Fields That Keep Killing\n\n       Numbers can be cold abstractions.

Twenty-six thousand is the \n     number of people who were killed or maimed in the past year \n     by land mines. Seventy is the figure for those who are blown \n     apart each day. Sixty-two is the number of countries where \n     land mines, weapons of mass destruction that kill in slow \n     motion, have \n\n[[Page S10483]]\n     been sown in the soil. Three dollars is the cost for a land mine, the \n     cheapest terror weapon of all.\n       The ethical imperative to eliminate land mines is clear. \n     Mines do not discriminate between civilians and combatants. \n     They go on murdering and mutilating innocent victims \n     indefinitely. There are still areas of the Netherlands and \n     Denmark that are off-limits because of unexploded mines from \n     World War II. In countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, \n     Angola or Iraq, the diffusion of mines has created permanent \n     killing fields. And Russian planes are currently strewing \n     mines in Chechnya.\n       To help end the commerce in land mines, Sen. Patrick Leahy \n     of Vermont is planning to introduce a bill to ban U.S. use of \n     antipersonnel land mines except ``in marked and guarded \n     minefields along internationally recognized national \n     borders.'' To discourage the proliferation of mines, the \n     United States would end all transfers of military equipment \n     to ``any country which the President determines sells, \n     exports or transfers antipersonnel land mines.'' The bill \n     would also authorize $20 million to clear and disarm existing \n     land mines.\n       Leahy's bill is necessary because the Pentagon has \n     prevailed on President Clinton to keep using mines that self-\n     destruct after a few months or years. That would be a license \n     to prolong mass murder. Leahy has proposed a wise and humane \n     measure that deserves support.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From New York Newsday, June 28, 1995]\n\n                       Newlyweds, Killed in Blast\n\n                          (By Michele Salcedo)\n\n       They were newlyweds, celebrating their nine-day-old \n     marriage with a dream honeymoon at a Red Sea resort in Egypt.\n       But on Monday the lives of U.S. Army Maj.

After the \n     '92 moratorium was passed, two dozen other countries enacted \n     similar measures.\n       By rough count, there are 1 million land mines currently \n     sown into the earth, awaiting either the costly process of \n     removal (Kuwait has spent $800 million doing this since the \n     end of the Gulf War) or the costlier detonation by an \n     unwilling passerby. Land mines do not know when a war has \n     ended or whether a victim is a soldier or civilian. Their \n     placement in fields once used for planting has the doubly \n     vicious result of causing widespread injury among civilians \n     while discouraging other refugees from returning to their \n     farm lands.\n       Land mines are designed to maim instead of kill. They cause \n     disabling injuries, inflict pain and terror among those \n     unfortunate enough in the minelaced regions of Cambodia, \n     Afghanistan, Angola, and a dozen other places. Approximately \n     26,000 people are killed or injured by land mines each year. \n     Once used as a defensive weapon, militaries have found these \n     cheap devices ideal for offensive purposes, as well. Their \n     drain on scarce medical resources means that others suffering \n     from disease or malnutrition will die from want of treatment.\n       President Bill Clinton has endorsed the idea of eventual \n     elimination of antipersonnel land mines, but unfortunately \n     also wants to allow a U.S. firm to export a higher-tech \n     version of the weapon, known as a self-destructing land mine. \n     In theory, these land mines either blow up or become inactive \n     after a given time. But allowing one type of land mine opens \n     a loophole for several types, and makes enforcement of a ban \n     on the rest nearly impossible.\n       As the world's largest arms exporter, the United States has \n     the special problem of facing potentially hostile countries \n     supplied with U.S.-produced weapons. The land-mine moratorium \n     is an important step toward reducing that eventuality and \n     increasing world safety. Maine's senators should support the \n     Leahy bill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Patriot-News, July 19, 1995]\n\n                    Ease the Threat From Land Mines\n\n       The numbers are staggering, so enormous that no one can say \n     with precision just how many unexploded land mines litter the \n     planet.\n       In a speech to the United Nations last September, President \n     Clinton cited the figure 85 \n\n[[Page S10484]]\n     million. More recently, the State Department has put the number at 100 \n     million, or one for every 50 people in the world.\n       What is known is that on average about 500 people are \n     killed or maimed each week--26,000 every year--by land mines. \n     Huge swaths of ground have been rendered uninhabitable by the \n     sowing of mine fields, from Kuwait to Angola. One of every \n     236 people in Cambodia is an amputee as a result of mine \n     blasts. Around the world, wherever land mines lie in wait for \n     the unsuspecting or careless, prominent among their victims \n     are children.\n       But there is an effort under way to do something about this \n     madness. A one-year moratorium on the sale, export and \n     transfer of land Mines was adopted by the United States in \n     1992, followed the next year by unanimous Senate passage of a \n     three-year extension. The moratorium effort has since been \n     joined by 25 other countries.\n       Late next week, the Senate is expected to vote on The 1995 \n     Land Mine Use Moratorium Act, which:\n       Urges the president to pursue an international agreement \n     for the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land mines.\n       Imposes a one-year moratorium on U.S. use of land mines, \n     except in certain marked areas along international borders.\n       Encourages additional countries to join the moratorium.\n       The legislation is sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., \n     with 44 co-sponsors representing both parties. Absent from \n     the sponsors list for this wise legislation, which has the \n     active support of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and \n     more than 200 other human rights organizations are the names \n     of Pennsylvania's senators, Arlen Specter and Rick Santorum.\n       We urge our two Republican senators to join the effort to \n     end this indiscriminate means of warfare, just as the nations \n     of the world have previously agreed to end the use of \n     biological and chemical weapons. America's leadership and \n     example is no less essential to making this a safer and more \n     peaceful world than it was in winning the Cold War.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, July 6, 1995]\n\n                             Ban Land Mines\n\n       The world is slowly waking to the indiscriminate carnage \n     that results from the use of a cheap, easily dispersed and \n     deadly weapon--the land mine.\n       The question is whether the United States will exercise the \n     leadership required to move the international community \n     toward a total ban of a weapon that kills and maims 26,000 \n     people a year.\n       There are about 100 million land mines already in place on \n     killing fields around the globe. They create terror on the \n     cheap. They cost between $3 and $20 to make, and 80 percent \n     of those killed are children. Long after the battlefields are \n     quiet in Cambodia, Angola, Lebanon and Vietnam, the killing \n     goes on.\n       Land mines are the weapons of cowards. The Soviet Union \n     spread them by the millions in Afghanistan; some were \n     specifically designed to entice children into picking them \n     up. Now Russia is spreading them in Chechnya.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy has played a leading role in prodding \n     the Clinton administration and the international community to \n     bring this hideous technology under control. Legislation \n     introduced by Leahy two years ago led to a moratorium by the \n     United States on the manufacture and sale of land mines and \n     prompted 25 other nations to follow suit. Leahy also \n     introduced a resolution before the U.N. General Assembly on \n     behalf of the United States calling for the ``eventual \n     elimination'' of land mines.\n       Now the Clinton administration is backtracking.\n       Leahy has introduced a bill that would prohibit the United \n     States from using land mines, except in certain specifically \n     designated border areas, and to impose sanctions on nations \n     who use them. He hopes the United States will lead by \n     example, as it did on the manufacturing moratorium, so other \n     nations also disavow use of land mines.\n       The U.S. military, however, is wary of establishing a \n     precedent. Even though land mines are primarily an instrument \n     of terror aimed at innocent civilians, the Army does not like \n     to have its options limited. Certainly, land mines are not \n     the most important weapon in the U.S. arsenal, but the \n     military does not want Congress to get in the habit of \n     indulging its humanitarian impulses by limiting the weapons \n     the Army can use.\n       Thus, Clinton has found a way to equivocate.\n       Though the United States introduced the U.N. resolution \n     favoring the elimination of land mines, Clinton now favors \n     the export and use of self-destructing land mines that would \n     detonate by themselves over time.\n       Here Clinton indulges in fantasy. Does he really believe \n     the dozens of nations with tens of millions of land mines in \n     their possession will decide they would rather buy more \n     expensive self-destructing mines and use them instead? In \n     this way, Clinton undermines the international effort to \n     eliminate the use of this weapon.\n       Just four years ago there were only two organizations \n     raising the alarm about land mines. One was the Vietnam \n     Veterans of America Foundation whose land mine campaign is \n     led by Jody Williams of Brattleboro. She had seen what land \n     mines do in Nicaragua and El Salvador.\n       Now there are 350 organizations in 20 countries pushing to \n     eliminate the use of land mines. Pope John Paul II, former \n     President Jimmy Carter, Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu of South \n     Africa, and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali all \n     support a ban. And yet Clinton backs away.\n       Leahy's bill would put the U.S. once again at the vanguard \n     of the effort to eliminate what Leahy has called ``weapons of \n     mass destruction in slow motion.''\n       Leahy's bill has 44 co-sponsors, including Sen. James \n     Jeffords, but he has still not been assured the bill will \n     come to a vote. It ought to come to a vote, and despite \n     Clinton's equivocation, Congress ought to send the message \n     that the United States will lead the way in containing the \n     violence war causes among the world's innocent bystanders.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in my ongoing effort to see a worldwide ban \non the use of antipersonnel landmines, it is interesting to note that \nsince starting this effort 25 countries have taken at least the initial \nstep by halting all or most of their exports of antipersonnel mines. \nThat was due in large part to the action we took here 2 years ago, by \npassing my amendment to stop U.S. exports of these weapons. Our action \ncaptured the attention of the world, and that is why it is important \nthat we continue to show leadership to bring an end to the landmine \nscourge.\n  I remind my colleagues that today in over 60 countries there are 100 \nmillion antipersonnel landmines that wait silently to explode. These \nare 100 million not in warehouses but concealed in the ground. In many \ncountries they are clearing the landmines an arm and a leg and a life \nat a time.\n  Today when wars end, soldiers leave and tanks and artillery and guns \nare withdrawn, in so many countries the killing continues, sometimes \nfor months, sometimes long past when people can remember what caused \nthe fighting in the first place. It continues because of the landmines \nleft behind.\n  We are about to make a major decision in Bosnia. The distinguished \nSenator from Kansas and I spent most of an afternoon with the President \nof the United States, with the Secretary of State, Secretary of \nDefense, our Ambassador to the United Nations, and General \nShalikashvili discussing what alternatives are available to us.\n  It was a very good discussion, I think a very important discussion. I \ncommend the President for having it. I could not help think throughout \nno matter who is in Bosnia, whether us, for whatever reason, our \nallies, whether now or when the fighting stops, they are going to find \na very, very grim surprise; that is, hundreds of thousands, perhaps \nover a million landmines that are now in the former Yugoslavia, and \nthey will keep on killing long after this dreadful fighting stops.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10481-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              THE INTERNET\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been a lot said about Internet, \nand about proposals to regulate indecent or obscene content in the \nInternet. There has been a lot of articles about so-called cyberporn \nand things of that nature.\n  I have had some interest in the way the legislation is proceeding. I \nbelieve I was probably the first Senator to actively hold town meetings \non the Internet. I have it in my own home, as many do now, and use it \ncontinuously, when I am here in my office in Washington, in my office \nin Vermont, in my home in Vermont, and in the residence here.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10484-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10484-S10486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  REPORT OF INTERACTIVE WORKING GROUP ON PARENTAL EMPOWERMENT, CHILD \n            PROTECTION AND FREE SPEECH IN INTERACTIVE MEDIA\n\n  In light of concerns and legislative proposals to regulate indecent \nand obscene content on the Internet, I have asked the Attorney General \nof the United States as well as a coalition of private and public \ninterest groups known as the Interactive Working Group to look at this \nissue and provide recommendations on addressing the problem of \nchildren's access to objectionable online material, but to do so in a \nconstitutional and effective manner.\n  I have not yet heard back from the Attorney General and look forward \nto receiving the report of the Department of Justice as promptly as \ntheir study can be concluded.\n  I come to the Senate today to speak about the report from the \nInteractive Working Group that will be released Monday. This group \nincludes online service providers, content providers, \n\n[[Page S10485]]\nand public interest organizations dedicated to the interactive \ncommunications media. I would recommend the report to my colleagues.\n  In its report, the Interactive Working Group describes some of the \ntechnology available, not in the future but today, to help parents \nsupervise their children's activities on the Internet and protect them \nfrom objectionable online material. In fact, available blocking \ntechnology can make pornographic Usenet news groups or World Wide Web \nsites off limits to children.\n  I mention this because we seem to be carried away with the idea that \nsomehow we will set up a Federal standard that will treat everybody \nexactly the same, whether adult or child, in setting up gateways on the \nInternet--without accepting the fact that maybe parents have a certain \nresponsibility to raise their children. The responsibility parents have \nis greater than the Senate or the House of Representatives has, and as \na parent, I would readily take on that responsibility rather than to \nhave the Congress tell me what to do.\n  There are other commercially available products that limit children's \naccess to chat rooms, where they might be solicited. They limit \nchildren's ability to receive pornographic pictures through electronic \nmail.\n  Other products allow parents to monitor their children's usage of the \nInternet. You can find out exactly where they have been and what they \nmight have been reading. This is significantly different from other \nsettings where parents may have no idea what magazines or books their \nchildren read--but you can find out on the Internet.\n  Yet some would close down the Internet to prevent the possibility of \nan infraction. What I am saying is that parents ought to take some \nresponsibility themselves.\n  Software entrepreneurs and the vibrant forces of the free market are \nproviding tools that can empower parents' to restrict their children's \naccess to offensive material. Parents can restrict access to whatever \nthey considered objectionable: whether it is beer advertising, or \nfantastic card games that some parents believe promotes interest in the \noccult. Interested organizations, like the Christian Coalition or \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, could provide parents that use blocking \ntechnology with lists of sites these groups consider inappropriate for \nchildren.\n  This is not a case where we in Congress, playing big brother or big \nsister, need to determine what parents should tell their children to \nwatch or read.\n  If you set up Government regulations, the kind of heavy-handed \nregulations that we seem intent upon passing, then you will stifle this \nnew industry. If you have overly restrictive bans on the Internet, they \nwill prove not only unconstitutional, but they are going to hamper the \ngrowth of this new communications medium, one that has grown faster \nthan anything else I have seen in my lifetime. The Internet has been \ngrowing at an exponential rate and new uses for it are devised daily.\n  Anyone with a computer and a modem can send something out on the \nInternet, but unlike a broadcaster, potential listeners must seek out \nthis information and download it. This indecency that we worry about \ndoes not come easily into a home. You have to go out and look for it.\n  We are at the dawn of a new era in communication. Interactive \ncommunications--ranging from online computer services, CD-ROM's, and \nhome shopping networks--are growing at an astonishing rate, bringing \ngreat opportunities for business, culture, and education. Of all these \nnew interactive communications, the Internet has become the new \nlocation for our Nation's discourse.\n  The Internet does not function like a broadcast or a newspaper where \na station manager or editor chooses which images or stories to send out \nin public. The Internet is like a combination of a great library and \ntown square, where people can make available vast amounts of \ninformation or take part in free and open discussions on any topic. It \nhas provided great opportunities for our disabled citizens and has \nenabled our children the ability to discuss issues with some of \nsociety's greatest minds. With this technology, I conduct electronic \ntown meetings with Vermonters, post information about legislative \nactivities, and hear back from Vermonters about what they think.\n  Unfortunately, like any free and open society, the Internet and \nonline computer services have attracted their share of criminals. I \nrecently introduced with Senators Kyl and Grassley the National \nInformation Infrastructure Protection Act to increase protection for \nour Nation's important computer systems and confidential information \nfrom damage or prying by malicious insiders and computer hackers.\n  In addition, the Internet is not immune from pornographers. \nPornography exists in every communications media, including films, \nbooks, magazines, and dial-a-porn telephone services. The press has \nrecently hyped the discovery that online pornography exists on the \nInternet. But we should be careful not to overstate the extent of the \nproblem.\n  In our universal condemnation of pornography and desire to protect \nour children from exposure to online pornography, we should not rush in \nwith well-meaning but misguided legislation. Any response we choose \nmust be tempered by first amendment concerns. Heavy-handed attempts to \nprotect children could unduly chill speech on the Internet and infringe \nupon the first amendment.\n  What are we doing as a legislative body if we discourage the project \nGutenberg from placing online the works of Charles Dickens, Geoffrey \nChaucer, or D.H. Lawrence for fear of prosecution because someone, \nsomewhere on the Internet, might find the works indecent? Would the \nInternet still be the great electronic library and the setting for open \ndiscussion it now promises? These questions and issues will be the \nsubject of an important Judiciary Committee hearing Monday afternoon.\n  Any legislative approach must take into consideration online users' \nprivacy and free speech interests. If we grant too much power to online \nproviders to screen for indecent material, public discourse and online \ncontent in cyberspace will be controlled by the providers and not the \nusers of this fantastic resource. At the same time, we should carefully \nconsider the Interactive Working Group's recommendation that online \nproviders be encouraged to implement reasonable forms of filtering \ntechnology. Our laws should encourage and not discourage online \nproviders from creating a safe environment for children.\n  Even worse than discouraging online providers from implementing \nblocking technologies, is discouraging them from allowing children onto \ntheir services altogether. If online providers are liable for any \nexposure of indecent material to children, people under the age of 18 \nwill be shut out of this technology or relegated by the Government to \nsanitized kids-only services that contain only a tiny fraction of the \nentire Internet. That would be the equivalent of limiting today's \nstudents to the childhood section of the library or locking them out \ncompletely. This is not how this country should face the increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace of the 21st century.\n  I do not want somebody to tell me what I can say if I am talking to \nmy neighbor on the Internet, or if I am sending messages back and forth \nto friends. Frankly, Mr. President, sometimes my friends and I will \ndisagree pretty loudly on the Internet and we will be very frank in our \ndiscussion of other's ideas and what not. At what point do we have \nsomebody come on and say you cannot talk like that to each other, \nsomeone I have known for 30 years?\n  With our children, I again say that there are times when the \nresponsibility should be that of parents. Parents know their children \nbetter than any Government official, and are in the best position to \nknow the sort of online material to which their children may be \nexposed.\n  Finally, the Interactive Working Group's report shows how we can use \nexisting Federal laws to stop online stalkers and child pornographers. \nOur criminal laws already prohibit the sale or distribution over \ncomputer networks of obscene material (18 U.S.C. Secs. 1465, 1466, 2252 \nand 2423(a)). We already impose criminal liability for transmitting any \nthreatening message over computer networks (18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(c)). We \nalready proscribe the solicitation of minors over computers for any \nsexual activity (18 U.S.C. Sec. \n\n[[Page S10486]]\n2452), and illegal luring of minors into sexual activity through \ncomputer conversations (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2423(b)). We need to make sure \nour law enforcement has the training and resources to track down \ncomputer criminals, and not create new laws which restrict free speech \nand are repetitive of existing crimes.\n  This paper is important because it shows how we can address the \nproblem of online pornography by empowering parents, and not the \nGovernment, to screen children's computer activities. This is the best \nway to police the Internet without unduly restricting free speech or \nsquelching the growth of this fantastic new communications medium.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the consideration of \nS. 641.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is the so-called Ryan White bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I shall not speak long, because there is \nnot much time allocated this afternoon to this measure. I am sure that \nthe distinguished majority leader was looking for something to take up \nfor 2 or 3 hours, and I am not going to keep you here very long on this \nFriday afternoon.\n  However, I have been listening in my office to the comments of \nSenators who advocate this legislation. I respect them, but I disagree \nwith them. At a later time, I will go into some detail to explain to \nall Senators what they will be voting for; indeed, some 62 or 63 \nSenators are identified as cosponsors of this so-called Ryan White \nbill. I have talked with 2 or 3 Senators at lunch, and at other times, \nabout the details of the bill. They do not have the foggiest notion \nwhat the bill is all about. It just sounds good to be for the Ryan \nWhite bill.\n  Let the Record show that I am sorry for people who have AIDS. \nHowever, I am not unmindful of how the majority of people get AIDS. I \nsaid so in an interview with a woman reporter for the New York Times \nwho called me several weeks ago.\n  What she really called me about, Mr. President, was clear at the \ntime; she repeatedly brought up Senator Dole, the majority leader of \nthe U.S. Senate and candidate for President. She was going to write one \nof those speculative stories, you see, suggesting that Senator Dole was \nholding up the so-called Ryan White bill.\n  The fact is, nobody was holding up the Ryan White bill. Nobody is \nholding it up right now. I emphasized that, yes, I did put a ``notify'' \nhold in the Cloakroom on the Ryan White bill, meaning that I wanted to \nbe notified when the bill was called up so that I could offer \namendments to give Senators--including the 60-odd Senators who are \ncosponsors of the bill, without knowing what they are cosponsoring--\ngive them a chance to vote on a number of questions which are of \ninterest to the vast majority of the American people.\n  Since the distorted story was published about 80 percent of the \nthousands of calls and letters I received from around the country have \nbeen favorable.\n  I told the lady from the New York Times that her speculation was \npreposterous, that Bob Dole was not holding up the Ryan White bill, \nthat Jesse Helms was not holding up the Ryan White bill, that, in fact, \nnobody was holding it up.\n  I asked, ``When has Senator Dole, the majority leader, had a time to \ncall up this bill?'' And, by the way, I said, the existing bill does \nnot expire until September 30, so what is the big rush?\n  No, it is the homosexual lobby in this country. My hometown paper \nengaged in an editorial about the weak forces of the homosexual lobby. \nWell, Mr. President, the homosexual lobby is one of the most potent \nlobbying outfits in the country.\n  They talk about little Ryan White--an attractive little boy, an \ninnocent little boy. He died of AIDS, and now his name is being \nexploited, as if the homosexuals had nothing to do with the tainted \nblood that killed Ryan White. Where does the New York Times think that \nthe tainted blood came from in the beginning? That is what Senators \nneed to consider before they rush pell-mell into voting for this bill.\n  There will be at least five or six amendments to consider and to vote \non before the Senate gets to final passage on this amendment.\n  What the homosexual lobbyists in this country are demanding are \nspecial advantages over everybody else. The Clinton administration is \nmaking a mockery of fair play in kowtowing to the homosexual demands at \nevery turn, which prompts me to wonder, for example, how many \nSenators--or how many people in the news media, for that matter--know \nabout the seminars being conducted these days throughout the Federal \nGovernment bureaucracy, seminars that are mandatory. Federal employees \nare penalized if they do not attend them. What are these seminars all \nabout? They are designed to ``teach'' Federal employees that \nhomosexuality is just another lifestyle.\n  I have not seen a word about it in the New York Times or the \nWashington Post, nor have I seen it on CBS, ABC, CNN, or any of the \nrest of them. You see, it's not politically correct to talk about this.\n  Federal employees do not have a choice about whether to attend these \nseminars. They go to them--or else. We had one case last year--and I \nhad to intervene--where a dedicated Federal official stationed in \nAtlanta was booted out of his job because he made a statement saying \nthat we ought to look for the higher things in life instead of \nconcentrating on homosexuality, and teaching the false doctrine that \nhomosexuality is just another lifestyle.\n  This homosexual lobby has gone to incredible extremes to exploit Ryan \nWhite's name to acquire an unjustified amount of Federal funding for \nAIDS.\n  By the way, Mr. President, there has never been another disease for \nwhich there has been a special Federal fund for one specifying money \nnot devoted to AIDS research. This money is distributed with \nsubstantial amounts going to homosexual organizations such as the Gay \nMen's Health Crisis in New York, and the Whitman Walker Clinic, right \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  But just try, Mr. President, to obtain some information out of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.

Mr. President, as an American citizen, public official, \nand former prosecutor, I am appalled at the news accounts I have seen \nof State, local, and Federal law enforcement officers getting together \nto wallow in racism. There is no room for racism in law enforcement. \nLaw enforcement officers, in particular, have to be held to the highest \nstandards of conduct. People have to know that they will be treated \nfairly by those who act on behalf of the Government and wield its \npower.\n  As we proceed with the Judiciary Committee hearing, I expect that we \nwill hear a chorus of condemnation. I expect that we will hear each \nagency join in that refrain, explain that it is investigating the \nsituation and that it will be taking appropriate action based on the \nfacts. We should all act based on the facts. I look forward to the \nprompt completion of ongoing investigations and to our following up, \nwhen the facts are known.\n  It is tragic that racism is still a fact of life. It is most \ndisconcerting if racism taints law enforcement actions. That is wholly \nunacceptable. I note that the reports of the activities at the recent \nGood Old Boys Roundup in Tennessee do not go that far, however--I have \nyet to hear any allegation that the official duties of the State, \nlocal, and Federal law enforcement agents who chose to attend the \ngathering were affected. That should be our first concern.\n  Next, we should be concerned whether Federal law enforcement \nresources were devoted to organizing or supporting these gatherings. \nThe American people need to know that their tax dollars are not being \ndiverted to such activities.\n  Further, we have to be concerned that our culture, and the culture in \nwhich these various law enforcement officers live and work, still abide \nthese gatherings and displays.\n  As we consider whether additional steps, policies, regulations, or \nlaws are needed to root out the evils of racism, we must be mindful \nthat we not create political litmus tests or become thought police. We \nneed to be sensitive to the limits of law and preserve some place for \nprivate lives and private thoughts.\n  We must also be careful to avoid being exploited by those with \nulterior motives who oppose valid law enforcement. Our actions and \nthose of the executive branch must be based on facts, not third-had \nnews accounts.\n  Finally, we must not allow this shameful incident to taint the vast \nmajority of fine and dedicated men and women who risk so much to \nprotect us and the rule of law every day.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10487-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10487-S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, why did S. 343 fail last night? As Casey \nStengel would say, we did not have enough votes. And we did not have \nthe votes we needed because no matter what changes were made to S. 343, \nit continued to be mischaracterized. From the beginning of its journey \nthrough the Judiciary Committee, S. 343 was demonized. Likewise, the \nbill reported from the Governmental Affairs Committee, S. 291, was \nbeatified.\n  Scores of improvements were made to S. 343 since it was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee. None of the few who understands the \nlegislation would disagree. Moreover, yesterday proponents agreed to \nmake significant additional changes requested by the bill's critics. \nBut just as it went throughout the long floor debate, the opponents \nwould not accept some improvements unless we agreed to all of their \ndemands. Yes, opponents blocked our attempts to improve the bill \nbecause they preferred to preserve talking points against the bill. \nThis is masterful politics, but this is also what disgusts the American \npeople about Congress.\n  In addition, it appears that proponents managed to create the \nimpression that negotiations were ongoing that promised fruitful \nresults. If such negotiations took place, like Senator Johnston, I can \nsay that I was completely unaware.\n  In contrast to S. 343, S. 291 and its successors have led charmed \nlives. The Glenn substitute, which the Senate rejected, was offered as \nthe text that was unanimously reported by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. But such a claim is highly misleading. Let me tell you why.\n  This legislation is rather complicated. The competing versions are \neach over 75 pages in length. Yet the real heart of reform can be \ncrystallized in a few concepts and in language that takes just a few \npages. In fact, judicial review--perhaps the most significant and most \ncontroversial part of these bills--is provided in just one sentence. \nYes, just one sentence.\n  Suppose that sentence were stricken. Could you say that the bill was \njust about the same? The length of the bill would not be changed; over \n99 percent of the words would be the same. But the impact of the \nlegislation would be entirely different. This exemplifies what happened \nto S. 291 as it was transformed into the Glenn substitute.\n  There are, as I said, just a few concepts one needs to grasp to \nunderstand regulatory reform.\n  First. The agency should undertake a cost-benefit analysis.\n  Second. The agency should apply the cost-benefit analysis.\n  Third. If the agency does not comply with the first or second item, \nthere is judicial review.\n  Fourth. The agency must review existing rules under the above \nprocedures.\n  Fifth. There must be some way to ensure the agency reviews existing \nrules.\n  Proponents and opponents appear to agree only on the first item, that \nagencies should perform cost-benefit analyses. That is because that is \nthe status quo. That is what Executive Order 12866 requires today.\n  But the Glenn substitute did not require that an agency actually use \nthe cost-benefit test. While the Glenn substitute used language similar \nto S. 291 to require that a cost-benefit analysis be performed for \nmajor rules, the Glenn substitute has no enforcement provision to make \nclear that the cost-benefit analysis should matter--that it should \naffect the rule. The Glenn substitute excoriated the sentence on \njudicial review in S. 291 that made clear that the court was to focus \non the cost-benefit analysis in determining whether the rule was \narbitrary and capricious. That provision in S. 291 was taken from a \n1982 regulatory reform bill, S. 1080, which was approved by a 94-0 vote \nin the Senate before it died in the House. In contrast, the Glenn \nsubstitute only required that the cost-benefit analysis be inserted in \nthe Record with thousands of other documents and comments. This is \nessentially what happens under the current Executive order.\n  The Glenn substitute had another fatal defect--it did not provide for \nan effective review of existing rules. Effective regulatory reform \ncannot be prospective only; it must look back to reform old rules \nalready on the books. Since 1981, repeated presidential attempts to \nrequire the review of rules by Executive order have only met with \nrepeated failures.\n  But the Glenn substitute does not cure the problem. Like the \nExecutive orders, the Glenn substitute makes the review of rules an \nessentially voluntary undertaking. There are no firm requirements for \naction--no set rules to be reviewed, no binding standards, no \nmeaningful deadlines. The Glenn substitute merely asks each agency to \nissue every 5 years a schedule of rules that, ``in the sole \ndiscretion'' of the agency, merit review.\n  The Glenn substitute seriously weakened the lookback provision in S. \n291. While not perfect, S. 291 did have firm requirements. S. 291 \nprescribed the category of rules that the agencies were to review. If \nthe agency failed to review any of those rules, they terminated \nautomatically. The Glenn substitute had no such firm requirements.\n  What a review of these elements shows is clear: the Glenn substitute \nwas an elaborate re-write of the status quo. Reform--without change. \nFor those few who understand what was \n\n[[Page S10488]]\nhappening on the Senate floor, it could not be clearer.\n  The real losers last night were the American people. We, on the \nSenate floor, know that the discretion of regulators needs to be \ncurtailed. We know that reform can be achieved in a way that fosters \nour health, safety, and environmental goals. S. 343 is, in fact, such a \nbill. But unfortunately, that was not quite clear enough last night.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10487-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, throughout the continuing debate on \nregulatory reform a number of things have become very clear:\n  First, the vast majority of Members of the Senate want regulatory \nreform--the speeches, the floor debates, the combined totals of the \nvotes for reform of one kind or another show that Democrats and \nRepublicans alike want regulatory reform.\n  Second, despite bipartisan refusal to accept the majority leader's \nbill, there is bipartisan support for tough regulatory reform \nlegislation as shown by the 48-to 52-vote to substitute the Glenn-\nChafee bill--a bill based on the bipartisan work of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee--for the Dole-Johnston bill.\n  Third, despite the majority leader's disappointment in his failure to \ngain acceptance for his proposal, there continues to be wide support \nfor continuing to negotiate cooperatively to come up with a workable \nreform bill. We have made good faith efforts throughout this debate: we \nhave come to the table on three different occasions with the proponents \nof the Dole-Johnston substitute; we have written lists of issues and \nhave provided legislative language to address our concerns. The latest \nround of these efforts to provide our responses to some of their \nproposals was yesterday--just an hour before the third cloture vote. \nThese lists were not new inventions of new problems, but a consistent, \ncontinuing set of concerns. Our list of concerns has narrowed as \nnegotiations have progressed. We have not, as some Members have \nalleged, invented new problems merely to delay or confuse the debate.\n  Fourth and finally, in the heat of this debate, in what seems to be a \npart of the desperation of a few to make the best of a bad situation, \nsome unfortunate and misleading statements have been made about our \nbill. I am very disappointed, and in fact surprised, by the statements \nof Senator Roth. We worked together in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to make his regulatory reform bill, S. 291, into a strong \nbipartisan bill that could be and indeed was supported by every member \nof the Committee--8 Republicans and 7 Democrats. Just when the Wall \nStreet Journal was unfairly and inaccurately characterizing the Roth \nbill as ``a do-nothing bill'' as it did on April 27, 1995, Senator Roth \nand I were working together and agreeing that we had a tough but fair \nbill that could gain the support of the Committee and should be the \nbill that could and should pass the full Senate.\n  Last week he made charges against the Glenn-Chafee bill with regard \nto risk assessment provisions, saying that we took the National Academy \nof Sciences ``minority views'' by preferring ``default assumptions to \nrelevant data.'' As I pointed out on the floor, that was not correct. \nOur bill says to use default assumptions when relevant data are \nlacking. And our bill requires agencies to put out guidelines in \nrefining default assumptions and replacing those assumptions with real \ndata. Clearly, our bill does not give a preference to assumptions over \ndata.\n  Yesterday, and this is the reason I return to the floor today to set \nthe record straight, he said the Glenn-Chafee bill is ``toothless''--\nyes, just the word the Wall Street Journal used to attack him a few \nmonths ago, that it is completely different from the Roth-Glenn bill \nthat came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and that it has a \ncompletely different thrust.\n  It is also ironic that my colleague from Delaware now so clearly \ndefends the S. 291 review process, stating on July 17 on the floor, \n``Although the original Glenn bill was similar to the Roth bill, the \ncurrent Glenn substitute seriously differs from the Roth bill * * * \nSenator Glenn has seriously weakened the review of rules * * * The \nrevised Glenn substitute lacks any firm requirement about the number of \nrules to be reviewed.'' However, in his ``Dear Colleague'' letter on \nJuly 11 he states, ``S. 291--and S. 1001--has substantial \nadministrative difficulties. They require every major rule to be \nreviewed in a 10-year period, with a possible 5-year extension, or be \nsubject to termination. * * * It would be very burdensome to review all \nexisting major rules--unduly burdensome when nobody is complaining \nabout many of them.'' He calls us weak for not sticking to the Roth \nbill, and then calls the Roth bill ``unduly burdensome.''\n  I can understand loyalty, but I am surprised at the degree to which \nmy colleague has turned away from his earlier, commendable reform \nefforts. He has now put himself in the strange position of attacking \nmany of the same provisions he so enthusiastically supported just a few \nshort months ago.\n  Yesterday, I insisted that the Glenn-Chafee bill is based on the \nRoth-Glenn bill, S. 291, and that the Glenn-Chafee bill is largely \nidentical with S. 291. In fact, the Glenn-Chafee bill differs from S. \n291 in only three major ways to match S. 1001 and a few lesser ways in \norder to match amendments to the Dole-Johnston bill. Senator Roth, on \nthe other hand, said ``what we voted for in Committee was entirely \ndifferent from what we voted for on the floor in the Glenn \nsubstitute.'' For the record, I would like to provide a comparison of \nthe two bills, and as the Record will show, most of the sections are \nidentical. To reiterate, we made three changes, and we made additional \nchanges to match amendments to the Dole-Johnston bill.\n  First, the Glenn-Chafee substitute, which was voted for by 48 \nSenators, is a slight modification of S. 1001, which I introduced with \nSenator Chafee. S. 1001 differs from S. 291 on only three major points:\n  It does not sunset rules that fail to be reviewed. Rather it \nestablishes an action-enforcing mechanism that uses the rulemaking \nprocess.\n  It does not include any narrative definitions for ``major'' rule--\nsuch as ``adverse effects on wages''.\n  It incorporates technical changes to risk assessment to track more \nclosely the approach of the National Academy of Sciences and to cover \nspecific programs and agencies, not just agencies.\n  Second, in the weeks since introduction of S. 1001, negotiations and \ndebate have resulted in common agreement on improvements, both to the \nDole-Johnston and the Glenn-Chafee proposals. Accordingly, the final \nversion of Glenn-Chafee, which again was supported by a bipartisan vote \nof 48 Senators, contains some additional changes. Most of these are \nalso found in the Dole-Johnston bill, which Senator Roth now supports. \nSo I find it difficult to understand how the Senator from Delaware can \ncriticize these changes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a comparison of the two \nbills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the comparison was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record; as follows:\n\n      Section By Section Comparison of Glenn-Chafee and Roth-Glenn\n\n       Section 1. Title.\n       Section 2. Definitions--identical.\n       Section 3(a). Analysis of Agency Rules.\n       Subchapter II. Cost-Benefit Analysis.\n       Section 621.

Mr. President, this last Monday I chaired a hearing of \nthe full Foreign Relations Committee to consider ambassadorial \nnominations for four countries within the jurisdiction of my \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs: Cambodia, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and Thailand. I was impressed by all of them, and am sure \nthey--as well as the Ambassador-designate to APEC--will be confirmed by \nthe full Senate soon. In speaking privately with all the nominees, \nhowever, there was one issue I brought up with both the Ambassador-\ndesignate to Thailand and the Ambassador-designate to Cambodia that \nthey were unable to address to my satisfaction and which I believe \nshould be brought to the attention of my colleagues: the links between \nthe Thai military and the Khmer Rouge and their involvement in the \nillegal timber trade across the Thai-Cambodia border.\n  Cambodia shares a lengthy and relatively uninhabited border with \nThailand. The entire region is heavily forested; formerly, 76 percent \nof Cambodia's 176,520 square kilometers of land area was covered by \nforest. That amount, however, has declined dramatically over the last \n15 years due to the increased commercial harvesting of timber. \nAccording to some sources, tree cover has been reduced by almost half \nsince 1989. The loss has been especially dramatic in western Cambodia, \nwhere a handful of foreign firms are responsible for a majority of the \ndeforestation.\n  These companies purchase concessions from the Cambodian Government, \nand theoretically make payments to the government based on the amount \nof cubic meters of timber felled. The timber is then exported over the \nThai border, either by boat or overland on dirt roads built expressly \nfor that purpose by the companies, where they are collected at places \ncalled rest areas before being sent further on into Thailand. According \nto both Thai and Cambodian regulations, the logger/exporter must secure \na certificate of origin from the Cambodian Government, a permit from \nthe Thai embassy in Cambodia, and permission from the Thai Interior \nMinistry to import the logs into Thailand.\n  There is one more party, however, that plays a major role in the \nlogging: the Khmer Rouge [KR]. Led by the infamous Pol Pot, the KR \ncontrolled the government of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. During that \ntime, it was directly responsible for the genocide of more than one \nmillion Cambodians in the ``Killing Fields.'' Since the 1991 U.N. peace \nagreement established a democratic government in Cambodia, the KR has \nbeen relegated to the role of a rebel guerilla force. Although the \ngovernment has made some inroads in combatting the KR, including \nimplementing a somewhat successful amnesty program, the KR remains a \nstrong force in the western khet of Batdambang, Pursat, Banteay \nMeanchey and Siem Reap. Despite the campaign being mounted against \nthem, though, they still receive a steady flow of food, military \nsupplies, and currency sufficient to pay their 10,000 to 20,000 man \nmilitia; and therein lies the connection to the timber trade and the \nThai military.\n  Over the past several years, the press has consistently reported that \nthe Thai military has been providing assistance and support to the \nKhmer Rouge. The links between the two are longstanding. Beginning in \n1979, Thailand acted as a funnel for Chinese-supplied arms being \ntransshipped to the KR--apparently in return for an end to Chinese \nsupport for rebel Thai Communists in northern Thailand. Since then, the \nevidence suggests that the Thai have regularly supplied the KR with \nlogistical support and materiel. In return for this support, Thai \nbusiness interests and certain government sectors have benefitted from \naccess to timber and gem resources within that part of Cambodia along \nthe Thai border controlled by the KR. Their interest is sizable; in \n1993, the U.S. Embassy in Thailand estimated that Thai logging \ncompanies had some $40 million invested in timber concessions in KR-\nheld areas.\n  It is from the sale of these resources that the KR acquires funds \nsufficient to continue its reign of terror in Cambodia. The process is \nactually quite simple. Foreign companies interested in harvesting \ntimber in western Cambodia purchase official lumber concessions from \nthe government in Phnom Penh. Having dealt with the de jure government, \nhowever, the companies must then deal with the de facto government in \nwestern Cambodia: the KR. The companies pay the KR for the right of \nsafe passage into KR-held territory, to fell the timber, and to \ntransport it out to Thailand safely. The present going rate of payment \nto the KR per cubic meter is between 875 and 1,000 baht, or between $35 \nand $40. It is estimated that the weekly income to the KR from timber \ncarried across just two of the many border points is around $270,000, \nwith total monthly income to the KR estimated at between $10 and $20 \nmillion.\n  Once felled and placed on the back of trucks, the logs are driven \nacross the Thai border. That crossing, however, is not without its \ncosts. The Thai military--the Marines, actually--controls a 4-mile wide \nstrip along the Thai side of the border, and in order to negotiate it \nthe logging trucks must pass through guarded checkpoints where, it \nappears, payments in the form of tolls or bribes are made to Thai \nconcerns.\n  The Thai have consistently, albeit often disingenuously, denied any \nties to the KR or to the timber trade. Each round of denials, however, \nis soon followed by press reports and concrete evidence to the \ncontrary. For example, in 1994 Thailand officially closed its border \nwith Cambodia partly as a result of the murder of more than 20 Thai \ntimber workers by the KR and partly as a result of international \ncriticism. In a press statement made shortly thereafter, Maj. Gen. \nNiphon Parayanit, the Thai commander in the region, stated flatly that \nthe border was closed, that the military had severed all links with the \nKR, and that ``there [was] no large-scale cross-border \n\n[[Page S10490]]\ntrade going on.'' The official denials have continued to this day, \nincluding one of the more recent by Prime Minister Chuan noted in the \nMay 26 edition of the Bangkok Post.\n  Despite these denials though, and despite a Cambodian ban on logging, \ncredible eyewitness reports from members of the London-based group \nGlobal Witness fully confirm, in my opinion, that the trucks are still \nrolling across the Thai border. If--as the Thai military alleges--it is \nnot involved in the timber trade either directly or by turning a blind \neye to the shipments, I can think of no other explanation than that the \nmilitary personnel in the border zone are completely incompetent. One \nof the more heavily travelled timber roads in the border zone, one that \naccording to my information is in daily use even as I speak, is within \nsight of one of the Thai Marine camps. Nor can the central Thai \nGovernment claim ignorance; Global Witness recently brought to light a \ncurrent timber import permit signed by the Thai Interior Minister.\n  Mr. President, continued Thai support for the KR--in this or any \nmanner--concerns me greatly for several reasons. First and foremost, \nthe financial support the trade affords to the KR continues to allow it \nto survive thereby seriously endangering the growth and continued \nvitality of the nascent Cambodian democracy. That system is having \nenough trouble getting off the ground and running smoothly without \nhaving to deal with the KR insurgency. Secondly, Thailand's actions run \ncounter to its obligations under the 1991 Peace Accord and serve to \nundermine it. Finally, the clandestine nature of the timber extraction \nhas removed it from the control of the Cambodian central government. It \nis subsequently free to continue without regard to any regulations \naimed at limiting the amount of timber taken, preventing serious \necological damage, ensuring sustained growth, or protecting the lives \nand livelihoods of the local populace.\n  I have made my concerns about this issue clear to both of our \nAmbassadors-designate and to the State Department. I hope that this \nstatement will make my concerns equally clear to the Thai Government. \nIf a significant effort not made as promised by the Thai Government to \nfully investigate and then stem the cross-border trade and their \ndealings with the KR, then I would find myself placed in the position \nof calling on our government to abide by that provision of Public Law \n103-306 requiring that the President shall ``terminate assistance to \nany country or organization that he determines is cooperating, \ntactically or strategically, with the Khmer Rouge in their military \noperations.''\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me note that I greatly value the close \nrelationship between us and the government and people of Thailand. \nHowever warm or important that relationship, though, we cannot allow it \nto obscure or interfere with what is our equally important dedication \nto the principles of democracy taking root in Cambodia. I, and I hope \nmy colleagues, will be watching developments closely.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10489-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10490-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10490-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2058.

A bill to provide for the protection of Southeast Alaska \njobs and communities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        THE SOUTHEAST ALASKA JOBS AND COMMUNITIES PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reluctantly reinitiate \na debate concerning the management of the Tongass National Forest. I \nthought and hoped that Congress had resolved this issue with the \npassage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990 (TTRA). I want to \nemphasize my reluctance and unhappiness with the need to initiate \ncorrective legislative action because the Tongass Timber Reform Act of \n1990 was hailed by all concerned as a dramatic resolution to a long-\nstanding debate on how to manage the Tongass. The congressional \ndeliberations leading up to passage involved, as Senator Johnston, my \ncolleague from Louisiana, put it ``extraordinary cooperation'' among \nall of the parties involved.\n  When we passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act in 1990, I believe that \nCongress agreed with the Bush administration that--as long as the \ndemand for timber existed--the industry should be provided sufficient \nvolume from the remaining 1.7 million acre commercial forest land base \nto maintain the same amount of direct timber employment from operations \non the Tongass National Forest that it enjoyed in 1990. I believe that \nall parties agreed that maintaining this level of employment was part \nof the compromise underlying the bill.\n  Well, the Congress withdrew 1.1 million acres of land; and the Bush \nadministration unilaterally modified the long term timber sale \ncontracts on the Tongass, and required buffer strips on all major \nanadramous streams. But the jobs portion of the compromise has been \nlargely ignored by the current administration. Since 1990, direct \ntimber employment on the Tongass National Forest has been reduced by \nmore than 42 percent. As I see it, there are two principal reasons for \nthis decline: First, the Forest Service has failed to seek to meet \nmarket demand as required by TTRA section 101; and second, a variety of \nenvironmental groups have administratively appealed or litigated most \nproposed timber sales. Today 13 of 23 currently proposed sales are held \nup because of legal action taken by the environmentalists. These \nenjoined sales now make it impossible for the Forest Service to \nameliorate the impacts of the sales it has withdrawn from the pipeline.\n  What is happening in southeast Alaska is unfortunately not unique. \nThrough a combination of Clinton administration initiatives and \nenvironmental group litigation we are seeing all forms of economic \nactivity--timber, grazing, mining, and oil and gas exploration--driven \noff our public lands throughout the country. We are engaged in a policy \nof exporting both our jobs and some of our environmental problems to \nother nations. They will meet our material needs through production \nprocesses far less sophisticated and environmentally sensitive than our \nown. I represent the largest national forest in our system. I cannot \nbelieve that this forest cannot be managed to sustain a forest \nindustry. I can no longer stand by as that industry is destroyed.\n  Let me first turn to Forest Service malfeasance and nonfeasance, for \nit is with the Agency's performance that I am most unhappy. There are \nfour reasons why the Forest Service has been unable or unwilling to \nmeet market demand: First, the Forest Service in Alaska has \nreinterpreted the definition of ``viable population of a species'' such \nthat it is managing habitat to require that all species exist on all \nareas of the Tongass, not just the portion of the Tongass to which a \nparticular species is indigenous; second, in accordance with its new \nhypersensitivity to species protection, the Forest Service in the \nspring of 1994 canceled the Alaska Pulp Corporation [APC] long term \ncontract, withdrew 600,000 acres, and related timber sales, from the \n1.7 million acre commercial forest land base remaining after the 1990 \nact, and moved Ketchikan Pulp Company [KPC] into the APC contract areas \nso that habitat conservation areas [HCAs] and goshawk reservation areas \ncould be established on a portion of KPC's then existing sales; third, \nthe Forest Service has subordinated Section 101 of TTRA to species \nprotection concerns, interpreting this part of the compromise as non-\nbinding; and fourth, the environmental groups lawsuits have eliminated \nthe Agency's ability to offset the effects of the first three \ndevelopments.\n  My most immediate concern with the situation that the Forest Service \nhas created is that it is rapidly getting worse. That is why I, along \nwith other members of the Alaska Delegation, have come to the \nconclusion that we must act today. Let me describe the situation that \nexists.\n  The log shortage commenced with the Forest Service action in setting \naside habitat conservation areas and goshawk reservation areas in the \nspring of 1994, continues to cause job reductions, and now threatens \nnew job reductions. KPC has approximately 120 mmbf of timber on hand, \nneeds approximately 220 mmbf to get through the winter until April or \nMay of 1996, and can only achieve this additional volume if timber \nwhich is currently enjoined is made available by the Forest Service \nduring this timber harvest season. Meanwhile, the Ketchikan sawmill is \nclosed, the Wrangell sawmill is closed, and the Annette sawmill is \noperating on one shift only.\n  The timber sales program for the independent and small business \ntimber industry, SBA, currently has 63.6 million board feet of timber \nunder contract as of July 1, 1995. Only 5.92 million board feet of \nnewly advertised SBA and independent timber sales have been made \navailable in 1995 from all three supervisory areas of the Tongass. This \nshould result in one independent SBA production facility closing by \nSeptember 30, 1995, with a further reduction of regional, independent \nsawmill operations in the first quarter of 1996.\n  The Forest Service's response to this situation is to continue to \nassure the Alaska Delegation to rely on the Agency to rectify the \ncrisis as they complete the Tongass Land Management Plan [TLMP] \nrevision process. At first, this sounded attractive. But then we looked \ninto how the Forest Service is conducting the plan revision process. \nThe Agency is making a bad situation worse. Consequently, the TLMP \nrevision will not and cannot resolve this crisis for the following \nreasons.\n  The TLMP revision process is designed solely to modify the 1991 draft \nplan alternatives. The 1991 alternatives were the first revision \ndesigned to implement the 1990 Act. The Forest Service is modifying \nthis draft to consider such matters as population viability, cave \nissues, and ecosystem management. All of these priorities will likely \nreduce timber volumes from the 1991 alternatives; and from what has \nbeen offered to date.\n  Second, the current Forest Service approach to implementing the 1990 \nact and providing timber volume is to reduce market demand to the \ncapacity of only those mills which remain open. Each time a mill \ncloses, volume has been reduced accordingly. This ensures the continued \nclosure of the Ketchikan and Wrangell sawmills, and precludes building \na replacement medium density fiberboard facility for the closed \npulpmill in Sitka. In my view, all of this is contrary to Congress' \nintent in the 1990 TTRA compromise.\n  Third, on June 30, 1995, Regional Forester Janik made public the 10-\nyear timber sale projection shown on this chart. This was the final \nstraw that broke the camel's back. This schedule shows an annual \naverage volume of 278 million board feet. As this 10-year period \nmirrors the 10-year planning horizon for TLMP, we can only assume that \nthe Forest Service has already made up its mind to drop the ASQ to 2.5 \nbillion from the current 4.5 billion board feet, essentially reducing \nvolume availability by almost half. This is both unacceptable, and \nunconscionable given the Agency's arguments that we rely on the TLMP \nrevision process to fix the timber supply crisis.\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\n  Fourth, the TLMP scientists have been given an extremely short \nschedule which provides them insufficient time to collect and analyze \ndata. This converts the TLMP science into off-hand impressions, which \nwill be extremely conservative because of insufficient data. The \nOctober 24-26, 1994 meeting notes of the Forest Service's so-called \ngoshawk committee, which have already been the subject of press \nreports, highlight this problem.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee conducted two \noversight hearings on the management of the Tongass National Forest. \nThe hearings were held in Washington, DC, on May 18; and in Wrangell, \nAK on June 1. In all, the committee heard from 55 witnesses, with an \nadditional 100 or so statements for the record. The Clinton \nadministration was well represented at each hearing.\n  The Alaska Delegation has also been involved in a prolonged \ndiscussion with the administration--including an exchange of detailed \ncorrespondence with Secretary Glickman--in an attempt to fashion an \nadministrative solution to the timber supply crisis on the Tongass \nNational Forest.\n  Regrettably, that does not now seem possible. The administration \nappears to be fixed on a path that can only increase job losses in the \nregion. The administration seems to be wedded to a Tongass land \nmanagement plan revision process that cannot solve the problem. So, \nwhere does this leave us?\n  In short, if we continue on our current path, we will most certainly \nnot provide for sufficient volume to maintain jobs at the 1990 level. \nThe compromise I envisioned in enacting the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform \nAct will not be realized.\n  The Southeast Alaska Jobs and Communities Protection Act which I am \nintroducing today addresses these problems by restoring the 1990 \ncompromise, and by providing the Forest Service with the ability which \nit says it lacks to reconcile the provisions of the 1990 Tongass Timber \nReform Act and the more general public land and environmental statutes. \nThe organizing principle behind my proposal is the protection of jobs--\nthe number of jobs that existed in 1990, and that we sought to protect \nwith the 1990 act. The mechanism to accomplish this goal is very \nsimple. Whenever the Forest Service feels it has to reduce the timber \nbase on the Tongass in a fashion that will reduce jobs, the Agency must \nrevisit the land set-asides in the 1990 act and replace the loss of \ntimber base with enough lands to maintain the jobs.\n  By focusing on jobs, and providing the Forest Service with \nflexibility that it says it does not now have, the Southeast Alaska \nJobs and Communities Protection Act avoids tying the Agency's hands, or \nsetting a mandated harvest level. Indeed, provisions in the bill \nrequiring additional primary processing and encouraging value added \nmanufacturing ensure that we get the maximum employment potential out \nof each stick of timber.\n  Mr. President, I will not review each provision of the bill. Rather, \nI will submit a section-by-section summary for the record. Suffice it \nto say that the bill incorporates suggestions from all sides included \nin the 155 or more pieces of testimony received at our oversight \nhearings.\n  In the same spirit as the 1990 act and today's proposal were drafted, \nI now invite all interested parties to offer in their constructive \nsuggestions. I will schedule hearings on the measure, and hope to work \nclosely with the administration and Senator Johnston in the same kind \nof extraordinary cooperation that was the hallmark of the 1990 effort.\n  This cooperation is necessary because the status quo has become \nuntenable. Even so, we have heard from some that: First, there is no \ntimber supply problem on the Tongass; second, even if there is, they \nare not at fault; third, we need many more hearings before we do \nanything; and fourth, we need to sit back and allow the Forest Service \nto make the 1990 act work.\n  The general pattern of these arguments is not unfamiliar to me. \nChange a few words, and you could be summarizing the timber industry's \narguments prior to 1990 in defending the status quo embodied in the \n1980 act. In the late 1980's the Forest Service was slow to acknowledge \nthat there was a problem, and then grudgingly worked with the Congress \ntoward a solution. They are in a similar posture today. Also, as was \nthe case in the late 1980's, middle ground interests like the Southeast \nConference went beyond the posturing and the rhetoric to help isolate \nthe problems and identify solutions. That is also the approach that the \nSoutheast Conference took at our oversight hearings. Many of their \nsuggestions are included in today's proposal.\n  By contrast, polemical broadsides and ad hominem attacks are neither \nhelpful in solving this problem, nor an effective smokescreen to \ndistract people who are losing their jobs. It is true that today both \nsides in the Tongass debate are in court challenging the implementation \nof the 1990 compromise. They both have lawyers, plenty of them. Forest \nconflicts usually increase the number of lawyers, even as they decrease \nthe amount of timber. If lawyers were as useful as 2x4's maybe we \nwouldn't have such a problem today.\n  But it is time for everyone concerned to get beyond denial. The \ncurrent situation will be improved neither by the TLMP revision, nor by \nmore lawsuits. We will act because we have no choice. Unless we do, we \nwill: First, lose the opportunity to reopen the Wrangell and Ketchikan \nsawmills; second, forego by default the possibility of establishing a \nmedium density fiberboard mill in Sitka; third, discourage \nentrepreneurs who are presently considering the construction of a \nsawmill and kiln-dry facilities in Sitka; and fourth, suffer additional \nproduction curtailments at the Ketchikan pulp mill, and the closure of \nadditional sawmills.\n  We are eager to receive--and are already receiving from thoughtful \npeople--suggestions on how to proceed. Our objective is simply this: \nrestore the compromise, and the jobs inherent in it, in the 1990 TTRA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\nSummary of the Provisions of the Southeast Alaska Jobs and Communities \n                         Protection Act of 1995\n\n       Section 1. The objective of this section is to make the \n     changes necessary in the Tongass Land management Planning \n     (TLMP) process so that sufficient volume can be made \n     available from the Tongass National Forest to provide \n     approximately 2400 direct timber jobs, which is the number of \n     such jobs which existed when the bill passed in 1990.\n       All Tongass lands are to be considered in the TLMP process \n     except those designated as Wilderness under Sections 503 and \n     703 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \n     (ANILCA)(702(a)(1)).\n       For the Secretary to reduce the volume of timber available \n     for harvesting from that needed to protect jobs at the 1990 \n     level, the Secretary will have to do two things: (a) provide \n     a jobs impact statement showing that the reduction of the \n     jobs from the 1990 level and the adverse impacts on timber \n     dependent communities is outweighed by the environmental \n     gains to be achieved by the reductions; and (b) provide \n     equivalent substitute timber volume. (709(a)(1) and \n     709(a)(2))\n       Timber cannot be withdrawn to maintain plant or animal \n     diversity unless the Secretary makes a written determination \n     that such action is necessary to prevent the species from \n     becoming threatened or endangered. Even then, a jobs impact \n     versus an environmental benefit review must be obtained and \n     substitute timber must be provided. In addition, the State of \n     Alaska must be consulted about controlling predators which \n     prey upon the species of concern, and all nonsubsistence uses \n     of the species must be terminated. (709(a)(3))\n       The Secretary is directed to manage second growth timber \n     stands to maximize future timber production, and to make \n     second growth timber suitable for deer habitat and for other \n     species. (709(a)(4))\n       Subsection (b) of Subsection 1 states that the timber \n     substitution process required under subsection (a) will be \n     done without the need for a National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (NEPA) review. (709(b))\n       Subsection (c) makes it clear that a revised TLMP plan, \n     meeting the requirements of this section, shall be found to \n     be consistent with other laws pertaining to the National \n     Forests. This Act takes precedence over less specific \n     legislation.\n       Section 2. The objective of this section is to require the \n     Forest Service to meet market demand with a supply of mid-\n     market timber.\n       Subsection (a) requires that the Secretary meet market \n     demand with a supply of mid-market timber on an annual and \n     planning cycle basis. (705(a))\n       Subsection (b) requires the Secretary to monitor the timber \n     supply and demand from the Tongass National Forest, and \n     provide a report to the public on January 1 of each year, \n     providing that information and explaining how the Secretary \n     intends to reconcile market demand with other requirements of \n     law. (705(b))\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\n       Subsection (c) requires that the Secretary's determination \n     required by subsection (b) is utilized in setting timber sale \n     volume and offering levels for the Tongass. The explanation \n     shall be contained in the President's budget for that fiscal \n     year. (705(c))\n       Subsection (d) prohibits the reduction of timber volumes \n     available for harvest, unless the Secretary determines that \n     the timber job reductions and resulting adverse impacts upon \n     timber dependent communities are outweighed by the \n     environmental benefits to be achieved. Where such a reduction \n     occurs, equivalent volume of lands economically suitable for \n     timber production must be substituted. (705(d))\n       Subsection (e) describes how such substitution is to take \n     place. (705(e))\n       Subsection (f) requires regulations be promulgated to \n     implement the provisions of Section 2, within 60-days of \n     enactment of the section. (705(f))\n       Subsection (g) provides that a court shall not find that a \n     sale or offering of timber on the Tongass National Forest \n     which complies with this section is inconsistent with other \n     laws providing for forest management. This Act takes \n     precedence over less specific legislation.\n       Section 3. Section 3 amends Section 102 of the Tongass \n     Timber Reform Act to make Section 6(k) of the National Forest \n     Management Act (NFMA) consistent with the provisions of this \n     Act. Moreover, Section 6(k) cannot be used to delete volume \n     from the Tongass unless substitute timber is provided.\n       Section 4. The objective of Section 4 is to require the \n     Secretary to provide an annual volume of 80 million board \n     feet of timber to small business concerns and to better \n     tailor timber sales to the needs of small businesses.\n       Section 5. Section 5 provides a direct cause of action to \n     persons and communities adversely affected by the Secretary's \n     actions under this Act. Sixty days notice to the Secretary is \n     required as a predicate to filing such a suit. This provision \n     is necessary as a counterweight to the environmental \n     organization's ability to stop or enjoin timber sales under \n     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n       Section 6. This section requires the Secretary to request \n     annual appropriations sufficient to provide at least a three-\n     year supply of unharvested timber and requires the Secretary \n     to provide reports to the public concerning that timber.\n       Section 7. The objective of Section 7 is to allow a \n     purchaser of Tongass National Forest timber to lay out timber \n     sales pursuant to the Record of Decision signed by the \n     Contracting Officer following completion of a NEPA analysis \n     for that sale. The Forest Service has the authority to modify \n     or approve such a layout.\n       Section 8. Section 8 repeals Section 301(c)(2) of the \n     Tongass Timber Reform Act, which requires proportionality for \n     timber offerings made pursuant to the long term contracts. \n     Now that there is only one pulp mill left, and Classes 5, 6 \n     and 7 timber are being considered together, this provision is \n     unnecessary. The technical aspects of implementing such a \n     provision have been enjoined on several occasions. The new \n     Forest Service method for determining proportionality in \n     response to such lawsuits is a process that costs $200,000 \n     and an entire operating season to implement. In short, the \n     section is repealed because the environmental benefits are \n     far outweighed by the costs associated with the provision.\n       Section 9. The objective of Section 9 is to direct the \n     Secretary to reschedule the timber sales and offerings which \n     were deferred because of the June 1994 habitat conservation \n     areas (HCAs) and goshawk reservation area withdrawals by the \n     Forest Service.\n       Section 10. Section 10 amends Section 1326(b) of ANILCA to \n     add a definition of the term ``withdrawal'' as used in that \n     section. Section 1326(a) precludes a withdrawal of more than \n     5,000 acres of public land in the aggregate unless such a \n     withdrawal is made by the President and concurred by \n     Congress. The new definition of ``withdrawal'' includes \n     temporary reservations or deferrals. This is to avoid \n     situations as those that occurred with the HCAs and goshawk \n     reservation areas in June 1994 when one-third of the \n     commercial forest land was withdrawn and remains withdrawn \n     because the Agency contends that it does not constitute a \n     land withdrawal, as that term is currently defined in ANILCA.\n       Section 11. This section prohibits the export of all \n     sawlogs, pulp logs, utility logs and chips (based on a 90% \n     test). It also permits the State of Alaska to decide whether \n     or not to allow the export of timber from timber sales on \n     state lands.\n       Section 12. Section 12 directs the Secretary of Agriculture \n     to study the prospects for encouraging value added \n     manufacturing utilizing Tongass National Forest timber \n     resources.\n       Section 13. Section 13 defines terms used in the bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1055. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to \neliminate the requirement for preemployment alcohol testing in the mass \ntransit, railroad, motor carrier, and aviation industries, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n   the omnibus transportation employee testing act amendments of 1995\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould clarify the Department of Transportation's authority with respect \nto preemployment alcohol testing of our transportation workers. The \nbill seeks to make the program originally instituted through the \nOmnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 more effective by \neliminating the requirement for preemployment alcohol testing, and \nmaking the test permissive instead. Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n[MADD], which was very involved in the original bill, recently said \nthat the mandatory pre-employment testing of all applicants \n``regardless of their other qualifications may be unduly burdensome. It \ndoes not seem to make much sense to require that an applicant be tested \nwho did not have the qualifications for the job and who was not going \nto be offered a position.'' I agree with MADD, and so does Secretary \nPena, who has asked that I sponsor this clarifying legislation. The \nlegislation, if enacted, could save the affected industries about $30 \nmillion. It is an effort to streamline the Department's regulations and \nmake them more reasonable, while not changing in any way our commitment \nto eliminating the use and abuse of alcohol and drugs.\n  From 1987 until 1991, I fought to require drug and alcohol testing of \nour transportation system employees. The Commerce Committee reported \nnumerous bills in an effort to improve safety after the tragic rail \naccident at Chase, MD, in which 16 people were killed. The Omnibus \nTransportation Employee Testing Act was considered and passed by this \nbody 13 times before we were able to make it the law of the land as \npart of Public Law 102-143, the Department of Transportation and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992.\n  The act mandated drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive \nemployees in the aviation, rail, truck, and bus sectors. The act was \ndesigned to prevent needless and senseless accidents caused by those \nindividuals who are irresponsibly using and abusing drugs and alcohol \nwhile operating our transportation system. I had heard too much \ntestimony, read too many articles, and seen too many reports of \naccidents where our citizens were put at risk, and injured or killed, \nbecause of the foolish actions of some. I said when the bill was passed \nthat the vast majority of transportation sector workers are highly \ndedicated professionals that do not use drugs or abuse alcohol. Yet, \nthe Act was made necessary to protect workers and travelers from the \nsenseless actions of but a few of their coworkers.\n  The bill today continues our commitment to the traveling public, in a \nresponsible and reasonable manner.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Grams, and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 1056. A bill to prohibit certain exempt organizations from \nreceiving Federal funding; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                the federal advocacy reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am proud to join today with my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Wyoming, Alan Simpson, and several other \ncolleagues, in introducing the Federal Advocacy Reform Act of 1995. In \nreality, this bill is a Taxpayers' declaration of independence from the \nspecial interests.\n  This is not an issue of left-versus-right: It's about principles that \napply across the board:\n  Public money should be spent on the public interest, and not on the \npolitical agendas of special interests. The Federal Government should \nnot give special interests money to pay for lobbying for more money, or \nfor political advocacy. Our effort is about ensuring Government \nintegrity and responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers \nshould not be compelled to fund special interest lobbying that is \nagainst their interests.\n  Many groups who claim to speak for grass roots members or large \ngroups of Americans actually use Federal dollars inappropriately to \namplify the voices of a few.\n  Next week, the Senate is supposed to take up gift and lobbying reform \nbills. People are correctly focused on lobbyists' gifts to legislators; \nbut we also \n\n[[Page S10494]]\nneed to worry about the Government's gifts to lobbyists. Senator \nSimpson and I plan to pursue an amendment like today's bill at that \ntime, next week, when the Senate considers lobbying reform. Mr. \nPresident, our bill is real lobbying reform. It will protect the \ntaxpayers' pocketbooks from the abuse that has gone on too long for the \nbenefit of narrow, special interests.\n  Today, in the House of Representatives, the Appropriations Committee \nwas scheduled to consider an amendment on this same general topic, \nwritten by Congressmen Ernie Istook, Dave McIntosh, and Bob Ehrlich. \nAlthough our specific approaches may differ, our goals are the same. I \ncommend their work and look forward to watching both bodies progress in \nour consideration of this issue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself, Mr. D'Amato. Mr. Bond, Mr. Faircloth, \n        and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 1057. A bill to amend section 1956 of title 18, United States Code \nto include equity skimming as a predicate offense, to amend section \n1516 of title 18, United States Code to curtail delays in the \nperformance of audits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                      Equity Skimming Legislation\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I reintroduce legislation to help the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development deal with the fraudulent \npractice of equity skimming.\n  As the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nOversight, I have investigated a disturbing number of instances of \nfraud.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have been looking at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development's [HUD] subsidy and mortgage insurance \nprograms. This investigation has focused on an outrageous practice know \nas equity skimming.\n  Equity skimming is the term used to describe a particular type of \nhousing fraud. It occurs when an owner of a HUD-insured project takes \nmoney intended to be used to pay the mortgage and provide maintenance \nand upkeep of the project and diverts it for his or her own use. This \ndiversion of funds often causes the owner to default on their mortgage, \nforcing HUD--which guaranteed the loans--to pay the private lender the \nbalance of the mortgage. At this point, HUD assumes the mortgage and \nthe owner is required to make mortgage payments to HUD. Regrettably, \nhowever, the owner often continues to divert funds for personal use \nrather than meet mortgage and other expenses. As a result, these \nprojects often fall into disrepair, forcing the tenants to endure \nintolerable living conditions.\n  The term ``equity skimming'' is somewhat of a misnomer in that the \nactual equity that the owner invests in the project is relatively small \ncompared to the amount skimmed by the owner.\n  The HUD IG estimates that equity skimming has cost taxpayers \napproximately $6 billion to date. HUD has approximately 20,000 total \nprojects in its insured mortgage portfolio, totaling over $40 billion. \nHUD holds another $10 billion in mortgages already in default. An \nadditional $10 billion worth of HUD-insured mortgages are estimated to \nbe at risk of default and in fiscal year 1993 alone HUD paid $965 \nmillion in multifamily housing mortgage insurance claims to private \nlenders. HUD's IG believes that a significant amount of the defaults \nare a result of equity skimming.\n  The tragedy of this fraud goes beyond the waste of taxpayer dollars. \nAs a result of equity skimming, tenants have been forced to live in \nhorrible conditions because needed repairs go unattended to. At the \nsame time, the owners of these projects live the high life while HUD is \nstuck with the cost of insuring the mortgage and rehabilitating the \ndeteriorated project.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of how this shoddy practice has \nworked.\n  In upstate New York, partners in a nursing home claimed to be broke \nand failed to make payments on a $5.1 million HUD-insured mortgage. \nWhile they were defaulting on the mortgage and sticking the taxpayers \nwith the bill, the partners used various guises to divert some $500,000 \nto personal use and paid themselves another $1.7 million in fees for \nunverified services. While these partners were lining their own \npockets, nursing home residents were going without appropriate care.\n  Another case of equity skimming involved a company in Texas, which \nmanaged approximately 86 HUD insured and/or subsidized multifamily \nprojects. Results of a HUD IG audit revealed that $19.6 million of the \nexpenses were either ineligible or questionable because of insufficient \nsupport or evidence; The management company inadequately documented \n$1.2 million in maintenance expenses and lacked documentation for some \n$5.6 million in contracting expenses. The management company also \ndiverted $500,000 in project funds. The projects deteriorated at the \nexpense of HUD, the taxpayers and the tenants who lived in seriously \nsubstandard housing. Due to the management company's lack of \ncooperation with HUD's auditors, HUD was unable to identify all the \ndiversions and unsupported expenses.\n  In yet another case of equity skimming, the owner of four projects in \nTennessee, diverted some $4.7 million for personal benefit after \ndefaulting on the HUD-insured mortgages. The owner also diverted almost \n$800,000 to his wife rather than pay the mortgage. The owner also used \nanother $1 million to pay another loan and diverted $1.2 million to his \nother companies.\n  Because of improper diversion of project funds, the condition of a \nhousing project in Kansas deteriorated leaving the tenants, who were \nreceiving Federal rent subsidies, living in deplorable conditions. \nApartments were roach infested, ceilings were falling down, and doors \nand windows provided neither security nor protection from the weather. \nThe cost to rehabilitate the project came to an estimated $1.4 million \non a property worth $1.8 million.\n  Two other cases of equity skimming in Minnesota cost the Government \nalmost $600,000. In one case, two partners collected rent and \nGovernment subsidies while failing to make full mortgage payments on \ntheir federally insured mortgages. The total cost to the taxpayers in \nthis case was about $425,000. In the other case, two owners of five \nsubsidized buildings collected more than $173,000 in rent while \nneglecting to make mortgage payments.\n  HUD is taking positive steps to crack down on the owners engaged in \nequity skimming. HUD is working to prevent the diversions from \nhappening in the first place but, if this fails, HUD intends to step up \nits efforts to recover the diverted\n moneys. My legislation will give HUD some much needed tools to help \ncurb the problem of equity skimming.\n\n  My legislation has three parts. The first part would allow equity \nskimming to fall under provisions of the Federal money laundering \nstatute. Under current law, when the Federal Government sues project \nowners who steal or misappropriate money from federally insured housing \nprojects, owners are able to protect their ill-gotten gains by \ntransferring these assets to other individuals or parties during the \nlengthy litigation process. Making equity skimming a violation of the \nFederal money laundering statute will allow the Government to seize the \nassets.\n  The second part would make HUD insured mortgage programs subject to \nthe statute which makes it unlawful to obstruct Federal auditors. \nUnfortunately, there is currently some question as to whether this \nexisting statute applies to owners who receive HUD-insured mortgages \nbecause the owners receive no direct Federal payment. Because the \nmortgages are insured and no money goes directly to the owner from the \nGovernment, owners are able to use the ambiguity in the law to \nstonewall Federal auditors. My bill would make clear that owners of \nhousing projects financed with government-insured mortgages are subject \nto the audit obstruction statute. Perpetrators of equity skimming would \nno longer be able to hide their books from Federal auditors.\n  The third provision in the bill requires HUD to provide in its \nagreements with borrowers that HUD could recover from project owners \nany funds lost by HUD as a result of equity skimming. Under this new \nprovision, if an owner is convicted of equity skimming, the owner will \nbe responsible for HUD's entire loss. Currently, HUD is unable to \nrecover any funds it used to pay off the balance of the defaulted \nmortgage even if the borrowers are found guilty of equity skimming.\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation should go far in slamming the door on \nfraudulent owners and managers who take advantage of both taxpayers and \ntenants to line their own pockets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the inspector general at \nHUD, Susan Gaffney, in support of this legislation, and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government makes available mortgage \n     insurance and other assistance to encourage investors and \n     lending institutions to provide housing to low-income \n     individuals and families;\n       (2) in general, this current system functions well;\n       (3) some unscrupulous owners of federally assisted housing, \n     however, have diverted Federal housing subsidies and other \n     funds to personal and other improper uses, while failing to \n     make payments on their insured mortgages or maintain the \n     assisted housing;\n       (4) this practice of diverting funds, known as equity \n     skimming, has cost the Nation's taxpayers an estimated \n     $6,000,000,000; and\n       (5) current law is inadequate to deter or prevent the \n     practice of equity skimming.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF EQUITY SKIMMING AS A LAUNDERING OFFENSE.\n\n       Seciton 1956(c)(7)(D) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``sanction 254 of the National Housing \n     Act (relating to equity skimming),'' before ``or any felony \n     violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act''.\n\n     SEC. 3. OBSTRUCTION OF FEDERAL AUDIT.\n\n       Section 1516(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting ``or relating to any property that is security \n     for a mortgage that is insured, guaranteed, acquired, or held \n     by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to \n     any provision of law described in section 254(a) of the \n     National Housing Act,'' after ``under a contract or \n     subcontract,''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

William S. Cohen,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \n         Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing you to express my \n     appreciation and support of your efforts to address equity \n     skimming in HUD multifamily projects by promoting legislation \n     for more effective enforcement authority.\n       As part of Operation Safe Home, HUD has initiated an \n     aggressive proactive effort to pursue affirmative litigation \n     against owners of multifamily housing projects whose owners \n     misuse project operating funds. The goal of Operation Safe \n     Home is to stop major abuses in HUD programs that result in \n     unacceptable living conditions for the millions of needy \n     people who look to HUD for help. As you know, equity skimming \n     has done much to undermine HUD's ability to provide quality \n     affordable housing and has significantly impacted the cost of \n     doing so.\n       A primary objective of the Equity Skimming aspect of \n     Operation Safe Home is to create an enforcement program that \n     provides an effective deterrent and recovery mechanism for \n     the misuse of income and assets at projects having HUD \n     insured or Secretary-held mortgages.\n       One of our goals is to initiate changes to statutes, HUD \n     regulations, and contracts with HUD program participants that \n     will facilitate the application of enforcement actions. Your \n     efforts to change statutes to make equity skimming a money \n     laundering offense, hold owners personally liable for related \n     losses incurred by the Federal Government, and to deter the \n     obstruction of Federal audits, are significant. Such statutes \n     will enable us to better ensure compliance with the \n     requirements for the operation of assisted multifamily \n     housing in a decent and safe manner for all of those who rely \n     upon HUD for housing.\n       If I can be of any further support or assistance to your \n     efforts for addressing these important enforcement issues, \n     please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Gaffney,\n                                                Inspector General.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1058. A bill to provide a comprehensive program of support for \nvictims of torture; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the comprehensive torture victims relief act of 1995\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce the Comprehensive \nTorture Victims Relief Act of 1995. I am joined today by Senators \nSpector, Hatfield, Jeffords, Harkin, Moynihan, and Kennedy, as original \ncosponsors of this measure. This bipartisan legislation outlines a \ncomprehensive strategy for providing critical assistance to refugees, \nasylees, and parolees who are torture survivors in the United States \nand abroad. It is an important blueprint for an overall approach to the \nserious problem of torture. This legislation provides a focus and a \nframework for a newly reenergized debate about where torture survirors, \nand our response to the practice of torture by other countries, fit \nwithin our foreign policy priorities.\n  The bill authorizes funds for torture rehabilitation programs, both \nhere and abroad. It also increases the U.S. contribution to the U.N. \nVoluntary Fund for Torture Victims. It is similar to legislation \nintroduced toward the end of last year by myself, and Senator \nDurenburger and Harkin. The bill is being supported by over 65 \norganizations concerned with human rights issues. This legislation is \nalso similar to H.R. 1416, introduced earlier this year in the other \nbody by Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey and cosponsored \nby a bipartisan group of ideologically diverse\n Representatives ranging from Representative Hyde to Representative \nFrank, and including Representatives Lantos, Wolf, Rohrabacher, Yates, \nPelosi, Sabo, McKinney, and Vento. With such bipartisan support, I hope \nthat Congress will move quickly to enact this important legislation.\n\n  While the huge cuts in foreign aid programs that have been proposed \nin Congress will make even a modest expansion of torture treatment \nassistance doubly difficult, I want to do everything I can to see the \nkey provisions of this bill enacted into law. I hope that enactment of \nthis legislation will be a watershed in the movement to garner broader \npublic and private support, both here and abroad, for much-needed \ntorture rehabilitation programs.\n  Specifically, the Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act would \nauthorize funds for domestic refugee assistance centers as well as \nbilateral assistance to torture treatment centers worldwide. It would \nalso change our immigration laws to give a priority to torture \nsurvivors; provide for specialized training for U.S. consular personnel \nwho deal with torture survivors; and commission a comprehensive study \nby the National Institutes of Health on the numbers and geographical \ndistribution of refugees and asylees who are torture survivors now in \nthe United States. That study should help refine our goals and then \nhelp us to target those people in need of rehabilitation assistance.\n  Finally, the bill would allow an increase in the U.S. contribution to \nthe U.N. Voluntary Fund for Torture Victims, which funds and supports \nrehabilitation programs worldwide. In 1994, this fund contributed over \n$3.7 million to 106 projects in 60 countries. I believe that continuing \nto expand the U.S. contribution to the fund is necessary as a show of \ngenuine U.S. commitment to human rights, and I will continue to push \nuntil these programs receive the funding they need and deserve.\n  This bill would not cause an increase in the Federal budget deficit \nbecause spending would be reallocated from among funds already provided \nfor in \n\n[[Page S10496]]\nFederal law. For example, as a demonstration of our commitment, the \nUnited States could reallocate funds to these rehabilitation programs \nfrom military assistance to foreign governments which torture their own \npeople, or condone it within their borders. Reducing military aid to \ncountries which practice torture or ignore its existence has a certain \nsymmetry, and would be another way of signifying our opposition to \ntorture.\n  Mr. President, the practice of torture is one of the most serious \nhuman rights issues of our time. Governmental torture, and torture \nbeing condoned by officials of governments, occurs in at least 70 \ncountries today. We have seen this most horribly demonstrated recently \nin Bosnia, where torture, rape, and other atrocities have become \ncommonplace. We can and must do more to stop torture, and to treat its \nvictims. Treating torture victims\n must be a much more central focus of our efforts as we work to promote \nhuman rights worldwide.\n\n  Without active programs of healing and recovery, torture survivors \noften suffer continued physical pain, depression and anxiety, intense \nand incessant nightmares, guilt and self-loathing. They often report an \ninability to concentrate or remember. The severity of the trauma makes \nit difficult to hold down a job, study for a new profession, or acquire \nother skills needed for successful adjustment into society.\n  Providing treatment for torture survivors is one of the best ways we \ncan show our concern for human rights around the world. The United \nStates and the international community have been increasingly aware of \nthe need to prevent human rights abuses and to punish the perpetrators \nwhen abuses take place. But too often we have failed to address the \nneeds of the victims. We pay little if any attention to the treatment \nof victims after their rights have been violated.\n  The commitment to protect human rights is one shared by many around \nthe world. In 1984, the United Nation approved the United Nations' \nConvention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment. The U.S. Senate ratified it in April \n1994. Although Congress has taken some steps to implement parts of the \nconvention, we have not yet taken action\n to provide sufficient rehabilitation services in the spirit of the \nlanguage of article 14 of the convention.\n\n  Certainly, there exists a great need for the rehabilitation programs \nsupported by this legislation. The generally accepted estimate of the \nnumber of torture survivors, including refugees, asylees, and parolees \nin the United States, hovers around 200,000--although some experts in \nthe field believe it may be closer to 400,000. In my State of Minnesota \nalone, there are estimated to be over 8,000 survivors of torture. The \nFederal Government's response to this problem so far has been minimal.\n  In Minnesota, we began to think about the problem of torture, and act \non it, over 10 years ago. The Center for Victims of Torture in \nMinneapolis is the only fully-staffed torture treatment facility in the \ncountry and one of a select few worldwide. They just celebrated their \n10th anniversary. The center offers outpatient services which can \ninclude medical treatment, psychotherapy and help gaining economic and \nlegal stability. Its advocacy work also helps to inform people about \nthe problem of torture and the lingering effects it has on victims, and \nways to combat torture worldwide. The center has treated or provided \nservices to hundreds of people over the last 10 years.\n  Some of the often shrill public rhetoric these days seems to argue \nthat we, as a nation, can no longer afford to remain engaged with the \nworld, or to assist the poor, the elderly, the feeble,\n refugees, those seeking asylum--those most in need of aid who are \nright here in our midst. The Center for Victims of Torture stands as a \nrepudiation of that idea. Its mission is to rescue and rehabilitate \npeople who have been crushed by torture, and it has been accomplishing \nthat mission admirably over the last 10 years. It is a light of hope in \nthe lives of those who have for so long seen only darkness, a darkness \nbrought on by the brutal hand of the torturer.\n\n  I would like to thank the distinguished human rights leaders who \nhelped craft this bill, including those at the Center for Victims of \nTorture in Minneapolis and others in the human rights community here in \nWashington and in Minnesota. Without their energy and skills as \nadvocates for tough U.S. laws which promote respect for internationally \nrecognized human rights worldwide, the cause of human rights here in \nthe United States would be seriously diminished. I salute them today. \nWe must commit ourselves to aiding torture survivors and to building a \nworld in which torture is relegated to the dark past. My hope is that \nwe can help bring about a world in which the need for torture treatment \nprograms becomes obsolete. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, \nand I urge its timely passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a partial list of organizations \nsupporting the Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act be printed in \nthe Record along with a copy of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1058\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Torture \n     Victims Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American people abhor torture by repressive \n     governments and other parties. The existence of torture \n     creates a climate of fear and international insecurity that \n     affects all people.\n       (2) Torture is the strategic use of pain to destroy both \n     individuals and society. The effects of torture are long \n     term. Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors and \n     affect future generations.\n       (3) By eliminating leadership of their opposition and \n     frightening the general public, repressive governments use \n     torture as a weapon against democracy.\n       (4) Torture victims remain under physical and psychological \n     threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are \n     not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat \n     torture victims are threatened with reprisals, including \n     torture, for carrying out their ethical duties to provide \n     care. Both the survivors of torture and their treatment \n     providers deserve, and often require, protection from further \n     repression.\n       (5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering \n     the United States have been victims of governmental torture. \n     Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their \n     applications for political asylum to minimize their \n     insecurity and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now \n     live in the United States. They should be provided with the \n     rehabilitation services which would enable them to become \n     productive members of our communities.\n       (6) The development of a treatment movement for torture \n     survivors has created new opportunities for action by the \n     United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and \n     other acts of torture.\n       (7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect \n     and support torture victims and their treatment providers \n     together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.\n       (8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect \n     their families, the United States can help to heal the \n     effects of torture and prevent its use around the world.\n       (9) The United States has ratified the Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, but has not implemented all provisions of the \n     convention.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) In General.--Except as otherwise provided, the terms \n     used in this Act have the meaning given such terms in section \n     101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (2) Torture.--The term ``torture'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, \n     and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual \n     violence by a person acting under the color of law upon \n     another person under his custody or physical control.\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF PERSONS FEARING \n                   SUBJECTION TO TORTURE.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--The United States shall not expel, \n     extradite, or return involuntarily an individual to a country \n     if there is substantial evidence of circumstances that would \n     lead a reasonable person to believe that the individual would \n     fear subjection to torture.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``to return involuntarily'', in the case of an individual in \n     any locale, means the following:\n       (1) To return the individual without the individual's \n     consent, whether or not the return is induced by physical \n     force.\n       (2) To take an action by which it is reasonably foreseeable \n     that the individual will be returned, whether or not the \n     return is induced by physical force.\n\n     SEC. 5. IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES FOR TORTURE VICTIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any alien--\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\n       (1) who presents a credible claim of having been subjected \n     to torture in the alien's country of nationality, or, in the \n     case of an alien having no nationality, the country in which \n     the alien last habitually resided, and\n       (2) who applies for--\n       (A) refugee status under section 207 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act,\n       (B) asylum under section 208 of that Act, or\n       (C) withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of that \n     Act,\n\n     shall be processed in accordance with this section.\n       (b) Consideration of the Effects of Torture.--In \n     considering applications for refugee status, asylum, or \n     withholding of deportation made by aliens described in \n     subsection (a), the appropriate officials shall take into \n     account--\n       (1) the manner in which the effects of torture can affect \n     the applicant's responses in the application and in the \n     interview process or other immigration proceedings, as the \n     case may be;\n       (2) the difficulties torture victims often have in \n     recounting their suffering under torture; and\n       (3) the fear victims have of returning to their country of \n     nationality where, even if torture is no longer practiced or \n     the incidence of torture is reduced, their torturers may have \n     gone unpunished and may remain in positions of authority.\n       (c) Expedited Processing of Refugee Admissions.--For \n     purposes of section 207(c) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act, a refugee who presents a credible claim of having been \n     subjected to torture shall be considered to be a refugee of \n     special humanitarian concern to the United States and shall \n     be accorded priority in selection from the waiting list of \n     such refugees based on compelling humanitarian concerns.\n       (d) Expedited Processing for Asylum and Withholding of \n     Deportation.--Upon the request of the alien, the alien's \n     counsel, or a health care professional treating the alien, an \n     asylum officer or special inquiry officer may expedite the \n     scheduling of an asylum interview or an exclusion or \n     deportation proceeding for an alien described in subsection \n     (a), if such officer determines that an undue delay in making \n     a determination regarding asylum or withholding of \n     deportation with respect to the alien would aggravate the \n     physical or psychological effects of torture upon the alien.\n       (e) Parole in Lieu of Detention.--The finding, upon \n     inspection at a port of entry of the United States, that an \n     alien described in subsection (a) suffers from the effects of \n     torture, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, shall be a \n     strong presumptive basis for a grant of parole, under section \n     212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, in lieu of \n     detention.\n       (f) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Attorney General shall allocate resources sufficient to \n     maintain in the Resource Information Center of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service information relating \n     to the use of torture in foreign countries.\n\n     SEC. 6. SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR CONSULAR, IMMIGRATION, AND \n                   ASYLUM PERSONNEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide \n     training for immigration inspectors and examiners, \n     immigration officers, asylum officers, special inquiry \n     officers, and all other relevant officials of the Department \n     of Justice, and the Secretary of State shall provide training \n     for consular officers, with respect to--\n       (1) the identification of the evidence of torture;\n       (2) the identification of the surrounding circumstances in \n     which torture is practiced;\n       (3) the long-term effects of torture upon the person;\n       (4) the identification of the physical, cognitive, and \n     emotional effects of torture, including depressive and \n     anxiety disorders, and the manner in which these effects can \n     affect the interview or hearing process; and\n       (5) the manner of interviewing victims of torture so as not \n     to retraumatize them, eliciting the necessary information to \n     document the torture experience, and understanding the \n     difficulties victims often have in recounting their torture \n     experience.\n       (b) Gender-Related Considerations.--In conducting training \n     under subsection (a)(4) or subsection (a)(5), gender specific \n     training shall be provided on the subject of interacting with \n     women and men who are victims of torture by rape or any other \n     form of sexual violence.\n\n     SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT ON TORTURE VICTIMS IN THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Study.--The National Institutes of Health shall conduct \n     a study with respect to refugees and asylees admitted to the \n     United States since October 1, 1987, who were tortured \n     abroad, for the purpose of identifying--\n       (1) the estimated number and geographic distribution of \n     such persons;\n       (2) the needs of such persons for recovery services; and\n       (3) the availability of such services.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than December 31, 1997, the National \n     Institutes of Health shall submit a report to the Judiciary \n     Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     setting forth the findings of the study conducted under \n     subsection (a), together with any recommendation for \n     increasing the services available to persons described in \n     subsection (a), including any recommendation for legislation, \n     if necessary.\n\n     SEC. 8.

A bill to amend section 1864 of title 18, United States \nCode, relating to tree spiking, to add avoidance costs as a punishable \nresult; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        TREE SPIKING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I regret that I must come to the floor \ntoday to introduce this legislation. But some extreme preservation \ngroups apparently know no bounds in their zealotry to stop timber \nharvest on national forests. They leave me no choice but to put a stop \nto their insane acts.\n  A preservation group in Idaho has just announced that they have \nspiked trees scheduled to be cut in an active timber sale. This is the \nlast, desperate act of radicals who did not get their way with the \nForest Service or in court. To gain their objectives, they are willing \nto jeopardize the lives of men and women working in the woods and in \nthe sawmill. The possibility of a head rig exploding as it hits a spike \nbothers them not at all.\n  There should be no controversy over this timber sale. The U.S. \nCongress specifically guaranteed that this particular Cove-Mallard area \nof the Nez Perce National Forest was to be used for multiple-use \npurposes. On that basis, the Forest Service completed their forest plan \nand the appropriate NEPA documents for timber harvest. The radicals did \nnot like that, so they appealed the NEPA decision. Their appeal was \ndenied.\n  The radicals did not like being denied so they filed suit claiming \nviolations of NEPA and the National Forest Management Act. The court \ndisagreed. It found that the Forest Service had properly applied all \nthe environmental laws in awarding the timber sale contracts in Cove-\nMallard. So, logging began in Cove-Mallard.\n  Most of all, the radicals do not like logging, so they have taken \nthis last, desperate act to force their wishes on all the rest of us. \nThey have spiked trees in the Cove-Mallard timber sale.\n  And they brag about it. They brag that they have used ceramic spikes \nwhich cannot be found by metal detectors. They brag they have spiked \nthe trees far up the stem of the tree so as to hide them and assure \nthey cannot be disposed of easily when found.\n  This tree-spiking incident just proves that some preservation groups \nwill not take no for an answer--even when that ``no'' comes from the \nCongress and from the courts. They feel their mission is beyond the \nlaw.\n  Well, it is not. My legislation will exact a heavy price from those \nwho break the law. It will amend Public Law 100-690 to add strong \npenalties for the disruption, expense, and damage of tree spiking.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in condemning this outrageous act. \nI ask their support to move this legislation very quickly as a signal \nthat Congress will simply not tolerate this kind of blackmail.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Nunn):\n  S. 1062. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to increase the purchasing power of individuals and employers, \nto protect employees whose health benefits are provided through \nmultiple employer welfare arrangements, to provide increased security \nof health care benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the employer group purchasing reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I introduce the Employer Group \nPurchasing Reform Act of 1995 for myself and my Democratic colleague \nSenator Nunn. Our bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct of 1974 (ERISA) in three significant ways. First, we provide \nincreased protection for approximately 46 million employees in self-\nfunded employee benefit health plans. Second, we increase the \npurchasing power and affordability of health insurance for small \nemployers by putting into place the States ability to crack down on the \nfraudulent and abusive practices used by unscrupulous multiple employer \nwelfare arrangement (MEWA) operators that have left thousands of small \nbusinesses and their employees without health insurance. We then make \nthe way for voluntary health plan purchasing coalitions to flourish.\n  This bill complements S. 1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act of \n1995, which is the bi-partisan bill that Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy \nintroduced last week, of which I am proud to be an original co-sponsor. \nAs I said last week, the foundation for incremental health reform is a \nwell-functioning private market. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes great \nstrides in addressing many of the problems in the insured market and \nalso begins to level the playing field in both the insured and self-\ninsured markets by applying the same national rules to both segments of \nthe marketplace.\n  This Health Insurance Reform Act deals with one of the central \nconcerns for all Americans, knowing their health insurance will be \nportable from job to job. Generally, portability means all people who \nhave insurance today will be able to purchase affordable insurance \ntomorrow, even if they get sick, or change or lose their jobs. In order \nfor this to occur, we have to convert the rules in today's insurance \nmarket, which reward excluding people, into rules where health plans \nmust take all comers. The Health Insurance Reform Act takes a giant \nstep toward this goal.\n  S. 1028 provides much needed improvements at the national level, but \nat the same time allows States the flexibility they need to move ahead \n\n[[Page S10499]]\nwith their own reform efforts. Unfortunately, unless we make greater \nstrides in leveling the playing field between the ERISA self-funded \nmarket and the insured market, the current trend of more and more \nbusinesses moving from the insured State regulated market to the self-\ninsured federally regulated market, as documented in a soon to be \nreleased GAO report, will continue.\n  You may ask what is self-insured or self-funded anyway, and why \nshould I be concerned about this trend? Well, self-funding is merely a \npay-as-you-go financing mechanism used by employers and unions to fund \nhealth benefits for employees. The term is used synonymously for any \nERISA health plan--but--in actuality ERISA health plans can be either \ninsured or self-funded. The irony is that the term self-funded is never \nused in ERISA and therefore has never been defined. This lack of \nclarity about how much risk an ERISA plan must assume to be self-funded \nhas caused havoc in the insured marketplace regulated by the States. \nThis fragmentation has caused prices in the insured marketplace to \ncontinue to rise because of the risk segmentation. In addition, it is \nthe insured market that gets assessed for providing subsidies for State \nhigh risk pools.\n  Employers choose to self-fund for basically two reasons. First, it \nprovides greater flexibility and uniformity in benefit plan design and \nsecond, if you have a healthy workforce it costs less to provide your \nemployees health benefits. Unfortunately, when some employers who self-\nfund experience an employee with a catastrophic illness they contain \ntheir costs by lowering life-time limits of health coverage. Our bill \nwould prohibit this practice.\n  Many employees who are in self-funded ERISA plans are not aware of \nthis fact because many of the large insurance companies, like Cigna, \nadminister the claims and the employees' insurance card will usually \nsay Cigna on the front. If a problem occurs with the plan most people \nwill file a complaint with a State insurance department only to find \nout there is nothing the State can do because the plan is under ERISA \nand lacks many of the protections afforded people with insured plans.\n  When ERISA was passed, over 20 years ago, the many years of thought \nand architecture that went into the pension provisions that gave \nemployees real security regarding their retirement were not duplicated \nin the health arena. As a matter of fact, the broadly drafted language \nof the preemption clause actually took protection away from employees \nwho were not in an insured health plan.\n  A major reason the drafters did not take the same precision in the \nhealth benefit area was the certainty that this was not necessary \nbecause national health reform was just right around the corner. Well, \nhere we are in 1995 still talking about health reform. As a matter of \nfact the talk has moved from the national front of last year toward \nlooking to the States to move forward with reform. But the States are \nonly able to reform the insured market. It is up to Congress to address \nthe problems ERISA preemption has caused in the private market. If we \ndo not figure out a way to level the regulatory playing field in the \nmarket we are never going to have a solid foundation for market based \nhealth reform.\n  The Employer Group Purchasing Reform Act levels the playing field\n   in some significant ways. First, we define self-funding to make it \nclear that employers must assume substantial financial responsibility \nif they are to be afforded preemption from State insurance laws. \nSecond, it emulates the portability protection individuals have when a \ngroup health plan disbands. Americans who purchase health insurance \nhave the protection of State guarantee funds in the event a health \ninsurer goes belly-up. Individuals who are in self-funded plans will \nnow be assured a 3 month conversion policy in the event their employer \ngoes out of business. Employees will no longer face a double whammy of \nlosing a job and also their health insurance. Rather than have the \nFederal Government regulate and determine the appropriate solvency \nrequirements for self-funded plans this bill has the market set the \nstandards. Our bill will require self-funded plans to purchase \ninvoluntary plan termination insurance in the event of bankruptcy.\n\n  As I mentioned when the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was introduced last \nweek, I was most grateful for the inclusion of the health plan \npurchasing coalition section of S. 1028. I believe that the key to \nmaking health insurance more affordable for individuals and small \nemployers is properly designed voluntary group purchasing arrangements. \nThe health plan purchasing coalitions in our bill are very similar to \nthose in S. 1028 except that we allow the coalition more flexibility in \nthe design of the benefits offered through the multiple health plans in \nthe coalition.\n  Employer group purchasing is not a new concept. Many employers have \nbeen pooling funds and contracting with entrepreneurs to offer health \nbenefits to their employees at reduced rates, for many years, through \nsomething defined as MEWA's under ERISA. A MEWA is an arrangement where \ntwo or more employers group together to purchase health benefits. This \ndefinition, added to ERISA by the 1982 Erlenborn amendment, is very \nbroad and encompassed all types of insurance-like arrangements that \ninvolve more than one employer, regardless of their corporate \nstructure, insurance status, or status as an employee welfare benefit \nplan. Categorizing the various types of MEWA's is difficult primarily \nbecause different people use different terms to refer to the same \nentity.\n  While a number of MEWA's fill an important gap in our present health \nbenefits system, some MEWA administrators have taken advantage of the \nconfusion as to who bears the responsibility for regulatory oversight, \nthe Feds or the States. They have been able to create and run ``Ponzi'' \nschemes designed to take premium payments with no intention of covering \nany major health claims. It has taken the States over 10 years to \nfinally get the Federal courts to interpret that self-funded MEWA's \nwere intended to be regulated by the States. Unfortunately, not all \ncourts are in agreement.\n  My esteemed cosponsor of this legislation, Senator Nunn, led the \neffort to uncover the corruption in the operation of fraudulent MEWA's \nwhen he chaired the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He \nwas instrumental in drafting the section of the bill that addresses \nMEWA reform. Simply put, we make it clear once and for all that the \nStates are responsible for regulating all MEWA's. Therefore, the \nnumbers of States that have moved forward in this area will no longer \nhave to be involved in costly litigation, using precious State \nresources, to prove they are the regulators. Hopefully, we have now \npaved the way for other States to do the same. The Employer Group \nPurchasing Reform Act gives clear authority for State's to shut down \nfraudulent MEWA's and clear authority to certify the well designed and \ndefined health plan purchasing coalitions which do not assume risk and \nare membership driven.\n  At this time, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate my \ncolleague in the House, Congressman Fawell, for leading efforts in the \nHouse to address the MEWA problems. Although we have taken different \napproaches to resolving this problem, I look forward to working with \nhim and the cosponsors of his bill in finding the best way for small \nbusinesses to group together and finally get the same purchasing power \nin the market that has previously only been afforded to the large \nemployers.\n  I won't take the time now to go over the rest of this bill but would \nask unanimous consent to include a section-by-section analysis of he \nbill in the Record.\n  I am very excited about the bipartisan approach taken by both the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act and the Employer Group Purchasing Reform \nAct. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the Labor \nCommittee to make improvements in these bills and then take the best of \nthese bills and report a bipartisan bill out of committee that we all \ncan be proud to bring to the floor of the Senate this year.\n  There being no objection, the section-by-section analysis was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of Employer Group Purchasing Reform Act of \n                                  1995\n\n\n              title I--employee group health plan security\n\n       Section 101. Employee Benefit Group Health Plan Non-\n     Discrimination Requirements. Prohibits discrimination \n     practices; \n\n[[Page S10500]]\n     limits waiting periods based on preexisting conditions; requires credit \n     for qualifying previous coverage; prohibits lifetime limits.\n       Non-discrimination. Prohibits health plans (fully-insured \n     or self-insured) from denying coverage based on health \n     status, medical condition, claims experience, medical \n     history, anticipated medical needs, or disability. Plans may, \n     however, offer discounts to members who participate in \n     programs of health promotion or disease prevention.\n       Preexisting Conditions. Limits preexisting condition \n     waiting periods to 12 months from enrollment, and then only \n     if the condition was diagnosed or treated in the 6 month \n     period prior to enrollment. Health plans may not impose a \n     preexisting condition limitation to newborns or pregnancies.\n       Credit for Qualifying Previous Coverage. If a new health \n     plan participant was still enrolled in qualifying coverage \n     under another health plan within 30 days of enrollment in the \n     health plan, the health plan must reduce its preexisting \n     condition period by one month for each month the participant \n     was enrolled in the previous qualifying coverage.\n       Lifetime limits. A health plan may not impose catastrophic \n     or lifetime limits on any provision of its coverage.\n       Section 102. Disclosure Requirements. Enhances the plan \n     notification, disclosure and termination requirements for \n     ERISA health plan (fully insured or self-insured). Provides \n     increased security of health benefits for employees enrolled \n     in employer-sponsored plans.\n       Insurer Notification. Requires insurers to disclose, prior \n     to selling a policy to an employer, information relating to \n     rate changes, renewability, preexisting condition provisions, \n     benefits.\n       Self-Funded Health Plans. Requires self-funded plans to \n     inform participants that the Plan is governed by federal law, \n     and is not subject to state laws relating to licensure, \n     benefits, and solvency. Plans also must inform participants \n     of the individual participant's liability for services should \n     the plan deny benefits of become insolvent. Plans must inform \n     participants of material changes in the terms of the plan.\n\n\n       section 103. proof of plan involuntary termination policy.\n\n       Notification to participants. Requires plans sponsors to \n     notify each participant of the termination of a health plan \n     (fully insured or self-insured) as least 90 days prior to the \n     termination. Employers may not modify benefits or \n     contributions levels in the 90-day period before termination.\n       Termination Policy Required. Requires self-funded health \n     plans to purchase an involuntary termination policy, which \n     must provide participants 90 days of coverage beyond the \n     plan's termination date. This gives participants 3 months of \n     protection in case of insolvency of a self-funded plan. An \n     exception exists for single-employer plans with a AAA bond \n     credit rating, and for multiemployer plans that meet the \n     requirements of Sec. 302 of the Labor Management Relations \n     Act.\n\n\n         title II--multiple employer welfare arrangement reform\n\n       Section 201.

Clarifies the status of plans \n     maintained by MEWAs by providing that even if a MEWA is not \n     treated as a benefit plan for ERISA purposes, each employer \n     participating in a MEWA will be treated as maintaining \n     (through the MEWA) a benefit plan, and the employer's \n     employees will be treated as the plan's participants.\n       MEWA Definition. Amends the definition of MEWA to include \n     certain employee leasing arrangements.\n       MEWA Registration. Requires MEWAs to register annually with \n     the Department of Labor.\n       Common Control. Clarifies the definition of common control \n     for single employer arrangements.\n       Section 202. Modification of Preemption Rules for Multiple \n     Employer Welfare Arrangements. Provides that state insurance \n     laws apply to any MEWA which is an employee group health \n     plan.\n       Section 203. Application of Criminal Penalties. Outlines \n     felony criminal penalties for false representation of the \n     MEWA product to any employer, employee, sponsor, State, or \n     the Department of Labor.\n\n\n              title III--health plan purchasing coalitions\n\n       Section 301. Health Plan Purchasing Coalitions. Establishes \n     ``health plan purchasing coalitions'' to provide small \n     employers and individuals meaningful power to negotiate \n     prices in the health care market.\n       Definition.

Mr. President, I today join my colleague Senator Jeffords, \nthe distinguished junior Senator from Vermont, in introducing \nlegislation designed to address certain problems in the area of \nemployer-sponsored health plans. Although the regulation of health \ninsurance companies has been a matter historically left to the States, \nthe provision of health benefits to employees through employer-\nsponsored health plans was subjected to Federal regulation under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA]. Unfortunately, \nthis concurrent system of State regulation of health insurers and \nFederal regulation of employer-sponsored health plans has led to a \ngreat deal of ambiguity when it comes to attempts to provide \nlegislative protection to the participants in employer health plans, \nparticularly those in self-funded plans. This ambiguity has left many \nparticipants in these plans without certain basic insurance safeguards \nand has, in some instances, left employers and employees alike at the \nmercy of unscrupulous promoters of fraudulent insurance schemes.\n  The legislation Senator Jeffords and I are introducing today, the \nEmployer Group Purchasing Reform Act of 1995, attempts to resolve some \nof these problems by amending ERISA to: (1) enhance plan notification, \ndisclosure, and termination requirements for all ERISA health plans; \n(2) clarify the authority of States to regulate certain multiple \nemployer health plan arrangements known as MEWA's; and (3) encourage \nthe purchase of fully-insured health insurance products through the \nformation of employer health plan purchasing coalitions.\n  I am pleased to note that this legislation draws in part upon work \ndone by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations from 1990 \nto 1992. In hearings which I had the privilege of chairing in 1990, and \nin a subsequent report, the Subcommittee revealed how the promoters of \nfraudulent insurance plans have been able to use the MEWA provisions of \nERISA as a shield with which to repel the legitimate efforts of State \ninsurance regulators to protect consumers. As a result, unsuspecting \nemployers and employees have been bilked of millions of dollars and \nhundreds of thousands of working men and women have been left with \nworthless insurance policies, unpaid medical bills and, in some \ninstances, an inability to obtain future health care coverage.\n  The idea behind MEWA's is a laudable one. Small employers who \notherwise might not be able to afford health insurance coverage for \ntheir employees group together in an arrangement which allows them to \nleverage their purchasing power in order to obtain \n\n[[Page S10501]]\ncoverage at reasonable rates. Unfortunately, the laudable idea has been \nsubverted by greed. Preying upon the legitimate desires of small \nbusinessmen, the promoters of fraudulent MEWA schemes have lured \nemployers into enrolling their employees in what appear to be \nattractive health benefits plans at low premium rates. In reality, \nhowever, many of these plans are actuarially unsound, maintain little \nor no\n reserves, and are constantly subjected to exorbitant fees, \ncommissions, and in some cases, outright looting.\n\n  Much to the chagrin of Congress and the States, these promoters have \nbeen able to use the provisions of the ERISA statute to further their \nschemes. In the first instance, they know that ERISA effectively \nprohibits States from applying their insurance laws to employee benefit \nplans, including those plans which offer health insurance. At the same \ntime, they also know that ERISA provides little, if any, substantive \nFederal regulation of these plans. For example, ERISA contains no \nstandards as to minimum reserve levels, contribution levels, or the \nestablishment of a guaranty fund, all of which are standard features of \nState insurance regulations. By claiming status as an employee benefit \nplan, the promoters of fraudulent MEWAs are thus able to evade the \nregulatory requirements of State law without having imposed upon them \nany comparable requirements under Federal law.\n  In 1992, I introduced legislation to correct this situation. That \nlegislation, the Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement Reform Act of \n1992, sought to make clear that MEWAs may be subjected to State \ninsurance regulation regardless of their status as an employee benefit \nplan under ERISA. Although my legislation was not enacted in 1992, I am \npleased to join with Senator Jeffords today to once again attempt to \nresolve this issue.\n  The legislation which we are introducing today will clarify the \nauthority of the States to regulate MEWAs. Quite frankly, it is \ninconceivable to me that Congress could ever have intended that a \nproduct that walks like insurance, talks like insurance, and acts like \ninsurance could somehow, by invoking the name of ERISA, avoid the \nsafety and soundness protections of State insurance law.\n  The legislation also, for the first time, provides substantive \nregulatory requirements for all ERISA health benefit plans in the areas \nof plan disclosure, notification, and termination. One of the major \nproblems the permanent subcommittee found in investigating MEWA fraud \nwas that employers and employees alike really had little understanding \nof the nature of the plans in which they had enrolled. In particular, \nthey often had no idea that most of these plans were self-funded and \nthat there was no guarantee that claims would be paid. This legislation \nwill finally ensure that employees are provided with that basic \ninformation.\n  Finally, our legislation attempts to encourage the laudable idea \nwhich attracted employers to MEWAs in the first instance. By providing \nfor the creation of health plan purchasing coalitions, our legislation \nrecognizes the difficulty many small employers have in obtaining \naffordable health care coverage for their employees. This legislation \nthus seeks to encourage employers to group together in order to \nleverage their purchasing power by providing a limited preemption of \ncertain State insurance laws for such groups. At the same time, we want \nto make sure that these coalitions are not subverted by the same types \nof unscrupulous promoters who peddle fraudulent MEWA plans. The \nlegislation therefore makes it clear that health plan purchasing \ncoalitions may not assume any financial risk with respect to any health \nplan and may not provide anything other than fully-insured health plans \nto their members.\n  I believe that these provisions will go a long way toward providing \nthe millions of Americans who receive their health benefits through \ntheir place of employment with certain basic protections that will \nensure that the health benefits they are promised will be there when \nthey need them. I am pleased to join with Senator Jeffords in this \neffort, and I look forward to working with him and my other colleagues \nin the Senate in addressing this important issue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 1063. A bill to permit State and local governments to transfer--by \nsale or lease--Federal-aid facilities to the private sector without \nrepayment of Federal grants, provided the facility continues to be used \nfor its original purpose, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n               THE FEDERAL AID FACILITY PRIVATIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one of the great challenges facing \ngovernments throughout this country, at all levels, is how to find the \nfunds to maintain our basic public works infrastructure. Another \nchallenge is find ways to bring sound business practices to the \nmanagement of these assets. I believe that privatization is an \nimportant tool that, in many instances, can help government meet both \nof these challenges.\n  Privatization of governmental facilities is not always the answer, \nbut it is something we ought to look at more seriously than we have in \nthe past. And where it makes sense, the Federal Government should do \nwhat it can, not only to undertake it itself, but also to encourage it \nin State and local governments.\n  Unfortunately, there are well-intended Federal policies that may \nserve unnecessarily to discourage useful privatization of certain State \nand local government facilities. I am referring to what are called \nFederal-aid facilities. These are public works facilities belonging to \nState and local governments that have been constructed with the \nassistance of Federal funds. Examples include waste water treatment \nfacilities, airports, parking structures, turnpikes, and public \nutilities.\n  State and local governments that privatize such facilities are \nrequired to make a payment to the Federal Government, based on the \namount of Federal aid that went into the facility. They are also \nrestricted in how they can use the proceeds of the privatization. These \nlimitations have served to discourage such privatizations.\n  These Federal-aid facilities can be quite costly to operate and \nmaintain, but funds for those purposes are increasingly limited. State \nand local authorities will find decreasing assistance in that regard \nfrom the Federal Government, given our severe budget constraints. But \nprivate investment and operation holds out the promise of filling that \nfinancial void, and of bringing new efficiencies to these enterprises. \nI believe we would be wise to seek creative ways of inducing \nnongovernmental funds to supplement these Federal, State and local \ninvestments.\n  Therefore, I think it is important that we remove any unnecessary or \noutmoded barriers to the creation of public-private partnerships in the \noperation of these facilities. Legislation has been introduced in the \nHouse by Congressmen McIntosh and Horn, H.R. 1907, to eliminate these \nbarriers.\n  Today, I am introducing that legislation--the Federal-Aid Facility \nPrivatization Act of 1995--in the Senate. It is my intention to hold \nhearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee on this bill and the \nissues it raises.\n  And it does raise important issues and questions that need thorough \nexploration, before we go further with the legislation. Just as it is \nimportant to allow privatization where useful, it is also important to \ndo so carefully and thoughtfully. Where Federal funds have been \ninvested, we have a responsibility to ensure that this investment \ncontinues to serve the long-term public interest.\n  I believe that this legislation is a very helpful starting point for \nexamining the best way to use privatization as a tool to further the \nenhancement of public assets. I appreciate the effort that has been put \ninto it by our colleagues in the House, and I look forward to working \nwith them on this important reform.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Pell, Mr. Dole, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Leahy, \n        and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1064. A bill entitled The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of \n1995; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             the middle east peace facilitation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for myself and Senator Pell, I offer today \nthe Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995, which is cosponsored by \nthe Senate's leaders, Mr. Dole and Mr. \n\n[[Page S10502]]\nDaschle, along with Senators Mack, Lieberman, Feinstein, McConnell, \nLeahy, and Lautenberg.\n  It is for me a difficult undertaking to participate in any proposal \nthat permits assistance to go to the Palestine Liberation Organization. \nI can never forget the deaths of hundreds of innocent men, women, and \nchildren at the hands of PLO terrorists, and their memory weighs \nheavily on me.\n  We have Biblical instructions to ``guide our feet into the way of \npeace,'' and I have undertaken to follow that dictum. I believe that \nthis legislation demonstrates our commitment to peace--and to the terms \nof that peace as well.\n   Mr. President, I have never tried to tell Israel what to do. It was \nthe choice of the sovereign, democratically elected government of \nIsrael to negotiate peace with the PLO. That would not have been my \ndecision. The United States cannot dictate the terms of Middle East \npeace. It can, however, dictate the terms of our assistance to the \nparties to the peace.\n  In retrospect, previous versions of this legislation have lacked \nneeded strength. My aim in crafting this bill, along with my \ncolleagues, was to tighten and strengthen the standards under which the \nPresident may waive existing restrictions on assistance to the \nPalestinians.\n  Within the realm of possibility, I believe we have succeeded in that \naim, and now provide for a cutoff of assistance should the PLO not meet \nthe strict requirements of this law. The Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct of 1995 contains a cutoff of assistance to the PLO, if, after 6 \nmonths, certain vital conditions are not met.\n   Mr. President, this legislation requires that the PLO, among many \nother things: Eschew and condemn violence, and bar those who commit \nsuch acts from participating in Palestinian institutions; keep to \ncommitments, and annul those portions of the Palestine National \nCovenant which call for the destruction of the State of Israel; observe \ninternational norms of human rights and democracy; disarm gun-toting \nthugs throughout territories controlled by the PLO and fight alongside \nIsrael to arrest, prosecute and imprison terrorists and would-be \nterrorists.\n  If, 6 months from the date of enactment of this act, the President \ncannot certify that the PLO has met these most stringent and specific \nconditions, no money will be provided pursuant to the exercise of this \nact. Period.\n   Mr. President, it is never easy to agree on how to proceed on an \nemotional issue such as the Israeli-Arab peace process. I walked the \nbeautiful hills of Judea and Samaria and it breaks my heart to see \nIsrael relinquish its rights in those territories. It is doing so in \nreturn for what it believes will be a lasting peace. We in the United \nStates must do everything in our power to ensure that it is a real \npeace. I hope this legislation contributes to that effort.\n  This is not a perfect work, but it is the product of many hours of \nlabor and, yes, with some reluctant compromise. I thank Senator Pell \nand his staff for their cooperation in this effort.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms in \nintroducing the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995.\n  This legislation is the follow-on to legislation that Senator Helms \nand I authored last year, which provides the President with the \nauthority to waive certain legislative restrictions against the \nPalestine Liberation Organization.\n  In September 1993, when Yasir Arafat shook Israeli Prime Minister \nYitzhak Rabin's hand on the White House lawn under President Clinton's \napproving gaze, the PLO and Israel began a historic process toward \npeaceful coexistence. In order for the United States to facilitate that \nprocess, the administration requested Congress to provide the President \nwith a certain amount of flexibility to deal with the PLO. The Congress \nagreed, in the form of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1994, \nto provide the President with waiver authority to enable the provision \nof U.S. assistance to the Palestinians and the opening of a PLO office \nin the United States. That authority was provided subject to the \nPresident's certification that the PLO was abiding by its commitments \nwith Israel and with the United States--in other words, that the PLO \nwas behaving responsibly and was true to its word with regard to \nIsrael.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the authorities under the Middle East \nPeace Facilitation Act of 1994 expired at the beginning of this month, \nand the Congress enacted a short-term extension to gain additional time \nto pass new legislation. I am pleased to be joining Senator Helms and \nmy other colleagues in introducing that new legislation today.\n  The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995 is a bipartisan \neffort, and the product of many hours of negotiations between \nRepublican and Democratic Senate offices, as well as representatives of \nthe administration. The legislation, in my view, represents a good \nconsensus view on how to continue U.S. support of the Israel-PLO peace \naccords. I cannot say that I am 100 percent supportive of every word in \nthe legislation, but I am convinced that it is a reasonable approach to \na difficult and complex issue. I wish in particular to express my \nappreciation to Chairman Helms and his staff for their flexibility and \ntheir good faith efforts in the negotiation of the text of the bill.\n  Mr. President, the Middle East peace process has always enjoyed \nbipartisan support, and it serves vital U.S. interests in the region. I \nhope that the Senate will join us in supporting and enacting this \ncritical legislation.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I have decided to join my colleagues in \nsupport of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. I do so with some \nmixed feelings.\n  With Senator Lieberman, I was an author of the concept of PLO \ncompliance and of the legislation that makes that concept the law of \nthe United States. The concept of PLO compliance is at the heart of the \nentire peace process. We often say that the peace process strikes a \ndelicate balance between strict demands on the PLO and understanding \nthe difficulties they face in making peace with Israel. Frankly, there \nare times when it is difficult to accept that balance. What \ndifficulties can there be to renouncing terror, and to abandoning vows \nto destroy Israel?\n  Here I would like to draw attention to what this legislation \ncontains, because there must be no mistake: The Congress is disturbed \nby the PLO's record since its decision to make peace with Israel. I \nwould like, here, to thank my colleagues, Senators Helms and Pell, who \nworked extremely hard together to draft this legislation.\n  This legislation moves us closer to a cut-off of aid, which is the \ninescapable result of the PLO's failure to fulfill its promises. This \nlegislation is very critical of the PLO. It incorporates all the \npromises of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement dealing with prevention of \nterrorism, abstention and prevention of incitement and hostile \npropaganda, the operation of armed forces other than the Palestinian \nAuthority, weapons offenses, extradition of criminal suspects and other \nlaw enforcement and rule-of-law issues.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of accountability. The \nPresident must certify that aid is being used for the purposes Congress \nintends. This is a standard that cannot be evaded. We will be watching \nthe PLO closely. We are helping the Palestinian Authority financially \nbecause it helps Israel and it helps ordinary Palestinians who \ndesperately need health care, education, and other assistance. We are \nnot providing aid to be wasted or siphoned away by Palestinian \nAuthority officials, or to help them, in any way, evade their \ncommitments.\n  This legislation also lets the administration know that its approach \nto PLO compliance needs improvement, and expressly requires \ncongressional notification of the President's determinations regarding \ncompliance. Here I would note that to the extent that the State \nDepartment accepts and minimizes PLO violations, the Department permits \nthe PLO to imagine that its commitments may be obviated. We do not \nbelieve that this is the administration's intent. However, we are \nequally sure that it is the inevitable outcome of the failure of U.S. \npolicy to clearly address PLO compliance.\n  The current situation cannot go on indefinitely. The Palestinian \nAuthority \n\n[[Page S10503]]\nmust make a choice. Either it recognizes that its commitments to Israel \nform the basis of a permanent peace, or it continues the charade of \ncompliance until the peace process is irreparably damaged. The sooner \nthe Palestinian Authority realizes that these commitments are \ninescapable and will not be overlooked by the international community, \nthe sooner the peace process will become simply peace.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act [MEPFA] of 1995 \njoining the majority and minority leaders, Senators Dole and Daschle, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenators Helms and Pell, my coauthor of the 1989 PLO Commitments \nCompliance Act, Senator Mack, and Senator Feinstein. This act supports \ncontinued progress in the important process of achieving a stable, \nlasting peace for Israel and the Middle East. This act alone will not \nbring peace to this troubled region, but without it the task becomes \nexceedingly difficult if not impossible. America's support for the \npeace process has been long, steady and essential. The Middle East \nPeace Facilitation Act of 1995 enables the United States to continue \nthe important role we have played and must continue to pay.\n  Much of the road to a secure peace remains ahead of us. Yet we must \nnot forget how much progress has already been made. Prime Minister \nRabin and Chairman Arafat have taken considerable risks--both personal \nand for their people--to reach the point we are at today. The United \nStates, and most especially President Clinton and Secretary \nChristopher, has remained by the side of the negotiators every step of \nthe way--facilitating the process, prodding where necessary, and, \nalways, supporting the negotiating parties. It is critical that the \nprovisions which MEPFA allows--waiver of certain restrictions and \nauthorities--remain in force if we are all to remain on the path to \npeace.\n  I continue to believe that PLO compliance with its commitments \nremains an essential element in the quest for peace. There is little \ndoubt that the Palestinian Authority has not yet fulfilled all the \ncommitments Chairman Arafat made in the declaration of principles \nsigned at Oslo and other agreements reached between Israel and the PLO.\n  The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995 maintains conditions \nand reporting requirements critical to ensure that the PLO commitments \nare carried out. This act strengthens the requirements which the \nPalestinian Authority must meet in order for United States aid and \nwaiver authorities to continue. It takes into account many of the \ncriticisms which have, correctly, been made of existing legislation. \nThe act makes far clearer the linkage between United States assistance \nand the firm obligation of the Palestinian Authority to comply with all \nthe commitments it has freely made. There should be no confusion that \nthe United States--and the cosponsors of this bill--is intent on seeing \nthis process through to a real peace brought about by both sides \nnegotiating in good faith and fulfilling their obligations.\n  The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act has been a vital component of \nthe Middle East peace process, and has served as an effective and \npowerful tool in monitoring and compelling PLO compliance with its \ncommitment to peace and fighting terror and extremism. This bill \nstrengthens MEPFA. The peace process and this bill deserve our full \nsupport.\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats] was added as a cosponsor of S. 327, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide clarification for the \ndeductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the \nbusiness use of the home.\n\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] was added as a cosponsor of S. 641, a bill to \nreauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 724\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the name of the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. \nKassebaum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 724, a bill to authorize the \nAdministrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Programs to make grants to States and units of local \ngovernment to assist in providing secure facilities for violent and \nchronic juvenile offenders, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 837\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the names of the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Rockefeller], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], the \nSenator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], the Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nDole], the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], the Senator from \nIndiana [Mr. Lugar], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], the Senator \nfrom Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], and the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. \nPell] were added as cosponsors of S. 837, a bill to require the \nSecretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the 250th \nanniversary of the birth of James Madison.\n\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the name of the Senator from Florida [Mr. \nGraham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 890, a bill to amend title 18, \nUnited States Code, with respect to gun free schools, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Pressler] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 907, a bill to amend the National Forest Ski \nArea Permit Act of 1986 to clarify the authorities and duties of the \nSecretary of Agriculture in issuing ski area permits on National Forest \nSystem lands and to withdraw lands within ski area permit boundaries \nfrom the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws.\n\n\n                                 S. 940\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n940, a bill to support proposals to implement the United States goal of \neventually eliminating antipersonnel landmines; to impose a moratorium \non use of antipersonnel landmines except in limited circumstances; to \nprovide for sanctions against foreign governments that export \nantipersonnel landmines, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                  969\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the names of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] and the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 969, a bill to require that health plans provide \ncoverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother and child following \nthe birth of a child, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         SENATE RESOLUTION 146\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnston, the name of the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution \n146, a resolution designating the week beginning November 19, 1995, and \nthe week beginning on November 24, 1996, as ``National Family Week,'' \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10491-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10503-S10504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n           THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                BINGAMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1834\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Feingold) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 1817) making appropriations for \nmilitary construction, family housing, and base realignment and closure \nfor the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n1996, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 22, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 127.

Mr. President, the committee has been particularly \ninterested in the proposed large anechoic chamber at Patuxent River, \nMD, a project for which $30 million has been appropriated to date. The \nCommittee has received a letter from the Chief of Naval Operations, \nAdm. Mike Boorda, strongly endorsing this project, which I will ask to \nhave printed in the Record today. This is a major national level \nproject and asset, of great value in the use of modeling and simulation \nto provide more timely and cost effective RDT of naval aircraft. The \nCommittee expects the Department of the Navy to begin expending the \nmoney already appropriated in the next few months, and fully expects \nthat future appropriations will fully fund the facility. I note that \nsome $60 million was authorized for the project. While the committee \nhas not added to the $30 million already appropriated, it is impressed \nwith the importance of the project and encourages the Navy to provide a \ndesign for the chamber that will maximize its long-term utility and \nefficiency.\n  I ask that the letter from Admiral Boorda be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                    Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n                                                    July 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing to inform you of our \n     commitment to proceed with the construction of the Large \n     Anechoic Chamber at Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent River, \n     Maryland. We thank you for your support of our aviation \n     programs and of this future national asset.\n       The proposed Large Anechoic Chamber (MILCON project P-389) \n     is of special interest due to its unique capabilities and its \n     multi-year appropriations. The chamber is a key component for \n     the increased use of modeling and simulation to provide more \n     timely and cost effective RDT of naval aircraft. It will be \n     completely integrated with the existing Air Combat \n     Environment Test and Evaluation Facility. Congress authorized \n     $60.9 million in FY93 for this project. We are proceeding \n     with a plan to construct a complete and useable, shielded \n     Anechoic Chamber which meets the stated intent of Congress.\n       The Navy's commitment to fund supporting materials for the \n     chamber (estimated $9 million of OM) results in an \n     alternative that will construct a complete and capable \n     facility within existing funds. This approach will result in \n     beginning the project this year and provide the core \n     capability along with the flexibility to later complete the \n     project as initially envisioned.\n       An additional appropriations of about $20 million will be \n     necessary to construct the chamber as initially envisioned \n     and to maximize its long term utility and efficiency. Design \n     efforts will be scoped to the available funds; if additional \n     appropriations could be made in advance of the design \n     process, a savings in both design and construction would be \n     course, be realized.\n       We are moving ahead with this project and look forward to \n     its contribution to future state of the art aircraft \n     development.\n       Sincerely & Very Respectfully,\n\n\n                                                  J.M. Boorda,\n\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n\n             statement for the record from senator sarbanes\n\n       I want to thank the distinguished Chairman and the ranking \n     member for their help in including language in the report to \n     accompany the Fiscal 1996 Military Construction \n     Appropriations Bill supporting the construction of a large \n     aneochic chamber at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent \n     River, Maryland.\n       This project--the Nation's first Integrated Test Facility \n     for aircraft--is a top priority of the U.S. Navy. It will \n     allow the Navy to perform flight tests, simulations and \n     threat assessments in an integrated, secure environment, and \n     provide more timely and cost effective research, development, \n     testing and evaluation of naval aircraft.\n       I ask that a copy of the letter from the Chief of Naval \n     Operations for the Navy, Admiral J.M. Boorda, highlighting \n     the importance of this future national asset, be included in \n     the Record, immediately following my statement.\n       Congress authorized $60.9 million for this project in \n     Fiscal 1993, and the committee has provided $30 million over \n     the past three years (1993, 1994 and 1995) for the completion \n     of this facility at Patuxent River. The base already has a \n     small anechoic chamber and associated laboratories that would \n     cost approximately $300 million to replicate. The need to \n     complement these unique facilities with a large chamber was \n     recognized as early as 1988 by the Inspector General at the \n     Defense Department.\n       I fully expect the Navy to submit a budget request to \n     complete this important project in Fiscal 1997 and I hope the \n     Committee will approve the necessary funding.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10504-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10504-S10505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              APPRECIATION TO THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, despite the collapse of efforts \nto enact comprehensive and meaningful regulatory reform, there is \ncredit and thanks that are due to many public-spirited organizations \nand individuals who gave selflessly of their time and talent to make S. \n343 a good, strong, credible bill. Perhaps no single professional \norganization did more to help the U.S. Senate in this regard than the \nAmerican Bar Association and the incoming chair of the ABA \nAdministrative Law Committee, Mr. Philip J. \n\n[[Page S10505]]\nHarter. Administrative law is nowhere as simple as many would make it \nout to be. In the debate on S. 343, there were many unfortunate \nmisstatements and misrepresentations regarding the most basic tenets of \nadministrative law. Few persons were more willing to volunteer their \ntime as a truth squad on such topics than Phil Harter. He gave days and \nperhaps weeks of pro bono time to educate my staff on the intricacies \nof the topics covered by the bill. He helped many other Senate staff as \nwell. Many of the improvements that I was able to suggest to S. 343 \ncame about as a result of discussions with Mr. Harter and other input \nfrom members of the ABA Administrative Law Committee. The ABA continued \nto help Senators during the floor debate with a series of letters that \nprovided staff and members with neutral, professional peer review of \nthe relevant legal issues. When complex issues were under discussion, \nwe could generally count on Phil Harter and the ABA's able Washington \nrepresentative, Gary Sellers, to appear in the lobby for consultations \nwith whomever was willing to avail themselves of their expertise. S. \n343 was a better bill for their tireless efforts. We owe Phil Harter \nand the ABA a great debt of thanks. My only regret is that their \nefforts did not result in a permanent improvement in our Nation's \nadministrative law.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10504-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GEORGE VUKELICH\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

STIFTEL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on June 22, the superior court of my \nhome State held a special session--special not only in the technical \nsense, but in spirit, in its purpose and its meaning. The court met, \nwith all of its current judges and many of its distinguished alumni \npresent, in appreciation of the services of Albert J. Stiftel.\n  I am proud today, Mr. President, on behalf of many other of his \nfellow citizens, to offer another expression of appreciation for Albert \nStiftel, who served on the Superior Court of the State of Delaware from \n1958 to 1990, including 24 years as presiding judge. The quality and \ncharacter of Judge Stiftel's service merit not only our attention and \nappreciation, but also, if we are up to the challenge, our best attempt \nat emulation.\n  My colleagues have indulged me before--indeed, some have joined me, \nin praising the tradition of excellence that has made Delaware's \njudiciary a standard for the Nation. It is a tradition of excellence \nnot only in the administration and dispensation of justice, but in \nprincipled as well as practical bipartisanship, in fun as well as \nfunctional collegiality, and in that often neglected cornerstone of \ndemocratic society, civility.\n  Mr. President, Albert Stiftel embodies that tradition.\n  Albert, as he is by choice most widely known, is pure Delaware: born \nand raised in Wilmington--raised, in fact, in the house where he still \nlives--a graduate of Wilmington High School and of the University of \nDelaware.\n  He entered law school at the University of Virginia in 1939, an \nundertaking interrupted when he was called to duty as a second \nlieutenant in the U.S. Army. As his lifelong friend and longtime \ncolleague on the Delaware bench, retired State Supreme Court Justice \nWilliam Duffy, remarked, ``Albert was born in Wilmington but, like many \nof his generation, he grew up in the South Pacific, including a place \ncalled Guadalcanal.'' After his military service, Major Stiftel \nreturned to the University of Virginia Law School, graduating in 1947.\n  Young Albert Stiftel's years of private practice were driven by a \npublic spirit. Before becoming a judge, he was an attorney for the \nLegal Aid Society, attorney for the Delaware State House of \nRepresentatives, and a Deputy Attorney General. And he was also a \nteacher, a role he wears naturally and with grace.\n  In 1958, my distinguished predecessor in this body, then-Gov. J. \nCaleb Boggs, a Republican, appointed Albert to the superior court. In \n1966, he was appointed as the court's presiding judge by Democratic \nGov. Charles Terry, and he was subsequently reappointed by a Republican \nGovernor, our former colleague in the other Chamber, Pete du Pont.\n  During his long tenure, Judge Stiftel confronted the challenge of \ntimes, both for the community and for the court, that he himself has \ndescribed as ``change and more change.'' Through it all, his leadership \nwon ever-deepening respect.\n  In acknowledging his debt to his predecessor, the current presiding \njudge of superior court, Henry du Pont Ridgely, thanked Judge Stiftel \nfor an example that taught ``the importance of comradeship and \ndemonstrated the work ethic you expect from others, of being even-\nhanded and setting high standards, under-promising, over-delivering, \nand sharing the credit.'' Lessons we would all do well to learn.\n  But despite the universal relevance of his example, Judge Stiftel's \nimpact on the court, and on all who have known him, has been distinctly \npersonal. Another longtime Delaware judicial colleague, now-Vice \nChancellor Bernard Balick, put it this way: ``All of us are unique, but \nAlbert is more unique than most.''\n  Albert Stiftel's defining qualities, as a judge and as a person, are \nhumility, kindness, and compassion. In and beyond superior court, he \nhas been truly the best of teachers and the best of friends--welcoming, \nhelpful, encouraging to all. I am told that the superior court's \n``Judge Stiftel Award'' is reserved for that employee who does the most \nto brighten the lives of his or her colleagues. It is aptly named.\n  As Justice Duffy put it, ``Other judges may have served longer, but I \ndoubt it, or have more entries in Lexis, perhaps, and a few may have \nbeen better administrators--but none has been held in higher personal \nesteem than Albert Stiftel.''\n  Mr. President, I left one quality off the list of Judge Stiftel's \ndefining characteristics, and it will be a glaring omission to anyone \nwho knows him. And in fact, the reason I left it out is that I wanted \nto call individual attention to it. ``It'' is His Honor's sense of \n\n[[Page S10506]]\nhumor. Let there be no doubt that Judge Stiftel's commitment to \nfairness is passionate and sure, but its expression has often been \npunctuated by a one-liner.\n  Vice Chancellor Balick told this story at the June 22 special \nsession: ``There was the time when Albert was presiding in a criminal \ntrial, and the defendant was on the witness stand, exercising his right \nto lie in his own defense. Albert was fooling with the microphone, as \nhe always does. He turned the volume up, which caused a loud screech. \nThat startled the defendant, at which Albert said, `Relax, it's just \nthe lie detector'.''\n  Whether conveyed in wit or wisdom--and usually it is with both--Judge \nStiftel's regard for his colleagues and for the court on which he \nserved has been unwavering and inspiring. As Resident Judge Vincent \nBifferato said, ``He taught me to love this court as he does.'' And \nJudge William Quillen said of Judge Stiftel, ``He has been a \ncheerleader, not only for the court but for each member of the court * \n* * he has made each of us better than we otherwise would have been.''\n  At the special court session, Judge Quillen presented a portrait of \nJudge Stiftel, which will hang in what was known as courtroom No. 1 \nwhen Albert was first appointed to the bench. The portrait was \ncommissioned not by the court, not by the State, not by the Bar \nAssociation, but personally by the judges, past and present, of the \nsuperior court. This public tribute is all the more official coming as \nit does out of the sincere affection, respect, and gratitude of Judge \nStiftel's colleagues.\n  That affection, respect, and gratitude are felt throughout and beyond \nDelaware's legal community, Mr. President, and it is my privilege to \ngive voice to them today. We in Delaware honor Judge Albert Stiftel for \nthe achievements and contributions of his public leadership and for his \ncountless acts of personal kindness and courtesy. He leaves good will \nand good humor, as well as high standards, in his refreshing wake.\n  It is most appropriate that in the portrait that will now be a \npermanent physical presence, as its subject is a permanent spiritual \npresence, in Delaware's Superior Court, Albert Stiftel is doing what he \nhas inspired so many others to do--he is smiling.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10505-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             MAUREEN WOODS\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday and pay tribute to Ms. Maureen Woods. In October of 1994, Ms. \nWoods became the first African-American woman to be appointed Assistant \nAir Traffic Division Manager of the Federal Aviation Administration. \nThis important position is a most fitting recognition of Ms. Woods' \ndistinguished career.\n  Maureen Woods began her service with the FAA in 1974. She rose \nsteadily through the ranks, demonstrating her exceptional ability at a \nvariety of posts throughout the Midwest. She has earned several honors \nin her FAA tenure, including five commendations for performance and \nthree awards for exceptional service.\n  As the Assistant Air Traffic Division Manager, Ms. Woods oversees \n4,300 employees and manages the 4 Air Traffic Control Centers, 8 \nAutomated Flight Service Stations, and 68 air traffic control towers in \nthe 8-State Great Lakes Region. With both the Chicago and Cleveland Air \nTraffic Control Centers, the Great Lakes Region is the busiest in the \nworld.\n  In addition to her service in the FAA, Ms. Woods has also been \nprominent in her community.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday and pay tribute to Ms. Maureen Woods. In October of 1994, Ms. \nWoods became the first African-American woman to be appointed Assistant \nAir Traffic Division Manager of the Federal Aviation Administration. \nThis important position is a most fitting recognition of Ms. Woods' \ndistinguished career.\n  Maureen Woods began her service with the FAA in 1974. She rose \nsteadily through the ranks, demonstrating her exceptional ability at a \nvariety of posts throughout the Midwest. She has earned several honors \nin her FAA tenure, including five commendations for performance and \nthree awards for exceptional service.\n  As the Assistant Air Traffic Division Manager, Ms. Woods oversees \n4,300 employees and manages the 4 Air Traffic Control Centers, 8 \nAutomated Flight Service Stations, and 68 air traffic control towers in \nthe 8-State Great Lakes Region. With both the Chicago and Cleveland Air \nTraffic Control Centers, the Great Lakes Region is the busiest in the \nworld.\n  In addition to her service in the FAA, Ms. Woods has also been \nprominent in her community. She is the coordinator for the Young \nWomen's Ministry of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, as well as \na youth and motivational speaker for her local church. Ms. Woods serves \nas a positive role model for her community and her profession.\n  Mr. President, I want to add my voice to those of Ms. Woods' family \nand many friends in congratulations on this most recent accolade.

Mr. President,\n   2 days ago, President Clinton called me to ask that \n\n[[Page S10507]]\n  I delay the vote on the Dole-Lieberman legislation until after the \nLondon meeting, which ended just a short while ago.\n\n  I agreed to the President's request. Unfortunately, the London \nmeeting was a disappointment--another dazzling display of ducking the \nproblem. Instead of clarity and decisiveness, once again we have \nambiguity and a lowest common denominator approach.\n  Instead of dumping the dual key it has been modified. Instead of \nresponding to the fall of Zepa and Srebrenica, these two eastern \nenclaves have been written off. Most egregiously, the London meeting \nreaffirmed the current failed U.N. operation.\n  In the wake of the fall of Zepa, it is hard for me to imagine that \nanyone still believes that the U.N. mission is viable in Bosnia--that \nwhat we are witnessing is anything but a colossal, collective \ncatastrophe.\n  Yesterday, the Bosnian Presidency building was shelled while the \nEuropean envoy, Carl Bildt, was meeting with the Bosnian President. If \nattacks on Sarajevo continue, what will be the West's response? Another \nmeeting. According to Secretary Christopher, the focus of U.N. efforts \nwill be to open access to the city for humanitarian aid. Yes; the \nBosnian people need food. They also need protection.\n  The London meeting\n   reportedly produced a decision to defend Gorazde through a \nsubstantial response--after a serious warning is given to the Serbs. \nGorazde is already under attack. How much further do the Bosnian Serbs \nhave to go before the warning is triggered?\n\n  The Serbs are becoming more aggressive and more defiant by the hour. \nThe London meeting made it clear there would be no immediate or \ndecisive response except more meetings.\n  In effect, what the Clinton administration and European leaders are \ndoing is trying to manage the conflict--to limit the war's consequences \nwithout providing a solution. Or, as the Bosnian Prime Minister said, \nwithout dealing with the real problem--which is Belgrade-sponsored \naggression.\n  Western leaders in London also called for a cease-fire and more \nnegotiations. It has been 1 year since the Bosnian Government signed \nthe so-called contact group's plan. Why should the Serbs sign now after \nyet another display of fecklessness?\n  It is crystal clear that the London meeting did not produce a \nsolution. It did not result in a policy.\n  I believe that the Senate will not be fooled by administration spin \ndoctors who will no doubt announce great results\n from the London meeting.\n\n  I believe that there is a substantial majority in favor of the Dole-\nLieberman legislation and that the disappointing outcome of the London \nmeeting will only serve to strengthen that support.\n  Once again, I want to emphasize that the Dole-Lieberman legislation \nlifts the U.S. arms embargo after UNPROFOR withdraws. It seems to me \nthat this point is being deliberately ignored and intentionally \nobfuscated by those allied and administration officials who claim that \nthe Dole-Lieberman legislation if passed will be responsible for a U.N. \npull-out. This does not take effect until they are out, so we will not \nbe responsible for a pull-out.\n  No doubt this is a political tactic designed to find excuses for what \nis the inevitable end of the U.N. mission in Bosnia. It may not be \ntoday, may not be tomorrow, but this will end as a consequence of its \nown failed policy. If only administration and allied officials would \nspend as much time designing a new policy as they do designing new \nexcuses for their inability to develop an effective and principled \npolicy. The bottom line is that passage of the Dole-Lieberman bill may \nbe an excuse for U.N. withdrawal, but it will not be a cause.\n  The dire administration predictions of humanitarian disaster have \ncome true--but not because of lifting the arms embargo, but because of \na lack of\n American leadership and a willingness to go along with failure in the \nname of consensus. Despite the paternalistic assertions made by \nadministration officials that they have the best interests of the \nBosnians at heart, the present approach is not humanitarian, it is \ninhumane. First, the Bosnians were corralled into giant refugee camps, \nthen disarmed, and then left unprotected.\n\n  With respect to the assertion that this legislation would give the \nBosnian President the right to send 25,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia I \nwould make three points: First, the commitment to send 25,000 U.S. \ntroops to Bosnia for either a withdrawal or to police a settlement is a \ncommitment that was made by President Clinton--and not pursuant to any \nrequest by the Bosnian Government or the result of any congressional \naction. Second, the days of colonialism are over. The Bosnian \nGovernment is a sovereign government and has the right to tell the \nBritish, French, Dutch, and other forces if and when it wants them to \nleave. Third, President Clinton has yet to make his case to the \nCongress that 25,000 troops are needed for such a withdrawal. Let us \nnot forget that the Dutch troops in Srebrenica negotiated their \ndeparture with the Serbs--they were not rescued by U.S. marines.\n  Let me also indicate, as I was told by the foreign minister just a \nfew days ago, he said there were about only 30 U.N. personnel in \nSerbian-held territory. Somebody said that figure is much higher, maybe \n500, maybe 600; but, again, it would not take 25,000 American troops to \nrescue 30 or 500 or 1,000 U.N. personnel.\n  We have been assured by the Moslems that they would in no way \ninterfere with the withdrawal.\n  Finally, I would like to say that a belated NATO response to the \nbrutal Serb onslaught in the Eastern enclaves is not a substitute for a \npolicy. The U.N. operation is a failure. That is a fact. And no amount \nof reshuffling will change that fact.\n  Neither Bandaids, nor reconstructive surgery will save the U.N. \noperation in Bosnia. Lifting the arms embargo and letting the Bosnians \ndefend themselves is the only policy option which has any hope of \nsaving them--and saving United States credibility.\n  I might point out, the New York Times--which has been struggling with \nthis issue editorially, as many have on the floor, today, and maybe \nthat will be referred to by my colleague from Connecticut--said rather \nflatly, it is time to lift the embargo. It is time to lift the arms \nembargo. If we do not want to Americanize what is happening there, and \nwe want to give this independent nation a right to defend itself, then \nthe course is clear. Lift the arms embargo after withdrawing the U.N. \nforces, and then we believe we can supply the Muslims with weapons. \nThey can be trained in safe places with no hazard, by anybody in the \nUnited States or any United States force who might be involved in any \nweapons or training or whatever.\n  We believe this is not the best solution. There are not any good \nsolutions. It gives an independent nation a right to defend itself and \ngives the people in that nation a right to defend themselves. In my \nview, sooner or later, it will happen.\n  Maybe not this week. Maybe not next week. Maybe not next month. But \nwinter is coming very soon in that part of the world, and I believe \nbefore that happens, U.N. forces will be withdrawn or on the way out. \nThen, perhaps, the Bosnians will have an opportunity to do what they \nwanted to do for some time.\n  I do not mean to dismiss the humanitarian aid that has been provided. \nIt has been helpful in some cases, but unintentionally, the U.N. \nprotection forces have become a barrier, which unintentionally has been \na help to the Serb aggressors, and not to the poor people who are \ntrapped in the enclaves.\n  So far, one has fallen. Another is about to fall. Clearly, everyone \nis in danger.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10506-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the majority \nleader for yielding the floor and for his statement on the latest \ndevelopments from London with regard to the crisis in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I share the sense of disappointment that the Senate \nmajority leader has expressed about the developments in London today. \nThe statement from the London conference is a threat, not a policy, and \na limited threat at that, extending, as it does, to only one of the \nfour remaining safe areas, so designated by the United Nations.\n  Why the conferees would feel that it was critical enough to issue \nthis threat with regard to Gorazde but not with regard to Tuzla, \nSarajevo and Bihac, I do not know. Why the conferees did not speak \nclearly and in a united fashion about opening up the supply road for \nhumanitarian aid to Sarajevo along the Mount Igman Road, I do not know. \nAnd why is there not clarity, at least, yet on the question of the \ndual-key arrangement which has done nothing but frustrate the rare \noccasions when there seemed to be some will to respond to Serbian \naggression by subjecting the desire of military commanders to the \ncontrol of political authorities from the United Nations? There is some \nsuggestion that there is still a dual-key approach for implementing \nthis threat that was issued today about what would happen to the Serbs \nif they attacked Gorazde.\n  There is some indication, though not clarity, that perhaps the \nmilitary commanders on the ground, the U.N. military commanders, will \nbe the ones to have the final say and a decision will not be bounced up \nfor a veto from the U.N. politicians at the top. But that is not clear \nto me, and therefore is also grounds for disappointment in the \ncommunique from the London conference. So I would call the communique \nfrom the London conference a threat, not a policy; and a limited threat \nat that.\n  If, in fact, the threat is carried out, as so many threats against \nthe Serbs before in this war have not been carried out--if this threat \nis carried out, if the Serbs take aggressive action, attack Gorazde, \nthen at least it will be the beginning of an implementation of half of \nthe policy that many of us--I am honored to say including the \ndistinguished Senate majority leader and myself and many others from \nboth parties in this Chamber--have been advocating, appealing for, \ncrying out for, for now 3 years, which is the lift and strike policy.\n  The communique does at last suggest that if the Serbs cross this \nline, which is a narrow line--it is not a broadly drawn line, it is a \nline of protection only around Gorazde--then they will finally be \nsubjected to the substantial and decisive NATO air power which we have \npossessed throughout this conflict and refused to use. Even though \ngoing back 2 or 3 years, at hearings of the Armed Services Committee on \nwhich I am honored to serve, asking the Chief of Staff of the Air Force \nwhether he felt that these raids could be carried out from the air with \nminimal risk to American personnel and maximal probability of success--\nhe said yes.\n  So, from this communique from London, implementing, if the threat is \ncarried through, at least the beginning of one-half of the lift and \nstrike policy, I take some small hope and find some small reason for \nthe Bosnian people, who are understandably cynical and unbelieving, to \nthink that perhaps the international community will finally lift a \nfinger, a hand, to protect them from aggression.\n  But, this threat, even if carried through by the allied powers, does \nnothing to lessen the moral and strategic imperative to lift the arms \nembargo imposed on the nations of the former Yugoslavia. It is illegal \nbecause it denies the people of Bosnia the right they are given under \ninternational law, under the charter of the United Nations, to defend \nthemselves, a basic right that we have as individuals and that nations \nhave under the United Nations Charter. This right has been taken away \nfrom them, not by any great act of international law, but by a \npolitical act, by a decision of the U.N. Security Council in 1991.\n  Looking back at it, a naive, in some sense a cynical decision, or \nmotivated by cynical behavior; an embargo, requested by the Government \nof Yugoslavia in Belgrade, now the Serbian Government, understanding \nthat when Yugoslavia broke apart, as it surely would, and Serbia began \nits aggression, as it clearly intended to, against its neighbors, then \nthe effect of the embargo would leave everyone in that region but the \nSerbs without the arms with which to fight because the Serbs in Serbia, \nby an accident of history and of hate, ended up controlling the \nwarmaking capacity of the former Yugoslavia.\n  Immoral--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  I say the embargo was immoral because we have watched not only \naggression and the frustration of the people to have the means with \nwhich to fight back, the victims, but we have watched genocidal acts. \nWe have watched people singled out because of their religion, in this \ncase Moslem; torn from their homes, herded into concentration camps, \nwomen raped systematically as an act of war--unheard of. Men--again, it \nis happening--between the ages of 18 and 55, herded off allegedly for \ninvestigations to determine whether they were criminals or terrorists, \nbut tortured and then, and we saw this 3 years ago: Concentration \ncamps, emaciated figures, Moslems tortured, unfed, slaughtered.\n  So I say, Mr. President, to my colleagues here in the Senate that the \nmoral and strategic imperative to lift the arms embargo remains \nundiminished by this limited threat and not a policy that was issued \nfrom London today.\n  I hope and strongly believe that when we take up the proposal which \nSenator Dole and I, and many others of both parties, introduced on \nTuesday to lift the arms embargo, that the result will be a resounding \nnonpolitical, nonpartisan, overwhelming majority in favor of lifting \nthe embargo, giving the people of Bosnia the weapons with which to \ndefend themselves, and creating finally the basis of a genuine policy \nthat can impose upon the Serbs some pain for their aggression that will \ngive them finally, and for the first time in this conflict, a reason to \ncome to the peace table to negotiate a just end to this conflict.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10508-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10508-S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  UNITED STATES/JAPAN AVIATION DISPUTE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am cautiously optimistic that last \nnight in Los Angeles progress was made in the United States-Japan \naviation dispute with regard to cargo. Finally, the Government of Japan \nhas agreed to honor the clear terms of the 1952 United States-Japan \nbilateral aviation agreement. Federal Express had been unfairly denied \nthe right to serve numerous Asian cities beyond Japan. Now that the \nJapanese have authorized these routes, Federal Express can finally open \nits new Pacific Rim cargo hub at Subic Bay in the Philippines.\n  I am also pleased with the job done by Secretary Pena in this \ndispute. The Japanese clearly expected us to trade off existing \naviation rights in order to get them to acknowledge rights we already \nhad guaranteed under the terms of the United States-Japan aviation \nagreement. We did not cave in to this blackmail. Had we done so, it \nwould have set a dangerous precedent for all U.S. international \nagreements. Global aviation opportunities for our carriers are critical \nto the long-term profitability of the U.S. airline industry. Secretary \nPena understands this very important point.\n   Mr. President, yesterday I, along with 20 colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle, introduced a resolution calling on the Government of \nJapan to immediately honor the terms of the United States-Japan \nbilateral aviation agreement. I have been developing the resolution \nover a period of several weeks and I understand the Government of Japan \nwas monitoring it closely. I believe the resolution, Senate Resolution \n155, sent a strong signal to the Japanese that the United States Senate \nexpects international agreements to be honored. We should expect \nnothing less when a solemn international agreement is in dispute.\n  In my introductory remarks yesterday, I expressed disappointment that \nthe show-cause order the United States \n\n[[Page S10509]]\nissued to the Japanese on June 19 had not seemed to serve as a wakeup \ncall for the Government of Japan. It was my hope that by introducing \nSenate Resolution 155 simultaneously with the negotiations in Los \nAngeles it would drive home the point that international agreements are \nnot to be unilaterally disregarded. I hope Senate Resolution 155 played \na role in resolving this dispute.\n  Let me say to the cosponsors of this resolution that we still may \nbring it to the floor. We may seek to pass it because the resolution \nalso addresses an important passenger carrier dispute with Japan that \nremains unresolved. What is happening is that Japan has denied our \npassenger and cargo carriers new opportunities to serve countries \nbeyond Japan such as Korea, Malaysia, and so forth. The Japanese refuse \nto recognize ``beyond rights'' guaranteed by our air service agreement. \nThat is what this dispute is all about.\n  Unfortunately, our aviation dispute with Japan over ``beyond rights'' \nis not completely behind us. United Airlines has patiently waited while \nU.S. negotiators focussed on the cargo dispute. Now, the United States \nmust demand the Government of Japan honor the rights of our passenger \ncarriers as well. United Airlines has been wrongly denied the right to \nstart new service between Osaka and Seoul, Korea. This is another clear \nviolation of the United States-Japan bilateral aviation agreement. It \nmust be redressed promptly.\n  Mr. President, let me also say I am angered by some media reports \nfrom Japan declaring victory in the aviation dispute. Let me make this \npoint loud and clear: This was not a victory for Japan. For months the \nUnited States has been offering to talk with the Government of Japan \nabout our bilateral aviation agreement. Quite correctly, the United \nStates said it would do so only after Federal Express' beyond rights \nwere honored by the Japanese. These reports are preposterous.\n  The aviation dispute accomplished nothing for Japan beyond \ntemporarily protecting its inefficient carriers from more head-to-head \ncompetition with our carriers. The dispute did galvanize Congress to \ntake a tough stand in future aviation relations with Japan. It showed \nwhat our Government can accomplish when Congress supports our Secretary \nof Transportation and permits him to negotiate from a position of \npolitical strength.\n  Mr. President, I hope our resolve in the United States-Japan aviation \ndispute sends a strong signal to nations around the world. if you enter \ninto an agreement with the United States, you will not be allowed to \npick and choose those provisions with which you will comply. Agreements \nbetween nations are solemn.\n  So, Mr. President, let me summarize by saying that last night I think \nour Government showed great progress in reaching the cargo aviation \nagreement with Japan. However, we did agree to give them some things in \nexchange for the agreement such as new cargo routes between Japan and \nChicago. That might appear to some that we gave in. Overall, however, I \nthink we stood firm and the cargo agreement is a step forward.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, I called a hearing last week to consider problems our air \ncarriers experience trying to fly beyond Tokyo and beyond Heathrow. \nThere is a system in both directions that prevents our carriers from \nflying beyond these important international gateways.\n  At times, the system which blocks our carriers can be subtle. For \nexample, sometimes the Japanese and British technically comply with our \naviation agreements but they impose certain ``doing business'' problems \nthat prevent our carriers from competing effectively with their \nnational carriers. Among these restrictions on competition are problems \nloading and unloading aircraft and requiring our carriers to use the \nold terminal while the host country carrier uses the modern terminal. \nThere are other barriers that prevent our carriers for serving global \ndestinations from Heathrow and beyond Japan.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Secretary Pena. He has done an \nexcellent job resolving this particular dispute. I have been a critic \nof his at times in the past. I am very sympathetic to the tough \nchallenge he faces in international aviation negotiations.\n  What happens to the Secretary of Transportation is he is frequently \nundercut because what our air carriers tend to do is the one that gets \nthe right to serve a foreign country sometimes works with the foreign \ngovernment to keep other U.S. carriers out. Then the Secretary is \npresented with a letter from 6 or 8 Senators and 8 or 10 House Members \nwho have a particular airline in their State or district which urges \nthe Secretary to put the interest of the incumbent carrier ahead of the \nnational goal of creating new opportunities for all our carriers. This \nundermines the Secretary's negotiating position.\n  To help correct this significant problem, I have urged that the \neconomic interests of the United States be the basis for the Secretary \nof Transportation's international negotiations.\n  Mr. President, I do not see this as the end of our aviation problems \nwith Japan. As I mentioned, a significant passenger issue involving \nUnited Airlines remains unresolved. Also, I suspect, having observed \nJapan's trade habits and protectionist activities, that they are going \nto keep attempting to block our carriers from serving points beyond \nJapan. There are many lucrative new air service opportunities in the \nPacific rim. The Japanese know this and they likely will try to keep \nthem for their own carriers.\n  We on this floor need to support the Secretary of Transportation in \nhis efforts to open new international opportunities for our carriers \nand to protect existing aviation rights. We need to let the Secretary \nput the economic interests of the United States first. I hope someday \nwe will no longer have to get bogged down in a system of bilateral \naviation agreements. Instead, I hope one day we will have a \nmultilateral aviation framework, like a GATT worldwide open skies \nagreement.\n  I congratulate the Secretary of Transportation. But I still think we \nmay need to pass a resolution in the Senate giving the Japanese notice \nthat we consider this a major trade issue. Also, we need to let the \nJapanese know that we expect the unresolved passenger carrier issue to \nbe resolved promptly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank you very much for the \nadditional time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/21/senate-section/article/S10508-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M., MONDAY, JULY 24, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
