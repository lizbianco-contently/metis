Members will be relieved to know that there will be \nothers joining me during this 30 minutes, other Members from our \nfreshman group, to continue our discussion about the agenda for the \nSenate, the agenda for the Republicans, and of course the agenda for \nthis country.\n  We feel very strongly, of course, that this is a great opportunity to \nmove forward on the issues that were the issues talked about and voted \non by Americans in the 1994 November election.\n  This is the greatest opportunity that we have had for a number of \nyears to evaluate programs that have been in place, rather than \ncontinuing to simply put more money into programs when the results have \nnot been what we expected. Now is an opportunity to take a look at the \nprograms and see, in fact, if there can be changes made, to see if in \nfact, there are programs that do not need to be continued, that could \nbetter \n[[Page S6132]] be done in the private sector, if there are \nconsolidations that can be made so that we can do away with repetition \nand redundancy in programs. There is no question but that those exist.\n  Mr. President, we are excited by the opportunity. There are 11 \nMembers who are in our first year in the U.S. Senate and are very proud \nand pleased to be there. More than that, I think we are excited at the \nchance to participate in change that has been needed for some time, \nparticipate in the change that voters sent Members here to accomplish \nthis year, with the message clearly that there is too much Government \nand that it costs too much.\n  They sent Members here with a message that there are better ways of \ndelivering services. We are not inclined to do away with programs and \nleave people without the assistance that properly comes from \nGovernment, but rather to find ways to help people help themselves back \ninto a productive society. That is what it is all about.\n  I am very pleased, Mr. President, to be joined by the president of \nour freshman class, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                          November Revolution\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I think he said it very \nwell. I think it is very important, and the 11 freshman Members are \nprobably in a better position than anyone else to remind the people \nthat what happened on November 8, 1994 in an appropriate way at the \nballot box, was, in fact, a revolution.\n  It is the first time in about 40 years that we have been able to look \nat Government and redefine its role and answer the question, has \nGovernment become involved in more things in a heavyhanded way, than it \nwas intended to be involved in?\n  I know it is the liberal agenda of giving away, having programs for \nall needs, taking care of everyone from the cradle to the grave, is \nsomething that is easy to demagog, but to stand here and know that \nthere are limited resources, I think it is irresponsible to continue \nthat.\n  I think the people in November voted for changes, not so much \nRepublican versus Democrat. Sure, the Republicans took over the House, \nand they took over the Senate. That is the first time that has \nhappened. The main thing is that we campaigned for things that we have \nconsistently voted for that contradict the behavior of Congress for the \npast 40 years.\n  When we look at Government's role, we have to ask the question, is \nGovernment's responsibility to take care of all the social needs? It is \na difficult thing to talk about because it is easy to demagog.\n  I was distressed probably as much as anyone was when the President \nand others went out and said, well, the Republicans are trying to take \nthe milk away from babies during the nutrition program debate when, in \nfact, the Republicans were suggesting a 4\\1/2\\ percent increase.\n  This is very disturbing. The people have awakened in America and they \ndo not buy that kind of talk anymore. They are going to demand changes.\n  I have heard, and there is a perception that the U.S. Senate is \noperating so slowly, that we are not getting anything done. Now, I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that we operate differently in the Senate, and \nas one who used to serve in the House of Representatives the same as \nthe Senator from Wyoming, maybe we like the way that operates a little \nbit better because it is faster. And, the occupant of the chair was \nalso there and knows what I am talking about.\n  On the other hand, there was not a day that went by in the U.S. House \nof Representatives when I was over there when this conversation did not \noccur. One would say, ``Are we really quite ready to vote on this? \nShould we refine it more?'' The answer is always ``Do not worry, the \nSenate will take care of that.''\n  For the first time in my life, when I was elected this last time to \nthe U.S. Senate, I realized what our Founding Fathers had in mind when \nthey said they wanted a bicameral system. In fact, we have to slow that \ntrain down.\n  How slow has the train been? The agenda, the Contract With America, \nhad 10 items in it. In the House of Representatives, they were able to \npass 9 of the 10. The only area that they did not pass was term \nlimitations. In the Senate, in just the first 3 months, we passed \ncongressional accountability, that is forcing Government to live under \nthe same laws we pass.\n  We passed an unfunded mandates bill. As a former mayor of a major \ncity, I can say that the major problem that exists in cities in America \ntoday is the fact that the Federal Government tells them what to do but \ndoes not send the money down. They are called unfunded mandates.\n We have passed that major reform here in the U.S. Senate, along with \ncongressional accountability. A line-item veto--we have talked about \nline-item veto now for a long period of time. Now we have passed it \nhere. We passed a moratorium on endangered species.\n\n  So we have actually handled about three or four of the major contract \nitems and we are on schedule to handle the rest of them. But I honestly \nbelieve it is a responsibility, as the Senator from Wyoming said, of \nthe freshman class, those of us who heard the mandate on November 8, \n1994, to keep this train on track and to keep focused. We still have to \nfinish up the rest of the items.\n  Right now, as soon as I leave the floor, I will be going over to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee hearing. Over there we are \nhandling another one of the contract items; that is, doing something \nabout the heavyhandedness of Government through its EPA regulations: \nwhat is happening in this country with the Superfund; what is happening \nwith wetlands; what is happening with endangered species.\n  Oklahoma is somewhat of an agricultural State. As I traveled through, \ncampaigning, I do not remember, of the hundreds of farmers I talked to \nduring the campaign, any of them coming up to me and saying, ``I want \nto know what the farm bill is going to do. I want to know about price \nsupports.'' What the farmers in Oklahoma and throughout America are \nconcerned about is property rights. That is one of the things we talked \nabout in the Contract With America, that we have the fifth amendment to \nthe Constitution and the 14th amendment to the Constitution that \nguarantee our property rights, not to lose our property without due \nprocess. We all know when farmers have property that is declared to be \nwetlands, they lose the value of that, and I have every expectation we \nare going to be able to pass the Private Property Protection Act that \nis going to guarantee the protection of private property and the value \nof that property to all Americans. Again, this is one of the contracts.\n  In this same committee meeting we are going to be hearing about the \nSuperfund problems that exist. We know, and it is a fact today, that \nthere are people who have received phone calls and letters from the EPA \nthat have put them out of business for something over which they had no \ncontrol. One such case was a lumber store owner in Tulsa, OK, by the \nname of Jim Dunn. He got a letter from the EPA that would have put him \nout of business, invoking $25,000 a day fines. Checking to see what he \nwas guilty of, we found that for 10 years he used the same person to \nsell his crankcase oil to. This contractor was licensed by the Federal \nGovernment, by the State of Oklahoma, even by the county and City of \nTulsa, yet they came back and traced some of that oil to a Superfund \nsite and came to the conclusion that he was liable. In the absence of \njoint and several reform, he could be liable for the whole amount. And \nfor that he was threatened to be charged a fine of $25,000 a day and \npossible criminal sanctions. That is the very thing that we are not \ngoing to allow to happen. It is the overregulation, the heavyhandedness \nof Government.\n  The Endangered Species Act--I am very proud the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, was able to get an amendment through on the floor to \nput some sanity on that, to slow that train down so that, before we add \nany new critters to the Endangered Species Act, we are able to sit back \nand look at the cost/benefit of all these things. It was not long ago \nthey decided to put the Arkansas shiner under the Endangered Species \nAct. Here is a little minnow that I guess they have decided is more \nimportant than people are. It would cost the average farmer in Oklahoma \nwho has runoff into the Canadian system about $2,000 to protect this \ncritter.\n  [[Page S6133]] This is the type of foolishness we are going to stop. \nWe are all sensitive to the environment and we are sensitive to the \nneed for some controls. But we are not going to allow Government to \ncontinue its heavyhanded treatment of its citizens, the people who are \nout there who are paying for all this fun we are having in Washington.\n  So we have an agenda. Those of us who are the freshmen, the 11 \nfreshmen--I am very pleased we are going to be driving this train, \nkeeping it on track, keeping the focus, and not forgetting. Let me give \nassurances to everyone out there: We are not going to forget what the \nmandate was of November 8.\n  I yield the floor now to my very close friend from the House, where I \nserved with him and was elected with him, and now he is a leader in the \nU.S. Senate, the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\n\n\n                    Taxation, Regulation, Litigation\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the campaign that the Senator from \nOklahoma was just talking about that we just went through, I heard a \nphrase over and over again, ``taxation, regulation, litigation,'' the \nthree problems in this country that we have to do something about. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has just spoken eloquently about the matter of \nregulation. This Congress is going to do a lot to reform the regulatory \nclimate in this country, to bring some common sense back into it.\n  The Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, just passed out a \nregulatory reform bill sponsored by the majority leader that is really \ngoing to get to the heart of some of the regulatory problems in our \nsociety today, bringing cost/benefit analysis and economic impact \nstudies and risk assessments and peer review into the regulatory \nprocess, so you do not have the kind of noncommonsensical imposition of \nregulations such as those the Senator from Oklahoma was just talking \nabout.\n  Let me turn to the third item in that trilogy, the matter of \nlitigation. We are debating today, and have been for almost 2 weeks \nnow, legal liability reform. It is part of what the House of \nRepresentatives did, and it is part of what this Senate is committed to \ndo as well, to reform our broken tort system. Some call it the \nlitigation lottery. It produces a tort tax on all of America because we \nend up paying higher premiums for insurance, higher costs for products, \nand, frankly, we do not get the benefit of a lot of improvements that \ncould be made in pharmaceuticals and in products and so on because the \nmanufacturers are afraid to experiment with anything new because they \nmay get sued, they may have to pay big damages, and their costs would \ngo up.\n  So what we are trying to do is reform that system so that all of \nAmerica will benefit from improved technology, reduced insurance rates, \nreduced product costs, and, by the way, particularly for small \nbusinesses, not constantly suffering under the threat of being sued; \nalso, of course, the physicians and the hospitals and other health care \nproviders whose medical malpractice premiums have skyrocketed in recent \nyears because of the possibility that somebody is going to sue them. \nThey end up practicing defensive medicine, offering all kinds of \nservices and tests that probably are not necessary but which they \nprescribe in order to make sure that nobody can say they did not do the \nabsolute maximum that was necessary for the patient's good.\n  So these are parts of the problem we are addressing in litigation \nreform. I would like to just isolate one specific one that I will be \ntalking about in about an hour and a half in the context of the bill we \nare debating today. I have laid down an amendment to correct a small, \nbut I think important, part of the bill that is before us today. Many \nStates--most States, I suspect--have what are called alternative \ndispute resolution mechanisms, ways of resolving disputes short of \ngoing to trial. Trials are expensive. In the end, the people who win \nare the lawyers. So what we are trying to do is to get people not to \nalways go to court but to try to resolve their differences short of \ngoing to court, and most States have those procedures.\n  There is an error in the bill that is before us, section 103. It \ndeals with alternative dispute resolution. It says when a State has \nalternative dispute resolution, the parties should use that. And that \nis fine. But then it says, if a defendant refuses to go forward when a \nplaintiff has made an offer in good faith and that defendant has \nrefused the offer in good faith to go forward with the alternative \ndispute resolution, then you can assess attorney's fees and costs \nagainst the defendant. But there is no such provision with regard to \nthe plaintiff refusing to go forward in good faith.\n  Mr. President, either we should not have a penalty for either party \nrefusing to go forward or there should be the same penalty on both \nparties, whichever one of them refuses to go forward in good faith. But \nyou cannot have a situation where one of the parties has the dagger \nhanging over his head and the other party with no downside for refusing \nto go forward in good faith. One way or the other that has to be fixed.\n  First, I said, ``Why don't we have a penalty for both parties?'' One \nobjection was we should not be dictating at the Federal level what the \nStates should do. Whatever people advertise there in the State, let \nthat be. Then I say fine. My amendment simply strikes the penalty that \nis in the bill at the Federal level so that whatever the State law is \nthe State law is. In effect, my amendment would return this alternative \ndispute resolution mechanism to the States to be enforced however the \nState law enforces it. Of course, in every State, if there is a \npenalty, the penalty applies equally to the defendant or the plaintiff, \nwhichever one is refusing to go forward unreasonably.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is something I will be talking about \na little bit later but something my colleagues will want to fix. Our \nwhole justice system is about fairness. The reason we are willing to \nput our lives and our fortunes into the hands of one person, a judge or \n12 people on a jury, is because we have faith that the system is fair. \nOne of the reasons we are talking about litigation reform today is \nbecause a lot of people do not think it is fair. It would be the height \nof unfairness to have a penalty apply to one side, the defendant, but \nnot have that same penalty apply to the plaintiff for doing the same \nthing--for refusing to go forward to resolve the dispute alternative to \na trial.\n  So my amendment will simply make it the same for both plaintiffs and \ndefendants and reinstate State law as the guiding principle.\n  I will be talking about this a little bit later. I think it goes back \nto the whole notion we have to reform. We have to do things fairly, \nand, if we do things fairly in our society today, if people think they \nare getting a fair break regarding regulation, as the Senator from \nOklahoma talked about, regarding taxation and regarding litigation, \nthen people gladly shoulder the burdens inherent in supporting the \nGovernment and society at large. But when they do not think they are \ngetting a fair shake--that is, when they begin to say this whole thing \nhas to be changed--it has to be reformed.\n  Fortunately, at least the Senate Republicans who were just elected in \nthe last election are here speaking every week about these kind of \nreforms. I think we are making a difference, Mr. President.\n  I know my colleague from Minnesota is here and wishes to continue the \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6131-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6133-S6135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n ONE HUNDRED DAYS OF REFORM FOR A NEW CENTURY OF RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am glad to have the opportunity to join \nwith my fellow freshmen today to speak on the topic this week, ``100 \nDays of Reform for a New Century of Responsible Government.''\n  Having just returned from a series of townhall meetings in my home \nState of Minnesota, however, it would be more appropriate to refer to \nit as moving forward with the people's agenda.\n  Over the Easter recess, I held town meetings in five cities, \ntraveling over 1,000 miles, talking with hundreds of people across the \nState of Minnesota.\n  And the mandate they delivered last November is more focused than \never--fix things in Washington.\n  [[Page S6134]] From Austin, MN to Brainerd, their message focused on \nour $4.8 trillion debt.\n  The folks I talked with agree something needs to be done now. They \nhave waited long enough.\n  They are not content to have a Government running deficits of \nhundreds of billions of dollars each year for as far as the eye can \nsee. They are understandably frustrated by decades of Washington \ndoublespeak when it comes to making the tough choices necessary to \nbalance the budget.\n  And most importantly, they are concerned for their children and \ngrandchildren who will be forced to finance the Government's spending \nspree.\n  Because of that massive $4.8 trillion debt, by the time every child \nborn after 1992 enters the work force, they will face a Federal, State, \nand local tax rate between 84 and 94 percent.\n  Think about it. If Washington keeps doing what it is doing, spending \ndollars it does not have and passing along the bills, every child born \nafter 1992 will spend their whole life working just to pay off a \nFederal spending spree that they never even asked for.\n  Fortunately, my constituents had an opportunity to voice their \nconcerns during my townhall meetings in Minnesota, and today, I want to \nshare what they had to say.\n  I brought with me some of the charts that I took around the State \nwith me in these town meetings to try to point out some of the problems \nthat I think we are facing. This first chart we were talking about is \nFederal taxes as a share of the median family income.\n\n\n            Federal Taxes as a Share of Median Family Income\n\n  The percentage of income paid to the Federal Government in direct \ntaxes went from 3 percent in 1948 to 24.5 percent in 1992.\n  In the 5 years between 1948 and 1953, Federal taxes rose from 3 to 9 \npercent of gross income.\n  You have to remember this is coming out of World War II where we had \nto go into debt to help finance. Only 3 percent at that time was going \nto the Federal taxes.\n  In the 8 years between 1972 and 1980, the average family saw their \ntax bill rise from 16 percent of their annual income to 23.5 percent of \ntheir income.\n  The rise of the Social Security payroll tax and the erosion of the \npersonal exemption have been the largest contributors to the reduction \nof posttax income for families.\n  It is no wonder middle class families are finding it difficult to buy \na house, put their kids through college, or put money aside for their \nretirement.\n      average income families would be taxed $10,060 less per year\n\n  Let us look at chart No. 2, the average income families would be \ntaxed $10,060 less per year.\n  According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the total pretax income \nfor a family of four in 1992 was $47,787. After taxes, this same \nfamily's income fell to $36,915.\n  Under the 1948 tax rates, the median income family of four would pay \nonly $812 in taxes to the Federal Government, leaving the family with \nan after tax income of $46,975 when adjusted to 1992 dollar amounts.\n  In 1992, a family of four, with the median income of $47,787, paid \n$10,060 more in direct taxes to the Federal Government than the same \nfamily would have if tax rates had remained at 1948 levels.\n  To put that into everyday terms, the median price of a single-family \nhome purchased in 1992 was $103,700. The average annual mortgage \npayment was $7,380.\n  The annual family income lost to increasing Federal tax burdens \nexceeds the average annual mortgage payments for an average home by 36 \npercent.\n  What could you do if you could keep another $10,060 in your pockets? \nYou could provide for the things your family needs without turning to \nthe Federal Government and asking for more subsidies and more help. The \ndollars would remain in your pocket.\n                     two-earner median income--1994\n\n  The next chart that I was able to talk with Minnesotans about is the \n1994 two-earner median income chart.\n  A median household with two breadwinners spends about $2 out of every \n$5 it earns on taxes; 40 percent of everything you bring in goes to \nState, Federal, and local taxes. The average family spends more money \non Federal, State, and local taxes than it spends on food, clothing, \nhousing, and medical care combined. This does not include sales tax or \nyour Social Security, the FICA tax. That brings it up to nearly 49.6 \npercent of everything an average family makes in this country which \ngoes to pay for government.\n  Why are Federal taxes so high today? After all, did Ronald Reagan not \npass a massive income tax cut in 1981? Yes, Reagan did sign a 25-\npercent income tax rate cut for all Americans in 1981. However, there \nhave been six major tax increases since--1982, 1983, 1987, 1988, 1990, \nand 1993. These have nullified the Reagan tax cuts.\n  In the early 19th century, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in the \nSupreme Court case, McCulloch versus Maryland: ``The power to tax \ninvolves the power to destroy.''\n  Today, this statement still rings true. Taxes are destroying the \nincome of American families, leaving only 60 percent of what it earns \nto spend on life's necessities and joys.\n  In 1966 the median income family of four will work until May 30 to \npay their share of Federal, State, and local taxes--98 days.\n  In 1948, the average family of four worked only 8 days to pay their \nshare of Federal taxes.\n  Had Congress adopted the Republican alternative budget for fiscal \nyear 1995, roughly 35 million families could have deducted $500 per \nyear from their tax bill per child next April 15. For the average \nfamily of four, that extra $1,000 would be handy.\n\n\n            sources of government spending fiscal year 1995\n\n  The budget is composed of two principal fund groups, Federal funds \nand trust funds. This is how the bills are paid in Washington.\n  Federal funds carry out the general purposes of government, whereas \ntrust funds, such as Social Security and Medicare, are designated by \nlaw and financed by specially allocated collections.\n  In 1994, trust fund surpluses totaled $95 billion. Under current law, \nthe sum of the trust fund surplus and Federal fund deficit equals the \nunified deficit, which is commonly referred to as simply the deficit.\n  Merging these trust funds--this is what we collect in tax receipts \nfrom your income tax, the 1040 business taxes, and others--the trust \nfunds bring in $511 billion and pay for Social Security payments, and \nothers. But last year there was a $107 billion surplus in that trust \nfund which the Government also borrowed along with the green part of \nthis chart, $192.5 billion.\n  What I would like to say about this green and what came out of the \ntrust fund is money that we are borrowing from our children. We are \ntaking this out of their future accounts to supply the dollars we need \ntoday in order to deficit spend, and the trust fund receipts in general \nrevenues will total over $1.2 trillion or 81.5 percent of the Federal \nspending.\n  Unfortunately, this sum does not even begin to cover the Government's \nexpenditures. The Government again will borrow from our children this \n$192 billion.\n  On the next chart, in real terms, a family of five making about \n$45,000 would have 10 percent of its Federal tax burden reduced through \nthe $500 per child tax credit. This chart shows where many argue this \nis a tax credit for the rich. They talk about the $200,000 a year \nincome. In real terms, families making under $75,000 a year would get \n86 percent of the tax credit on $500 per child.\n  If you make under $100,000, about 95 percent of the families making \nunder $100,000 would receive a tax credit.\n  In the next chart, the White House and congressional Democrats argue \nthat a $500 per child tax credit is unnecessary because they expanded \nthe earned income tax credit in the 1993 bill. But this claim ignores \nthe difference between a wage subsidy and a tax cut.\n  The EITC is a wage supplement for working families with children with \nincomes up to $26,000 per year. It is intended to offset the Social \nSecurity tax burden on these families and to increase their wages \nthrough a cash subsidy.\n  A family of four earning $14,000 a year--slightly below the official \npoverty level--will pay no income taxes \n[[Page S6135]] but will bear a Social Security tax burden of roughly \n$2,140. Now, this family is then eligible to receive some $2,400 from \nthe earned income tax credit, nearly $260 more than its entire tax \nburden.\n  A family earning $28,000 a year--and not eligible for the earned \nincome tax credit--would have 57 percent of its income tax bill and 17 \npercent of its total Federal tax bill erased by the $500 per child tax \ncredit.\n  This is an important part of tax relief to these families that do not \nqualify but still make under $35,000 a year.\n  Family tax relief, I believe, should not be means tested. Every \nworking family in this country is overtaxed, thus every working family, \nregardless of income, should be eligible for a $500 per child tax \ncredit. The Tax Code should not penalize children simply because of \ntheir parents' income.\n  Now, along with family tax relief, the Minnesotans with whom I met \nduring the past recess are demanding a balanced Federal budget with or \nwithout a balanced budget amendment. And if that means putting the \nFederal Government on a strict low-fat diet, then so be it.\n  One thing I heard over and over again during my town meetings, from \nMinnesotans who pay their own bills and balance their own budget, is \nthat if they can do it, then the Federal Government can do it as well.\n  One thing is very clear: The budget can be balanced, and we can do it \nwithout gutting the vital programs on which millions of Americans \ndepend. We will do it by containing the growth of Government while \ncontinuing to meet the needs of America's families, children, and \nsenior citizens.\n  By streamlining Federal bureaucracy and sending the money back to the \nState governments in the form of block grants, Minnesotans know that \nthey will have more power, not less power, more resources, not fewer, \nand new and better opportunities.\n  I have every confidence that the people of Minnesota can direct those \nresources and provide for those in need better than Washington \nbureaucrats could ever hope to do.\n  That is my motivation as we move forward during these next 100 days, \nand it is my hope that every Senator remembers the messages that they \nhave heard over the recess and join in the effort to enact what we call \nthe people's agenda.\n  We need to restrict or restrain the growth of spending in the Federal \nGovernment, but we also need tax relief for Minnesota families and for \nthe Nation's families. We cannot have one without the other. I hope \nvery strongly that as we move forward in these next 100 days we will be \nable to provide some of this long sought tax relief for middle-class \nAmerican families.\n  I thank the Chair. I would now like to turn the floor over to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft].\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Missouri.\n  The first half hour of time which was reserved has expired, so the \nSenator has up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nextend my appreciation to citizens all across America who are \nrecognizing the observation of the National Day of Prayer. It is a time \nduring which the people of America pray for this country and pray for \nthose of us who have the responsibility to lead, not just at the \nnational level, but at the local level as well. So in city halls across \nAmerica, in State capitals, and here in the Nation's Capital, \nindividuals are seeking to invoke the presence of God upon the \ndeliberations of the Government, and upon the Nation as a whole.\n  I am especially grateful for this fitting activity and for the fact \nthat as a nation we occasionally stop to remember the Almighty. In \nparticular, I am pleased to express appreciation on behalf of myself \nand many others to Shirley Dobson who is leading the National Day of \nPrayer this year.\n  As our Nation heals from the wounds inflicted upon us by the Oklahoma \nCity tragedy, and as we continue to confront daily the tragedies of \ndeath and violence that seem to plague our land, it is fitting we would \ncall upon God to give thanks for the blessings we have enjoyed.\n  The Old Testament book of Chronicles provides a worthwhile guide to \nour times. It says: ``If my people, which are called by my name, shall \nhumble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked \nways, then will I hear from Heaven and will forgive their sin and will \nheal their land.'' Mr. President, I do not think there is a more noble \naspiration than the desire of America to be a land of healing.\n  Our Nation has embodied this attitude of humility and reverence \nbefore God from the very earliest days of its existence. During the \nConstitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin rose to say: ``If a \nsparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable \nthat an empire can rise without his aid?''\n  There is little question but that we owe a debt of gratitude to \nAlmighty God for the blessings he has continued to bestow upon us. As \nGeorge Washington prayed: ``Almighty God; we make our earnest prayer \nthat Thou wilt * * * most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do \njustice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with * * * charity, \nhumility and a pacific temper of mind.''\n  I believe those are the kinds of sentiments we all ought to be \nexpressing today. I pray God's blessing upon this land, and I thank \nthose who are assembling across the country to remember our need for \nguidance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6135-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6135-S6136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of a \nbalanced budget, but I want to start by talking about the shifting \nbalance of Federal-State power. Last week, in United States versus \nLopez, the Supreme Court held that a 1990 Federal statute did not \n``substantially affect'' interstate commerce. While the decision did \nnot overturn any precedents, it marked a sharp departure from the \nmodern Court's expansive view of congressional power to regulate \ncommerce. By limiting Congress' ability to use the commerce clause to \nlegislate social policy, the Court highlighted the benefits of the \nFederal system envisioned by the Framers, and outlined in the \nConstitution. Moreover, they acknowledged what the American people have \nrecognized for quite some time: That a Congress with the power to do \neverything for you, also has the power to take everything from you.\n  In the Senate, we have just begun to discuss spending priorities for \nthe coming fiscal year. When the budget resolution comes before this \nChamber, our actions will help shape the ongoing debate over State \npower within the Federal system.\n  The question we must ask is not what power the Federal Government \nought to have, but what powers have been extended by the people. We \nmust be ever mindful of the fact that the powers conferred upon the \nFederal Government by the Constitution have proscribed limits. Clearly, \na National Government that has a debt of $4.9 trillion--that is over \n$18,000 for every man, woman, and child--has forgotten this fact.\n  Mr. President, if efforts are not made to limit spending, the Federal \nGovernment will no longer be able to fulfill its most basic \nconstitutional obligations. In just 17 years, spending on entitlement \nand the national debt will consume all tax revenues; Medicare will be \nbankrupt in just 6 years; and in FY 1997, we will pay more in interest \npayments on the national debt than we will spend on national defense.\n  Last November, the American people spoke with a clarity and an \nintensity seldom heard in American government. What was their message? \nReturn to us the ability to control our own lives, our own future, our \nown destinies. This was not some radical, foreign concept, it was the \nmessage of the founding--the message embodied in the capstone of the \nBill of Rights, the 10th amendment, which reads: ``The powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by \nit to \n[[Page S6136]] the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or \nto the people.'' I would posit, Mr. President, that this fundamental \nidea should animate all that we do here in the coming weeks.\n  The task of defining the constitutional line between Federal and \nState power has given rise to many of the Court's most challenging and \ncelebrated cases. In United States versus Lopez, the Court reaffirmed \nthe belief that the powers of the Federal Government have proscribed \nlimits. Now, it is the opportunity of this Congress to recreate the \ndual sovereignty that the Framers envisioned. For ``in the tension \nbetween Federal and State power lies the promise of liberty.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from California if \nshe has come to the floor to speak on budget and Medicare. She was here \nfirst. I will be pleased to follow her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, but I will be delighted \nto follow my friend. So if he would like his time now, that is just \nfine.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I yield \nmyself such time as I might need from the majority leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are, in a very short period of time, going to have \na historic debate about the budget and about priorities in our Nation, \nthe United States of America. Part of that debate--and I know my \ncolleague from California will be speaking to this as well--will focus \non Medicare.\n  As I have followed over the last couple of days some of the press \nconferences and some of the discussions taking place about Medicare, I \nthink it is really important to come to the floor and speak about \nMedicare, not so much in political terms but in substantive terms.\n  We are faced with a real irony. It may very well be that a good many \nof my colleagues will now discover that health care reform--not just a \nfocus on Medicare or Medicaid but real health care reform--is a \npressing, compelling issue in this country.\n  First of all, Medicare is a benefit program. It is not just an \nactuarial program. It is important for me to make this point, Mr. \nPresident. My mother and father are no longer alive. Both actually had \nParkinson's disease, but I can tell you, for my parents in their older \nage, Medicare, imperfections and all, was extremely important and it \ncontinues to be extremely important to senior citizens in this country.\n  It is not by any means perfect. It does not cover catastrophic \nexpenses, it does not cover prescription drug costs, and elderly people \nover 65 years of age pay four times as much out of pocket as citizens \nunder 65 years of age. But I think this focus on the budget is going to \nget us to the point where all of us understand some realities about \nhealth care and health care policy in the United States.\n  Eighty-five percent of Medicare expenditures pay for care for seniors \nwith household incomes of less than $25,000 a year. So let us also \nunderstand that these benefits help hard-pressed people, not people who \nhave plenty of income on their own.\n  Second point, Mr. President. I was on the floor the other day in a \ndebate with one of my colleagues--I think it was the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Gramm--and he was talking about his efforts to block \nhealth care reform in the last Congress and he was proud of that. In \nanother point in time, we will have a debate, and I do not have a \npractice of debating colleagues when they are not on the floor, but I \nwill say, as a matter of fact, one of the reasons that we are now \ndealing with the whole question of Medicare and how to finance Medicare \nis because we did not pass any comprehensive health care reform last \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, 89 percent of the growth in Medicare spending since \n1980 has been due to medical inflation, general inflation, and changes \nin enrollment. Let me go over those.\n  Medicare is a benefit program that, of course, we have to finance. It \nis part of what we are about as a country. It is, indeed, a contract \nwith senior citizens, and as we move into the next century, a larger \npercentage of our population are older Americans, and a larger \npercentage of those older Americans are older. That means that the cost \nof the program goes up.\n  Then there is the issue of general inflation. There is not much we \ncan do about the first issue that I mentioned. And there is not that \nmuch we can do about general inflation, but we can look at medical \ninflation.\n  The interesting thing is that the Congressional Budget Office made it \nclear last Congress--I did not say Democrat, Republican, but CBO--that \nthere are two ways you can contain medical costs. One is through global \nspending caps, as in the single payer proposal, or, if you do not \nprefer that, by placing some limits on insurance premiums. Some limit \non insurance premiums is a very effective way of containing costs.\n  But, Mr. President, if you just focus on one segment of the \npopulation and you cut $250 to $350 billion\n between now and the year 2002, you will have a severe impact on that \npopulation. Let me say to my colleagues, when you were talking about \nrationing last Congress when we were talking about comprehensive health \ncare reform, when you were yelling and screaming about rationing last \nCongress, I did not think that you had a case to make. But if you are \njust going to target Medicare, if you are going to cut expenditures for \njust one segment of the population, then you will ration by age, you \nwill ration by disability, and if you throw Medicaid into the equation, \nyou will ration by income. But now I do not hear my colleagues talking \nabout rationing at all.\n\n  Second of all, if you make these cuts in Medicare, you are going to \nthrow this whole health care system into--and I do not want to \nexaggerate--I would say a fair amount of chaos, if not utter chaos.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nfrom the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform, which \nincludes many businesses in this case.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The National Leadership\n\n\n                             Coalition for Health Care Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 1995.\n     Senator Paul David Wellstone,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We are writing to express our \n     serious concerns about the proposed cuts in the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs. Our Coalition is the nation's largest \n     nonpartisan alliance of business, labor, consumers, and \n     providers dedicated to improving the health care system--in \n     order to enhance the availability, affordability, and quality \n     of care. (Our membership list is attached.)\n       We have long been on record as strong supporters of cost \n     containment for both public and private payers. Until we \n     contain costs, our citizens cannot be secure in coverage for \n     themselves and their families. However, we believe that \n     further drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, coming on top \n     of deep cuts legislated in 1993, would pose program \n     difficulties and force the provider community to increase the \n     shifting of costs to the private sector. Such cost-shifting \n     would result in even more limited access, especially for low \n     and middle-income Americans, and an increase in the number of \n     uninsured.\n       We are troubled by approaches that focus primarily on \n     cutting the price of services. One of our central concerns--\n     as patients, payers, and providers--is that the quality of \n     care be enhanced by changes in the health care system. If \n     draconian cuts are made in prices, quality could further \n     suffer. We urge a balanced approach, one that would control \n     total system cost while improving quality, stopping cost-\n     shifting, and expanding universal coverage.\n       We believe that if our nation were to concentrate on better \n     outcomes and quality initiatives in addition to measures \n     targeted on costs, there would be significant gains both in \n     the appropriateness and efficiency of services, and in the \n     reduction of costs. Strong quality assurance mechanisms are \n     also essential as we shift more to better systems of managed \n     care.\n       [[Page S6137]] We urge Congress to take an integrated \n     approach to addressing our three serious and interrelated \n     problems of cost, quality and access. We fear a one-\n     dimensional approach, or one dealing only with federal \n     programs, will only make matters worse. We stand ready to \n     work with you on a balanced solution that will create a \n     better system for all our citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul G.

That is why the business community is opposed to these \ncuts in Medicare, because they know it will be a shell game. Mr. \nPresident, this will result in utterly irrational charge shifting. What \nwill happen is that the providers already not receiving reimbursement \nthey need will just shift the cost to the private sector, to those of \nus who have private health insurance plans. The business community \nknows that.\n  Some of my friends who were talking about Medicare just as a way of \nreducing the deficit, or even when they talk about reforming health \ncare but just focusing on Medicare, I think really overlooked problems.\n  Third of all, Mr. President, I could tell you right now, I would \nfight this tooth and nail if for no other reason than in rural \nMinnesota, greater Minnesota, many hospitals and clinics will go under. \nIn some cases, 75 percent of their revenues comes from Medicare. If you \nare going to take a meat-ax approach, a slash-and-burn approach, if you \nare not going to contain costs in the health care field but you are \ngoing to have these cuts in Medicare alone, then I could just tell you \nright now, many of our hospitals will go under and clinics will go \nunder in our rural communities.\n  Fourth of all, Mr. President, this idea of vouchers--this is \nunbelievable. People are going to have to get real with the people that \nwe represent. To say we will just give you a voucher, that we will set \nsome kind of limited per capita payment, and then you go out, senior \ncitizens, and sort of negotiate whatever plan works well for you. Mr. \nPresident, with preexisting condition exclusions, with no risk \nadjustment between plans, with no community rating, how do you think \nthat is going to work? How do you think that is going to work? If you \nhave a preexisting condition, you may be flat out of luck. If there is \nno risk adjustment, under a capitated system there will be a tremendous \nincentive for health plans not to accept people who are older and \nsicker. You have to make an allowance for that and that involves \nserious insurance market reforms.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I were able, a couple weeks ago, to \nrestore the funding for an insurance counseling and assistance \nprogram--unwanted by Republicans, unfortunately. They wanted to even \neliminate a small program providing counselors for elderly people to \nmake sure people do not get ripped off by some of these private \nMedicare supplementary plans. It is as if they are just going to give \npeople a voucher and say, good-bye, you are on your own.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me make a point that the Medicare payment \nsystem is the way in which we finance some of the most important things \nwe do in medical education. If we take away that funding, we are going \nto lose one of the most important things we do in this country. \nTraining residents is a public good--the competitive private insurance \nmarket will not pay for it. You would have to ask everyone to pay into \na fund in order to eliminate Medicare funding. But I have not heard \nsuch a proposal this year.\n  Mr. President, in Minnesota we have efficient markets. We have done \nan excellent job of holding down the costs. But there has been very \nlittle equity in terms of the kind of per capita payment. Parts of New \nYork get $646 per month per enrollee, and Hennepin County in Minnesota, \nurban Minneapolis, gets $363 per month per enrollee. This is in terms \nof our reimbursement now for Medicare managed care plans. My State does \nnot have any fat. If you are going to talk about across-the-board cuts, \nI will just tell you right now the impact on a State like Minnesota \nwill be severe. We are in a very precarious position.\n  So, Mr. President, let me conclude this way. No. 1, the idea of \ncutting $300, $350, $250 or $400 billion in Medicare, so that we can \nhave across-the-board tax cuts flowing to the wealthiest segment of the \npopulation, is simply outrageous. It is simply outrageous.\n  A family making under $30,000 would be getting, roughly speaking, \n$100; and families with incomes of over $200,000 would be getting, \nroughly speaking, $11,000. And for that, we are going to have these \nkinds of draconian cuts in Medicare? It is outrageous.\n  No. 2, if we do not have that tradeoff--and I think some of our more \nresponsible colleagues understand we cannot do that--I say to my \ncolleagues that you cannot move forward with cuts in Medicare unless \nyou do overall health care reform, and you cannot do it unless you \ncontain overall costs.\n  [[Page S6138]] I say to the Senators on both sides of the aisle, \nwelcome to health care reform. Welcome to the health care issue. It is \nback. How ironic it is that when historians write about the 104th \nCongress, they are going to say that the 104th Congress had to address \nhealth care reform, how to finance it, how to deliver health care to \npeople out in the communities in an affordable, dignified way. The \nreason the 104th Congress finally moved on this question is that some \nSenators realized, finally, that the only way we are really going to \nhave deficit reduction based on a standard of fairness and the only way \nwe are going to make sure we are able to provide decent health care \ncoverage for all of our citizens, regardless of age or where they live \nor income, is with significant, meaningful health care reform.\n  I am ready to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nbecause I think that will now have to be one of our major priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague for really \nputting out in very clear and simple terms the kind of crisis that we \nknew about. Indeed, President Clinton was so clear in his very first \nand second State of the Union Address when he said, ``If we want to \nhave meaningful deficit reduction, we better address the issue of \nhealth care reform.''\n  Here we have a situation--and I serve on the Budget Committee. I am \nwaiting for the Republican budget, by the way. It is way late. Since I \ncame here, I have been on the Budget Committee, and the Budget \nCommittee has been on time. Not this year. Do you know why? Because the \nRepublicans have promised certain things they just cannot keep: huge \ndeficit reduction, increases in the military, big tax breaks for some \nof the wealthiest again. Guess what? They said they would not touch \nSocial Security. Thank goodness. Frankly, I think a lot of my \ncolleagues made that point clear in the balanced budget debate. So the \nonly cash cow they can look at is Medicare. And at this point, they \nwant to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicare, and they \nrealize, how can we sell that to the seniors? So they are creating this \nbig crisis.\n  We talked about the need for health care reform. My friend, Senator \nWellstone, was one of the leaders in this fight. So I say to my friend, \nthank you for your remarks this morning. It is almost poignant that we \nare at this point. Does he not agree?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California \nfor her gracious remarks. It is ironic that indeed we have now come \nfull circle back to the last Congress.\n  The very people who were so proud of having blocked health care \nreform are now talking about a crisis in Medicare, talking about how we \nwill finance it, and are now making a proposal, I say to my colleague, \nfor rather draconian cuts in Medicare. But they do not want to talk \nabout rationing. Now they really are making proposals that will ration.\n  I think there are certain realities now that we all hope we will face \nup to and move forward on health care reform. It is the only way to do \nit. Otherwise, it will be disastrous.\n  The kind of proposals I hear people making now to cut Medicare will \nnot only hurt senior citizens, but as I said, will create absolute \nutter chaos in this health care system. They do not deal with \npreexisting conditions, they do not deal with any of the bias of not \nhaving community rating, they do not deal with how to make it \naffordable. If anything, it will just have a severe impact.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to thank my friend again. He is, of course, \ncorrect. The kinds of cuts that my colleagues on the Republican side \nare talking about out of Medicare simply will ruin Medicare. We cannot \npossibly, in the name of deficit reduction, destroy the Medicare system \nor the Medicaid system, for that matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6136-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6138-S6139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the leader has \nreserved some time to discuss general matters. I want to tie a few \npieces together.\n  Before Senator Wellstone took to the floor, the Senator from Missouri \nwas praising a Supreme Court decision that gave more power to the \nStates. Rather than get into that decision, I want to point out that in \nvote after vote, the vast majority of my Republican friends here in the \nSenate have voted in these last few days to replace State product \nliability laws, State medical malpractice--indeed, all other civil \nlaws--with Federal laws, with Federal caps.\n  We certainly know--at least I certainly feel confident in stating to \nthe American people--that these changes are going to hurt them. They \nare going to hurt consumers in our Nation by substituting politicians' \njudgments for local judges and juries.\n  Here we have spent many, many days and many, many hours on a power \ngrab--essentially, a Federal Government power grab--brought by this \nRepublican Congress in the Contract With America, a power grab to say \nthat we in the almighty Senate know better than a judge or jury what \nsomeone who has been burned beyond recognition ought to be able to get \nfrom those at fault; what someone who perhaps was paralyzed should get; \nwhat someone would be able to get if a physician, perhaps in a stupor, \nmakes a dreadful mistake. We have heard of some of those situations \noccurring.\n  I think it is very ironic that Senators would come to the floor on \nthe Republican side and talk about how they think more power ought to \nbe invested in the States and then support this kind of a bill.\n  I hope today, when we vote cloture, that we will be able to stop this \nhorrific bill from becoming a law of the land.\n  Mr. President, while I feel we should not be doing that, there are \nmany other things I feel we should be doing here in the Senate, that we \nshould be working on.\n  One of those, certainly, to my mind, is the confirmation of a new \nSurgeon General for this country, Dr. Henry Foster. I want to say that, \nin between my going to committees and my work on the floor, I have \nwatched Dr. Foster. I am very proud of the way he handled himself.\n  I see, today, he has gained the support of one Republican on the \ncommittee, assuring that there will be at least a tie vote. I want to \nreiterate to the majority leader, Senator Dole, what I have written to \nhim twice about. I see that the Democrat leader is on the floor and I \nwant to thank him for being so clear on this point.\n  Americans are fair, Mr. President. Americans are just. The fact is, \nthis man deserves to be heard on this Senate floor.\n  We have an AIDS epidemic, we have a breast cancer epidemic, we have a \nlung cancer epidemic, we have an epidemic of teen pregnancies, we have \ntoo many cases of Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease in this \ncountry.\n  We have too much smoking going on in this country, too many young \nkids taking up smoking. We need a Surgeon General. I do not know why it \nhas to take 3 more weeks for the committee to vote out Dr. Foster, but \nso be it.\n  I want to say today on the floor what I have written to Senator Dole, \nthat if Senator Dole refuses to bring this nomination to the floor, \neven if it is a tie vote or, Mr. President, even if it is a losing \nvote, if Senator Dole refuses to bring this nomination to the floor, I \nreserve my right as a Senator to object to Senate business until we can \nhave this nomination on the floor. Senator Dodd yesterday said he \nthought it would be childish for Members to avoid this discussion on \nthe floor and I want to, again, say that I agree with that.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to speak to one question in my \nremaining 5 minutes. Where is the Republican budget? Where is the \nRepublican budget? By law, the Budget Committee was required to \ncomplete work on that budget by April 1. It is May 3, 33 days after \nthat date, and we still have no budget. By law, the entire Congress is \nrequired to complete work on the budget by April 15. It is May 3--18 \ndays after that date--and still no budget.\n  For years, my Republican colleagues have said we could easily \neliminate the deficit, and we know how. Not one of my Republicans \nfriends voted for the budget last year, which cut $500 billion from the \ndeficit--not one. They said, ``We can do it better; we can do it \n[[Page S6139]] quicker; we can do it.'' Where is the budget?\n  My Republican friends have overpromised: More military spending; \nbalancing the budget by 2002; tax cuts, going up to over $200,000, \npeople will get tax cuts. Yes, they have a problem. They looked at that \nbudget and they saw only one place to go--Medicare. When it got out \nthat they were looking at cuts of $250 billion out of a program that 75 \npercent of Americans treasure, they started to get a little weak in the \nknees. They said: What are we going to do? Tell the people that \nMedicare is in crisis. This is the new turn of events. Medicare is in \ncrisis, they say.\n  Well, I have looked, looked at all the reports that have come from \nthe Medicare trustees over the years. There has not been a year when \nMedicare trustees did not say, at some point in the future, Medicare \nwill be in trouble. This year is no exception, because when this \nCongress was Democratic, we voted to shore up the Medicare fund by \nmaking some tax law changes.\n  The Republicans in the House repealed that. If their law continues, \nMedicare will be in trouble in 1999. If we can stave them off, we have \nthe fund solvent until 2002.\n  Yes, we have to fix Medicare. Yes, we have to reform Medicare. Yes, \nwe have to do it right. But not slash and burn. And not outside of the \ncontext of comprehensive reform.\n  I will say that if the Republicans succeed in this, our seniors will \nbe thrown into managed care; they will lose the doctor of their choice; \nthey will have to pay more out-of-pocket expenses, and many hospitals \nin California are going to close.\n  Let Members stand tall as Democrats in this U.S. Senate. Let Members \ndemand to see this budget. Let Members say to our seniors that we will \nstand for seniors and we will not allow the seniors of this country to \nhave the budget balanced on their backs. They deserve more respect than \nthat; they deserve much more than that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader from \nSouth Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6138-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6139-S6141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WHERE IS THE BUDGET?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I rise to commend my colleagues for their eloquent \npresentation this morning. The Senator from California could not have \nsaid it better.\n  The Senator from California knows, as my other colleagues have also \nindicated they know, the ramifications of this budget resolution and \nthe extraordinary problems we face as we consider some of the \nimplications of the huge cuts in Medicare that are now being proposed, \nas well as the extraordinary link between those cuts and the tax cut \nfor the wealthy that some of our Republican colleagues have proposed \nover the course of the last several months,\n and, as we have already indicated, the House of Representatives has \nalready passed.\n\n  The concern I want to address just briefly this morning has to do \nwith what happens when nothing happens. What happens when the budget \nresolution does not come to the floor in the manner the law requires? \nWhat happens to the debt? What happens to the cost of running the \nFederal Government each and every day that we delay?\n  It may come as a surprise to some who may be listening that each day \nwe delay action on the budget, the Federal debt increases by $820 \nmillion. The budget resolution, of course, was due on the 1st of April. \nThe budget resolution was due almost 35 days ago. At that time, if you \nuse the day before as the baseline, we increased the debt on that \nparticular day by $820 million. On April 2, only 2 days after the \nbudget resolution was supposed to have been reported, the debt increase \nwas up to $1.6 billion.\n  As you can see, in just the first 9 days since April 1, the debt \nincreased by $8.2 billion simply because there has been no budget \nresolution and no opportunity for Congress to address the concern that \nso many of our Republican colleagues say ought to have the highest \npriority in the Congress today. Indeed, it should have that priority.\n  The situation is beginning to look very serious as you go from this \nchart to the next one. The next chart indicates that 10 days after the \nbudget resolution was due the debt had increased by $9 billion; 20 days \nafter the budget resolution was due the debt had increased $16 billion. \nSo, in just 20 days, because of inaction, because we have not had a \nbudget resolution, because we have not been given an opportunity to \naddress the extraordinary consequences of failure in leadership here, \nin just 20 days we have seen an increase of $16 billion in the total \ndebt, directly attributable to the fact that we have not had a budget \nresolution.\n  It gets worse, Mr. President. This chart begins to depict how much \nworse. On April 21 that debt increased to $17.2 billion. As you can \nsee, slowly we are going off the chart now. The chart is not even big \nenough to show the debt that has accumulated by the last day of the \nmonth in which the budget resolution was due.\n  As we all said, we knew the implications would be serious, but this \nchart shows just how serious. On April 30 we now see the debt, as a \nresult of not having a budget resolution, go off the charts to $24.4 \nbillion. That is $24 billion more than it would have been had we been \nable to stop this growth, this excessive increase in debt, on April 1 \nwhen the resolution was due.\n  The real story then comes on the final chart. At least we hope it \nwill be the final chart. The final chart shows that on May 1 the \nincreased debt was $25.2 billion; on May 2 it was $26 billion; on May \n3, another $820 million more than the day before--$26.8 billion more \nthan on April 1.\n  Today I will add yet the newest bar, for May 4, $27.6 billion in \nadditional debt as a result of the lack of action, as a result of the \ninaction of the Senate Budget Committee and our colleagues on the \nRepublican side in failing to address this issue.\n  This is what we are facing. We are going to need charts that I will \nnot be able to reach here by the end of this week, simply because we \nhave not been given the budget resolution that the law requires. We all \nunderstand. When the American taxpayer is told that he has to produce \nhis check to pay his taxes by April 15, people join long lines at the \npost office in order to ensure that they get their return in the mail \nand comply with the law. American taxpayers go down to the post office \nat midnight sometimes, on the eve of April 15, to ensure that they \ncomply with the law. The law says everybody has to pay their taxes by \nApril 15, and, indeed, the vast majority of American people, as law-\nabiding citizens, comply with the law.\n  The law also says that the budget resolution has to be passed out of \nthe Budget Committee by April 1, and out of the Senate, the Congress, \nby April 15. But we have now seen the cost of inaction. We have now \nseen what happens if nothing is done. We have now seen how it is \ncompounded, day after day, with increases in cost, increases in debt, \nincreases in the complexity of the problem we are going to have to \naddress in the coming days.\n  I must say, I think the biggest concern that many of my colleagues on \nthe other side have as they consider all of the ramifications of a \nbudget resolution is a promise that was made last November. We heard it \ntime and time again. We heard that we can cut taxes, we can increase or \nat least maintain defense spending levels, we can balance the budget, \nand we can do all of that without touching Social Security.\n  Now, given the circumstances, it is becoming increasingly apparent \nthat that is not possible, that there is no way to do all of that, as \nwas promised last November. So, as we look at ways with which to begin \nto address it, they are coming to the conclusion that one of the \nbiggest pools of resources from which to draw to pay for the tax cut \nthey promised is Medicare. In the name of reform, some of our \ncolleagues on the other side are suggesting that is really what we must \ndo. Let us reform Medicare. And in reforming Medicare we just happen to \nsee this new pool of resources so that we can pay for a tax cut for the \nwealthy.\n  Cutting Medicare benefits for the elderly in this way has nothing to \ndo with reform. That is not reform. Certainly there has to be some \nappreciation of the difficulties we are facing in Medicare with the \ntrust fund. Everyone is willing to concede that. But, to say in the \nname of reform we are going to cut benefits, in the name of reform we \n[[Page S6140]] are going to do it in the context of a budget \nresolution, in the name of reform somehow we are going to reduce \nMedicare but then increase the tax cuts for the wealthy, all with the \nsame stroke of the pen, I think defies credibility. I think most \nAmericans understand the fallacy of that kind of logic and that kind of \nbudgeting.\n  So I do not think there is much support for that proposal. I think \npeople are beginning to understand that the promises made last November \nare coming home to roost. The promises made about cutting taxes and \ncutting the budget and maintaining defense spending and not touching \nSocial Security--all in a very short period of time, without any pain. \nThe American people are coming to realize that it just cannot be done.\n  So we hope to have a good debate about the budget. We hope we can \ntalk about our priorities. We can talk about the need for reforming \nMedicare. But, as we said over and over on this floor over the last 2 \nyears, you are not going to resolve the Medicare problems until you \ndeal with the health care problems in this country. We all understand \nthat, to a large extent, the increase in Medicare costs is being driven \nby the same forces driving across-the-board health care costs. \nMedicare's increases in costs this year are no greater than the \nincreases in cost in the private sector. So we all understand that, \nindeed, if we are going to get a handle on Medicare, if we really are \ngoing to reform Medicare, then we have to reform the overall health \ncare system. Otherwise, there will be no real reform--only cost \nshifting.\n  So I am hopeful we can stop this steady rise in the debt. I hope we \ncan begin to see these bars go back down as we deal with the budget \nresolution. But it is now the 4th of May. We have seen from past charts \njust what has happened with each day, the daily incremental increase of \n$820 million leading in less than 45 days after the date set for the \nBudget Committee to produce a budget resolution to a proliferation in \ndebt of $27.6 billion.\n  We will bring this chart out again. We will continue to show, as we \nhave already been able to show, that we cannot afford delay. We cannot \nafford the lack in leadership that we have seen on the Senate Budget \nCommittee with regard to a budget resolution. We need to get on with \nit. We want to work in a bipartisan way. But we certainly appreciate \nthe extraordinary complexity the Republican Party and our Republican \ncolleagues have created for themselves as we try to grapple with the \npromises made last November.\n  You cannot cut taxes, you cannot increase defense, you cannot balance \nthe budget and not touch Social Security, all at the same time. Thus, \nwe are left with what we see on these charts. We want meaningful budget \nmanagement. We want an opportunity to see a resolution that will turn \nthis chart around, that will bring this debt down, that will do what \nthe American people want us to do, and that will protect Medicare, that \nwill protect those investments in people that we believe in so \nstrongly.\n  So, Mr. President, again let me commend my colleagues for their \nparticipation this morning, for the work that they have done in laying \nout the facts as we see them relating to the budget, Medicare and the \nimplications of doing nothing. We need leadership. We are very hopeful \nthat, in the not too distant future, we will see a lot more of it \ncoming from the Republican side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to the minority leader \nand others ask the question this morning, ``Where is the budget?'' I \nindicated yesterday that I thought the majority party in the Senate had \nridden into a box canyon. All of us have watched the old spaghetti \nwesterns, old-time cowboy movies in America and understand what riding \ninto a box canyon is. In fact, they usually show them as riding into \nthe box canyon whistling and happy-go-lucky. And they ride into that \nbox canyon, look around, and understand they are in very big trouble.\n  What has happened here with respect to box canyons? The majority \nparty promised the American people that they were going to increase \ndefense spending. In fact, they are going to rebuild now a new star \nwars program, increase defense spending, cut taxes and balance the \nFederal budget. But, of course, that does not add up. Most people know \nit does not add up. So they had an urgency about this program. Was the \nurgency to cut spending to balance the budget? No. The urgency was to \ncut taxes in what they called a middle-class tax cut.\n  The middle-class tax cut turns out to be not so middle class after \nall. The middle-class tax cut does the following. If you are a family \nbelow $30,000 in income, you get a big old tax cut from those folks \nover there of $124 a year. If you are a family with over $200,000 in \nincome, those folks say, ``Guess what? We have a check for you for \n$11,200, if you are such good Americans.''\n  I think everybody is a good American. So I am not saying we ought to \ndiscriminate. But it seems to me, when you are up to your neck in \nFederal debt and the first job is to cut spending to balance the \nbudget, and if with the first jump out of the chute you run over with a \ntax cut, the bulk of which goes to the wealthiest Americans, then come \nto the floor of the Senate and claim it is a middle-class tax cut, you \nneed an award for fiction. Get your tux on. We will give you a prize \nfor fiction. The truth is that this tax cut is not a middle-class tax \ncut. This gives the cake to wealthy and the crumbs to the rest.\n  Once they decided they were going to do this and started adding up \nnumbers, they discovered the laws of arithmetic--which most of us \nlearned early in life--do not allow them to balance the budget after \nall. So then they said to us. Now that we have done this, we want you \nto join us in cutting spending for Medicare and Medicaid. I guess our \nresponse is we certainly ought to join together to reform Medicare and \nMedicaid to make that solvent, whole, for the long term. But my \nresponse to the majority is, the first thing you ought to do is find a \nplace to deep-six nonsense. Get rid of tax cuts for wealthy. Then let \nus talk about reforming the rest.\n  All of us have a responsibility. The urgency of cutting spending and \nthe urgency of balancing the budget is not in question. Why were those \nwho were most urgent here on the floor of the Senate to change the \nConstitution now walking around scratching their heads wondering, \n``When will we get a budget?'' The question ought not be much cause for \nwonder. The date was April 1. It is in the law. We can read the law \nbooks to understand when the requirement to bring the budget to the \nfloor of the Senate was--April 1 and April 15. Those are the two \nstatutory dates. Now it is May.\n  Those folks who said it was urgent to do something about the Federal \nbudget deficit have only had time to pass a tax cut, a big tax cut, \nover in the House. And then this morning we see people standing on the \nfloor of the Senate justifying it as a middle-class tax cut. That is no \nmiddle class in any town I am familiar with--middle class, $200,000 or \nmore, $11,200 in tax cuts, and $120 for $30,000 or less, for families \nthat earn that amount of money. No. I think the lessen here is clear.\n  I do not think we have a budget on the floor of the Senate because \nthe folks who must produce the budget in the Budget Committee \nunderstand that the dilemma they have is they want to give tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest Americans and then ask us to help them cut spending on \nhealth care for the elderly and the poor people. That does not add up. \nIt is not going to happen.\n  What we ought to do is back away from this ideological nonsense and \ndecide to start over completely. We ought to join hands and say, let us \nstop this agenda stuff that we have, the Contract With America agenda \nthat says let us make the rich richer and let us cut the health care to \nthe poor and let us decide to do this together, in a sober, serious, \nthoughtful way. All of us understand. Yes. Federal spending must be \ncut. Let us cut it in real ways. Let us do it together and let us do it \nfirst. When we have done that job, we have cut spending and reduced the \nFederal budget deficit and have a plan to balance the budget, then let \nus talk about tax cuts. And, when we do, let us talk about tax cuts for \nreal American families. Let us do it in the real way. That is the way \nto approach this budget dilemma.\n  [[Page S6141]] I end as I began. The question is, ``Where is the \nbudget?'' Let us find that answer, bring it to the floor, pass it in a \nreasonsible way, and put this debate on the course it should be on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I have to leave to attend a \nbudget meeting, I would like to try and expose the fraud in statements \nfrom Members on the other side of the aisle claiming that the President \nis unwilling to lead and that, much to their surprise, they just \ndiscovered that the Medicare trust fund is going broke.\n  The truth of the matter is that they have been telling us for a while \nnow that action by the President was not even necessary. I wish I could \ntake us back to December 18 after the glorious Republican victory in \nNovember when Mr. Kasich and others were on the TV saying,\n\n       We're not going to wait on any budgets. We have three \n     budgets. In fact, we are going to take one of them and have \n     them first and we're going to have the budget cuts before we \n     get to tax cuts.\n\n  I want the people to go back. For months they totally ignored the \nPresident and saying that his proposals were irrelevant, that they had \ntheir own plan, their own revolution, and were going to present their \nown budget. Having been a former chairman of the Budget Committee, that \nexcited me. In January, I submitted a plan for the Record that showed \nhow to put our Government back in the black by 2002.\n  But then having gone back on their promise to give us a budget in \nJanuary, they said, ``We're going to put the spending cuts in the bank \nbefore giving any tax cuts.'' Then, we had the circus out on the lawn, \nas the House passed the tax cuts. We are back to the days of Rome under \nKasich, Gingrich, and that crowd. They went back home, had \ncelebrations, waved flags, and everything else of that sort.\n  But then, they came back to Washington and said, ``Whoops, we just \nfound out that Medicare's going broke.'' As a result, we have Medicare \nhearings coming out of our ears.\n  The Budget Committee has not given us the budget. They will not mark \none up even though by law they are required to report out a budget by \nApril 1. While we wait for the markup, they are having Medicare \nhearings all over the Hill. Mr. President, let me get right to the \npoint and refer to the report of the board of trustees of the Federal \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund last year, dated April 11, 1994, and \naddressed to Speaker Foley and Vice President Gore:\n\n       Gentlemen: We have the honor of transmitting to you the \n     1994 annual report of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust \n     Fund.\n\n  On page 2, it says:\n\n       The trust fund ratio defined as a ratio of assets at the \n     beginning of the year to disbursements during the year was \n     131 percent in 1993, and then under the intermediate \n     assumptions is projected to decline steadily until the fund \n     is completely exhausted in 2001. Under the low-cost \n     assumptions, the trust fund ratio is projected to decline \n     until the fund is completely exhausted in 2004. Under the \n     high-cost assumptions, the trust fund ratio is projected to \n     decrease rapidly until the fund is exhausted in the year \n     2000. These projections clearly demonstrate that the hospital \n     insurance program is severely out of financial balance, using \n     a range of plausible economic and demographic assumptions.\n\n  Now, that makes it pretty clear. Why didn't the Contract With America \nface up to that point? They knew about it, but did not want to face up \nto it. Moreover, they rebuffed the President's attempts to address the \nproblem. Let us remember that the President of the United States did \nnot cause any kind of deficit in Medicare. He was down in Little Rock; \nif it was caused, it was caused by me and other Members of Congress, \nbut certainly you cannot attribute it to him. Still, when he offered \nhis proposal, we could not get any cooperation whatsoever from \nRepublicans. I can say that categorically because when we finally got a \n$56 billion Medicare cut adopted, it was without a single Republican \nvote in the House of Representatives or in the U.S. Senate. In \naddition, we took $25 billion from the wealthiest Social Security \nrecipients, and put the money into the HI trust fund. What does the \nContract With America call for? It says repeal the Social Security tax \nincrease of last year and thus hasten the insolvency of the HI trust \nfund.\n  We ought to cut out this nonsense and tell them to give us a budget. \nI yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes today \nto speak once again in support of the amendment that I have introduced \nalong with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  The purpose of our amendment which we will soon be voting on is to \ntry to expand the portion of the underlying bill on product liability \nthat pertains to joint and several liability beyond the realm of \nproduct liability to other aspects of civil actions.\n  As I spoke yesterday on several occasions, and as I have argued in \nquite a variety of settings over the last few weeks during this debate, \nwhat we are talking about here is what I believe is an underlying \nprinciple of the American legal process, the principle of fairness and \nthe principle of justice. These principles, it seems to me, tend to be \nout of sync in the area of joint and several liability.\n  As I have demonstrated in the floor statements I have made, we have \ncountless incidents where persons who are only minimally responsible \nfor the damages involved in a court action, or other legal action, find \nthemselves shouldering all or most of the responsibility for paying \ndamages because of the fact that they are the deep pocket.\n  Unfortunately, this is not just something that afflicts defendants \nwho are big businesses. As I demonstrated, it is also a problem for \nmunicipal governments, for county governments, for State governments. \nIt is a problem that all too often afflicts nonprofit organizations, \ncharitable organizations, and the like.\n  We heard talk during the debate yesterday that somehow the amendment \nwe are speaking of would be adverse to women. But the fact is that \nwomen do not just find themselves as plaintiffs in legal actions; they \noften find themselves as defendants. They, too, could be victimized by \nthe joint and several liability process that we have today. Indeed, 30 \npercent of the small businessowners in this country today are women. It \nis the small businesses who are most at risk, in my judgment, unless we \nrepair this defect in the legal system at this time.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I just wanted to conclude the \ndebate on this topic--at least from my perspective--by reiterating the \narguments I made yesterday and by calling on those \n[[Page S6142]] people who have been supportive of reform of the joint \nliability process in the context of product liability, to support this \neffort to expand this notion beyond product liability.\n  Every argument that makes sense in the product liability context, \nwhere the people who are likely to be beneficiaries are the producers \nand manufacturers of products, also makes sense when the people who are \nlikely to be aided are average American families, small businesses, \ncharitable organizations and municipal governments. If this reform \nmakes sense for product manufacturers, I think it equally makes sense \nfor the small businesses, the charitable and nonprofit organizations, \nand for the local governments of this country.\n  For that reason, I sincerely hope that those individuals who will \nsupport the product liability legislation will support the expansion of \nthis particular provision of that legislation to help the small \nbusinesses, the cities and towns of America, the average American \nfamilies and, I think most importantly, the communities of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in \nthe closing minutes of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6141-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nAbraham amendment. I am not a lawyer, and I am glad that I can take a \nchance here, as a small businessman, to bring perspective on the \nquestion a little bit out of a legal arena. This whole question of \njoint and several liability, which means to an everyday person that if \nthere is a wrongdoing that occurs and a legal dispute emerges about it, \nthat if several parties are involved, and let us say party A is \nresponsible for 90 percent of the wrongdoing and party B is responsible \nfor 10 percent of the wrongdoing,\n and a suit is filed against the two of them, if it is determined by \nthe legal process that party A, who was responsible for 90 percent of \nthe wrongdoing, does not have any money, then the person to go after is \nparty B who, while only sharing 10 percent of the responsibility, for \none reason or another, has access to large sums of money. Therefore, he \nis the target.\n\n  Mr. President, I think in the American way that is just considered \nnot fair. That is making two victims out of the crisis: The person to \nwhom the wrongdoing occurred, and then this other party who happens to \nbe in the arena, who does not share much of the responsibility, but \njust has resources. Therefore, that entity becomes the target.\n  In American A-B-C logic all across the country, it is not right for \nsomebody who does not bear the responsibility, or much of it, to be the \ntarget of paying up just because they have money.\n  We have read several of these ludicrous stories of a person coming \nout of the McDonald's, spilling their milk shake, getting into an \naccident with somebody, suing the person they got into the accident \nwith but that person is uninsured, so they sue McDonald's.\n  Mr. President, in light of the time, I will not dwell on this much \nmore. I did take an interest in this Newsweek article--I am sure it has \nbeen talked about before--with the legal tax on the everyday consumer. \nBecause of the kinds of things I have just been talking about, \neverybody is scared to death. So they build in all kinds of defensive \ntests and costs to protect themselves. An 8-foot ladder that costs \n$119.33, $23 of the cost is now a product of our legal system.\n  A tonsillectomy which costs $578 has $191 built into it because of \nour legal system. That is why 80 percent of the American public support \nthe broadening of legal reform that we have been battling here for the \nlast 2 weeks.\n  I will just close by saying once again that it is fundamentally wrong \nto make people who have a very small responsibility, if any, be the \nsubject of having to pay damages simply because they were in the area \nor arena, or we had a situation where, as I said a moment ago, 90 \npercent of the responsibility belongs to person A and 10 percent to \nperson B, but person B has resources, so they will ruin that person's \nlife, ruin that victim's personal business, simply because they had \nresources and were responsible.\n  That is fundamentally unfair. That is why so many Americans support \nthis amendment on joint and several liability, which means a person is \nresponsible, financially, for their proportional share of what went \nwrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6142-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 NOTICE\n\n  Financial disclosure reports required by the Ethics in Government Act \nof 1978, as amended and Senate rule 34 must be filed no later than \nclose of business on Monday, May 15, 1995.

Mr. President, in early January I announced my intention to \nhave the Governmental Affairs Committee develop this year a blueprint \nfor the reorganization of executive branch departments and agencies. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to indicate that this effort will \nbegin with hearings on May 17 and 18. That first day will be devoted to \nan overview of the general principles relating to the structuring of \nthe Government. The second day will focus on specific proposals that \nhave made regarding the elimination and consolidation of executive \ndepartments and agencies.\n  A number of such proposals have been made recently. In March, for \nexample, our majority leader suggested the elimination of four \ndepartments--Commerce, Education, Energy, and HUD. Similar proposals \nhave been made by other Members, both in the House and the Senate. In \nearly January, I said that we might be able to reduce the number of \ndepartments by up to one-half of the present 14.\n  But more is involved in such an effort than simply outright \nelimination of departments and agencies. We may need to retain certain \nexisting programmatic responsibilities of an agency that is itself to \nbe terminated. We need to think about where to put these programs. And \nto really do this right--to begin to move us toward a Federal \nGovernment that is appropriate for the 21st century--we ought to be \nthinking in terms of a fundamental reorganization of the executive \nbranch.\n  In other words, rather than trying to restructure the Federal \nGovernment piecemeal--eliminating a couple of departments this year, \nconsolidating a couple of more next year, and leaving everything else \nuntouched--we need to take a more comprehensive approach.\n  And this is what I intend to have Government Affairs Committee do. As \nthe committee with the jurisdiction over the reorganization of the \nexecutive branch, including the creation and elimination of Cabinet \ndepartments, the Governmental Affairs Committee is ideally suited to \nlook at the big picture, and to ensure that all the pieces of a \nreorganization fit together. Doing this may require a fundamental \nrethinking of what the executive branch ought to look like in the \nfuture.\n  To illustrate what this might mean, I would point to a proposal made \nby the Ash Commission during the Nixon administration. It was then \nproposed that four existing departments be retained-- \n[[Page S6143]] State, Treasury, Defense, and Justice--and that all the \nothers be folded into four new departments with very broad \njurisdiction--Natural Resources, Human Resources, Economic\n Development, and Community Development. In 1991, then-Congressman Leon \nPanetta proposed that the executive branch be reorganized into just six \ndepartments--State, Defense, Justice, Human Services, Natural \nResources, and Economic Policy. And just last month the Heritage \nFoundation proposed that there be only five cabinet departments--State, \nDefense, Justice, Treasury, and Health and Human Services.\n\n  But before launching into a full-scale examination of Federal \ndepartments, agencies, and programs--to see what should be eliminated, \nconsolidated, or reorganized--I think we need a better understanding of \nhow to approach this task.\n  This is why I intend first to begin with an overview hearing. The \npurpose will be to get a better understanding of the principles and \ncriteria that Congress should apply as it looks to specific aspects of \ngovernmental organization and operation. For example, is it best to \ncentralize responsibility into fewer departments, so as to focus \naccountability and enhance policy coordination? Or is it best to \ndecentralize responsibility, in order to eliminate layers of \nbureaucracy and improve responsiveness? Are there innovative ways to \nachieve the advantages to both approaches--such as through semi-\nindependent agencies located within larger departments?\n  If the Federal Government is going to retain a certain programmatic \nresponsibility--even after reorganization and streamlining--are there \nbetter ways of doing so? When, for example, should a program be part of \nan independent agency? When should it be part of a cabinet department? \nAnd when is it best to use some sort of autonomous government \ncorporation?\n  We will also ask about privatization. What does it mean, when should \nit be used, and how should it be implemented? Are there alternative \nforms that might be appropriate, sometimes referred to as \ncommercialization or marketization. And what about contracting out?\n  As I have stated, I intend that the hearing on the following day, May \n18, will address specific proposals for agency consolidation and \nelimination, and program privatization. I would invite Members of \nCongress who have offered such proposals to contact the committee if \nthey would like to testify on their ideas.\n  I should add that I also intend to have the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee begin an examination of governmental operational issues. We \nneed to improve the performance of government, as we reduce its size \nand complexity. This means a serious effort at civil service reform, as \nwell as looking at budget system reform, program performance \nmeasurement, and financial accountability. We also need to ask which \nresponsibilities might most appropriately be devolved to the State and \nlocal governments.\n  I strongly agree with the demands for cutting the size and costs of \nthe Federal Government by eliminating obsolete and ineffective programs \nand agencies. I think the right way to do this is to approach the task \nthoughtfully and carefully--but with a clear intention to develop a \nplan that is both bold and comprehensive.\n  Of course, another way to do this would be to appoint a commission--\nmodeled on the Military Base Closing Commission--to develop the plan, \nand require Congress to approve or disapprove the plan. I have in past \ncongresses introduced legislation that would create just such a \ncommission, and I am still willing to consider it as an alternative \napproach.\n  But regardless of what mechanism we use to develop it, we need a \nblueprint for the organization of the Federal Government that reflects \ntoday's priorities and fiscal realities, and that prepares us for the \n21st century. The Governmental Affairs Committee will soon begin work \non this task.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6142-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6143-S6144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF SENATOR JOHN C. STENNIS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ncomment on the life and career of our departed colleague and my good \nfriend, Senator John C. Stennis, whose long and full life ended on \nSunday, April 23, at the age of 93.\n  When Senator Stennis retired in January 1989, he had been in the \nSenate 41 years, 1 month, and 29 days. This made his service in the \nSenate longer than all but one other person in history.\n  When I came to the U.S. Senate in November 1972, Senator Stennis had \nbeen a Member of this body for nearly 25 years, and I had the great \nhonor and privilege of serving with Senator Stennis for 16 years--until \nhe retired at the close of the 100th Congress in 1989. So it is with \nsadness that I pay tribute to the memory of this departed colleague \ntoday.\n  John Stennis was a man who anyone coming to know him well would love \nand admire. I came to know him early on my arrival in the Senate. He \nwas from my neighboring State, and I learned to follow his advice and \nleadership in certain areas of our service together.\n  It was also my privilege to serve with John Stennis on the \nAppropriations Committee beginning in 1975. We had nearly identical \nsubcommittee assignments on the committee. He was chairman of the then \nPublic Works Subcommittee, now the Energy and Water Subcommittee, when \nI came aboard and I succeeded him as chairman of that subcommittee when \nhe became chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in 1978. \nWe worked together on many matters of mutual interest, especially the \nMississippi River and tributaries flood control works, and other \ninfrastructure improvements throughout the country. He requested my \nassistance on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway project and I was \npleased to help floor manage the successful completion of that massive \nproject which opened in 1985. The New York Times called the Tenn-Tom \nSenator Stennis' ``pyramid,'' and I am pleased to have had a role with \nSenator Stennis on this impressive project.\n  Mr. President, in our committee assignments and work together, I was \nblessed as much as a fellow Senator could be blessed by association, \ncounsel, and advice from our departed friend.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it has been my honor and privilege to be \nclosely associated with Senator Stennis for over 16 years of service \ntogether. As chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stennis designated and commissioned me to floor \nmanage and handle various appropriations measures including \nsupplemental bills and continuing resolutions. He was my chairman, and \nI was always happy and enthusiastic to carry out his wishes on these \nmatters.\n  Mr. President, John Stennis was unqualifiedly and unreservedly a \ngentleman in the finest American tradition. He was a man whose word was \nas good as his bond. He had an almost reverent sense of discretion and \npersonal taste in his relations\n to the greatest affairs of the Nation as in his relations to \nindividuals. He was indeed a giant in the Senate.\n\n  John Stennis was a Senator's Senator. He was gentle and courteous in \nconduct, but tough and strong in conviction and character. He \npersonified the highest ideals of honor and integrity within the \nSenate.\n  John Stennis also possessed an extraordinary, and indomitable, \nfortitude, spirit, and fearless courage. I think of the several \npersonal adversities he confronted with such wonderful dignity and \ndemeanor. In 1973, he was shot by robbers in front of his house and \nleft for dead. In 1983, his beloved wife of 52 years, he called her \nMiss Coy, passed away. In 1984, he lost a leg to cancer and was \nconfined thereafter to a wheelchair but, Senator Stennis bore these \nadversities with such great strength and courage that he served as a \ngreat inspiration to us all.\n  We are thankful for his character, for his modesty and selflessness, \nfor his devotion to the Senate and his family, for his outgoing good \nwill to his friends, for his high honor as a man.\n  Mr. President, I traveled with a number of my colleagues to the \nburial services for Senator Stennis on Wednesday, April 26, at the \nPinecrest Cemetery in DeKalb, MS. He was born in DeKalb County in the \nred clay hills of eastern Mississippi and his mortal remains were \nburied there in the family plot next to his beloved ``Miss Coy'' and \nnear his parents. Many of the Stennises \n[[Page S6144]] buried there were known as professional people--doctors, \nlawyers, teacher, and legislators. I was deeply impressed with the \ntribute given Senator Stennis by his son, John Hampton Stennis. He \nstated Senator Stennis' campaign pledge and creed when Senator Stennis \nran for the Senate in 1947, after having served as a circuit court \njudge for 10 years. That political creed was ``I want to plow a \nstraight furrow right down until the end of my row.'' Obviously, \nSenator Stennis succeeded with that campaign pledge. And that \nphilosophy seems to have guided his entire political career and his \nlife. With those words John Hampton captured the spirit and philosophy \nof John C. Stennis.\n  Senator Stennis taught through example. He has left both a challenge \nand a pattern of conduct for citizenship, as well as public life.\n  What can our citizens today find in John C. Stennis to emulate? A \ncourse of conduct that inspires confidence; absolute personal \ndedication; noble purposes always foremost as a motive and objective; \nstandards in public and private life unexcelled; a willingness to \nserve; a willingness to lead and endlessly carry the penalty of \nleadership, and above all else, the attainment of being an honorable \nman.\n  I believe we find here a man and a record that fully live up to the \neverlasting call of the poet, Gilbert Holland, who said:\n\n     God, give us men! A time like this demands\n      Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n      Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n      Men who have honor; men who will not lie;\n     Strong men, who live above the fog\n      In public duty and in private thinking.\n\n  Mary and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family of Senator \nStennis--his daughter, Mrs. Margaret Jane Womble, and son, John Hampton \nStennis, and to his grandchildren of whom he was so proud.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6143-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE McKIM BUILDING OF THE BOSTON PUBLIC \n                                LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of \none of the most beautiful buildings in America, the McKim Building of \nthe Boston Public Library.\n  Founded by an act of the Massachusetts Legislature on April 3, 1848, \nthe Boston Public Library was the first free and publicly supported \nmunicipal library in the world. By 1880, its original 10,000 volumes \nhad grown to 357,440, and the legislature empowered the city of Boston \nto take as much land within its limits as it needed to build a new \nlibrary. The trustees envisioned the new library to be a ``palace for \nthe people, and as such * * * a monumental building, worthy of the city \nof Boston.'' They hired architect Charles Follen McKim, a senior \npartner in the New York firm of McKim, Mead & White, to design this new \nedifice.\n  McKim wanted to create a building which would fit with its \narchitecturally distinguished \nneighbors--H.H.

Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record a \nletter from the Secretary of Energy to the President of the Senate that \ntransmits administration-proposed legislation. The primary purpose of \nthis legislation is to sell strategic petroleum reserve [SPR] oil to \nfund the decommissioning of the Weeks Island SPR storage facility. I am \nhaving the proposed legislation printed in the Record instead of \nintroducing it because I disagree with the policy of selling SPR oil to \nraise money. Let me explain.\n  The administration's legislation proposes three things. First, it \nauthorizes the sale of up to 7 million barrels of crude oil from the \nSPR. Second, it earmarks the moneys from that sale for the \ndecommissioning of the Weeks Island storage facility, and for other \nunspecified activities related to the SPR. Third, the administration's \nlegislation allows the sale of the SPR oil to not count adversely under \nthe budget rules. I will not speak to the asset sale issue because it \nis not central to my concerns.\n  The key policy issue raised by this legislation isn't whether the \nWeeks Island SPR storage facility should be drained of oil and \ndecommissioned; that must occur. Instead, the question facing the \nSenate is whether we should authorize the sale of SPR oil to fund this \nactivity and a host of other unspecified SPR activities simply because \nthe administration is unwilling to ask for the necessary money as a \npart of DOE's regular budget. In a nutshell the issue is: Should SPR \noil be sold to make up for a budget shortfall, or should SPR oil be \nkept on hand in case of an energy emergency? Before I explain my \nconcerns about the administration's proposal to sell SPR oil, let me \nfirst describe why the Weeks Island SPR storage facility must be \nemptied and decommissioned.\n  Weeks Island is one of the five SPR crude oil storage facilities. \nLocated in Louisiana, it holds 73 million of the total 592 million \nbarrels of oil stored in the SPR. Weeks Island is unique among the SPR \noil storage facilities. It was a commercial salt mine before being \npurchased by the Department of Energy and converted to an oil storage \nfacility. The other four SPR facilities were created specifically to \nstore oil.\n  In May 1992, a sinkhole was discovered on the ground directly above\n   Weeks Island. The cause of the sinkhole was determined to be a \nfracture in the salt formation. Over time, the fracture has enlarged as \na result of water leaking through it and into the Weeks Island storage \ncavern. In February 1995, a second sinkhole was discovered over Weeks \nIsland, but it has not yet been determined if this indicates a second \nleak.\n\n  The water leaking into Weeks Island is accumulating at the bottom of \nthe oil storage chamber and it is pushing the oil up. Although the leak \nis slow, water intrusion creates a risk of path enlargement and \nincreased water inflow. This could ultimately result in a catastrophic \nwater inflow, which would completely displace the oil stored in \n[[Page S6145]] the facility. Although a remote possibility, if that \noccurred the 73 million barrels of oil stored in Weeks Island could \nenter the underground water aquifer. That would be a major ecological \ndisaster.\n  After extensive engineering studies, DOE has concluded that the long-\nterm integrity of Weeks Island cannot be assured. Thus, the most \nprudent option is to remove the oil while the leak is manageable. Once \nemptied of oil, Weeks Island will then be decommissioned by filling the \nfacility with salt brine. Plans are being made by DOE to move the oil \nto other SPR storage sites beginning in the fall of 1995. As part of \nthis activity, DOE will put a freeze wall around the facility to \nprevent oil leakage. Full decommissioning of Weeks Island will take 2 \nto 3 years.\n  I agree with the Department of Energy that Weeks Island must be \nemptied of oil and decommissioned as soon as possible. I also agree \nthat the life extension activities should take place. As I stated \nbefore, the issue facing the Senate is not whether these should occur, \nbut rather how they are to be paid for. More specifically, should we \nauthorize the sale of SPR oil to fund these activities, or should the \nmoney come from DOE's budget? In deciding whether or not SPR oil should \nbe sold, it is worth reviewing why we have an SPR in the first place.\n  The SPR was created by Congress in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab oil \nembargo. Recall that the oil embargo caused energy shortages, sharp \nprice increases, long gasoline lines, double-digit interest rates, and \neconomic stagflation. The SPR protects the Nation by having on hand a \nsignificant amount of immediately available crude oil.\n  The function of the SPR is twofold. First, it discourages foreign oil \nexporting nations from using the oil weapon against the United States, \nas they did back in 1973. Second, it protects the United States from \nshortages and\n price spikes if a supply interruption does occur. In addition, the SPR \nis needed to satisfy the requirements of the International Energy \nProgram, which requires member nations to maintain oil stocks \nsufficient to sustain consumption for at least 90 days with no net oil \nimports.\n\n  Congress intended SPR oil to be used only if there is an energy \nemergency. The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act specifies that \nSPR oil can be sold only if the President finds that ``it is required \nby a severe energy supply interruption or by obligations of the United \nStates under the international energy program.''\n  The SPR has been tapped only once--other than for test purposes--but \nwhen used it was important that the oil be on hand. In January 1991, \nbecause of the Desert Storm war with Iraq, President Bush declared an \nenergy emergency and sold 17 million barrels of SPR oil. Had he not \ndone so, oil prices would have spiked, consumers would have suffered, \nand our economy would have been harmed.\n  Given declining U.S. oil production and the corresponding increase in \nforeign dependence, if anything we need more oil stored in the SPR--not \nless. Since the Arab oil embargo in 1973, U.S. crude oil production has \ndeclined by 28 percent and U.S. dependence on foreign oil has grown to \nmore than 50 percent. Notwithstanding additions of oil to the SPR, \nbecause of our growing foreign dependence, the SPR is increasingly less \ncapable of offsetting a supply interruption. In 1985, the SPR contained \n493 million barrels of crude oil--then the equivalent of 115 days of \nnet U.S. oil imports. Today, the SPR contains 592 million barrels of \ncrude oil--the current equivalent of 74 days of net oil imports. \nAlthough we have added nearly 100 million barrels of crude oil to the \nSPR, due to our growing foreign dependence it is 41 days less capable \nof handling a supply interruption. Thus, I am very concerned that \nselling SPR oil--even as little as 7 million barrels as proposed by the \nadministration--reduces the protection the SPR will provide in case of \nan energy emergency.\n  Let me again say that I am convinced that the Weeks Island facility \nmust be emptied and the oil moved to other SPR storage sites. We cannot \nafford an ecological disaster of the magnitude posed by a catastrophic \nrupture of Weeks Island. But I want to point out that those actions do \nnot require the amount of money that would be generated by the sale of \n7 million barrels of SPR oil, as is proposed by the administration's \nlegislation.\n  At current market rates of $20 per barrel, the sale of 7 million\n   barrels of SPR crude oil will generate about $140 million. Yet the \nDepartment of Energy needs only $89 million to move the Weeks Island \noil to other SPR storage sites and to decommission the facility. \nPossibly much less if lower cost transportation options were used. \nMoreover, only about $38 of the $89 million is actually required in \nfiscal year 1996 because decommissioning will take several years to \ncomplete. Even if the entire $89 million were required in fiscal year \n1996, that still leaves $51 million from the $140 million sale. What \ndoes DOE plan on doing with that money? They plan on spending a large \nshare on SPR life extension activities that need to occur, but more \nproperly should be part of the regular DOE budget.\n\n  DOE could have proposed to use part of its budget for Weeks Island, \nbut it elected not to. For fiscal year 1996, DOE asked for $17.833 \nbillion, a $337 million increase over fiscal year 1995. $89 million is \nonly .005 of the DOE's total budget, and only one-quarter of just the \nproposed budget increase. Surely, the administration could have found \nthe necessary moneys within its existing budget if it really wanted to.\n  A fair question is where will DOE get the money it needs if we do not \nauthorize the sale of SPR oil as requested? I say again, DOE should \nhave asked for the money as a part of their fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequest; I believe that we would have approved it. So I turn the \nquestion around and ask the administration: If it really is so \nimportant to undertake these activities, what are the lower priority \nDOE programs that you are willing to forgo? You tell us which programs \nyou want to cut.\n  I am also very concerned that selling SPR oil simply to raise money \nsets a very dangerous precedent. I greatly fear that there will be no \nend once we start doing this. Every time DOE's budget is put in a \nsqueeze, there will be pressure to sell a few barrels of SPR oil to \nprotect this or that cherished program. How will we be able to say no \nto other raids on the SPR piggy bank, if we allow it here?\n  Mr. President, the strategic petroleum reserve is this Nation's \nenergy emergency insurance policy. I do not believe that we should cash \npart of it in just because DOE is unwilling to use even the tiniest \nfraction of its $18 billion budget to address the SPR's problems. We \nmay need the SPR some day if another supply disruption occurs. After \nall, Saddam Hussein is still with us. It is for these reasons that I \noppose the sale of SPR oil as proposed by the administration and I will \nnot introduce their legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill and letter were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That--\n       (a) Notwithstanding section 161 of the Energy Policy and \n     Conservation Act, the Secretary of Energy may draw down and \n     sell up to seven million barrels of oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve to the extent that appropriations acts make \n     the proceeds from such a sale available for the purposes \n     specified in subsection (b).\n       (b) The proceeds from the sale described in subsection (a) \n     shall be deposited into a special account in the Treasury, to \n     be established and known as the ``SPR Decommissioning Fund,'' \n     and shall be available to the extent and in the amounts \n     provided in advance in appropriations acts for the purpose of \n     removal of oil from and decommissioning of the Weeks Island \n     site, and for other purposes related to the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve.\n       (c) The proceeds from the sale described in subsection (a) \n     shall be included in the budget baseline required by the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and \n     shall be counted as an offset to discretionary budget \n     authority and outlays for the purposes of section 251(a)(7) \n     of that Act, if the President designates that the proceeds \n     should be so counted, notwithstanding section 257(e) of that \n     Act.\n       (d) The authority to contract for sale of oil under this \n     section expires September 30, 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a legislative proposal to \n     ``provide for the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve and the transfer of oil from Weeks Island, and for \n     other purposes.'' This legislation, which is \n     [[Page S6146]] proposed in the President's Fiscal Year 1996 \n     Budget, is part of the Administration's ongoing effort to \n     reinvent the Federal Government.\n       The Department of Energy recently announced the planned \n     decommissioning of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's Weeks \n     Island site. Water seeping into underground storage chambers \n     is compromising the structural integrity of the facility, \n     which holds nearly 73 million barrels of oil. As a result the \n     Department will transfer the oil to other sites in Louisiana \n     and Texas, and sell up to seven million barrels of oil to \n     finance the transfer and decommissioning, and other SPR \n     activities. Currently, the Department has legislative \n     authority to draw down and sell Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     oil only under emergency authorities vested in the President \n     or as part of a test sale of up to five million barrels of \n     oil. New authority is required for this proposed sale.\n       The proposed legislation would authorize to the extent \n     provided in appropriations Acts the sale and drawdown of up \n     to seven million barrels of oil from the Reserve for purposes \n     of removing the oil and decommissioning the site. Seven \n     million barrels is equivalent to less than one day of oil \n     imports, and would not appreciably affect the mission of the \n     Reserve. Proceeds from the sale would be deposited in a \n     special account known as the ``SPR Decommissioning Fund'' and \n     would offset the cost of decommissioning and other SPR \n     activities. This bill would also allow the sale proceeds to \n     be counted as offsets to spending. Authority to contract for \n     sale of oil under this section would expire on September 30, \n     1996.\n       We look forward to working with the Congress toward \n     enactment of this legislation.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that enactment \n     of this proposal would be in accord with the program of the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6144-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          MARJORIE S. ARUNDEL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a most \ndistinguished Virginian, Mrs. Marjorie S. Arundel, of The Plains, VA, \nwho has devoted her life to the conservation of our natural resources.\n  As a member of the Garden Club of America, Marjorie Arundel has been \nrecognized for her conservation efforts in the Commonwealth of Virginia \nand across our Nation. Her tireless work has throughout more than 30 \nyears contributed much to preserve and enhance the natural beauty.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing both Mrs. Arundel and her late \nhusband, Russell M. Arundel, for a number of years in Fauquier County. \nThe contributions which they have made to that community are \nimmeasurable.\n  In the 1960's, the Arundel family donated over 600 acres of their own \nland to the Nature Conservancy, which created the first Nature \nConservancy preserve in Virginia. It is now known as Wildcat Mountain \nNatural Area. Due to her endeavors in conservation, Mrs. Arundel was \nawarded the Governor's Certificate of Recognition from former Gov. \nCharles Robb, my junior colleague in the Senate.\n  There are several projects that are trademark Marjorie Arundel with \nher typical ingenuity and spirit. I recall fondly meeting with Mrs. \nArundel in the 1980's regarding a highway widening north of Warrenton. \nMrs. Arundel promptly brought to my attention a 200-year-old oak tree \nwhich stood directly in the proposed roadway. In an effort to spare the \ntree, Mrs. Arundel then met with officials from the Virginia Department \nof Transportation, who agreed to bypass the removal of the tree. Today, \nthat ``Loretta Oak'' stands proudly and continues to live and be \nenjoyed by all.\n  As a gardener with a special interest in wild plants, Mrs. Arundel \nbecame aware that several species were being dug out of the wild and \nsold to commercial interests. These actions created serious wildflower \ndepletions in the Virginia mountainside and our neighboring States. Her \ncrusade to protect the wild populations from both trade domestic and \nabroad was truly a labor of love. Using her trademark ingenuity, Mrs. \nArundel drafted the support of World Wildlife Fund, the Natural \nResources Defense Council, and the Garden Club of America.\n  And with similar success, Mrs. Arundel has taken on other tough \nenvironmentally conscious issues, like pesticide and pollution abuses \nin the environment.\n  Mrs. Arundel's achievements include the Award of Honor presented by \nthe World Wildlife Fund; an American Achievement Medal from the Garden \nClub of America; a Stewardship of the Land Award from the Virginia \nChapter of the America Society of Landscape Architects; Communicator of \nthe Year Award from the American Horticultural Society; and the Delacy \nGray Memorial Medal for Conservation as ``a conservation leader who \ndemonstrates a love for the nature environment and a responsibility for \nits preservation.''\n  There are many accolades bestowed upon this great lady, but ``The \nLand Ethic'' well speaks to Marjorie Arundel's testimony to natural \nintegrity as, ``Conservation is a state of harmony between men and \nland.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6146-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WEEK\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, I may be a little biased, but I have \nalways believed if you give South Dakotans an even break, they can make \na living even under the toughest circumstances.\n  Yesterday I met with a man who proves my point. His name is Randy \nBoyd, and he was just named South Dakota's 1995 Small Business Owner of \nthe Year by the Small Business Administration.\n  Randy lives in a town of 300 people called Geddes in southeast South \nDakota with his wife, Sheila, and their two young children, Cassidy and \nVincent.\n  He moved back to Geddes in 1982, after his dad had a heart attack and \nhelped move his father's gunsmithing business from his garage into a \n400-square-foot shop, where they worked together repairing guns. Later \nthat year, Randy and his father bought a two-spindle carving machine \nthat could make up to eight gunstocks a day.\n  Today, Boyd's Gunstocks Industries is one of the largest original-\nequipment manufactuers of gunstocks in the country. It has grown from 3 \nemployees in 1986 to 22 full-time and 10 part-time workers, plus 10 who \ndo contract work at home. Company sales have skyrocketed from $29,000 \nin 1986 to more than $1 million last year.\n  In 1992, with help from the Small Business Administration, Randy was \nable to obtain a new warehouse for raw materials, as well as new \ncomputerized equipment to improve efficiency. The business now occupies \n13,500 square feet.\n  One of Randy's biggest challenges is finding enough skilled workers \nin a \n[[Page S6147]] town of only 300 people. He is exploring the possibility \nof opening a second facility soon in another town in order to hire new \nworkers and take advantage of new international trade opportunities.\n  In addition to creating jobs and opportunities for South Dakota \nfamilies, Randy has served on the Geddes City Council. He is a \nvolunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician. He is also a \nblack belt karate instructor.\n  In South Dakota, small business has always been big business. This \nweek, as we celebrate Small Business Week in our State, I commend the \nSmall Business Administration for the partnerships it is forging with \nSouth Dakota business owners. And I offer my congratulations to Randy \nBoyd for his hard work and his outstanding contributions to his \ncommunity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6146-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a member \nof my staff who is leaving Washington to return to her home State of \nConnecticut, Tracy Crowley. Tracy came to Washington 12 years ago to \nwork for the Small Business Committee, which at the time was chaired by \nSenator Lowell Weicker. I was fortunate that Tracy remained with the \ncommittee when I became chairman in 1987. In 1991 she joined my \npersonal staff and has been a valuable member of the office for the \nlast 4 years.\n  Mr. President, those of us fortunate to serve in the Senate are often \nblessed with loyal and dedicated staff that make us look good. However, \nvery rarely do we show the gratitude that these staffers deserve. The \nhours are long, the pay, in comparison to the private sector, is not \nvery good and the working conditions can be difficult.\n  There is no one on my staff that has been more dedicated or worked \nlonger and harder than Tracy Crowley. Although she is not a native of \nArkansas, she treated each and every appropriations project with great \ntenacity, fighting to make sure that the interests of Arkansans were \npreserved. There is not a fish farmer, park superintendent, forest \nranger or environmentalist in the State of Arkansas that does not owe \nTracy Crowley a great debt for her work on the annual Interior \nappropriations bills.\n  Twelve years is a long time for anybody to work in one place. For a \ncongressional staff person, 12 years of service is above and beyond the \ncall of duty. Mr. President, while I am sorry Tracy is leaving the \noffice, I know that she will have great success in her future endeavors \nand I wish her the best. All of those who have worked with Tracy, and \nthose she has so ably served in Arkansas and throughout the Nation, \nwill miss Tracy greatly.\n  Mr. President, I know that you and the entire body wishes Tracy well.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6147-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      OBSERVATIONS ON AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have just returned from a trip through \nthe agricultural region of my State and the farmers I represent are \nvery worried about their own future and the future of their industry. \nBy any measure, American farmers are one of this country's success \nstories. They have provided their fellow citizens with a stable food \nsupply that is both safe and affordable. In fact, Americans pay less \nfor food than any other industrialized nation in the world. They have \nalso produced enough food to feed the world's hungry and are one the \nfew sectors of our economy that has consistently registered a positive \nbalance of trade. Their success, however, seems to get lost in the \ndiscussions here in Congress and the political rhetoric of the Nation.\n  I visited with farmers in Pullman, Colfax, Walla Walla, and Moses \nLake and they do not feel that the rest of the country or the U.S. \nCongress appreciates their efforts. After reviewing the spate of \nproposals advanced this Congress, I am forced to agree with them. There \nseems to be a misconception around here that farmers are the only \nbeneficiaries of the commodity programs. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. In exchange for income protection, the farmers that sign up \nfor the program agree to accept production controls and numerous other \nguidelines and regulations on the operation of their farms. While these \nconditions were often put in place to achieve a specific public policy \ngoal, it is important to remember that it is an additional cost to \nfarmers and it is a cost they will not be able to recoup from the sale \nof their commodity.\n  Because wheat farmers face many difficulties in providing the rest of \nus with our food, it is easy to understand why almost 90 percent of \nthem in Washington State sign up for the program. In addition to a \nregulatory environment that they often consider unfavorable, they face \nunfair trading practices by our competitors, nontariff trade barriers, \nescalation costs, and a price that is too low to cover their costs of \nproduction. On top of all this, weather conditions often wreak havoc on \nall the producers' hard work. Every economic analysis I have seen \npaints a very bleak picture of the future of rural America. I believe \nthe conditions of American agriculture justify our continued support of \nthe commodity programs, the export promotion programs, and the \nconservation programs.\n  The gloomy conditions in farm country are not the only reason to \nsupport these programs, however, and I am here talking on the floor of \nthe Senate because I believe all Americans are well served by these \nprograms, not just farmers. In my State, many of the jobs in urban \nareas depend on the exports provided by agriculture. If we, as a \nnation, wish to continue to guarantee that we have a stable food supply \nand continued economic growth in our cities, it is in our interest to \ncontinue to adequately fund this Nation's agricultural program. I know \nthat I will have to continue to make that point in the urban areas of \nmy State as well as here in Congress so that there will be a greater \nunderstanding of just how critical our agricultural industries are to \nall of us. We need to keep these things in mind as we consider the \nbudget, the farm bill, and other legislation that impacts farmers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6147-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6147-S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        ISRAELI INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues and \nmillions around the world in celebrating Israel's 47th year of \nindependence. Israel's rapid economic progress and strength are \ntestimony to the vigilance and determination of the Jewish people.\n  As we celebrate nearly five decades of Israeli autonomy, we call to \nmind the many of today, yesterday, and centuries past who share a \ncommon bond: The dedication of their lives to establish and maintain a \ncountry that every Jewish person can call home. As Israeli President \nEzer Weizman recently stated, ``The State of Israel achieved its \nposition due to the fact that its people aimed for peace and fought for \nit, despite all difficulties.'' For the Jewish people, adversity has \nserved as an incentive rather than a deterrent. According to Prime \nMinister Shimon Perez, ``Israel will continue her quest for peace. At \nthe same time, she will fight those who fight peace.'' As friends, the \npeople of the United States salute the conviction and perseverance the \nJewish people as we, on this occasion of independence, reaffirm our \nshared belief in Israel's sovereignty.\n  The tiny democracy of Israel thrives in a region historically \nbarraged with \n[[Page S6148]] anti-Western sentiment. Since its inception, Israel has \nexperienced regional opposition from dictators such as Egypt's Gamal \nAbdel Nasser and Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Yet Israel has flourished \namidst such hostility. Through open, democratic elections, majority \nrules representation, and the support of her allies, Israel has proven \nthat a democracy can succeed in a region of otherwise undemocratic \nnations. Today we applaud the tenacity and the vision of the Israeli \npeople and their success in making democracy work for nearly half a \ncentury.\n  Israel's charter reads that the new state ``will rest upon the \nfoundation of liberty, justice, and peace as envisioned by the prophets \nof Israel, and that it will be loyal to the principles of the United \nNations Charter.'' Almost immediately, President Truman recognized the \nsimilarity between the United States Constitution and the Israeli \nproclamation and became the first foreign leader to endorse the newly \nformed state. With the help of allies like the United States and the \npath-breaking leadership of individuals such as Menachim Begin and \nFormer Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Israel has been able to maintain \nand even expand its strategic alliances throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, the State of Israel has made tremendous progress over \nthe past 47 years. Israel has emerged as a scientific and technological \nleader. Last year, the Israeli economy grew more than 7 percent--a \ngrowth rate higher than the more advanced economies. This is clear \nevidence of Israel's commitment to progress, and the willingness of \ncountries all over the globe to recognize Israel as a viable trade \npartner. The Israeli people have repeatedly looked beyond the events of \nthe day and maintained a focus on the need building a strong scientific \nand technological base. Neither terrorism nor war has diminished their \ndesire to maintain a strong, independent nation.\n  Without a doubt, the people of Israel could not have flourished so \nquickly without the support of friends and family living abroad. By \nconveying their support for Israel, Jewish people living in the \ndiaspora have demonstrated their commitment to a Jewish homeland. \nIsraeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres recently stated that, ``No nation \nhas been helped as much by its brothers and sisters.'' Americans of all \nreligions and creeds are brothers and sisters of the people of Israel. \nOur nations share a bond of similar values. Our experiences are their \nlessons. Israel and the United States of America have demonstrated that \na democratic society can withstand the forces of hate, oppression, and \nterror. That is why we have embraced Jews living within this Nation and \nhave pledged our support to their homeland.\n  In spite of a housing shortage, Israel maintains an open door to \nJewish immigrants. The Israeli Government has made it clear that it \nwill not refuse the admission of Jewish immigrants due to external \npolitical pressures. To do so would contradict a major principle of the \nJewish faith--that ``all Jews are responsible for one another.'' \nPresident Weizman recently reaffirmed this belief by insisting that, \n``The significance of sons and daughters coming to Israel in large \nnumbers to feel and breathe the atmosphere cannot be overemphasized. \nIsraelis, on their part, will take them to their hearts.'' This long-\nstanding policy has been a beacon of hope for the 600,000 Soviet and \n50,000 Ethiopian Jews who fled their besieged countries and settled in \ntheir new homeland.\n  Today's celebration of Israeli independence should bring to mind the \ndetermined spirit of the Jewish people. After centuries of struggle and \npersecution, the Jewish people finally have a cultural, political, and \nreligious sanctuary. To our friends in Israel, we Americans share in \nyour continuing efforts to achieve regional peace and the further \neconomic progress of your homeland. The celebration of Israeli \nindependence is a celebration of the permanence of democracy. We \nrecognize that no force can defeat your spirit of self-determination. \nIn the words of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, ``neither war not \nholocaust nor threats nor animosity could cut the energy of your \npeople.''\n  Mr. President, today is a great day for all Jewish people and all \npeople in democratic societies. The nation of Israel stands as a great \ntribute to the fortitude of the human spirit. I am pleased to join with \nmy colleagues in wishing the Jewish people, especially those in my home \nState of South Dakota, a happy and peaceful 47th Yom Ha'atzmaut.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6147-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 956, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 956) to establish legal standards and \n     procedures for product liability litigation, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       (1) Gorton amendment No. 596, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       (2) Abraham amendment No. 600 (to amendment No. 596), to \n     provide for proportionate liability for noneconomic damages \n     in all civil actions whose subject matter affects commerce.\n       (3) Kyl amendment No. 681 (to amendment No. 596), to make \n     improvements concerning alternative dispute resolution.\n       (4) Hollings amendment No. 682 (to Amendment No. 596), to \n     provide for product liability insurance reporting.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding. First, I want to begin by saying that the comments of the \nSenator from Georgia just now are right on the mark in terms of the \namendment that we will be voting on. I certainly subscribe both to what \nhe said and what the Senator from Washington has previously said about \nthis.\n  My conversation, Mr. President, this morning, has to do with a very \nspecific amendment which we will be voting on, the Kyl-McCain \namendment, which will have the effect of striking section 103 of H.R. \n956.\n  This amendment preserves State law on alternative dispute resolution \nprocedures and ensures the plaintiffs and defendants are treated \nequally through the ADR, or alternative dispute resolution process.\n  The amendment strikes section 103, which says when alternative \ndispute resolution procedures are employed, these procedures are \nenforceable only against the defendant, not against the plaintiff. \nCurrently, of course, under the State laws under which this would be \napplied, ADR provisions are equally applicable to the plaintiffs and to \nthe defendants. Of course, it should remain that way.\n  Mr. President, a fundamental tenet of American jurisprudence is that \nall parties go into court with equal rights. As a matter of fact, \nAmericans, I submit, would not submit their disputes, their lives, and \ntheir fortunes to a decision by the judge or a jury if they knew that \nthe deck was stacked against them when they began.\n  That is precisely what this section 103 of the bill does today. That \nis why we are striking this section.\n  What this section says is that when a State has an alternative \ndispute resolution procedure, the parties may use it. Well, that adds \nnothing to current law. That is the law of the States. Parties can take \nadvantage of those alternative dispute procedures, and they should.\n  As a matter of fact, we are trying to encourage more alternatives to \nproceeding through the actual trial of the case. The second part of \nsection 103 provides for the notice by one party or the other that that \nparty wants to invoke those procedures. Again, this amendment or this \nbill changes nothing in that regard.\n  The part that changes the law and that we wish to strike is titled \n``Defendant's Penalty for Unreasonable Refusal,'' meaning unreasonable \nrefusal to go through the alternative dispute resolution process. \nDefendant's penalty; there is no concomitant plaintiff's penalty.\n  In other words, the authors of this section have provided that, \nalthough \n[[Page S6149]] the defendant would suffer the consequences of refusing \nto go through alternative dispute resolution, if the defendant wishes \nto go through that process--and we all encourage them to do so--and the \nplaintiff unreasonably refuses to do so, there is no penalty on the \nplaintiff.\n  Mr. President, that is fundamentally unfair. It is exactly the kind \nof thing the American people wish Members to reform in this litigation \nprocess that we engage in in our country.\n  The whole idea of reform here, the whole notion of what we are \ndebating, is fairness. This provision would inject a fundamental \nelement of unfairness where one party is penalized for not going \nforward with alternative dispute resolution, and the other party \nsuffers no adverse consequences at all. It is fundamentally unfair.\n  Now, what the provision states is that the court shall assess \nreasonable attorney's fees and costs against a defendant who refuses to \nproceed; final judgment is entered against that defendant that that \nrefusal was unreasonable or not made in good faith.\n  That is typical of the State alternative dispute procedures here, \nthat where either parties says, ``Let's go to alternative dispute \nrather than going all the way through trial'', and the other party \nsays, ``No, I do thought want to do that,'' and it turns out the other \nparty loses and the court finds that that party's refusal to go through \nthe alternative dispute resolution procedure was unreasonable or not \nmade in good faith, then costs and attorney's fees can be assessed \nagainst that losing party. That is the law in many States today. We \nshould preserve that law.\n  This section of the bill changes that procedure in State law. It \nsays, ``No, even though you say that the losing party who refuses to go \nthrough the alternative dispute resolution in good faith should have a \npenalty, we are going to strike that in the case of only one-half of \nthe parties, the plaintiff.'' The plaintiff gets a free ride. The \nplaintiff can refuse alternative dispute resolution in bad faith and \nstill not be penalized. A defendant who refuses alternative dispute \nresolution and who loses, and the court determines he has done that in \nbad faith, has a penalty rendered against him.\n  Mr. President, I could argue either way that there should or should \nnot be a penalty. I do not want to change the State law in that regard. \nThat is why, instead of saying that the penalty would lie to both the \ndefendant and the plaintiff, which we could have done with this \namendment, we have simply said ``Let's strike the section and leave \nState law the way it is. State law treats both parties fairly. That is \nthe way it should be.''\n  So I urge all my colleagues who for the last several days have been \narguing that this is not something that the Federal Government should \nbe involved in, that we should let the States experiment, that we \nshould let them decide their own procedures here--I urge them to \nsupport this resolution, my amendment, because my amendment allows the \nState law to be preserved as it is today with no change on alternative \ndispute resolution. I think we want to encourage alternative dispute \nresolution. We will certainly not be encouraging it if we say we \nbelieve in it but only if it is a stacked deck, only if it can be used \nagainst the defendant but not against the plaintiff.\n  It is fundamentally unfair, and we should never be a party to \nchanging the law of the States in a way that will result in unfairness \nto one side or the other in litigation. So I urge my colleagues when we \nvote in about an hour on these various amendments to the bill to \nsupport the Kyl-McCain amendment to strike section 103 and thus \npreserve State ADR proceedings and preserve the balance between \nplaintiffs and defendants proceeding under those procedures.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I wonder if the Senator can respond to a question or two?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to reply.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I have come to somewhat agree with the Senator in regards \nto this. I have always been sort of puzzled as why that was put in \nthere.\n  Of course, in original ideas on alternate dispute resolution methods, \nsome of the States have had what they call court-annexed arbitration, \nand they put a penalty relative to the failure to bind on the claimant, \nplaintiff, when this occurs, which raises an issue that it could be a \nviolation of the seventh amendment, of the right to a trial by jury, by \nsaying anything is mandatory under the concept of court-annexed \nprovisions. Previous bills, as I recall, said if the judgment that \noccurred was less than what the award had been in an arbitration \nproceeding which is a part of the alternate dispute resolution, that \nthen plaintiff would have to pay the reasonable attorney's fees and \ncourt costs and so on. And that raised the question of whether that was \ncausing a claimant to be deprived of the right of trial by jury.\n  This language here has, in section 103(a)(1), that they can have an \noffer to proceed to voluntary, nonbinding alternate dispute resolution. \nIf it is voluntary and nonbinding, I do not understand why you would, \nin effect--unless it is sort of an effort to have an encouragement for \ndefendants, realizing that claimants would be the ones who would \nprobably want a nonbinding, voluntary alternate dispute procedure to \nstart in order to more rapidly dispose of their claims. In particular, \nin the States that have had procedure, they usually have a dollar \namount limitation.\n  Actually, this is already authorized under existing law which we \nvoted on several years ago, the Biden Civil Justice Act. I do not \nremember the specific title and name of it, but it authorized \nnonbinding alternate dispute resolutions in the Federal courts. You \ncould have such a proceeding under this existing statute.\n  So, I have been puzzled why proponents attempted to have the \nprovision for a possible defendants' penalty. The only reason I see is \nI thought they were probably doing it for window dressing, purely for \nthe purpose of trying to say we are giving something to the claimant; \nwhile we are taking away 100 different things, we are going to give you \n1 with the alternative dispute resolution provision.\n  Of course they use the word ``unreasonable'' in this section which \nallows for some leeway on behalf of a defendant.\n  But overall, in fairness, I sort of tend to support the Senator's \namendment here to strike the provision from the underlying Gorton \nsubstitute. I do not know what the others will do but as it is right \nnow, unless I am convinced otherwise, I may well vote with you.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Alabama. That \nhelps to give us more background on this as well. I think he is \nabsolutely correct, that as a matter of States rights many States have \nthese procedures today. If they have them, we leave them in place. But \nto the extent that we change them by saying in effect they only apply \nto one party, we, at the Federal Government level, will have injected \nan element of unfairness and I just do not think we want to be a party \nto doing that.\n  I know the Senator from Washington wishes to proceed so that is all I \nwill say about that, but I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nAlabama. I certainly agree with him on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are at this last half-hour or 45 \nminutes before a series of votes, speaking to several amendments: The \nunderlying broad amendment by the Senator from Michigan to extend the \njoint liability provisions of this bill to all litigation; the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Arizona and discussed during the \ncourse of the last few minutes; and an amendment by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina on insurance data collection and reporting requirements.\n  While he spoke briefly to that last night, I think it important to \noutline for the benefit of my colleagues who will soon be voting on it \nwhat that amendment actually does. The amendment is not so much an \ninsurance reporting act, though it does add inevitably to the huge \namount of paperwork with which our society and economy is already \nburdened, as it is another skillful attempt for all practical purposes \nto kill this bill, this whole idea.\n  What the amendment would do would be to sunset all of the substantive \nprovisions of the proposal which is now before us. I want to repeat \nthat. It would sunset all of them.\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n  I am sorry. Mr. President, I apologize. The notes I have here--the \nSenator from South Carolina has crossed those provisions out of this \nprovision. Now, it simply requires costly and unnecessary reporting \nrequirements and institutes a brandnew Government bureaucracy.\n  It stems from the proposition from the opponents to this bill that \nthe only goal of the bill is to lower insurance costs. Yet, I do not \nbelieve that either the Senator from West Virginia or I have ever \nincluded lower interest costs as one of the rationales for the passage \nof this bill. We hope that it might well be an incidental impact of the \npassage of the bill. But it is not central to our arguments.\n  To go back to the beginning, each of us has said that it is designed \nto improve the competitiveness of American businesses, large and small, \nto increase economic growth and to create more jobs, to make the \npresent system more fair by making it more open to small claims through \nan alternative dispute resolution mechanism and by creating a uniform \nand in many cases in many States a more generous statute of limitation \non claims and to reduce overall liability costs. But whatever the \nsituation may have been 25 or 30 years ago, overall liability costs are \na large universe, of which insurance premium costs are only one and one \nincreasingly less important element. Why? For three reasons:\n  First, in many States, punitive damage awards cannot be insured \nagainst. It is not true in all cases but it is true in many States. It \nis the arbitrary nature of punitive damage verdicts, which is a major \ngoal of the reforms contained in this bill.\n  Second, several years ago through a solution developed in the \nCommerce Committee, of which both the Senator from South Carolina and I \nare members, a market solution was created for the nonresponsiveness of \ninsurance premiums to market changes by a Federal Risk Retention Act \nwhich allows small businesses to pool themselves together to self-\ninsure in the area of product liability, an act which has been utilized \nby thousands of small businesses across the country. So they are \noutside of the insurance field entirely.\n  Finally, of course, most very large businesses, many of the business \nenterprises which have abandoned product lines or decided not to \ncontinue to develop new product lines, are self-insurers. They do not \ngo to insurance companies to insure themselves against product \nliability costs. They make their own business judgments about what they \nwill develop and what they will market.\n  My friend and colleague from West Virginia is constantly brought up \nas being originally a sponsor of a bill like this a number of years \nago. It is true that he was. But as I trust is the case with all of us, \nchanging circumstances and greater thoughtfulness change our minds on \nparticular courses of action. It has changed my mind on the substance \nof this bill. There was at least one previous product liability bill in \nthe Commerce Committee which I opposed in the committee, one quite \ndifferent from this. But when Senator Rockefeller, several Congresses \nago, offered an amendment like this, the product liability bill that we \nwere dealing with included strict limits on liability, caps on pain and \nsuffering damages, which this one does not. We did not have the Risk \nRetention Act in existence at that time. It was a much better argument \nat that point that this proposal would have a clear cost-cutting effect \non insurance.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes; I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I was interested in what the Senator had to say about \nwhether the Senator really does anticipate that the passage of this \nbill would reduce insurance costs. The Senator has given a couple of \nreasons why certain things are outside. But as I understand it, one of \nthe main ideas has been that this would cut transaction costs, which I \nquestion, because it bifurcates a trial requiring additional hearings. \nBut basically, will the Senator agree that where companies have \nliability insurance that there is in practically all policies no limit \non transactional costs? The defense that occurs to the company as a \nresult of liability insurance is borne by the insurance companies. \nTherefore, I raise the issue.\n   One of the arguments is the cost. I have heard the Senator talk \nabout it--defense fees, the deposition fees, and those things from the \ndefense side which really would be borne by the insurance companies. \nTherefore, it would have some relationship to the overall cost of \ninsurance, would it not?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am not entirely certain what the question from the \nSenator from Alabama consists of. But I think I understand it. I will \ndo the best that I can to answer it.\n  Yes; one of the goals of this bill is to reduce transaction costs. It \nis to see to it that more of the money that goes into the legal system \ngoes to actual victims, whether product liability as the bill is now \nmore inclusive, medical malpractice. We find it an absolute scandal \nthat for every dollar that goes into the product liability system only \n40 cents or so gets to victims. And 60 cents goes to transaction costs, \nmost of which goes to lawyers.\n  We have not separated out how much of those lawyer fees are \ndefendants' fees. That is a matter I suspect of indifference to the \nvictim. It is 60 percent. Of course, for most insurance policies there \nis no limit on the amount that the insurance company will spend in \ndefending the defendant in such a case. There hardly could be. Under \nthose circumstances the claimant's attorney would simply drive the \nengine until that level had been reached and then no longer would have \nany opposition.\n  What we are attempting to do in this bill is, one, create more \nsituations in which there was a prompt settlement through something \nless than full litigation through the ADR provisions in the bill; \nsecond, by limiting to in some respects consistent with the \nConstitution--in fact, a response to the invitation from the Supreme \nCourt of the United States under the Constitution to do so--somehow \nlimiting the possibility of huge punitive damage verdicts causing cases \nto settle earlier, and at a more reasonable price and at a lower \ntransaction cost; third, of course, simply doing more justice in the \nsystem. We hope that it will modestly cut back on the number of \nlawsuits that are brought in the first place, especially frivolous \nones, and cause the meritorious lawsuits to be settled more quickly and \neven when they go to trial to be settled less frequently with lengthy \nappeals to appellate courts.\n  This Senator did not say, I report, Mr. President, to my friend, that \nwe did not believe that there would be any reduction in liability \ninsurance costs. The Senator said that we were not utilizing that, we \nwere not making that prediction as an argument in favor of the bill. \nThe argument in favor of the bill is greater justice, especially for \nsmaller claims, the increase in economic growth and the creation of \njobs, and the encouragement of the development of new and improved \nproducts on the part of the American business community.\n  If you ask this Senator does he think that liability insurance costs \nwill go down, he does. He certainly hopes so. But the point is that if \nthey do not, unlike the situation 8 or 10 years ago, those who have to \npurchase the insurance or who face product liability claims will have \nan alternative, an alternative that we created for them in risk \nretention pools.\n If the competitive market among big insurance companies does not lower \nthe costs, those risk retention pools certainly will, and they are not \na subject of this amendment.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I might inquire of the Senator if there was testimony--I \ndo not know whether it was this year or last year--from the American \nInsurance Association, one of their officers, which basically said that \npassage of the bill would not, I repeat, not, bring about any reduction \nin liability insurance premiums? Some words are that there would be \ninsurance cost savings. I do not remember right offhand the person who \nsaid it, but I remember seeing that in a previous report of the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Does the Senator remember that testimony?\n  Mr. GORTON. I do not remember that testimony this year. I believe the \nSenator from Alabama is probably correct about some such testimony for \nyears past. But to exactly the extent that that is true, the amendment \nwhich we are discussing is irrelevant and has no impact other than \nprobably \n[[Page S6151]] to drive up costs because it drives up the paperwork \ninvolved in the entire system.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. In regard to the alternate dispute resolution, if I \nrecall right--I do not have it before me right now--there was a GAO \nstudy which indicated that they thought the bill would increase the \ntransaction costs and that one of the reasons for it was the way the \nalternate dispute resolution provision was contained in the bill. Does \nthe Senator recall that testimony?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am sorry; I was distracted.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I was speaking of the GAO report. I do not have it before \nme. But as I recall the GAO report indicated that the provisions of the \nbill--maybe it was a predecessor of it--in their judgment would not \nreduce transactions costs, and that one of the reasons was they felt it \ncould possibly increase it was because of the alternate dispute \nresolution methods that were there--increasing it another hearing as \nwell as the provisions dealing with bifurcation, separate hearings that \nyou would have to go through--thereby bringing about additional \nlawyer's fees in regards to those proceedings, particularly on the \ndefendant's side where there is an hour billable approach.\n  Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. GORTON. I have to say to my friend from Alabama I do not recall \nthat. As the alternative dispute resolution provisions in these bills \nhave changed from year to year, certainly no such report has been filed \nin connection with the alternative dispute resolution proceedings, or, \nrather, sections in this bill.\n  I see, Mr. President, it is now 5 minutes after 12. I know my \ncolleague from West Virginia wishes to speak, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as one of the managers of what was \nonce solely a bill to reform our product liability system, I wish to \nspeak to my colleagues, those who share in a general sense the purpose \nof what we are trying to do here, about at least my views on the \nbusiness before us.\n  At 12:15, in 10 minutes, the Senate will vote on three pending \namendments to this bill, and then vote on the first of two cloture \nmotions. The second cloture motion vote is expected at 2 o'clock, maybe \n2:15. I am not sure.\n  I am going to make a motion to table both the Abraham amendment on \njoint and several liability and the Kyl amendment that tries to delete \nthe alternative dispute resolution section of this bill, alter it in \nways which I find distasteful, but the message I wish to get across \nmost strongly is that I will vote against both cloture motions. I will \nvote against the one at--whenever the first one comes, and I will vote \nagainst the second one. I will not vote for one and against the other, \nagainst one and for the other. I will vote against both. I want both to \nfail because there are those of us who believe that this bill needs to \nbe kept to product liability--and I think there are many of us--so that \nwe can at least get some tort reform accomplished, which we will not in \nany other event. Those folks need to vote in their conscience, if that \nis where their conscience dictates, against both cloture motions, to \nvote no on both cloture motions. And I hope anybody interested in \nachieving actual results on product liability reform will do the same \nand vote no on both cloture motions today.\n  This past week, frankly, has been rather astonishing to me, Mr. \nPresident. One would think, when a majority of Senators get the chance \nfinally, without a filibuster on the motion to proceed, when we finally \nget to work on a bipartisan, balanced, focused piece of legislation to \ndeal with this very serious problem, that is precisely how they would \nspend their time here.\n  But, no, instead, we have watched Senator after Senator come eagerly \nto the floor to add one more ornament to the tree. As I have said \nbefore, anyone who has ever decorated a Christmas tree knows that if at \nsome point you put too many ornaments on, too many bows on one side of \nthe tree, that tree is going to fall over and crash down and you lose \nthe ornaments, the tree, the Christmas spirit, and it is a terrible \nvacation. That is the situation I see before us right now. And the \namendments from Senators Abraham and Kyl are going to assist in sending \nthis tree to the ground.\n  The Senate has had absolutely no opportunity that I know of to \nconsider whether the joint and several provisions in the product \nliability bill make sense for the rest of civil actions. I do not know \nof any hearing on the topic. I do not see a bill from the Judiciary \nCommittee on the topic, or a report laying out the arguments on an idea \nas significant as this one. Yes, the House of Representatives made a \nsudden decision to throw the idea into their stew of legislation on \ntort reform that passed a couple weeks ago. But this body is supposed \nto keep a standard of actually thinking about what it is on which we \nvote. We pride ourselves on that. And the idea of deleting the section \nin this bill that promotes alternative dispute resolution is appalling \nto me.\n  Maybe I need to restate the obvious. Legislation becomes law when \ninterests are balanced, when legislators work out difficult problems \ntogether, when problems are addressed with practical remedies.\n  The alternative dispute resolution provision in our product liability \nbill is there for these reasons. Here is one of the parts of this bill \ndesigned solely and specifically to deal with one of the most maddening \nproblems in product liability. Victims have to wait too long for \ncompensation. The system is too slow and too inefficient. If I am a \nsmall farmer from West Virginia or some other place and I do not have \nany money, and I do not have any money to hire lawyers or any money to \npay for time for 3 years to go by, I can avail myself of the \nalternative dispute resolution.\n  We want to encourage that small farmer who does not have the \nresources, the small business person, the person of very modest means. \nAnd this is the way we do it, by allowing him this particular \nadvantage. That is why we want to promote alternative dispute \nresolutions in a way that will speed things up so that that small \nfarmer will, in fact, come in and probably just speak for himself and \nthe case will be simply handled right there on the spot, no lawyer, no \nproblem, no time, no expenditure of money.\n  I really do not think we have to apologize for devising an approach \nthat is slanted toward the victim when we are talking about encouraging \nthem to resolve their cases earlier. Remember, they have wait to 3 \nyears now. We are trying to encourage people to get that amount of time \ndown.\n  So in the strongest possible terms, I urge my colleagues to defeat \nboth of these amendments. And I urge my colleagues, again, to vote \nagainst cloture, not just the first cloture vote but also the second \none that will take place this afternoon at about 2 o'clock.\n  We now have a bill that has become deformed, disfigured. A small \ngroup of Senators has refused to follow the discipline of working out \nwith the rest of us who are interested in enacting product liability \nreform what we will do to accomplish that. Until they do, we should \nbring this bill to a halt.\n  A majority of Senators are clearly interested in a balanced, moderate \nproduct liability reform bill--I am convinced of that; I deeply believe \nthat--that serves consumers, victims of defective products, and \nbusiness in a balanced way. We still have that opportunity. The pending \ncloture votes will demonstrate what it takes to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to hear Senator Rockefeller \nstate that the way the bill stands now, it is deformed and disfigured. \nThat reminds me that this bill, as it stands right now, is pretty much \nsimilar to what the House passed. I do not think whatever we pass here \nin the Senate, when it goes to conference, is going to come out much \ndifferent from the House bill. I think we know that the Speaker over \nthere has great influence.\n  I just feel that, basically, whatever we do here which passes the \nSenate and goes to conference will reflect the Speaker's position on \nthis overall issue. I think the key battle is the battle here in the \nSenate and the Senate's \n[[Page S6152]] role to be deliberate and to prevent unwise, unfair \nlegislation.\n  Now, if there is a disfigurement and a deformity by extending the \nlanguage pertaining to punitive damages, by extending the language \neliminating joint and several liability to cover all civil actions, \nthen that is a recognition that there is a fault with that extension, \nthere is a fault with the overall underlying principle that is being \nbrought forth here in regard to punitive damages and also to \neliminating joint and several liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, a vote is to occur at 12:15.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I send to the desk and will ask to have printed in the \nRecord a letter, dated May 25, 1990, to the Honorable Richard H. Bryan, \nthen chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, pertaining to the GAO study.\n  One of the questions that he asked was:\n\n       In your research of the current product liability system, \n     have you found any evidence that would support the argument \n     that the current tort system has led to an increase in \n     transaction costs?\n\n  And they ended up saying: ``We believe that S. 1400''--which was a \npredecessor bill--``is unlikely to reduce transaction costs in product \nliability suits.''\n  I send that letter to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    General Accounting Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1990.\n     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Consumer, Committee on Commerce, \n         Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed are my responses to your \n     questions regarding my February 28, 1990, testimony on \n     product liability. If you have additional questions or if I \n     can be of further assistance, please call me, or Cynthia \n     Bascetta.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Joseph F. Delfico,\n                                 Director, Income Security Issues.\n       Enclosure.\n       1. In your research of the current product liability \n     system, have you found any evidence that would support the \n     argument that the current tort system has led to an increase \n     in transaction costs? What are the major factors that \n     contribute to the level of transaction costs? Do you believe \n     that S. 1400 would reduce transaction costs in product \n     liability suits?\n       In our review, we did not collect data over time to assess \n     whether the current tort system has led to an increase in \n     transaction costs. We reviewed a 1987 study by the Rand \n     Corporation, however, that reported that between 1980 and \n     1985, the annual growth rate for the amount of tort \n     litigation was about 3 or 4 percent. Expenditures for this \n     litigation grew at about 6 percent for automobile-related \n     litigation and about 15 percent for other tort claims, \n     including product liability.\\1\\ Although the literature is \n     replete with general concerns about the costs of litigation, \n     we did not find any other research documenting trends in \n     transaction costs associated with the current tort system.\n     \\1\\Hensler, Deborah R. et al, ``Trends in Tort Litigation: \n     The Story Behind the Statistics,'' Rand Corporation, \n     Institute for Civil Justice, Santa Monica, CA, 1987, p. 25.\n       The major factor affecting the level of transaction costs \n     is the length of litigation. As we reported, cases we \n     reviewed took years to process--almost 2-\\1/2\\ years to move \n     from filing of a complaint to the beginning of the trial. On \n     average, appealed cases took 10 more months. In our review, \n     we noted two possible reasons for lengthy litigation in \n     product liability cases. First, the law has been evolving in \n     many states, which may increase the complexity of the legal \n     decisionmaking process. Breaking new ground and establishing \n     new precedents, for instance, take more time than cases where \n     the law is clearer and requires little deliberation or \n     interpretation. Second, both plaintiffs and defendants have \n     little incentive to cut corners. Although plaintiffs have \n     incentives to expedite the process so that they can receive \n     compensation, their attorneys may want to invest substantial \n     resources in developing cases to deter manufacturers from \n     making harmful products. Defendants may prefer not to settle \n     cases to deter further suits over the same product. Pretrial \n     discovery--a time-consuming and expensive feature of \n     litigation--therefore becomes an important part of product \n     liability suits for both parties.\n       We believe that S. 1400 is unlikely to reduce transactions \n     costs in product liability suits. For cases that are \n     litigated, the procedural features of the tort system would \n     not be changed by the bill. It is also not clear that the \n     bill provides strong incentives for alternative dispute \n     resolution, which could cut litigation costs. Moreover, the \n     alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that may be used \n     are left to the discretion of the states. If these mechanisms \n     are not binding, then they may add to rather than substitute \n     for litigation. If this happened, costs could actually \n     increase.\n       2. Your study found that product liability cases were quite \n     time consuming:\n       A. Could you please identify the specific factors that make \n     these cases time consuming?\n       B. Are there any benefits to the judicial process for \n     having prolongated cases? For example, is lengthy litigation \n     ever justified in order to insure an accurate record in a \n     complicated case?\n       C. What are the disadvantages for having lengthy \n     litigation?\n       D. Do you believe S. 1400 would reduce litigation time in \n     product liability cases?\n       A. Specific factors that make these cases time-consuming \n     are the steps required in the legal process. In the vast \n     majority of cases we reviewed, we noted that defendants often \n     used the maximum amount of time legally required. Delays \n     caused by defendants were also common. In most cases, \n     manufacturers have little incentive to settle cases, as we \n     said in response to the first question, although some may be \n     concerned about adverse publicity regarding their products.\n       In the typical case in our review, the defense was first \n     granted 30 days to respond to a petition. The defense \n     typically argued, at the end of the 30 day period, that the \n     plaintiff did not use the product or that negligence was the \n     cause, at least in part, of the harm. This began the legal \n     process known as discovery, in which the burden was on the \n     plaintiff to build a record by collecting data on product \n     design, specifications, and other (often proprietary) \n     information from defendants. The preparation of \n     interrogatories--testimonial evidence from eyewitnesses, \n     expert witnesses, and others--was another lengthy process \n     needed for the record. We also found frequent motions to \n     extend and delay court dates.\n       B. In any case, a complete and accurate record would be \n     necessary to ensure a fair legal outcome. In this sense, \n     lengthy litigation and its attendant costs might be \n     justified. Generally, however, we believe litigation should \n     be shorter, and as a result, we would expect lower overhead \n     costs and higher net compensation for injured parties. In our \n     report, we concluded that we cannot determine the degree to \n     which the benefits of the judicial process balance \n     substantial administrative costs. We also noted that benefits \n     thought to accrue from the judicial process include providing \n     incentives for product safety. The Rand Corporation noted in \n     its 1987 study that ``there is no ready measure of the \n     inherent reasonableness of the system's transaction costs. \n     Especially when we focus on the tort system's goal of \n     deterrence, we might encounter circumstances in which we find \n     very high transactions costs acceptable.''\\2\\\n     \\2\\Ibid., p. 25.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       C. There are two primary disadvantages of lengthy \n     litigation. First, as we have already discussed, time greatly \n     increases costs. Second, protracted litigation means that \n     injured parties wait longer for compensation.\n       D. S. 1400 will probably not reduce litigation time in \n     product liability cases because discovery and other legal \n     processes would not be affected by the bill. And, because the \n     effect of S. 1400 on alternative dispute resolutions is \n     unclear, we cannot predict the extent to which lengthy \n     litigation could be avoided if product liability reform were \n     enacted.\n       3. Your study indicated that the data needed to give a \n     complete evaluation of the effects of tort reforms is not \n     readily available. Do you have any recommendations on how the \n     relevant and necessary data might be collected? If so, what \n     is your projection of the length of time it would take to \n     collect such data?\n       When we began our review, we found that with the exception \n     of ongoing work at the Rand Corporation, very little data had \n     been gathered in any systematic way about the outcomes of \n     tort reforms. According to researchers at Rand, neither \n     critics nor defenders of the civil justice system have much \n     solid evidence to support their views. In fact, the legal \n     system is notorious for its fragmentation and dearth of \n     records on finances and workloads. Our review confirmed \n     serious inadequacies in available databases, methodological \n     difficulties in designing rigorous studies, and an overall \n     lack of empirical evidence that impede efforts to evaluate \n     the effects of tort reforms.\n       For a comprehensive assessment of research prospects in \n     this area, we refer you to the following Rand Corporation \n     publications: (1) Hensler, Deborah R., ``Researching Civil \n     Justice: Problems and Pitfalls,'' Summer 1988; (2) Reuter, \n     Peter, ``The Economic Consequences of Expanded Corporate \n     Liability: An Exploratory Study,'' November 1988; and (3) \n     Carroll, Stephen J., ``Assessing the Effects of Tort \n     Reforms,'' 1987.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Senator Hollings is unable to be here. He was called down \nto the White House on a budget matter.\n  In regard to his amendment, he has asked that I point out that his \nsame amendment was accepted by unanimous consent last year. The \nproponents of the bill, Senator Gorton \n[[Page S6153]] and Senator Rockefeller, accepted the amendment by \nunanimous consent in the last Congress. So I am just repeating that at \nthe request of Senator Hollings relative to this matter.\n  But overall, this bill is a very unfair bill. It has added to it to \nmake it much more encompassing, to make this matter of punitive damages \nnow extend to other suits far into what it does.\n  There are other provisions, such as the Abraham amendment, that, in \neffect, extends the elimination joint and several liability to all \nsorts of suits. Now, in our courts, you either have criminal cases or \nyou have civil cases. Under this, it extends it to all civil suits \nbrought under any theory whatsoever. So it is very broad and \ncomprehensive, and very much covering almost every conceivable type of \ncivil lawsuit that you might have, including such things as State \nantitrust laws.\n  Sexual harassment in State laws would be covered; disability \nprotections in State laws; Americans with disabilities would be \ncovered, as it would apply, by State laws relative to this; automobile \naccident cases, all sorts of things in regard to it.\n  It is an extremely broad and encompassing bill. I think it ought to \nbe defeated.\n        abraham amendment no. 600 on joint and several liability\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the Abraham \namendment to extend limitations on joint and several liability for \nnoneconomic damages to all civil actions.\n  The sponsors of this bill, and this amendment, have pointed out that \nthere are problems with joint and several liability. In some cases, a \ndefendant who has only a marginal role in the case ends up holding the \nbag for all of the damages. That doesn't seem fair.\n  On the other hand, there are good reasons for the doctrine of joint \nand several liability. We all know that cause and effect cannot \naccurately be assigned on a percentage basis. There may be many causes \nof an event, the absence of any one of which would have prevented the \nevent from occurring. Because the injury would not have occurred \nwithout each of these so-called but for causes, each is, in a very real \nsense, 100 percent responsible for the resulting injury.\n  This bill and this amendment, however, do not recognize that in the \nreal world, multiple wrongdoers may each cause the same injury. They \ninsist that responsibility be portioned out, with damages divided up \ninto pieces. Under this approach, the more causes the event can be \nattributed to, the less each defendant will have to pay.\n  Unless the person who has been injured can successfully sue all \nguilty parties, he or she will not be compensated for his or her entire \nloss. The real world result is that most plaintiffs will not be made \nwhole, even if they manage to overcome the burdens or our legal system \nand prevail in court. Wouldn't it be more fair to say that any \nwrongdoers who caused the injury should bear the risk that one of them \nmight not be able to pay its share? Put another way, isn't it more fair \nfor all of the wrongdoers who cause an injury to bear this risk than \nfor the victim to carry the burden of uncompensated loss?\n  More than 30 States either maintain the doctrine of joint and several \nliability or have come up with creative approaches to address the \npotential unfairness of imposing joint and several liability in some \ncases without unfairly hurting the injured party. Because these State \nlaws are more favorable to the injured party than the approach adopted \nin this amendment, so they would all be preempted.\n  As far as I am aware, no hearings have been held on this broad \nproposal to abolish joint and several liability for noneconomic damages \nin all civil cases. There has been no discussion of the range of State \nlaws that would be overridden by this amendment and the effect that \noverriding them would have. This amendment is unfair and unbalanced, \nand I cannot support it.\n               Punitive Damage Caps For Small Businesses\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, and \naccepted by the Senate yesterday. The amendment provides for a $250,000 \ncap on punitive damages for individuals whose net worth does not exceed \n$500,000 and corporations, partnerships, associations, and units of \nlocal governments with fewer than 25 employees.\n  Mr. President, small businesses are the engine that drives the \nAmerican economy and provide for at least half of this country's new \nemployment opportunities. As such, Mr. President, as we debate the \nissue of imposing a punitive damages cap, we need to ensure that small \nbusinesses are not punished disproportionately when they take actions \nwhich call for the imposition of such damages.\n  Mr. President, punitive damages are designed to punish the offender \nand protect the public by deterring conduct that is harmful. I am, \ntherefore, a strong proponent of the right of courts to police \negregious conduct through the award of punitive damages. Thus, while a \ncap on punitive damage awards should be sufficient to punish and deter \nfuture action, it should also reflect the fact that a cap that may be \nsufficient to punish a large corporation may in fact push a small \nbusiness into the abyss of bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken to small business owners in New Jersey \non this issue. What I have heard over and over again is that if they \ncommit offenses that merit an award of punitive damages, they should be \npunished; however, the punishment and deterrent effect should reflect \nthe economic situation of the small business offender. Mr. President, a \n$250,000 punitive damage award against a small business with assets of \n$400,000 may drive the owner out of business, while a $5 million \npunitive award against a large corporation with assets in excess of \n$500 million will have less of a deterrent effect. I cannot support \nsuch a disproportionate impact on small businesses struggling to meet \ntheir bottom line.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Ohio which serves to balance our national \ninterest in punishing and deterring harmful conduct and protecting the \nviability of small businesses.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have been working on product liability \nreform for more than a decade. During that time, a wide range of my \nconstituents--consumers, manufacturers, small businesses, and workers--\nhave told me about the serious problems with the present system.\n  Injured people are upset about both the length of time it takes to \nreceive fair compensation and the high cost of legal fees. \nManufacturers are reluctant to introduce new products because of the \ninconsistent product liability laws in the 50 States. Small businesses \nare hurt by the costs of defending themselves against unjustified \nlawsuits. Workers fear that the costs in the present system will drag \nthe economy down. Consumers question whether they are getting high \nquality products at a fair price.\n  We need reform that will improve the system for everyone. To do that, \nwe must strike a balance between many competing interests. We must not \nadopt reform that tips the balance too far in any direction. In the \npast, I have opposed measures that unfairly limited the rights of \nconsumers, and I will continue to do so.\n  Because 70 percent of all products move in interstate commerce, this \nis an appropriate area for Federal standards. A national, more uniform \nsystem would lower costs and speed the resolution of disputes. At the \nsame time, we need to be careful about making other changes in the \nlegal system that have not been as carefully thought out.\n  The original bill, crafted by Senators Rockefeller and Gorton, \noffered the kind of carefully focused, balanced reform that would \nimprove the system for everyone. I am a cosponsor of that bill. I am \nconcerned, however, about a number of changes that were made to the \nlegislation during the past week.\n  For example, the bill now contains a separate title on medical \nmalpractice reform. I agree that there are significant problems with \nmedical malpractice litigation and that Congress should enact carefully \nconsidered reforms. The proposal that was added to the product \nliability bill, however, is flawed.\n  It contains, for example, a provision that would make it harder to \nbring lawsuits against obstetricians who are seeing the patient for the \nfirst time. This provision might not have much of an effect on \nwealthier patients who \n[[Page S6154]] would have a primary doctor supervising the obstetric \nservices. But what about those poor women who only see the doctor \nduring the actual delivery of the baby? If they were injured, they \nwould have a difficult time receiving compensation.\n  The Gorton-Rockefeller bill was expanded in other ways. For example, \nthere is now a cap on punitive damages in all civil cases--not just \nproduct liability cases. There have been a number of studies and \ncommentaries about the problems with punitive damages in product \nliability cases. Those analyses suggest that some reform is needed for \nthose cases. However, it is not clear that we need to reform punitive \ndamage awards in all civil cases. In my view, we ought to engage in \nmore extensive debate before taking such drastic steps.\n  Additionally, I have concerns about putting arbitrary limits on \ndamages. Because caps limit flexibility, they can lead to unjust \nresults in some cases. I have filed an amendment that would address \nthis problem. Under my amendment, the jury would determine whether \npunitive damages are appropriate, but the judge would set the amount. \nHopefully, we will resume debate on the bill and consider this \namendment.\n  Because of these and other concerns, I will vote against cloture. \nThere is still much work that needs to be done on this bill, and this \nis not the time to cut off debate. I still support product liability \nreform and will work with my colleagues to enact careful, balanced \nreforms. But I will not support efforts to ram through other changes in \nthe legal system that go far beyond the balanced product liability bill \nI co-sponsored.\n  We have a real chance to actually pass meaningful and fair product \nliability reform this year, and I will not support anything that \nendangers those chances. In my view, there is a bipartisan majority of \nSenators that would support that approach, and I look forward to \nworking with them to pass a good bill.\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 600\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 600.\n  Mr. GORTON. Has a rollcall been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. GORTON.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, assuming that this is free time, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, be allowed to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is controlled and equally divided. \nWithout objection, the Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, I have listened carefully over the past weeks of this \ndebate--pro and con--on product liability. I am not an attorney, so I \nhave tried hard to work through what is fair and what is not. While I \nwould like to have an opportunity to vote for cloture on a more \nnarrowly crafted bill, I cannot vote for this bill with the Dole \namendment included. To do so, I believe, would extend the impact of the \nbill far beyond the limited field of product liability, and impose \nmajor limitations to redress of grievances across the board in all \ncivil actions, without the opportunity of Committee hearings in the \nSenate and consideration of how the bill would impact other specific \nareas of the law.\n  Anyone who has read ``The Rainmaker,'' the newest best seller, can \nsee what impact the Dole amendment would have, for example, in \ninsurance cases. Insurance companies would be able to do exactly what \nwas done in that book, act in bad faith. And I simply cannot support \nthis.\n  I believe that Senators Gorton and Rockefeller have worked hard to \ncraft a bill with reasonable reforms that could pass this body. I was \nparticularly pleased with the compromise reached with the Snowe \namendment to limit punitive damages to two times compensatory, which is \nnow part of this bill. This replaces the original fixed cap of \n$250,000, or three times economic damages, whichever is greater. I \nbelieve this would be a fair model which takes into consideration both \nwomen and children whose earnings may be limited or nonexistent.\n  I find myself in strong support of other major provisions of this \nbill, as well. Specifically, I support the imposition of a 2-year \nstatute of limitations from the time the injury and its cause are \ndiscovered for a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit. This provision is \nactually more permissive than that in many States, and California. This \nprovision is actually victim and plaintiff friendly.\n  Two, the imposition of a 20-year statute of repose, an outer time \nlimit on litigation involving workplace durable and capital goods. This \nis a fair standard of repose.\n  The bill would eliminate product seller's liability--including that \nagainst wholesalers, distributors, and retailers--for a manufacturer's \nerrors. Sellers would remain liable in cases of their own negligence. \nFor example, if a seller removed the manufacturer's label from a toy \nthat said it is not appropriate for children under 6 years of age, and \na child was subsequently injured, the seller would be liable.\n  The bill would preserve a plaintiff's power to sue one defendant, \ntheoretically the deep pocket, for the full amount of economic damages, \nbut eliminate such joint and several liability for noneconomic damages, \nsuch as pain and suffering.\n  It would allow either party to offer to participate in alternative \ndispute resolution--something that I very much thought and hoped would \nbe part of this bill, and which I believe is an important part, \nespecially for the plaintiffs who have small claims.\n  The bill would bar recovery of a plaintiff who is more than 50 \npercent responsible for causing their accident \n[[Page S6156]] due to intoxication from alcohol or any drug. This puts \na fair measure of the degree of culpability on a plaintiff in an \naction.\n  It would reduce the amount of the judgment against the defendant if \nthe product user is found to have misused or altered the product. I \nbelieve this is a just and fair provision. It would eliminate liability \nof raw material suppliers for medical devices, such as the supplier of \nteflon/dacron, products often used to coat a medical device.\n  Finally, the bill would deny an employer at fault in causing a \nworkplace injury the right of reimbursement for workers compensation \nbenefits from an employee who wins in a suit against a manufacturer.\n  The tort liability system has been a particular source of concern to \nmany, and that includes everyone: consumers, professional service \nproviders, manufacturers, and public agencies, all of whom, in recent \nyears, have faced increasing liability insurance costs. Over the last \n40 years, general liability insurance costs have increased at over four \ntimes the rate of growth of the national economy. American \nmanufacturers and products sellers generally pay product liability \ninsurance rates that are 20 to 50 times higher than those of their \nforeign competitors. In a global marketplace, that becomes a real \nbarrier to competition.\n  Many believe that the tort liability system of delivering \ncompensation is seriously flawed, requiring high transaction costs to \ndeliver compensation that some see as inadequate and others as too \ngenerous, but which most agree is uncertain and unpredictable.\n  Putting aside the size of the judgment for a moment, the transaction \ncosts associated with the current product liability system--including \nplaintiff's attorney's fees, defense legal fees, court proceedings and \nother public expenditures, the time of the litigants--are enormous. The \nRand Institute found that overall transaction costs of the tort system \nactually exceed compensation to plaintiffs.\n  Critics of product liability reform, on the other hand, argue that \nhowever well or poorly the system performs its compensation function, \nit must be preserved and indeed strengthened because of its importance \nas a means of deterring unlawful, careless, negligent conduct in the \nmanufacturing of a product.\n  I believe the basic bill provides a fair and reasonable balance. Many \nof its provisions are either consistent with or based on California \nlaw.\n  The two key features of the bill that have raised the most concern \nare the cap on punitive damages and the joint and several liability \nprovisions.\n  I was pleased to work with and support Senator Snowe's amendment on a \nmodified punitive damages formula that is responsive to the concern \nraised about the impact on women and children of the punitive damages \ncap in the original bill.\n  Instead of linking the punitive damages cap to a formula that is \nlopsided in favor of those with high amounts of lost wages, the \nmodified formula links punitive damages to what I consider a fairer \nmeasure--the full compensation received by the plaintiff.\n  This formula is substantially that recommended by both the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers and the American Law Institute, and both \nbodies have given a great deal of study and attention to the issue of \npunitive damages.\n  Although I would support a bill without a punitive damages cap, I \nhave concluded that some reform of this area is needed.\n  The American College of Trial Lawyers, for example, commented that \npunitive damages awards ``* * * often bear no relation to deterrence \nand merely reflect a jury's dissatisfaction with a defendant and a \ndesire to punish, often without regard to the true harm threatened by a \ndefendant's conduct.'' They further note that ``* * * punitive damages \nshould be more difficult to obtain and that the amounts of such awards \nshould be subject to more control.''\n  The Supreme Court, as well, has expressed concern about punitive \ndamages that ``run wild,'' and have clarified that it is the job of \njudges to review awards for their reasonableness.\n  In a recent law review article, it was noted that in recent years, \nthe scope of punitive damages law has broadened considerably as the \ncourts have applied them in new fields of law--such as product \nliability, mass tort litigation where punitive damages can be awarded \nrepeatedly, and contract law--all areas of the law where punitive \ndamages did not traditionally apply.\n  As a result, the number of awards has increased significantly. In my \nown State of California, between January 1, 1990, and December 31, \n1994, there were 86 punitive damage jury verdicts in State courts that \nwere equal to or greater than $1 million, out of several hundred cases, \nresulting totally in judgments of $1.7 billion. California has one of \nthe largest number of punitive damages awards and size of awards in the \nNation.\n  The Gorton substitute amendment, as modified by the Snowe amendment, \nI believe is the right approach. It retains punitive damages, which are \na powerful tool for deterring conduct which society finds offensive and \nflagrant and, at the same time, ensures that more reasonable awards \nwill be set.\n  Another area that has been of great concern are the provisions on \njoint and several liability. This provision in the bill is actually \nbased on reforms enacted in California in 1986 by ballot initiative.\n  It neither appears reasonable nor fair to hold a defendant liable for \nmore than their share of the fault just because they are the deep \npocket or the only available party to be sued. The public policy has \nbeen that in selecting among parties to bear the burden, pick the deep \npocket. I do not agree with that.\n  Again, I think the approach of the bill, as in California, is the \nfairest compromise, allowing for full economic compensation, but an \napportioning of noneconomic losses among responsible parties in \nproportion to their level of fault.\n  I want to speak for a minute on biomaterials, which impacts the \ngrowing medical technology sector in my State. In April of last year, \nthe New York Times reported that big chemical companies and other \nmanufacturers of raw materials, used to make heart valves, artificial \nblood vessels, and other implants, began warning medical equipment \ncompanies that they intended to cut off deliveries because of fears of \nbeing joined in lawsuits.\n  In essence, many biomaterials suppliers simply will not provide their \nproduct to medical device manufacturers because such transactions \ninvolve low returns and a high risk of substantial losses.\n  Ms. Peggy Phillips, an attorney with a life-sustaining medical \ndevice, testified before a Commerce subcommittee and told me \npersonally, of her own story. She suffers from sudden cardiac death \nsyndrome--a disease where the patient's heart will unexpectedly stop \nbeating for no apparent reason. As a result, Ms. Phillips had a life-\nsaving device implanted in her body called an implantable \ndefribillator. Essentially, it functions to shock her heart back to \nlife and to maintain a constant heart beat.\n  This device and others like it, however, are in jeopardy, because, as \nMs. Phillips noted, it does not make sense for biomaterial suppliers to \ncontinue providing those materials for device manufacturers.\n  She related a story of one supplier who spent $8 million annually \ndefending itself in cases involving an implantable device even though \nthat supplier had no role in the design, manufacture or sale of the \ndevice.\n  She noted that sales by all suppliers to the device ``totaled \n$418,000 while sales of this same raw material to all other markets \ntotaled $282 million.''\n  The provisions of this bill, both preserve access to essential \nsupplies and shorten the liability chain so that those who are truly \nresponsible for the design, manufacture or sale of a product will be \nthe party hauled into court to be held accountable.\n  The current State-by-State system of product liability is ever \nchanging and filled with conflicting rules it presents, today, I \nbelieve, an unfair barrier to competition, and creates an \nunpredictability which is neither fair to business nor consumers \nbecause it translates into less development of new products and higher \nproduct costs for the consumer.\n  It is my hope that I will have an opportunity to vote on a narrow \nbill \n[[Page S6157]] which includes the provisions of this bill on which I \nhave stated my support, but which does not include the Dole amendment \ncrippling punitive damages in all civil actions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the leader \nfor his courtesy, and I want to thank the two authors of the bill. I \nknow they have labored long and hard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will take 2 or 3 minutes, and I think the \nSenator from Utah wishes to speak, and maybe others. There will be one \nmore cloture vote on the substitute amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield? We will have our time? I know \nthe majority leader is talking on leader's time.\n  Mr. DOLE. We each have 11 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time of 11 minutes has expired; \nthe majority leader has time remaining.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Are we talking about those for and against the bill? \nAre we deemed the minority side? I think by the recent vote we would be \nthe majority side.\n  I'll be glad to yield to the majority leader. I just wanted to have \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia yielded time to \nthe Senator from California, and the time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will work it out. We will just have to delay the vote. \nWe have 10 minutes on this side.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Maybe it will not take quite 10 minutes. We had somebody \nthat wanted to leave at 2 o'clock. We will work it out.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We will work it out. We have regular order at 2 \no'clock--another vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will delay it a few minutes so that the Senator will \nhave time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wanted to remind people before the next cloture vote that \n83 percent of the American people want to reform our legal system. They \nwant to eliminate abusive, large damage awards that benefit only \nlawyers and not the public, and they want commonsense, not dollars and \ncents, legal reform.\n  Who would have thought that 2 weeks ago a majority of the Senate \nwould vote to extend punitive damages to all civil cases? It would have \nbeen hard to believe 2 weeks ago that a majority of the Senate would \nvote to add medical malpractice to the bill. It would have been hard to \nbelieve 2 weeks ago when we started on this bill that a majority in the \nSenate had proved by its vote that it wants to improve the legal system \nso that it benefits a majority of the Americans and not a majority of \nthe trial lawyers.\n  Do not forget, with the votes we have been able to pretty much meet \nwhat the House did in a bipartisan way in the Contract With America. \nThe vote in the House was 265 to 161. We had a lot of Democrats and a \nlot of Republicans come together and respond to the voices of the \nAmerican people.\n  For the first time in 10 years, we have broken the stranglehold of \nthe tort lawyers. We have heard the voices of the American people and \npassed amendments that protect entities as varied as small businesses, \nGirl Scouts, churches, Little Leagues, firefighters, and policemen.\n  For all this endorsement of change, the forces of status quo remain \nas strong as ever. They continue to object and delay, and our \nconstituents pay more in the cost of this gridlock. The cost is steep.\n  Let me remind the Senate and the American people of the outrageous \ncost of our legal system: It adds about $8 to $11.50 to a dose of DPT \nchildhood vaccine; it adds $20 to the cost of a $100 stepladder; it \nadds $100 to the price of a $200 high school football helmet; and $500 \nto the price of a new car.\n  Experts have estimated that without reform of our legal system, it \ncosts every American $1,200, or $4,800 for a family of four. That is a \ncost of $300 billion per year, a tax on the American people. Any wonder \nwhy the American people want change and want Members to make as many \nchanges as we can?\n  I do not have any anticipation that there will be a sudden switch and \nwe will get cloture on the second vote. I think there were 46 voted for \ncloture--44 Republicans, 2 Democrats--and the balance who voted were \nopposed to cloture. There will be another cloture vote in the next 15 \nminutes. There is an opportunity for those who may have not fully \nunderstood the import or the impact of the vote ``yes'' on this cloture \nvote.\n  It seems to me if we are going to reform our legal system we have a \npretty good package here. Not everything people wanted is in it, but it \nis a pretty strong package. We owe it to the American people, in my \nview, to invoke cloture on this bill and then proceed to pass the \nsubstitute as amended.\n  If that fails, there will be a substitute offered by the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from West Virginia. But I think we have one \nlast opportunity here to say that we are not doing business as usual. I \nhope that my colleagues will grab that opportunity. I yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation now? \nHow much time is on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 6 minutes 52 seconds; \nthe minority time is expired. The time for voting was earlier extended \nto 2 minutes after 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is the Senator from South Carolina the majority or the \nminority? We have not clarified that. The time was supposed to be \nequally divided, and we have not said a word on this side.\n  Mr. DOLE. Five minutes?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I don't know if I need 5 minutes: I am being persuaded \nby my colleagues they have heard enough from me.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield 5 minutes of our time. That would leave \n2 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, right to the point. We assume that the contention of \nthe sponsors of this bill is that we need tort reform. This contention, \nhowever, has been totally contradicted by the data that have been \ncollected on the product liability system. I will go right to the heart \nof the matter. Of all civil claims filed in the United States of \nAmerica, 9 percent represent tort claims; and of all the tort claims \nfiled, 4 percent of that 9 percent represent product liability, the \nsubject matter at hand.\n  If they really want to talk reform, they would obviously go to \nautomobile accidents and many other tort cases, which represent the \noverwhelming majority of tort cases filed, not product liability. That \nrefutes that particular contention.\n  They contend, ``Well, wait a minute, there is a litigation \nexplosion.'' That was refuted at all the hearings, and studies by the \nRand Corp., the General Accounting Office, and Prof. Marc Galanter of \nthe University of Wisconsin. What these studies have shown is that the \nfact of the matter is that product liability claims now are in a \ndiminishing scale. That is why they say at the State's level, ``Look, \nwe do not have a problem. We oppose this measure.'' Both the \nAssociation of State Legislatures, and the Association of State Supreme \nCourt Justices are on record as opposing this bill.\n  The American Bar Association, the Association of State Supreme Court \nJustices, the State attorneys general, everybody connected with the law \non this particular score comes, testifies, and opposes this measure for \nthe simple reason, No. 1, they do not really find a crisis, or cause \nfor Federal action.\n  And in the context of eliminating duplicity and confusion, the \nproponents of this bill will actually add to the confusion, add to the \ncomplexity, by enunciating rules of guidelines at the Federal level, to \nbe interpreted and administered by the 50 States in accordance with \ntheir own law. However, their refusal to establish a Federal cause of \naction is evidence that they do not believe in their own bill.\n  This bill, in fact, is a manufacturers bill--but they exempt \nthemselves. I see the Chair now is limiting my time. It just goes \nagainst any kind of sound procedure.\n  If everybody is in step, Senator, with the contract, this is exactly \nopposed to the contract. The contract says that \n[[Page S6158]] the best government is that closest to the people.\n  They keep quoting Jefferson around here, and instead of block grants \nlike they have for crime and block grants for welfare back to the \nStates, block grants for housing back to the States, here they want to \ntake the authority, the 200-some-year authority from the States and \nrelegate it to the Federal bureaucrats.\n  I am finally getting in step with the contract. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nin support of cloture on the Gorton substitute for the product \nliability bill as amended.\n  The American people support these commonsense changes to this bill. A \nmajority of the Senate has supported these commonsense changes to the \nbill. But defenders of the status quo are now filibustering the bill \nand filibustering the changes Americans want.\n  Who benefits if they win? Some--just some--of our Nation's trial \nlawyers benefit: those who want to keep the status quo.\n  Who benefits the most in the status quo? Who has the largest stake in \nmaintaining this out-of-control civil justice system and its runaway \npunitive damages? I think most of my colleagues know who. Some of our \nNation's trial lawyers. And I believe most Americans understand that, \nas well.\n  The opponents of change may want to shroud this issue under a \nsmokescreen of high-blown rhetoric, but when the smoke clears we will \nsee some of the Nation's trial lawyers laughing all the way to the \nbank. Who else could defend a system where an undisclosed $601 paint \nrefinishing of an automobile results in a $2 million punitive damage \naward? Who else could defend a system where an insurance agent's \nmisrepresentation about a $25,000 policy could result in a jury award \nof $25 million in punitive damages?\n  We could go on and on. Now, the fact of the matter is, I am not \ntalking about all trial lawyers, just some who literally have milked \nthis system dry.\n  Everybody knows we have to make these changes. There are excesses in \nthe system, and these excesses are ones that only trial lawyers, some \ntrial lawyers, could love. Runaway punitive damages is one of those \nexcesses.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote for cloture on this next vote and help \nus to bring about the change that all America wants and only a few \ntrial lawyers want to avoid.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support cloture \non the Gorton substitute to the product liability bill, as amended. The \nAmerican people support commonsense change in our legal system. But the \nstubborn defenders of the status quo are now filibustering the change \nAmericans want. Who benefits? Some of our Nation's trial lawyers, \nthat's who.\n  As I have mentioned earlier, this bill represents the culmination of \na longstanding, bipartisan effort to correct some of the more egregious \nfaults of our product liability and civil justice systems. The defects \nin our product liability system have been long recognized.\n  We also passed a provision to apply punitive damage reform to all \ncivil cases whose subject matter affects commerce. As I noted during \nthat debate, punitive damage awards have grown out of control in this \ncountry. They have been out of control in all civil litigation--not \njust product liability cases. Even opponents of this legislation have \npointed out time and again that excessive punitive damage awards in \nthis country are most heavily evident in nonproduct liability cases. I \nagree. That is why I cosponsored the Dole punitive damages amendment, \nand why I was so pleased that a majority of my colleagues supported it.\n  That amendment improves the underlying bill by addressing more \ncompletely the crippling litigation costs that have been imposed not \nonly on our product manufacturers but on cities and counties, volunteer \norganizations, service providers, small businesses, and others.\n  We have also added medical malpractice reform to the Gorton \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. President, I have listened as the champions of the status quo \nhave mislabeled this bill as a manufacturer's bill. It is a pro-\nconsumer bill. I have listened as these opponents of change in our \ncivil justice system talk about the bill as narrowly drawn, covering \nonly some participants in our national economy, even as they, \nironically, resist efforts to have some provisions of the bill extended \nto cover all civil actions. These comments are, with all due respect, \ndiversionary in their effect.\n  Who benefits the most from the status quo? Who has the largest stake \nin maintaining, in place, this out of control civil justice system and \na runaway punitive damages system? I think most of my colleagues know \nwho--some of our Nation's trial lawyers. I believe most Americans \nunderstand that, as well.\n  The opponents of change may wish to shroud this issue under a \nsmokescreen of high blown rhetoric. But when the smoke clears, there \nare some of the Nation's trial lawyers, laughing all the way to the \nbank. Who else could defend a system where an undisclosed $601 paint \nrefinishing of an automobile results in a $2 million punitive damage \nverdict? Who else could defend a system where an insurance agent's \nmisrepresentation about a $25,000 policy could result in a jury award \nof $25 million in punitive damages? Who else could defend a $38 million \npunitive damage verdict over the handling of a car loan? Who else could \ndefend a system where liability concerns impede volunteer organizations \nand are so costly to them?\n  Now, I am not talking about all trial lawyers, and I understand the \nvital role lawyers play in vindicating individual rights. But lets face \nit: there are excesses in the system only some trial lawyers could \nlove.\n  Runaway punitive damages are one of those excesses. The pending \nmeasure fixes this problem, and others. I urge a vote for cloture and \nallow us to give the American people the commonsense legal reform they \nwant.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6155-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last evening, as I sat in the chair, \nthe distinguished minority leader came on the floor and made a \nstatement about, among other things, Medicare. There were many of the \nthings he said on that occasion with which I disagree and so I take \nthis opportunity, while my memory is still fresh on the minority \nleader's comments, to register my disagreement.\n  The reason I am doing it this quickly, and I hope this completely, is \nbecause I believe that the issue of Medicare's impending bankruptcy is \nso important that we should not allow statements that are incorrect to \nstay on the Record uncorrected. We should make sure this debate is as \ncareful and as correct as it can possibly be. The stakes are much too \nhigh for this debate to take place in an atmosphere that some might \nconsider demagogic.\n  I will take several of the minority leader's statements now and \nrespond to them specifically. The first one: He said--and I am quoting \nfrom this morning's Congressional Record, page 6128:\n\n       Republicans have discovered that the Medicare Program faces \n     challenges in the years ahead. Democrats told them and the \n     Nation that 2 years ago when we shored up the Medicare \n     Program and cut the deficit, all without Republican votes.\n\n  Madam President, I apologize for not having this particular chart \nmade up in a chart big enough to show the world. Perhaps the television \ncan pick it up for those that are watching. But I am sure those in the \nChamber can at least see the direction of the curve, which is the \nhospital insurance trust fund balance, in billions, starting in 1994; \nit goes up slightly in 1995 and then begins a precipitous plunge to \nzero in the year 2002.\n  The reason I hold this chart up is because the minority leader has \nsaid, ``Democrats told the Nation that 2 years ago.'' This chart, Madam \nPresident, became available on April 5, 1995, not necessarily 2 years \nago.\n  I sat in the Chamber in the other body when the President of the \nUnited States addressed the House of Representatives in September 1993, \nroughly 2 years ago, and gave a masterful discourse on health care. He \ndid not mention anything relating to the facts contained in this chart.\n  If, in fact, Democrats told Members this 2 years ago, the President \nof the United States neglected to mention it when he made his statement \nto the joint session of Congress.\n  I will not claim to have participated in all portions of the health \ncare debate last year. I do not think any Member can make that claim. I \nwatched the health care debate very closely. I cannot recall a single \ninstance where a single Democratic spokesman told Members in last \nyear's debate that the Medicare trust fund was in any kind of trouble.\n  The minority leader talked about the budget. I participated in the \nbudget debate when the new administration came in. The adoption of the \nbudget of which the minority leader is so proud, and I cannot recall--\nand I would like to have him point out to me if I am wrong--a single \ninstance during that budget debate where the Democrats told Members \nthat this trust fund was headed for disaster, indeed, extinct, in the \nyear 2002.\n  I think the minority leader is incorrect when he says the Republicans \nare just discovering something that the world has known and that the \nDemocrats openly told Members about 2 years ago.\n  Second, he says:\n\n       House Republicans are considering reductions in Medicare \n     growth on the order of $300 billion. Senate Republicans have \n     said they will need to reduce normal Medicare growth by $200 \n     to $250 billion.\n\n  Then he goes on to say this is normal growth; the Republicans are \ncutting this growth in a way that is irresponsible.\n  What he does not tell Members is that during the health care debate \nlast Congress, the President himself projected that we needed to reduce \nMedicare by $118 billion. I am not going to quibble with him--yes, the \n$200 billion figure that is talked about in the Senate now is obviously \nmuch higher than the $118 figure that the President talked about.\n  The point is that the President, in last year's debate, and Democrats \non this floor in last year's debate said, ``We must reduce Medicare,'' \nand the figure the President came up with was $118 billion.\n  I do not think it is appropriate to say the Republicans have suddenly \ndiscovered the idea of reducing Medicare in the hundreds of billions of \ndollars, and is that not terrible, when the President himself was \nsaying we have to reduce Medicare from the projected rates by in excess \nof $100 billion. That was OK, then. Now, Republicans are being bashed.\n  The one I feel the most strongly about, Madam President, is this \nstatement where the minority leader said:\n\n       Medicare Program costs are increasing because all health \n     insurance costs are increasing. In fact, on a per capita \n     basis, Medicare and Medicaid costs are increasing at the same \n     rate as privately insured costs.\n\n  On this one, Madam President, I did go to the chart makers and I have \nproduced a chart. I will put it here and share it with the Members of \nthe Senate and ask unanimous consent that the figures contained in this \ntable be printed in the Record following my Statement.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Here are medical expenditures. The dark figure--no \nmetaphor intended--the dark figure is for public expenditures for \nhealth care; the light figure is for private expenditures.\n  The expenditures are calculated in terms of percentage growth. That \nis, if we look at 1985, in that year, public expenditures for health \ncare went up at a rate of 8.8 percent per year, while private \nexpenditures went up 10.3 percent. We can see in these years there is a \ndisparity.\n  Some years public ones go up faster than private; other years private \nexpenditures go up substantially faster than public expenditures. We \ncan see that, in general terms, it is around 8 or 9 percent in public \nexpenditures and slightly more than that in private expenditures.\n  [[Page S6160]] Then in 1989, something happened. In 1989, the rate of \nincrease for public expenditures went to its highest level--11.9 \npercent; private levels going up at 10.3 percent. Then, in 1990, public \nexpenditures went up 13.2 percent; for the second year in a row, public \nexpenditures went up faster than private, a trend that has continued to \nthis day unabated.\n  In 1991, public expenditures are still up in the double digits--12.6 \npercent, but market forces are beginning to assert themselves in the \nprivate marketplace, and the private expenditures only increased 5.6 \npercent. It did not stay down that low the next year. They came up to \n6.9; but public expenditures stayed in double digits at 10.8 percent.\n  Now they have been getting better. In 1993, public expenditures 8.5, \nbut private is 7.2. In 1994, public expenditures come down to 7.8; but \nprivate drops to 5.3 percent.\n  For the minority leader to say that the reason we cannot do something \nabout the expanding growth of Medicare is because Medicare expenditures \nare going up at the same rate as private expenditures, is to ignore the \nfacts of the case.\n  Private expenditures are coming down in terms of the percentage \ngrowth at a faster rate than public expenditures are coming down. \nIndeed, Madam President, if we were to take the minority leader's \nstatement at face value, where he says:\n\n       Medicare Program costs are increasing because all health \n     care insurance costs are increasing on a per capita basis. \n     Medicare and Medicare costs are increasing at the same rate \n     as privately insured costs.\n\n  If that statement were true, that would mean that Medicare and \nMedicaid costs would be increasing at 5.3 percent per year, which \nfigure, Madam President, is within the band the Budget Committee is \nconsidering for increases for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I have sat in on the budget briefing and I have heard the budgeteers \nsay, ``If only we could get the rate of increase down to 5 percent, we \ncould solve all of our problems.'' The rate of increase is down to 5 \npercent in private expenditures.\n  The minority leader thinks the two are the same. Perhaps he has them \nconfused and thinks that the private people have not done a good enough \njob and the private expenditures are up in this kind of level for \npublic expenditures. In fact, they are not. They have, ever since 1989, \ncome down at a faster rate than the public expenditures come down and \nthey are leading the way.\n  This is the point we need to keep in mind, then, Madam President, \nwith respect to Medicare and the reforms that are necessary. We cannot \ndemagog this issue. We must stick with the facts. Our goal is to make \nthe system that takes care of our elderly as stable, as secure, and as \ncertain for the future as the system that takes care of the rest of the \npopulation.\n  If we can do it as responsible public servants at the same rate of \nincrease that exists in the rest of the population, we can solve all of \nour budgetary problems and the disastrous circumstance indicated in \nthis table will go away.\n  Madam President, I have nothing but respect for our distinguished \nminority leader. I consider him a friend and one of the more reasonable \nand certainly most thoughtful Members of this body. I feel that the \ninformation that he shared with the Senate last night is inaccurate, \nand it becomes Members in this debate to make sure that the record is \nset straight as quickly as possible, because the stakes in this debate \nare so high.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, recently I announced that I was not going \nto be seeking another term in the Senate. It has been a wonderful \nopportunity these last 16\\1/2\\ years to serve in this great body, to be \nserving with all of my great colleagues and friends from all the 50 \nStates, and all the wonderful staff people that make this place run. I \njust want to thank all of them so much for their many kindnesses shown \nto me.\n  Mr. President, I was cleaning out my desk a while ago and just \nlooking through something I have had in my desk for some time that was \nprepared by some of the individuals, I think, in the Historian's \noffice. That is not the proper name for those who prepared this. But I \nthought while there were interested parties involved, I might read a \nfew pages of some of the history of the desks in this Chamber. This is \na brief history.\n\n       When British troops burned the U.S. Capitol in 1814 during \n     the War of 1812, they severely damaged the Senate Chamber and \n     destroyed the original furnishings. The rebuilt Chamber was \n     completed in 1819 and the Senate ordered 48 new desks at a \n     cost of $34 each from Thomas Constantine. A New York \n     cabinetmaker, he also constructed desks for the House of \n     Representatives. Many of these early desks remain in use in \n     the Senate Chamber today. As new states have entered the \n     Union over the years, additional desks of identical design \n     have been built and placed in use.\n       Throughout most of the 19th century a senator's only office \n     was his desk on the Senate floor,\n\n  We did not have, I might say, the Senate office buildings. This was \nour office, the desk that was on the Senate floor.\n\n     but gradually separate rooms were assigned. The earliest \n     offices were Committee rooms occupied by their chairmen; \n     additional space later became available under the Olmsted \n     Terraces on the West Front of the Capitol. Finally, with the \n     completion of the first Senate office building [the Russell \n     Building] in 1909, all senators were able to occupy suitable \n     offices on Capitol Hill.\n       Over the years, modifications have been made to the Chamber \n     desks to provide more room for books and papers. Beginning in \n     the \n     [[Page S6161]] 1830s, three- to four-inch high mahogany \n     writing boxes were added to each desk. The writing boxes were \n     not installed all at one time, but periodically over the next \n     40 years, usually at the request of a desk's occupant. Senate \n     vouchers record payments to carpenter R. B. Griffin for \n     altering nine mahogany desks in 1860, shortly after the \n     Senate moved to its present Chamber.\n       Not every senator preferred the modification, but today \n     only one desk--``the Webster--lacks a writing box. Senator \n     Daniel Webster reputedly refused to have his desk added to on \n     the grounds that if his predecessor had managed without the \n     extra space, so could he. No succeeding occupant of Webster's \n     desk has seen fit to abandon that opinion. In order to bring \n     the height of the Webster desk into visual line with others \n     in the Chamber, a raised base has been added. Although he was \n     born in New Hampshire, Webster represented Massachusetts in \n     the Senate, and the desk has continued to be associated with \n     Webster's birth state. New Hampshire Senators Styles Bridges \n     and Norris Cotton, for example, occupied the desk for long \n     periods. In 1974, just before Cotton retired from the Senate, \n     he secured the adoption of Senate Resolution 467 (93rd Cong., \n     2nd sess.), specifying that the Webster desk would henceforth \n     always be assigned to the senior senator from New Hampshire.\n       Other early Senate desks bear design characteristics that \n     allow their differentiation. The oldest desks incorporate \n     wooden inlays of circular and rectangular banding at the \n     sides, crotch veneer mahogany across the fronts, and narrow \n     reeding on the feet. These features were incorporated in \n     desks newly-made throughout the third quarter of the last \n     century and may today be found in more than seventy of the \n     present number.\n       The difference in shape and dimension among the desks is \n     due to the original semicircular arrangement in the Old \n     Senate Chamber.\n\n  Not this Senate Chamber, but the Old Senate Chamber.\n\n       A desk's shape conformed to its position in the room: if on \n     the aisle it was narrow and angled, if near the center it \n     tended to be wider and more square. If the oldest desks could \n     be rearranged to the original configuration, it is believed \n     they would form a perfect semicircle.\n       During the mid-19th century, mahogany shelves were added \n     near the bases of the desks. At the turn of the 20th century, \n     the feet were enclosed with a metal grille and connected to a \n     plenum chamber below the floor which provided ventilation.\n\n  That, Mr. President, was the air-conditioning system. We have a much \nbetter air-conditioning system now than they had then.\n\n       Inkwells and sanders atop the desks have also undergone \n     change. Original inkwells were composed of clear cut glass, \n     covered with square, flat tops that moved horizontally. In \n     1933, the remaining original inkwells were replaced by \n     containers having hinged covers, because the earlier design \n     was no longer manufactured.\n       Over the years the desks have been periodically rearranged, \n     as new states sent senators and as party representation \n     increased and diminished. When additional desks were \n     required, these were generally made by private cabinetmakers, \n     although the four newest desks--those constructed for Alaska \n     (1959) and Hawaii (1960)--were built in the Senate's own \n     cabinet shop.\n       Seven distinct numbering systems have been employed over \n     the years to track the expanding group of desks and their \n     locations. These numbers--both Roman and Arabic--are still \n     visible below and inside the desks in various places. The \n     current system, instituted in 1957, consists of Roman \n     numerals burned into the right-hand corner of the principal \n     crosspiece beneath the desks. The desks are not arranged on \n     the Senate floor in numerical order. The easiest method of \n     tracing the heritage of each desk is to read the names carved \n     inside desk drawers.\n\n  Now, in earlier years, the Members of the Senate carved their names \nin the desk drawers. I hate to say that in modern times I have looked \nin my desk drawer and some of the occupants of this desk even wrote \ntheir name, it appears, with a ball point pen. That is not quite as \nclassy as carving.\n\n       It appears that such inscriptions are a 20th-century \n     tradition, for the earliest recorded names date back only to \n     the first decade of this century. Possibly some 19th-century \n     senators inscribed their names in the desks, but these names \n     have been lost when drawers were refinished. Not all names in \n     drawers were personally inscribed by the senators. Many \n     reveal an identical hand, suggesting either that older drawer \n     bottoms were replaced and the names recopied, or that staff \n     members, rather than senators, took responsibility for \n     chronicling certain holders. In recent decades, senators have \n     adhered more closely to a tradition of personally inscribing \n     desks.\n       One difficulty in verifying the desks' 19th-century \n     assignees is the fact that for many years Senate doorkeepers \n     closely guarded such privileged information. Isaac Bassett, \n     Senate page and doorkeeper from 1831 through 1895, feared \n     that souvenir hunters might damage the historic furniture if \n     it was widely known which pieces were used by the famous \n     Senators Clay, Calhoun, or Senator Webster. Bassett the page \n     and the doorkeeper had reasonable cause for alarm. In April \n     1861, when the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment was bivouacked \n     temporarily in the Senate Chamber, literally living in the \n     Senate Chamber, Bassett entered the room just in time to hear \n     the sound of splitting wood on the Democratic side. Rushing \n     to\n      investigate, he found a Union soldier bayonetting the desk \n     recently vacated by Jefferson Davis, then president of the \n     Confederacy. ``Stop! Stop! What are you doing?,'' Bassett \n     shouted. ``That is not Jeff Davis' desk--it belongs to the \n     government of the United States. You were sent here to \n     protect government property, not to destroy it.'' Today, a \n     small block of wood inlay on the left side of the desk \n     marks the spot where the bayonet once struck the desk of \n     Jefferson Davis.\n       Traditions associated with Senate desks continue to evolve. \n     A recent example is the so-called `Candy Desk''. Each member \n     of the Senate knows which desk is the candy desk. Senator \n     George Murphy (R-CA) originated the practice of keeping a \n     supply of candy in his desk for the enjoyment of fellow \n     senators. This desk was subsequently passed on to other \n     members for use, but the tradition of keeping candy in the \n     desk that occupies that particular place in the back row of \n     the Chamber continues today.\n       The custom of dividing the arrangement of Senate desks by \n     party is almost as old as the parties themselves. Democrats \n     traditionally sit on the presiding officer's right; \n     Republicans on his left. But the division has not always been \n     definitive as it is today.\n       In the Old Senate Chamber, an equal number of desks was \n     placed on each side of the aisle, without regard to party \n     size. When one party elected more than half the senators, \n     some majority party members had to find space on the minority \n     side. When the Senate moved to the modern Chamber in 1859, \n     the practice of dividing the desks equally continued for \n     several years. But during the Civil War many Southern \n     Democrats withdrew from the Senate and Republicans took their \n     places on the Democratic side, even though empty desks were \n     available on ``their own'' side.\n       The new Chamber was large enough to permit a somewhat \n     flexible seating arrangement and in 1877 the practice began \n     of moving desks back and forth across the center aisle to \n     permit all majority members to sit together on the \n     appropriate side of the aisle. From time to time since then, \n     one party has elected such an overwhelming majority that it \n     has become necessary to again have majority members sit on \n     the minority side. For instance, during the 60th Congress \n     (1907-1909) ten Republicans sat on the Democratic side, while \n     during the 75th Congress (1937-1939) thirteen Democrats sat \n     on the Republican side. Such seating became known as the \n     ``Cherokee Strip,'' meaning that the overflow of majority \n     party senators were ``off their reservation'' [the Cherokee \n     Strip in Oklahoma was land belonging neither to the Indian \n     Territory nor to the United States]. By then it had become \n     the practice for senior senators to take front row, center \n     aisle seats; junior majority party members who filled the \n     ``Cherokee Strip'' were assigned either rear row or end seats \n     on the minority side of the chamber.\n       Senators independent of either party have traditionally \n     chosen on which side of the aisle they preferred to sit. \n     Once, during the 1950s, when Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon \n     had left the Republican party but not yet joined the \n     Democrats, he placed his chair temporarily in the middle of \n     the center aisle in order to demonstrate his independence.\n       The seating of the majority and minority leaders at the \n     front row desks on either side of the center aisle is a \n     relatively recent Senate tradition, dating back only to 1927 \n     for the Democrats and 1937 for the Republicans. In the 19th \n     century, party leadership was not yet institutionalized. \n     Certain senators were recognized as leaders for reasons of \n     personal popularity and political skill, not elected to an \n     official post by their parties. For example, Henry Clay \n     always occupied a rear seat near the Chamber entrance. From \n     that position he was able to signal party members as they \n     came in before a vote, while vigorously denying the role of \n     party floor leader.\n       Not until the 1890s did party caucus chairmen emerge as \n     floor leaders and for the most part such leaders retain \n     regular seats. Front row desks went to senior senators in the \n     party. For many years, the front seat on the Republican side \n     was held by Senator Robert La Follotte, Sr., an insurgent who \n     was frequently at odds with his party's majority. Two earlier \n     Democratic leaders, John T. Morgan, in 1902, and Oscar W. \n     Underwood, in 1921, took front row desks, each retaining that \n     position after his service as leader had end. Not until \n     Underwood left the Senate did Democratic minority leader \n     Joseph Robinson move to the front row desk, which he \n     continued to hold as majority leader. Following Robinson's \n     death, the desk went to his successor majority leader, Alben \n     Barkley. The desk has been used by Democratic leaders ever \n     since. On the Republican side, the front row desk was held by \n     senior senators until 1937, when minority leader Charles \n     McNary moved there, setting a precedent that continues today.\n\n  Mr. President, the actual office that prepared this report, and it \nwas done in February 1995, was the Office of Senate Curator. I want to \nthank the Senate Curator for preparing this report.\n  Also, in the back of this report, it gives a history of desk No. 39. \nThis is \n[[Page S6162]] desk No. 39, Mr. President, and it lists all of the \nSenators who have occupied this particular desk.\n  I just want to name a few of these. Some of these names may stand \nout. John Bankhead from Alabama occupied this particular desk. John \nBankhead lived over on 19th Street, right off of Dupont Circle. John \nBankhead was the father of Tallulah Bankhead. Tallulah Bankhead was one \nof the grand actresses during that period of time, and they lived on \n19th Street, where I used to live.\n  Now, also, Patrick McCarran of Nevada occupied this particular desk, \nNo. 39. He was the author, I assume, of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \nwhich many people will recognize.\n  Theodore Francis Green, of Rhode Island, occupied desk No. 39. \nTheodore Francis Green may have been--I do not know, that record may \nhave been broken--but at one time he was the oldest Member to ever \nserve in the Senate. That may have been surpassed. I need to check and \ncorrect it. But he was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nimmediately preceding the chairmanship of Senator J. William Fulbright \nof the State of Arkansas.\n  Another very illustrious individual who has occupied desk 39 is Estes \nKefauver, from Tennessee, known for his coonskin cap and all his grand \ncampaigning as he ran for President and as he ran for Vice President. \nHe really was a major force in the 1950's in the Democratic Party and \nin American politics.\n  Another great Senator who has occupied desk No. 39 is Henry M. \n``Scoop'' Jackson, of course from Washington State, who passed away \njust a few years ago. He truly was one of the giants of the Senate. He \noccupied desk 39.\n  Frank J. Lausche, from the State of Ohio, occupied this desk, desk \nNo. 39. For some of you who may not know, Frank J. Lausche, to the best \nof my recollection, served more terms as Governor than any other \nGovernor elected in the history of America. I think he was Governor of \nhis State for--it seems like well over a decade and perhaps even close \nto 2 decades, in the State of Ohio.\n  Mr. President, some of this may not seem too important to a lot of \npeople, but there may be some students around who someday would want to \nknow more about the Senate Chamber and about the desks in the Chamber.\n  As Senator Rockefeller and Senator Coats and myself take our \nconstituents through the Capitol and sometimes sit with them in the \ngalleries, sometimes people ask us about the aisle, where do the \nRepublicans sit and where do the Democrats sit? And so we thought it \nmight be a good time to put a little statement in the Record giving a \nlittle, brief history about this Chamber and some of the desks that \nmake up this wonderful U.S. Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senator seeking recognition.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6160-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6162-S6163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICARE INSOLVENCY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

I \ninvite his reaction if he is within the sound of my voice.\n  He said in his remarks the Medicare trustees' report predicting \ninsolvency only became available in April 1995; that it was not \navailable 2 years ago when the President's deficit reduction package \nwas debated.\n  The fact is that the Medicare trustees' report is available every \nyear for all Members of Congress to see, and every year the report has \nbeen predicting insolvency of the Medicare trust fund, sometime between \n1999 and the year 2003. So there should be no surprise with regard to \nthe predictions of this year's trustees' report. I think the question \nis, how we will generate Medicare savings over the course of the next \nyear, and how will we use those savings.\n  There are some who have advocated providing a significant tax cut for \nthe wealthy. I think it is fair to say that when you cut Medicare to \nthe extent that some have proposed it be cut, and then you propose a \nsimilar decrease in taxes for the very wealthiest among us, one would \nhave to conclude that the cuts in Medicare will be used to pay for the \ntax cut for the wealthy. That was the main point I was making.\n  Regardless of whether people are willing to make that association, as \nvalid as I believe it is, I think it is very clear everyone recognizes \nthat, indeed, the Medicare trust fund is in serious trouble. In fact, \nthe President's 1993 deficit reduction package addressed this issue \nthrough proposals designed to delay insolvency for several more years. \nBefore the President's deficit reduction package was enacted, the \ntrustees' report indicated the trust fund would be insolvent by 1999. \nAs a result of the enactment of the 1993 reconciliation package, which \nall Democrats supported and every Republican opposed, we have been able \nto extend the viability of the trust fund for 3 more years, from the \nyear 1999 to the year 2002. So we have made progress.\n  What many of us are saying now is, if we are going to continue to \nmake progress, then clearly we have to go beyond what the \nreconciliation package did with respect to strengthening Medicare.\n  What we said last year is that we have to pass meaningful health care \nreform if we are to reduce further the rate of Medicare growth, without \nhurting beneficiaries and shifting costs onto families and businesses.\n  That is what we attempted to do last year. The Senator from Utah \nindicated that the President last year argued we needed $118 billion in \nadditional Medicare cuts. Well, the President proposed these reductions \nin the rate of growth of Medicare in the context of a health reform \nproposal that assured costs would not be shifted onto the private \nsector. Clearly we get cost shifting to the private sector when we cut \nMedicare without addressing private sector health care cost problems. \nThat is why so many of us argued for so long--and, unfortunately, with \nso little success--last year that if we are ever going to solve \nMedicare's problems, we have to address our entire health care system's \nproblems. Unfortunately, Republicans opposed that effort last year.\n  So, Mr. President, my point in addressing this issue is to clarify \nagain what I believe to be the real issue. The real issue is that we \nhave to make meaningful reforms to Medicare without adversely affecting \nthe beneficiaries and without passing whatever savings we generate on \nto the wealthiest among us in the form of another tax cut. Real reform \nis not cutting benefits to the elderly or simply shifting more costs \nonto them. Real reform must ensure more efficient functioning and \nadministration of the program.\n  The last issue that I wish to raise with regard to Medicare has to do \nwith the chart the distinguished Senator from Utah used. My chart is \nnot nearly as fancy because we didn't have time to make such an elegant \nchart, but I think it illustrates my point.\n  The Senator from Utah indicated that Medicare costs were going up \nfaster than costs in the private sector.\n  Well, this is only true if you look at overall costs. But if you look \nat a more meaningful statistic, per capita health care costs, as this \nchart indicates--on a per enrollee basis, from 1976 to 1984, Medicare \ncosts rose only slightly faster than private sector costs, 14.2 \npercent, versus 14 percent for the private sector.\n  But look what has happened from the years 1984 to 1993. In that \ntimeframe, 1984 to 1993, about 10 years, the actual increase in private \nsector per enrollee costs was 9.8 percent. The increase in Medicare per \nenrollee costs was 7.7 percent.\n  These are numbers given to us from HCFA, and I think they make the \npoint I was trying to make again this morning. On a per enrollee basis, \nthere is no \n[[Page S6163]] doubt that Medicare costs over the last 10 years have \nnot grown as quickly as they have in the private sector. But that, in \npart, is because we are continuing to do what I just said we do not \nwant to do any more. We do not want to pass Medicare costs on to the \nprivate sector. We do not want to say, in the name of reform, all we \nare going to do is let the private sector take on greater \nresponsibility for health costs.\n  We have to solve the problem of skyrocketing costs in the private \nsector, as well as those costs in Government. And that is exactly what \nI said this morning and what I hope we can continue to focus on as we \nconsider the Medicare debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6162-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DAVID PRYOR: A TRUE PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I could not help but listen to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas just a moment ago. All of us will \ngreatly regret his absence beginning in the next Congress.\n  As we all know, last week, the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, announced his plans to retire.\n  As the Senate Democratic leader, I feel like pleading with him not to \ngo; to change his mind.\n  What we heard just this afternoon was another illustration of the \nvalue that he is to all of us, the unique individual that he truly is.\n  While he has been known around town as one of the President's closest \nfriends on Capitol Hill, he is one of my most indispensable allies in \nthe Senate and one of the closest friends that most of us have here in \nthe Senate.\n  I have constantly drawn on his experience and wisdom for advice and \nguidance. And I have constantly found his calming influence amidst many \na Senate tempest to be essential for my own personal well being as well \nas that of the U.S. Senate.\n  But while I recognize that he is a kind, southern gentleman of the \nfirst order, I also warn, do not let that calm demeanor fool you. In \nthe Senate, there is not a more tenacious or aggressive fighter for the \ncauses in which he believes than David Pryor.\n  Shortly after his election to the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Pryor went undercover as an orderly to investigate \nconditions in nursing homes. When the House refused to conduct hearings \non the plight of America's elderly, he rounded up volunteers from local \ncolleges, rented a trailer, and conducted his own hearings in an \nabandoned gas station a few blocks away from the House Office Building. \nWhen the Speaker of the House refused to establish a Committee on \nAging, then-Congressman Pryor turned his trailer into the ad hoc House \nTrailer Committee on the Aging and continued its investigation.\n  The House finally established--to no surprise of anyone who watched \nall of this--a Select Committee on Aging.\n  When OPM claimed to have cleaned up its act and made Government jobs \naccessible to all applicants, Senator Pryor sent his office interns \ndown to that agency to apply for jobs.\n  He then called them to testify before his Subcommittee on Federal \nServices, where they informed the Senate about the continuing abuses in \nthat most important Federal job recruiting agency.\n  The list does not end.\n  He has taken on the IRS and authored and steered to passage the \ntaxpayers' bill of rights to make our tax system fair and equitable to \nevery citizen and every business.\n  He has taken on the Beltway Bandits, as he has conducted hearings and \ndemanded more than 40 GAO reports on Government use of what he calls \nAmerica's shadow government--private consultants.\n  He has taken on the pharmaceutical companies for the high prices they \ncharge for prescription drugs.\n  He has stopped production of unsafe and unworkable chemical weapons, \neven though it meant jobs in his State of Arkansas.\n  He has conducted a longstanding crusade against what he considers \ntime-consuming and time-wasting Senate procedures like filibusters, \ndilatory floor tactics, quorum calls, and extended rollcall votes.\n  But throughout his fights, Senator Pryor hss remained the gentleman \nthat he is. His fights have always been constructive, not destructive, \nto the national interest, We need more, not less, positive-minded, \ncooperative, dedicated Senators like David Pryor.\n  While I am tempted to ask him to stay, as his friend, I fully \nunderstand and support his reason for leaving.\n  He has given a lifetime of public service. As a teenager, he worked \nin Washington, first as a page for Representative Oren Harris, and then \nin the post office in the House of Representatives.\n  He had successful careers as an editor-publisher and as an attorney, \nbut he always came back to public service. In 1960, he was elected to \nthe first of three terms in the Arkansas State Legislature.\n  In 1966, he was elected to the first of four terms in the U.S. House \nof Representatives. He served two terms as Governor of Arkansas.\n  Since 1979, he has served in the U.S. Senate. His work in this \nChamber has consumed so much of his time and attention. In addition to \nhis most important work as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, \nhe has been active on the Finance Committee, the Committee on \nAgriculture, the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. And, yes, event the Ethics Committee.\n  In addition to all that, he has also served as Democratic Conference \nsecretary.\n  Senator Pryor now wants to enjoy life after politics--and there is \nmuch to say for that kind of life. Senator Mitchell told me so just the \nother day.\n  Senator Pryor's love for the Senate is exceeded only by his love for \nhis family and his love for the beautiful State of Arkansas--both of \nwhich he will now be able to enjoy even more. I wish Senator Pryor, \nBarbara, and his family the best in the years ahead and can only say \nthat their gain is our loss.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 956, and the \nGorton amendment is the pending amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6163-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6163-S6164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a \nperiod for morning business until 5:30 p.m., with Senators allowed to \nspeak for not to exceed 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last month, the Medicare Board of Trustees \nissued its annual report. Four members of this committee are appointees \nof President Clinton--three of them currently serve in his Cabinet.\n  The trustees concluded that Medicare will begin to go broke next \nyear, and will be completely bankrupt by the year 2002.\n  If this were to occur, no payments, by law, can be made by Medicare \nto pay for hospital care or for any other services paid for by the \ntrust fund.\n  Thirty-three million seniors and four million disabled individuals \ndepend on the Medicare Program every year.\n  It is for them, and for those who will follow, that we must commit to \npreserving, improving, and protecting the Medicare Program.\n  Tuesday, the Speaker of the House and I extended a verbal invitation \nto President Clinton to sit down with us and to begin working on a \nbipartisan plan to preserve, improve, and protect Medicare.\n  Judging from the President's actions in the past weeks, and from \nremarks he delivered earlier yesterday at the White House Conference on \nAging, it appears that the President has once again chosen partisanship \nover leadership.\n  Instead of heeding the advice from his trustees, the President heeded \nthe advice of his political pollsters, using yesterday's speech as an \nopportunity to engage in scare tactics and to mislead America's \nseniors.\n  Nevertheless, Speaker Gingrich and I are willing to give the \nPresident the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he did not watch the news \nTuesday evening or read the paper yesterday morning. Perhaps no one at \nthe White House told him of our invitation.\n  [[Page S6164]] So, yesterday afternoon, a letter from the Speaker and \nmyself was delivered to the White House, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of that letter be placed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOLE. In this letter, we once again extend our invitation to the \nPresident, asking him to join us in a bipartisan effort to preserve, \nimprove, and protect Medicare. It was precisely this type of bipartisan \neffort which saved Social Security in 1983, and it is what is needed \ntoday.\n  And I know a little about the 1983 Social Security effort, because I \nwas a member of that Commission, along with Democrats and members from \nthe private sector, appointed by the then majority leader Howard Baker \nin the Senate, appointed by then Speaker O'Neill in the House, and \nPresident Reagan.\n And it worked. A lot of people felt at that time Social Security was \nin deep trouble, and it was in deep trouble. It was about to go broke. \nThe trustees had warned us it was about to go broke. It warned us years \nahead it was about to go broke. As often happens around this place, \nnobody really thought it was going to happen.\n\n  When it finally became critical, we moved and we acted, and thanks to \nthe efforts of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both sides of \nthe Capitol and President Reagan's effort, we were able to put together \na compromise which, since 1983, has secured the solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust funds. In fact, Social Security is going to be in good \nshape for a fairly long time. Some day we will have to address it, but \nright now the 1983 Social Security fix has worked.\n  It also appears to me that Treasury Secretary Rubin, Labor Secretary \nReich, and Health and Human Services Secretary Shalala, all trustees, \nall of whom signed the report calling for action now have a great deal \nriding on the President's response.\n  The President's inaction to this date suggests one of two things: \nEither he believes his trustees are incompetent and have reached an \nerroneous conclusion, or he accepts their conclusion and just does not \nbelieve it is the duty of his administration to solve the problem, in \nwhich case his trustees are irrelevant. Relevancy has been a matter of \nsome debate around this town.\n  If, however, he treats the recommendation of his trustees seriously, \nthen he has only one choice: To stop searching for campaign issues and \nto join Congress in searching for solutions.\n  I hope that the President, in the same spirit we have been working \nwith the President on welfare reform, on antiterrorism legislation, on \nNAFTA, GATT, and other examples I can point out where Republicans \nprovided the majority of the votes, working with a Democratic \nPresident, I hope the President of the United States will take a look \nat the trustees' report.\n  I know there is a conference on aging, and I know the temptation \nfrightens people, scares people and they may pick up a few seniors' \nvotes for the President, but if we do not fix Medicare, as I have \nindicated, we are not going to be able to make the payments.\n  The year 2002 seems like a long way off. Why worry about it in 1995? \nLet me just suggest, by the time you get it put together and by the \ntime you start to implement it, the time will roll by more quickly than \nwe think.\n  I cannot speak for everyone on this side of the aisle, but I think \nmost of my colleagues are ready and willing to make hard choices. We \nare not talking about cuts--the President says, ``Oh, we can't cut \nservices, we can't do this, we can't do this.'' We are suggesting every \ndollar saved in our efforts to protect, preserve and improve Medicare \ngo back into Medicare; not to cut taxes for the rich--as we hear from \ntime to time from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--or not \nfor budget purposes, except so far as Medicare is part of the unified \nbudget.\n  So I hope that the President has received our letter and that he will \nseriously consider it and that he will come to the Capitol, or we can \ngo to the White House--it makes no difference--or we can meet halfway, \nwhatever, and talk about what we may do in a bipartisan way to begin \nworking on what is a serious problem with Medicare.\n  They are the President's trustees. They are people of integrity, as \nfar as I know; people of competence, as far as I know; people of good \njudgment, as far as I know. I assume this trustees' report was based on \nthe best information available and they said we should act now. Now \nmeans precisely what now means--now, 1995.\n  So we are prepared to work with the President and members of this \nadministration, we are prepared to work with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, we are prepared to work with House Members, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and my view is, if we are serious about \nthis, we can do it in a very brief period of time.\n  So I hope that we can have some response from the President.\n  The other day I suggested we maybe have a bipartisan commission. That \nis how we made recommendations on Social Security in 1983. The \nPresident called that a gimmick. Well, it was not a gimmick. It was an \nidea that Speaker O'Neill had at the time and Majority Leader Baker and \nPresident Reagan had at the time, and it worked. It was not a gimmick. \nThey made solid recommendations to Congress, and the Congress adopted \nthe recommendations of the commission. I was proud to be a member of \nthat commission, along with Claude Pepper, I might add, who was \nprobably the seniors' greatest representative and voice in Congress, a \nDemocrat from the State of Florida.\n  So, Mr. President, I certainly hope the President will follow up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6163-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say with reference to the schedule, \nright now there are discussions going on so we can have a substitute \noffered by Senators Rockefeller and Gorton, and then it would be my \nintent to file cloture so we can bring the debate on product liability \nto a close. We have been on this now last week and most of this week. I \nam not quite certain when they will have the product complete.\n  I do not believe there will be any further votes today because, \nfrankly, we wanted to move to another matter but it was objected to by \nmy colleagues on the other side. So we will just have to wait and see \nwhat agreement can be reached, and then the substitute will be filed \nand then the cloture motion will be filed.\n  It is my intent to have the first cloture vote on Monday and if \ncloture is not obtained, to have a second cloture vote on Tuesday. So I \nsay to my colleagues, we are going to have a cloture vote on Monday. It \nis very important we be here. We have been on this bill for 2 weeks. I \ndo not want to frighten anybody or discourage anybody, but I can see \nthe August recess going out the window. As much time as we take on \nevery piece of legislation in the Senate, it does not leave the leader \nany alternative than to say, well, August would have been a great month \nto be off; a lot of us would like to have done a lot of things.\n  But the first thing we must do is complete our work, and as slowly as \nwe are proceeding, I do not see how it can be done. Maybe there can be \nsome agreements in the next few weeks, but we are behind schedule now \nand, I must say, unless we can catch up, I do not believe the American \npeople expect us to be off for 30 days when a lot of the work is not \ndone.\n  So we will be right here catching up unless we can do so in the \nnext--we have time if we work together, let me put it that way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

It is obvious we have a very \nserious American problem, and that is Medicare, and a \n[[Page S6165]] very serious solution recommended by trustees, four of \nwhom were the President's, two of whom are private citizens.

Mr. President, I want to speak about a bill I \nintroduced yesterday and I did not get a chance to speak on it. It has \nbeen introduced and has been referred. It is now known as S. 755. It \nhas a very uninteresting caption and name: United States Enrichment \nCorporation Privatization Act.\n  Actually, while that does not sound like much, we hear a lot these \ndays about Russia, Iran, and Russian scientists having to find some way \nto earn a living. We hear a lot about the fact that Russia has a very \nsignificant amount of enriched uranium and that we have agreed, in a \nsense, to buy it.\n  Now we find ourselves kind of in a quagmire. Our own trade laws do \nnot let us buy and resell the material because that is dumping. So we \nhave a $4 billion commercial transaction going and the Russians are \nsaying, ``Fine, we made a deal, let's do it.''\n And so we have an entity here, the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, \ncurrently in existence. It is Government owned, and thus it is \ncorporate only in the sense that we call it a corporation. The U.S. \nEnrichment Corporation, when we sell it--and what we propose here has \nbeen cleared by and looked at by a lot of marketplace people--we \nbelieve it will generate $1.5 billion for the Treasury of the United \nStates, when we take the existing Government corporation and put it on \nthe market, make it a corporation.\n\n  One of the most difficult issues facing this enrichment corporation \nand the uranium industry as a whole is how uranium from the Soviet \nUnion is allowed to enter the United States market. Currently, the \nDepartment of Commerce enforces a suspension agreement that limits the \namount of uranium we can import from the Soviet Union. The suspension \nagreement enforces U.S. trade laws. Obviously, a straight purchase and \nresale into the U.S. market would result in dumping. So it will not \nwork.\n  In 1993, Russia and the United States signed an agreement under which \nthe United States would purchase up to $4 billion worth of natural \nuranium derived from highly enriched uranium from Soviet nuclear \nweapons. However, as I indicated, the U.S. trade law prevents that \nnatural uranium from being sold in the United States. The enrichment \ncorporation is responsible, nonetheless, for implementing the Russian \nagreement. As a result, the $4 billion obligation falls squarely on the \nenrichment corporation, the one we now have, the Government \ncorporation, because the enrichment corporation is prevented from \nselling the natural uranium into the U.S. market, which would be \nillegal since the material is below market price. As a result, the \nUnited States Enrichment Corporation cannot pay the Russians. In turn, \nthe Russians argue that they are being shortchanged $4 billion. I do \nnot think one can blame them for that. We have an agreement. But our \nenrichment corporation cannot buy it, because if they buy it, they \ncannot use it.\n  So this legislation solves that problem by enabling the creation of a \nfutures market for natural uranium derived from the Russian agreement. \nThe material could only enter the U.S. market in a controlled manner \nstarting in 2002. Thus, it is not inconsistent with our trade laws.\n  So this proposal preserves the United States trade commitment, \nprotects the United States uranium industry from unfair dumping, and \nencourages Russia's important work of dismantling nuclear weapons to \ncontinue. This proposal enables the Russians to be able to pay the \npeople that are doing the dismantlement work that with some of the \nfruits of the disarmament, namely the revenue from the natural uranium. \nThe money would provide the cash flow necessary to keep the Russian \nminatom employees working to dismantle the Russian nuclear capability \nand, in turn, the Russians might not be so adamant about selling \nreactors to Iran for a billion dollars.\n  So in a very real way, the notion of privatization, which is given \nsort of a rebirth because of the last election, finds itself settling \nin on this situation. I happen to have the privilege of chairing the \nSubcommittee on Energy Research and Development that has this as one of \nits responsibilities. So the idea of privatizing it fell on our \nsubcommittee, and with the work of some experts and some really \nexciting ideas encapsulated in this bill, we may indeed retain the \nenrichment corporation, that is privately owned, privately run, that \ncan indeed make money, and we will succesfully implement the Russian \nagreement using the futures approach. I do not think we have seen a \nnicer fit and match than this. In the meantime, we pick up $1.5 billion \nfor the U.S. Treasury.\n  Now, obviously, there will be a lot of questions about this, and we \nare understanding of that. We hope that within a month, as soon as we \nget the budget behind us a little bit here, we can have some hearings \non this and get it to the floor this year. We think it is an exciting \nidea of privatization which accomplishes so many good things at one \ntime that we want to move full speed ahead and see if we cannot get it \ndone. I have good cosponsors. I invite other Senators to take a look. \nMr. Ford is a cosponsor. He is ranking member of the subcommittee. We \nhave Senators Johnston, Campbell, Thomas, and Simpson.\n  I am sure we will have others as soon as they understand it. I look \nfor some of those who work in foreign relations and are worried about \nIran and the growing relationships of a monetary nature between Iran \nand Russia, I look to them to analyze this, and perhaps they can see \nfit to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor--and I listened with \ngreat interest earlier to the majority leader, the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, talking about a letter that he and the Speaker of \nthe House have written to the President asking for some bipartisan \ncooperation having to do with Medicare.\n  Mr. President, for 12 years when we had a Republican President, any \ntime anyone would say, gee, how come Ronald Reagan does not submit a \nbalanced budget, or George Bush does not, the standard response that \nwould come is--mostly, I must say, from Republicans in defense of their \nRepublican President--they would say, ``Gee, the President does not \nspend any money, Congress spends the money.'' I must say, the \nRepublican defense is accurate. Congress does spend the money. For us \nto say, gee, the President has the responsibility for spending the \nmoney is inaccurate. It is the Congress of the United States of America \nthat passes laws that determine how much money we are going to collect \nand in what manner we are going to collect it from the American people \nand how we are going to allocate that money across a whole range of \nprograms.\n  In fact, the Budget Enforcement Act requires the Congress to produce \na budget resolution by the 15th of April, which is several weeks past.\n  Mr. President, if the majority leader wants to get a bipartisan \nmovement to do something about deficit reduction, there are a number of \nus on this side of the aisle who are all too willing to do exactly \nthat. It seems to me that is what we need. If we are going to get \nmovement, it ought to be movement inside of the U.S. Congress. There is \na ferocious debate. There are ideological differences. The biggest task \nthat faces us is that deficit reduction is tough. The problem with \nMedicare is not caused by mean and nasty Republicans or mean and \nliberal Democrats; it is caused by demographics and technology.\n  The good news is that we are living longer. The bad news is that it \nis getting more and more expensive for us to pay for the health care \nfor those where we have made a commitment. If you think it is bad over \nthe next 4, 5 years, you ought to see what the entitlement commission \nsays this looks like when my generation begins to retire. This thing \ngoes clear off the charts after the \n[[Page S6166]] year 2008. So the insolvency of the year 2002 forecast \nby the trustees is only the tip of the iceberg, Mr. President.\n  Deficit reduction is difficult precisely because it forces us to make \ntough choices. This Congress needs to get about the business of doing \nthat. I was disappointed when the President's budget did not address \nthe issue of entitlements. Our Presidential commission worked for an \nentire year. We made recommendations to the President to try to do \nsomething. But I think the President made a calculated judgment. He has \nto say, I have a Republican Congress and I had a 1993 deficit reduction \nact and did not get a single Republican to vote for it. In fact, part \nof the Contract With America promises to take the increase in taxes on \na small number of Social Security beneficiaries, about 15 percent, \nreduce that tax which reduces the flow in Medicare and\n makes the problem worse. For that and other reasons, perhaps the \nPresident decided not to address the issue of entitlements. We know \nwhat we need to do in this Congress.\n\n  I am very much concerned that this thing is going to degenerate into \nmerely an attempt by Republicans to say, ``No, we are right and the \nDemocrats are wrong,'' or the Democrats saying, ``No, we are right and \nthe Republicans are wrong.''\n  For Members to do that for very much longer, Mr. President, maybe we \ncan survive for a week or two or three with partisan blasts back and \nforth across the bow, but at some point we have a lot of educating, a \nlot of explaining, and a lot of leading to do.\n  I spoke last week to the National Press Club and unfortunately the \nanswers that I gave to some questions afterwards got most of the \nattention. But at the heart of my message is that in deficit reduction, \nthere is not a free lunch. Deficit reduction is not something that we \nare doing just to seek political advantage or curry favor with the \nvoters, because the voters want deficit reduction. Deficit reduction \nhas a positive effect upon our economy because it increases savings.\n  The majority leader indicated we do not need to do anything with \nSocial Security. With great respect, I disagree. I believe Social \nSecurity also needs to be reformed, because unlike the common \nperception of Social Security, Social Security itself is not a savings \nprogram.\n  I inform anyone who might be listening to this right now that Social \nSecurity is a commitment on the part of those generations that are in \nthe work force to allow themselves to be taxed at a fixed percentage of \ntheir wages, the money going to those generations that are out of the \nwork force, who are retired.\n  The program started off as a 1-percent tax on wages. The retirement \nage was 6 years after normal life expectancy when the program started. \nToday, it is 12 percent of our wages. And 12 percent of our wages, \npromised to pay beginning in the year 65, which is 11 years this side \nof normal life expectancy.\n  It is a demographic problem, Mr. President. I appreciate the majority \nleader saying we do not need to address it because we have enough money \ncoming in, but do not tell that to a 20-year-old, a 30-year-old, or a \n40-year-old.\n  We had Director Rivlin before the Treasury Postal Subcommittee on \nAppropriations this afternoon, and I asked her about the deletion of \nintergenerational accounting in last year's budget. She expects the \nreport to come out.\n  My effective tax rate over the course of my lifetime is about 34 \npercent--my generation. But the generation right behind, if we do not \ntake action with Social Security and with Medicare relatively quickly, \nthey are looking at an effective tax rates in excess of 80 percent--in \nexcess of 80 percent--in an economic environment where their lives are \napt to be more difficult to begin with.\n  I believe what is needed is for Members of Congress to come and say, \nOK, we will fire a few shots across the bow here at Democrats, pointing \nout that Republicans, for 12 years when a Republican President was in \nthe White House, said it was Congress' responsibility. Now that we have \na Democrat in the White House they are not looking across the aisle and \nsaying, as Congress we should fix it. They sent a letter to the \nPresident and said, ``How come you are not doing something about \nthis?''\n  I believe it is our responsibility under the Budget Enforcement Act \nto deal with this budget problem, and it is going to be tough. I note \nwith great alarm a poll--in fact it has been distributed not just to \nDemocrats but to Republicans as well, and may, in fact, have \ncontributed not just to the President's address to his Conference on \nAging, but to a remarkable address on the part of the Speaker of the \nHouse, going to the seniors coalition. He got several standing \novations, I might point out.\n  Why would he not? He made it sound like the Medicare solution is \neasy. ``We will give seniors choices. We will let you keep the savings \nof 10 percent. If you find waste, fraud and abuse, it will be easy. We \ndo not have it get Medicare all tied up in that nasty old budget \ndeficit debate, we will move it aside, and it is all going to get real \neasy.''\n  It is not easy. We either ask Americans to pay more or we give them \nless, or some combination of the two. Or we turn and honestly say to \nour kids that their effective tax rates will be higher. It will not be \n15 percent of wages. That is what it is today. But if we do not take \naction in the next couple of years, that tax rate will be 20 percent. \nOr they will have to look to their parents and cut their benefits \nenormously. Time is on our side right now, Mr. President, but it is not \ngoing to be on our side for very much longer.\n  I genuinely hope that after we fired our few little political rounds \nhere that the Democrats and the Republicans can, in fact, get together. \nWe are the ones that by law have the responsibility for passing not \nonly authorizing legislation but appropriation legislation and we have \nto change our laws.\n  I was very alarmed to read in the newspaper this polling data that \nshows that 45 percent of the American people would not vote for any \nrepresentative who voted to reduce the increases in Medicare. Fifteen \npercent would vote for them, if they did.\n  I note again in Gerald Seib's piece in the Wall Street Journal, I \nbelieve yesterday, saying that a full 48 percent of the American people \nthink that we are not spending enough on seniors, 48 percent.\n  If we think that is greedy seniors, it is not. Only 34 percent of the \npeople over 65 say we are not spending enough. It is people 18 to 34, \nby over 50 percent. Less than 5 percent say we spend too much.\n  That is not what our budget shows, Mr. President, whether it is at \nthe State or Federal level. No one who seriously examines our budget \nbelieves that the problem is we are not spending enough on people over \nthe age of 65. That is not the problem we face.\n  I sincerely hope--I must say it may require me to do more than hope. \nI may have to raise my voice and do a lot of praying before we can \nbridge the rhetorical gap that divides the Republicans and Democrats on \nthe Senate floor. I think there is a bipartisan group that is willing \nto come to the American people and begin by simply saying ``This is the \ntruth,'' not hyperventilate and say things that sound like we are on \nthe side of the angels and the other side is on the side of devil, but \njust say, ``This is the truth.''\n  Look at the numbers. We do not fix this thing by getting rid of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. We will not fix this thing by sort of \ntinkering at the edge and say, ``I will give you choice. We will put it \noff into managed care.'' That is not going to work.\n  We either accept responsibilities that we have as citizens to say \nthat if we ask for something we will pay for it. And we are not going \nto ask for any subsidy that we neither need or deserve. That is part of \nthe problem now.\n  We have an awful lot of people in America, whether corporations or \nindividuals, that do not need subsidies and we are giving them \nsubsidies. They make a good case for it for social or economic reasons, \nand we shovel the money out and find ourselves when it comes time to \ntaking care of people who need it, we are woefully short of either the \nresources of trying to do anything.\n  I am down here right now to offer a constructive engagement to the \nmajority leader saying that this is not the President's problem. This \nis not his \n[[Page S6167]] fault. The President of the United States submits his \nbudget. I was critical of it for leaving entitlements out and not doing \nthe intergenerational accounting, but by law it is the Congress of the \nUnited States of America that must make these decisions.\n  We are now almost 4 weeks late, according to the Budget Enforcement \nAct, of coming up with a budget resolution. I trust that when the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New \nMexico comes up with a budget, that he will need Democrats on this \nSenate floor to come with him and say, ``We will join to make an effort \nto go out and explain it to the American people.''\n  I will say what my price is, Mr. President, so it can be clear. I do \nnot want anybody saying, ``I wonder what Kerrey wants?'' We will not do \na $300 billion, 7-year tax cut. That is for openers. That is my price. \nWant to negotiate a bipartisan fashion? Have to give the $300 billion \ntax cut? That is nonsense. What kind of nonsense is that? Give up $300 \nbillion?\n  Only yourself to blame when people get up and say, ``Gee, $300 \nbillion tax cut and $300 billion Medicare cut. Aren't you paying with \nMedicare for the tax breaks to individuals?'' It looks that way. We do \nnot have to do much in the way of pumping hot air into that argument. \nIt looks like that is what is going on.\n  Republicans have to take that $300 billion tax cut and forget it. \nDemocrats on the other hand, will have to say we will give on \nentitlements. We will tell the truth on entitlements. We will inform \nthe American people.\n  I believe Republicans as well will have to say, OK, maybe we scored \nsome great political point in last year's election by alleging that \nwhen Democrats voted for the 1993 Deficit Reduction Act without a \nsingle Republican voting for it in the House or the Senate, we took a \nlittle political advantage by saying that every Social Security \nbeneficiary had a tax increase.\n  Do not tell me that Republicans were not saying that. I have heard \nit. I have seen it in advertisements. It worked. If I was a Republican \nand I had not voted for that, I would have done the same thing. It is \nan effective way to score political points.\n  For gosh sakes, we cannot take that tax, I think, fairly applied at \n85 percent of income, reduce it to 50 percent, that takes money out of \nthe Medicare part A fund.\n That makes the problem worse, not better. That is my two opening \nsteps.\n\n  I also think, by the way, that those of us who worked in the \nmainstream group last year, Republicans and Democrats, led by the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island--who worked so very hard to \nhold that mainstream group together--were pretty close to being on \ntarget when it came to health care. We did ask people to pay the full \nbill. We did ask people to share the cost of health care. We did not \nsay there is a free lunch here.\n  We had a reasonable plan, it seems to me, that was in the middle. \nToday, of course, health care reform is not very fashionable. But we \nhad a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats who worked long and \nhard and got very close to a piece of legislation that I think, \nfrankly, had we had a little more time, we might have been able to pass \nand we might not be in this fix we are in right now, trying to figure \nout what we are going to do about Medicare.\n  If we treat Medicare only as a budget issue and not as a health care \nissue, we are going to find ourselves doing what none of us wants to \ndo, in my judgment, and that is taking that couple out there who is \nworking really hard, that American couple out there, where you have \nboth the husband and wife--and we all know who we are talking about \nhere--working for $5 and $6 and $7 an hour each and by the time they \npay their payroll taxes and income taxes they have precious little \nmoney left; those individuals are, right now, if we treat Medicare only \nas a budget issue, going to find themselves paying a lot more money \nthan they already are for health insurance. We are going to make their \nlives more miserable. Those Americans who say: I do not want to be on \nwelfare; who say I do not want the Government of the United States of \nAmerica to give me food stamps; I do not want to be on AFDC; I am \nwilling to work at McDonald's; I am willing to work at Radio Shack; I \nam willing to work wherever I have to, but I am going to earn my own \nway-- those are the individuals in the United States of America today \nthat are in the greatest amount of trouble, the ones who are not asking \nus for anything. Those individuals are going to suffer, in my judgment, \nif we treat Medicare only as a budget issue.\n  So I say, here is one Democrat who is willing to work with \nRepublicans. I have worked with the Senator from New Mexico on budget \nissues before and was pleased to be able to join with him on his U.S.A. \nTax, an item that I believe in fact will generate more money for the \nU.S. Treasury by allowing people not to pay taxes on their savings and \nbusinesses expense off their investments that they made.\n  We have to look not just at how much money we are generating, we have \nto look at ways to generate tax money that encourage economic growth, \nbecause in the end that is going to determine whether or not we are \nable to pay for anything, whether it is defense, or Medicare, or Social \nSecurity, or whatever it is.\n  So I hope in the end of perhaps the next 3 weeks, after we have all \nhad a little political fun here and scored our political points, that \nDemocrats come and say: Here are our values. I am a Democrat and I \nbelieve the laws of the United States of America ought to say every \nsingle American has an opportunity to move up the economic ladder. I am \nwilling to say you have to make an effort. There is no free lunch here. \nYou have to work hard to do it.\n  But I understand, if you are making $5, $6, $7 an hour, you have a \ntough time paying for health insurance; that retirement does not mean \nmuch for you; you are having a difficult time with child care because \nit is $500 or $600 a month for a couple of kids. I understand you are \nfrustrated because you read in the newspaper and see there is an 80-\npercent differential between what you can earn with a college degree \nand what you can earn with a high school degree, and yet you are not \nsetting enough money aside for your kids. Then, when it comes time for \nyou to get a college loan, you are told you are maybe making too much \nmoney; you are no longer eligible.\n  So I am prepared to come and say: Here are my Democratic values. Here \nis what I believe in as a Democrat. I will bring those arguments to the \ntable. But when it comes to deficit reduction, we are going to have to \nact like Americans. At some point, I am going to have to be willing to \ngive. I am willing to give on entitlements. I am willing to go out on \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and say to the American people: \nHere is the truth.\n  This is not the time, it seems to me, for us merely to hope we can \nscore political points over the other party. This is the time for us to \nsurprise the marketplace--and it would be a surprise if the Congress of \nthe United States of America, in spite of the fact that we have a \nbudget recommendation that calls for $200 billion deficits and no \naction on entitlements, can somehow manage to get together, Republicans \nand Democrats who care about deficit reduction, and surprise the \nmarketplace and enact this year a 5- or 6- or 7-year deficit reduction \nplan that would get us to a balanced budget.\n  I think the American people would not only be pleased--they may not \nlike some of the cuts we put in place--but I think they would be \npleased because the economy of the United States of America would grow, \nlong-term interest rates would go down, the dollar would strengthen, \nand we would be creating more jobs again.\n  I hope and pray in fact that this Congress does what the laws and the \nConstitution say we are supposed to do, and that is do the hard work of \nbudgeting; make the hard choices that are required in budgeting. Then, \nonce we have produced a budget resolution with both Republicans and \nDemocrats on board, then it is time for us to challenge the executive \nbranch, the President, to pony up and share some responsibility by \ngoing to the American people and saying he believes Congress has \nfinally got it right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  [[Page S6168]] The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to terminate \nthe Civilian Marksmanship Program; to rescind funding for the National \nBoard for the Promotion of Rifle Practice; and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n       THE CIVILIAN MARKSMANSHIP PROGRAM TERMINATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this morning I rise to introduce a \nbill to terminate a program that I think has long outlived its \nusefulness. It is called the Army Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n  It is no secret that I do not like this program. In fact, I offered \nan amendment to terminate it in the last Congress. It got 30 votes. The \narguments then may not have been persuasive. But perhaps recent events \nwill change that.\n  Like everyone else, I read the reports that come out about the \nterrorist bombing in Oklahoma City. And they are shocked by the scope \nof that tragedy. Every day we hear more and more news about confirmed \ndead and the fact that the search may in fact have to be abandoned. It \nis a tragedy that will live on forever in the minds of our democratic \nsociety and throughout the world.\n  But in one of these stories, Mr. President, I found information that \nmembers of extremist militia groups in this country may have received \nweapons, ammunition, and training at Army facilities under the auspices \nof the Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n  Indeed, Mark Koerneke, the leader of the Michigan-based militia \ngroup, told ABC's ``Prime Time Live'' that he had access to U.S. \nmilitary bases in Michigan for the purpose of training through this \nprogram.\n  We all know that one of the individuals accused of masterminding the \nOklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh, was associated with the \nMichigan-based militia group. I do not know, Mr. President, whether \nTimothy McVeigh received training and ammunition under the Civilian \nMarksmanship Program. But I know it is possible that he did.\n  A few days ago, Mr. President, I wrote to Secretary Perry and urged \nhim to conduct an investigation to determine the veracity of the \nreports linking members of extremist militia groups to the Civilian \nMarksmanship Program. I also called on the Pentagon to immediately \nsuspend the Civilian Marksmanship Program and propose terminating it in \nthe long run.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter I sent to Secretary \nPerry, along with a press report related to Mark Koerneke's comments, \nbe inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Perry,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     The Pentagon,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Perry: Recent press reports indicate that \n     members of extremist militia groups in this country may have \n     received weapons, ammunition, and training at Army facilities \n     under the auspices of the Civilian Marksmanship Program \n     (CMP). I am writing to urge you to conduct an investigation \n     to determine the veracity of these reports and to ask that \n     you provide me with a list of all the clubs that participate \n     in the CMP program. In the interim, I urge you to immediately \n     suspend the CMP and propose terminating it in the long run.\n       As you know, I have long believed the CMP is a low priority \n     program and is an egregious example of waste in government. \n     The program promotes rifle training for civilians through a \n     system of affiliated clubs and other organizations, and \n     sponsors shooting competitions. As part of these activities, \n     the program donates, loans, and sells weapons, ammunition and \n     other shooting supplies.\n       The program was first established in 1903, at a time when \n     civilian marksmanship training was believed to be important \n     for military preparedness. Yet, according to a report by the \n     General Accounting Office, the program now has limited \n     military value. As Army officials told the GAO, no Army \n     requirements exist for civilians trained in marksmanship, and \n     no system is in place to track program-trained personnel. In \n     a March 15, 1994 hearing in the Senate Defense Appropriations \n     Subcommittee, Army Secretary West stated that national \n     security objectives will be met with or without the CMP.\n       In essence, the CMP provides a taxpayer subsidy for \n     recreational shooting. In light of budget deficit we face and \n     the military needs we ought to address, this simply is not a \n     justifiable use of scarce resources. After all, defense \n     dollars are not used to subsidize other sports. They ought \n     not to be used to subsidize a shooting program which has no \n     relationship to military needs and requirements.\n       At a minimum we ought to ensure the CMP is not being used \n     to train and arm members of extremist militia groups. The \n     American people have a right to know that their tax dollars \n     are not being used to train people who pose a threat to law \n     abiding citizens and to peace and order in this country.\n       I appreciate your prompt attention to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank P. Lautenberg.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 U.S. Riflery Program May Aid Militias\n\n                            (By Colum Lynch)\n\n       New York.--Even as the Clinton administration moves to \n     monitor extremist groups that hate federal agencies, the \n     government continues to fund a $2.5 million program that may \n     have provided elements of such groups with low-cost surplus \n     weapons, free bullets and access to Army training facilities.\n       Mark Koernke, the shortwave radio broadcaster and leader of \n     the Michigan Militia group that disdains the federal \n     government, suggested the embarrassing prospect that the \n     government was aiding some of its domestic adversaries when \n     he told ABC's ``Prime Time Live'' Tuesday that he had gained \n     access to US military bases in Michigan to train through the \n     92-year-old Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n       Critics of the federal program, which provides about 1,150 \n     civilian gun clubs around the country with access to military \n     firing ranges and more than 40 million rounds of free \n     ammunition, are demanding that the Pentagon immediately \n     suspend the financing and launch an investigation into \n     whether the program has provided training facilities and \n     equipment to Koernke and to antigovernment militia groups.\n       Investigators also want to probe for possible links to \n     Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh, and brothers \n     James and Terry Nichols, who allegedly helped McVeigh produce \n     explosives in recent years.\n       ``Our government may be inadvertently arming and training \n     individuals and groups whose goal is to harm law enforcement \n     officials and other innocent people,'' said Rep. Carolyn \n     Maloney, a New York Democrat who has led an unsuccessful two-\n     year battle in Congress to halt the program.\n       To be sure, many thousands of law-abiding gun enthusiasts \n     have used the program over the years to hone their skills \n     with no other goal than to operate their weapons safely, \n     effectively and peacefully. In Michigan alone, there are 51 \n     clubs with more than 6,400 members in the riflery program.\n       Army officials yesterday defended the program as a valuable \n     public service, particularly useful in training youths to \n     handle weapons. Still, the Pentagon last year suggested the \n     program might have outlived its usefulness.\n       The program was started in 1903. Military officials during \n     the Spanish-American War were appalled at the ineptitude of \n     American marksmanship and sought to remedy that by providing \n     rifle training to civilians in peacetime.\n       ``It was discovered that the majority of Americans who were \n     recruited to fight in that war couldn't\n      hit the side of a barn,'' said Martha Rudd, an Army \n     spokeswoman in Virginia. ``The program has been continued \n     ever since. And the only way that it can be made to go \n     away is if Congress makes it go away.''\n       In addition to providing civilian marksmen with access to \n     military facilities, the Army also sells up to 6,000 surplus \n     M-1 rifles annually to club participants at a bargain cost of \n     $250 apiece. Each year, the program funds what one Army \n     official called ``the World Series of marksmanship,'' a \n     shooting tournament at Camp Perry, Ohio, hosted by the Army \n     and the National Rifle Association.\n       [[Page S6170]] Army officials said yesterday that the \n     riflery program is an innocent recreational affair that \n     promotes civic virtue and in particular aids the safe \n     training of youths ages 10 to 18. In the 1980s, Rudd said, \n     the military worked to discourage more extreme militia \n     organizations from participating by insisting that each club \n     chapter include at least 10 youths.\n       But she said that adults are welcome to participate and \n     that it is impossible to say whether Koernke or other groups \n     hostile to the government received ammunition or purchased \n     weapons through the program.\n       In a letter to Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Maloney \n     requested a list of the gun clubs and military bases \n     participating, as well as information on ``links between this \n     program and militia groups or individual extremists.'' Rudd \n     said no investigation into the program had been initiated.\n       Maloney also circulated a bill calling on Congress to end \n     the program.\n       ``Long before this bombing, the Civilian Marksmanship \n     Program stood out as one of the most ridiculous items in the \n     federal government budget,'' she said. ``We're slashing \n     funding for abused children, foster care and child nutrition, \n     yet we're subsidizing recreational marksmanship.''\n       Indeed, the Pentagon issued a report to Congress last year \n     that said the program no longer served a military purpose. \n     Even conservative commentator George Will has referred to it \n     as ``petrified pork.'' However, largely because of lobbying \n     by the NRA and resistance from some Democratic and Republican \n     supporters, the program has survived.\n       ``The NRA has been the official agent for the Civilian \n     Marksmanship Program,'' contended Bob Walker, the legislative \n     director for Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based group \n     advocating gun control. ``In order to qualify for surplus \n     rifles and free ammunition, one of the requirements is that \n     you belong to the NRA. This program is a subsidy for the NRA \n     and its members.''\n       The NRA press office did not respond yesterday to several \n     requests for an interview.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have long believed the Civilian \nMarksmanship Program is a low priority program and an egregious example \nof waste in government. The program promotes rifle training for \ncivilians through a system of affiliated clubs and other organizations, \nand sponsors shooting competitions. As part of these activities, the \nprogram donates, loans, and sells weapons, ammunition, and other \nshooting supplies.\n  The program was first established in 1903, soon after the Spanish-\nAmerican War, at a time when civilian marksmanship training was \nbelieved to be important for military preparedness. Back then, some \nFederal officials were concerned that recruits often were unable to \nshoot straight. The officials believed that a trained corps of \ncivilians with marksmanship skills would be useful to prepare for \nfuture military conflicts.\n  Mr. President, that may have made sense in 1903. But this is 1995. \nThe Spanish-American War ended more than 90 years ago, and things have \nchanged.\n  According to a report by the General Accounting Office, the program \nnow has limited military value. As Army officials told the GAO, no Army \nrequirements exist for civilians trained in marksmanship. In a March \n15, 1994, hearing in the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nArmy Secretary West stated that national security objectives will be \nmet with or without the Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n  Unlike the situation in 1903 and the Spanish-American War, today we \nhave well-trained Reserves and National Guard Forces, and we have \nadvanced, high-technology weapons systems. The military does not need a \nready supply of ordinary civilians who know how to shoot a rifle.\n  Even if we did need such a corps, the program does not give us one. \nNo system is in place that tracks the program-trained personnel, and \nthe program is not part of the Army plan for mobilizing forces in an \nemergency.\n  In essence, the Civilian Marksmanship Program provides a taxpayer \nsubsidy for recreational shooting. In light of the budget deficit we \nface and the military needs we ought to address, this simply is not a \njustifiable use of scarce resources.\n  After all, defense dollars are not used to subsidize other sports. \nThey ought not be used to subsidize a shooting program which has no \nrelationship to military needs and requirements. Training young people \nto play baseball is a nice thing to do, but the Government does not \nsubsidize Little League. We do not give children free baseballs? Why \nshould we give them bullets?\n  Mr. President, Americans are deeply cynical about the Congress. They \nthink we are controlled by narrow special interests and that we are \nwasting taxpayers' money on useless boondoggles. A program like bucks \nfor bullets only reinforces that image.\n  It also makes people wonder about our priorities. After all, how can \nwe close military bases and lay off thousands of defense workers while \nspending money on recreational gun clubs? How can we fail to fully fund \nHead Start if we can pass out free bullets to school kids? How can we \nomit funds for people unable to afford a college education if we can \nfind millions to teach kids how to shoot?\n  Where is our sense of priorities? Where is our common sense?\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will agree that it is time to end \nthis program. At a minimum, Mr. President, we ought to ensure the \nCivilian Marksmanship Program is not being used to train and arm \nmembers of extremist militia groups. The American people have a right \nto know that their tax dollars are not being used to train people who \npose a threat to law-abiding citizens and to peace and order in this \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 757\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RESCISSION OF FUNDS FOR NATIONAL BOARD FOR THE \n                   PROMOTION OF RIFLE PRACTICE.\n\n       The unobligated balanced of the funds appropriated by title \n     II of Public Law 103-335 under the heading ``National Board \n     for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, Army'' is rescinded.\n\n     SEC. 3. FISCAL YEAR 1996 FUNDING NOT AUTHORIZED FOR THE \n                   NATIONAL BOARD FOR THE PROMOTION OF RIFLE \n                   PRACTICE.\n\n       Funds are not authorized to be appropriated for the \n     National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senator from \nNew Jersey in this legislation to rescind the appropriation for the \nCivilian Marksmanship Program. I do so for a number of reasons, and I \nwant to briefly cite them.\n  At a time when our Government and this body is cutting virtually \nevery program that benefits people all across the board, I think the \nCivilian Marksmanship Program is one program that is truly expendable \nand can be rescinded. As was pointed out, the military has said this \nprogram is not necessary. The General Accounting Office in 1990 found \nthe program unnecessary and not related to the military mission.\n  In March 1994, the Department of Defense testified before the Defense \nSubcommittee on Appropriations that the Civilian Marksmanship Program \nwas not related to our Nation's military readiness and had no effect on \nour national security objectives.\n  About a week ago, Mr. President, I had a group gathered of major law \nenforcement organizations to talk about the intended repeal of the \nassault weapons legislation, and the head of a Federal law enforcement \norganization handed me a copy of the National Rifle Association's \nletter, a 6-page direct-mail piece that went out, and said to me this \nwas received by one of our law enforcement people who was, frankly, \namazed that this kind of rhetoric could appear on an NRA direct-mail \npiece.\n  I took a look at it, and I was astonished by what I saw. Since that \ntime, a number of Members of the Senate have commented in the Chamber \non their concern about this piece. It was \n[[Page S6171]] thought that the National Rifle Association might agree \nthat it was hyper hyperbole and that it seemed to have a purpose to \nincite people to take action against the Federal Government, and it \nmade statements which were in effect libelous; they were untrue; they \nwere slanderous; statements like it did not matter to those of us who \nsupport the assault weapons ban that it gave ``jack-booted Government \nthugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our \ndoors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill \nus.''\n  Mr. President, I have had a lot of things said about me but never \nthat. That is untrue. It is a lie. It is patently false and it is said \nfor one reason and one reason only, and that is to incite people.\n  Then it goes on to say, ``President Clinton's army of antigun \nGovernment agents continue to intimidate and harass law-abiding \ncitizens. In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \nthe Government's go ahead to harass, to intimidate, and to even murder \nlaw-abiding citizens.''\n  On its face, that is slanderous and in writing it is libelous. It is \nfactually untrue. It is said but for one reason and one reason only. \nAnd that is to incite and develop hatred against the Federal Government \nand the very people who carry out the intent of the laws that we in \nthis body and the other body pass and are signed by the President and \nbecome the law of the land. I do not think this body can condone this \nkind of rhetoric.\n  Now, is this connected with the Civilian Marksmanship Program? Not \ndirectly. Not directly. But indirectly it is, because the NRA \neffectively participates in this program--it is estimated by some to \nthe extent of $1 million out of the $2.5 million appropriation.\n  Moreover, given the association's refusal to recant this letter, a \nletter which is blatantly political and inciting, certainly not one of \na nonpolitical organization, should Federal funds benefit a political \norganization of this type? I would come down and say no, Federal moneys \nshould not go to benefit an organization that openly admits it plays a \nmajor political role in the election and in the unelection of Members \nof Congress and members of other local bodies.\n  I believe letters of this kind really defeat its purpose as a so-\ncalled nonpolitical organization.\n  In addition, I am disturbed about recent reports, such as the ABC \n``PrimeTime Live'' episode and a Boston Globe article, that describe \nhow militia members brag that they have received ammunition, surplus \nweaponry, and training on Army bases through the Civilian Marksmanship \nProgram.\n  I do not know whether this is true or not. I have no way on my own of \nverifying it, but the fact is they did brag that this was the case.\n  In fact, my staff was recently told by the Department of Defense \nabout a recent incident where a military security patrol monitoring an \nArmy rifle range saw that club members were using the range and wearing \nMichigan militia patches. These club members were asked to leave the \nrange, which is located at Camp Grayling, MI, on April 27.\n  As DOD staff admit, there is nothing in the regulations of this \nprogram to prevent militia members from joining civilian marksmanship \nclubs and receiving ammunition, weaponry, and access to military \ntraining facilities, because--and I stress this--the program does not \ncheck members for their membership in other organizations or limit the \nnumber of adults that can join.\n  So in light of these reports, which suggest this possibility to \ntrain, supply, or subsidize anti-Government extremist militias, and the \nletter which seems to indicate to me, and I think to other reasonable \nreaders of the letter, that the National Rifle Association is willing \nto go a step further to raise the level of the rhetoric, to increase \nthe hostility, one can certainly question the wisdom of Federal dollars \ngoing to provide weapons and bullets and training to groups who may--\nand I say may and I say might--use these weapons and use that training \nagainst the very people that this body empowers to carry out our laws.\n  So I believe the time has come to take definitive, direct action and, \nby that action, to send a message that we will not, in fact, tolerate \nthis. That is why I am cosponsoring this legislation, and I hope this \nbody will be receptive to its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Lugar, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bond, \n        Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Ford, Mr. Robb, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Craig, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Cohen, Mr. Grassley, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 758. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor S corporation reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  the s corporation reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Pryor, I \nrise today to introduce the S Corporation Reform Act of 1995. We are \npleased to be joined by Senators Simpson, Breaux, Lugar, Leahy, \nHutchison, Murray, Bond, Kempthorne, Johnston, Ford, Robb, Dorgan, \nKerrey of Nebraska, Kyl, Baucus, Craig, Cochran, Grassley, D'Amato, \nCohen, Bennett, and Bingaman.\n  Mr. President, today almost 1.7 million businesses pay taxes as S \ncorporations and the vast majority of these are small enterprises. As \nwe all know, small business is the engine that drives American job \ncreation. It is important to note that while in ordinary times, small \nbusinesses create half of the new jobs in this country, in times of \nrecovery, this number jumps to 75 percent. It is obvious that the tax \nand economic policies of this Nation should support and sustain the \ncreation and growth of small businesses. Our economic future depends on \nthe health and strength of our small business sector.\n  This is why we are introducing a bill today to strengthen small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, this bill will help to fine-tune the Nation's job-\ncreating engine of small business in three ways: by improving access to \ncapital, by making it easier to pass on family-owned businesses from \none generation to the next, and by simplifying many of the outdated, \nunnecessary and complex tax rules that apply to S corporations.\n  One of the biggest problems facing small business is that of \nattracting adequate capital. This bill helps to expand access to \ncapital by S corporations by increasing the\n number of permitted shareholders from 35 to 50, by permitting tax-\nexempt organizations to be shareholders, and by allowing non-citizens \nto own S corporation stock. It will also modernize S corporation \nfinancing by allowing them to issue preferred stock and convertible \nbonds.\n\n  Further, this legislation will make it easier for one S corporation \nto own another corporation. Our outmoded rules already permit this, but \nnot without a sizeable diversion of capital away from productive \ninvestment and into the pockets of lawyers and accountants. This bill's \nprovisions will streamline small business structure and return common \nsense to the realm of business ownership.\n  Additionally, the bill will help preserve family-owned businesses by \nmaking it easier for families to establish trusts funded by S \ncorporation shares, and by counting all members of a family who hold S \ncorporation stock as a single shareholder. These are important \nprovisions, Mr. President, because so many successful small businesses \nfail to survive beyond the first generation.\n  Finally, the bill will repair a number of outmoded, inefficient \nprovisions of S corporation tax law. Among the revised rules are a \nprovision giving fringe benefits in S corporations the same tax \ntreatment provided to ordinary corporations, and another which will \nstop corporate elections from being invalidated by mere technicalities. \nMost importantly, all of the bill's provisions have been carefully \ndesigned to avoid creating future difficulties for America's small \nbusinesses.\n  In my home state of Utah, there are thousands of current and future \nentrepreneurs for whom this bill will provide much-needed financial and \nlegal flexibility in the increasingly competitive marketplace. \nThroughout the\n country, small businessmen and women have \n[[Page S6172]] been clamoring for relief from our Nation's outdated and \ninflexible policies regarding S corporation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this badly needed legislation, \nwhich will give small businesses the strength and flexibility they will \nneed to thrive into the next century.\n  Mr. President, there is much talk these days about tax simplification \nand about throwing out the old tax system and starting over again with \na better one that makes more sense. This debate is a very positive \nthing for this country and I believe it will eventually lead to some \nvast improvements in the way our economy operates. In the meantime, \nhowever, let us not overlook some of the relatively simple and \nnoncontroversial changes that will make our tax system work better. \nThis bill represents such changes. These are improvements that we can \nmake right now that will help small and growing businesses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 758\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I also want to pay specific tribute to our \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Pryor. Not only has he \nbeen a great Senator here but he has been the leader on this particular \nissue for years and he deserves the credit for these changes in the S \ncorporation law. I have agreed to assistance this year in trying to get \nthis done and we intend to get it done this year. It is something that \nis long overdue, and thanks to his leadership and his intellectual \nprowess I think we will be able to get it done. So I want to personally \ncompliment him.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my very good \nfriend, my long-time friend and distinguished colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch.\n  Senator Hatch and I have worked on this proposal for a long time and \nwe are very proud today to be able to introduce it as a bill and to \nalso announce our 23 cosponsors from each side of the aisle in support \nof the S Corporation Reform Act of 1995.\n  Senator Hatch has been, certainly, a teacher for me in this whole \nprocess. I thank him. He has been a great ally. Truly, serving on the \nFinance Committee together, working with this legislation and working \nwith a number of colleagues that we have in support, and also the \nnumber of organizations that I will list in a moment, we think truly in \n1995 we can make this reform of S corporation law become a reality.\n  This legislation is truly the culmination of the efforts of many, \nmany individuals and groups. It is a bipartisan effort, and certainly \nrepresents, I think, a step that Congress can and should take in order \nto capitalize on one of our country's most valuable resources, small \nbusiness, as Senator Hatch has just so eloquently stated.\n  I want to thank all of the businessmen and women, attorneys, \naccountants, and small business organizations who have worked with me \nand my staff to help us to understand the unique problems of subchapter \nS corporations. They have helped us arrive at solutions that we think \nare easily administered and targeted to encourage economic growth.\n  The interest and enthusiasm for this effort is of special mention. At \nthis date, the bill is endorsed by the :\n  Members of the S Corp Subcommittee of the American Bar Association's \ntax section; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses Small Business Legislative Council; American \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants; American Vintners \nAssociation; American Consulting Engineers Council; \n[[Page S6177]] American Electronics Association; Associated Builders \nand Contractors; Associated Equipment Distributors; National \nAssociation of Life Underwriters; National Association of Realtors; \nNational Association of Wholesale-Distributors; National Business \nOwners Association; National Society of Public Accountants; and the S \nCorp Reform Project.\n  Mr. President, these fine organizations we think represent hundreds \nof thousands of businesses across this country that will be impacted in \na good way across our country. It is quite a team, and a team that I \nthink is very rarely put together. It is quite a team that has worked \nthoughtfully and diligently, and I must say, patiently, through this \nsystem to help produce a bill that Congress can pass and we should pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out to my colleagues that I \nintroduced similar legislation in the last session of Congress. On \nNovember 19, 1993, S. 1690 was introduced with our former colleague, \nSenator John Danforth, who retired from the U.S. Senate. Working \ntogether, we were joined by a strongly bipartisan group of 40 of our \ncolleagues who cosponsored that bill at that time.\n  Today, once again, I am so proud to be able to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, with whom I very much look forward to working \nin order that we might take the next step and move this bill into law.\n  The S Corporation Reform Act of 1995 contains 27 provisions designed \nto usher sub-S corporations into the financial environment of the \n1990's.\n  Subchapter S was first enacted in 1958. In fact, I think it might \nhave been about the year that the distinguished occupant of our chair \nwas born. On that particular date that subchapter S was passed into \nlaw, it was enacted to remove tax considerations from small business \nowners' decisions to incorporate. This tax treatment has proved helpful \nto small business over the years, especially to startup businesses, to \nnew businesses. But subchapter S, as originally enacted in 1958, was \nvery limiting and contained a large number of pitfalls. Today, hundreds \nof thousands of U.S. businesses are S corporations. These businesses \nare still subject to many of the oppressive restraints which date back \nto its original enactment in 1958.\n  Mr. President, it goes without saying that times have changed a great \ndeal since that year. The financial environment is far more complex \nthan the 1950's. Sub S limitations restrict growth opportunities, and \nfrankly sub S needs an overhaul, and it needs an overhaul now.\n  This legislation we think is the overhaul we need. It is an overhaul \nthat is doable. It is an overhaul that can give a boost to our economic \nrecovery by creating more opportunities for capital growth and jobs \nthroughout every segment of American economic activity.\n  Mr. President, these objectives are met by this legislation in ways \nthat have been carefully thought through. There may well be other ways \nto encourage these goals that Senator Hatch and I share this afternoon. \nBut I hope and expect my colleagues respectfully will come forward with \ntheir ideas should they see areas where we might improve upon this \nproposal. I look forward to this dialog. I urge my colleagues to \nexamine this bill closely and to join with Senator Hatch and myself in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a summary \ndescription of the major provisions of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    S Corporation Reform Act of 1995\n\n\n                     accelerating capital formation\n\n                        Shareholder limitations\n\n       Increase the number of permitted shareholders from 35 to \n     50. Currently a corporation is not eligible to be an S \n     corporation if it has more than 35 shareholders. Increasing \n     the number of permitted shareholders to 50 will make S \n     corporation status available to additional closely-held \n     businesses, allowing them the benefits of limited liability. \n     Further, increasing the number of permitted shareholders will \n     enable S corporations to raise more capital.\n       Permit tax-exempt organizations to be shareholders. This \n     would permit charities and pension plans to be eligible \n     shareholders of an S corporation, thereby increasing an S \n     corporation's access to certain capital markets. \n     Specifically, an S corporation would be able to establish an \n     employee stock ownership plan and would have access to \n     additional capital from charitable organizations and pension \n     funds. The bill further provides that the flow-through income \n     of an S corporation would be treated as unrelated business \n     taxable income to a tax-exempt shareholder as if the S \n     corporation's activities were conducted directly by the tax-\n     exempt shareholder.\n       Allow nonresident alien shareholders to own S corporation \n     stock. By permitting non-resident aliens to be eligible \n     shareholders of an S corporation, the bill expands an S \n     corporation's access to capital. In addition, it enhances an \n     S corporation's ability to expand into international markets \n     because it provides them the ability to offer an equity \n     interest to individuals they are trying to recruit to grow \n     their business overseas. To ensure collection of tax on \n     nonresident aliens, the bill subjects these shareholders to \n     U.S. withholding tax on S corporation income.\n\n                  Preferred Stock and Convertible Debt\n\n       Permit S corporations to issue preferred stock. Currently, \n     S corporations may not issue more than one class of stock. By \n     permitting S corporations to issue preferred stock, the bill \n     increases access to capital from investors who insist on \n     having a preferential return. The provision also facilitates \n     family succession by permitting the older generation of \n     shareholders to relinquish control of the corporation but \n     maintain an equity interest. The bill also provides that a \n     distribution made with respect to qualified preferred stock \n     will be considered interest income to the shareholder and \n     deductible interest expense to the S corp.\n       Expand Safe Harbor Debt to permit convertible debt. This \n     provision permits S corporations to issue debt that may be \n     converted into stock of the corporation provided that the \n     terms of the debt are substantially the same as the terms \n     that could have been obtained from an unrelated party. The \n     provision will also permit the debt to be held not only by \n     qualified shareholders, but also by a person who is actively \n     and regularly engaged in the business of lending money. The \n     current law provision, which prohibits conversion of the debt \n     into stock, unnecessarily impairs the ability of an S \n     corporation to raise investment capital.\n     Subsidiaries\n       Permit an S corporation to own greater that 80% of another \n     corporation. Currently, S corporations may not own more than \n     79% of a C corporation. This provision removes this \n     limitation to allow S corporations to hold more than 80% of \n     the stock of a subsidiary C corporations, which will greatly \n     enhance an S corporation's ability to achieve significant \n     non-tax objectives in structuring their operations. In \n     reality, taxpayers get around current rules through complex \n     arrangements used by expensive tax planners. So, this \n     provision allows S corporation to do directly, what they now \n     do indirectly.\n       Permit S Corporations to own wholly-owned S Corporation \n     Subsidiaries. The provision would permit an S corporation to \n     serve as a holding company for the various operating S \n     corporations, which would simplify management of the group. \n     The holding company could enter into contracts on behalf of \n     the group, serve as a common paymaster, perform other \n     centralized management services, and facilitate obtaining \n     financing for the group.\n\n\n                   preserving family-owned businesses\n\n       Expand the types of trusts that can own S corporation stock \n     to include certain complex trusts that qualify as ``electing \n     small business trusts.'' This provision would enable S \n     corporation shareholders to accomplish many estate planning \n     goals not currently available because of current law \n     limitations on the types of trusts that can be S corporation \n     shareholders. Specifically, this provision would enable S \n     corporation shareholders to establish complex trusts with \n     multiple beneficiaries and permit the trustee to have \n     discretion as to which beneficiary to make distributions. \n     Providing this type of flexibility is consistent with a major \n     underlying purpose of the S corporation--to provide a vehicle \n     for family-owned corporations.\n       Count all members of a single family that own an S \n     corporation's stock as a single shareholder. An election \n     could be made with the consent of all shareholders to count \n     family members that are not more than six generations removed \n     from a common ancestor as one shareholder for purposes of the \n     number of shareholder limitation.\n\n\n                     removing traps for the unwary\n\n     Elections\n       Permit the Secretary of the Treasury to treat invalid \n     elections as effective and permit late elections. This \n     provision permits the IRS to retroactively validate an \n     invalid S corporation election in cases where the corporation \n     inadvertently failed to meet the definition of a small \n     business corporation or to obtain the required shareholder \n     consents. The bill sets forth the criteria under which the \n     IRS should validate such elections. The bill also provides \n     for an automatic waiver procedure for certain inadvertent \n     terminations. In addition, the bill provides that if a \n     corporation fails to make a timely S election (i.e., by the \n     15th day of the third month of the first S corporation year) \n     and the Secretary determines that there was reasonable cause \n     for the failure to make such election, the Secretary may \n     treat the election as timely made.\n                [[Page S6178]] Passive Investment Income\n\n       Repeal excessive passive income as a termination event. \n     Under current law, if more than 25 percent of the gross \n     receipts of an S corporation are passive investment income, a \n     corporate level tax will be imposed on the excess passive \n     income. In addition, en election of S corporation status will \n     be terminated if at the close of three consecutive years a \n     corporation has subchapter C earnings and profits and more \n     than 25 percent of gross receipts are from passive investment \n     income. The provision would increase the threshold for taxing \n     excess passive income from 25 percent to 50 percent. \n     Importantly, the provision would also provide that an S \n     corporation would not lose its S corporation status if it has \n     excess passive income for three consecutive years. Instead, \n     the corporate level tax rate applied to the excess passive \n     income would increase by 10 percent for each successive year. \n     The provision also makes it clear that items of income \n     connected with an S corp's trade or business will not be \n     considered passive income.\n\n\n                            fringe benefits\n\n       Place S corporation shareholders in the same position as \n     regular corporations with respect to fringe benefits such as \n     life insurance premiums.\n       Repeal restrictions on qualified plan loans made to S \n     corporation shareholders.\n\n\n                          technical proposals\n\n       Treat losses on liquidation of S corporations as ordinary \n     to the extent the loss created by ordinary income passthrough \n     triggered the liquidation. In the case of a liquidation of an \n     S corporation, current law can result in double taxation \n     because of a mismatch of ordinary income (realized at the \n     corporate level and passed through to the shareholder) and a \n     capital loss (recognized at the shareholder level on the \n     liquidating distribution). Although careful tax planning can \n     avoid this result, many S corporations do not have the \n     benefit of sophisticated tax counsel. The provision in the \n     bill would eliminate this potential trap.\n       Allow interim closing of the books in termination of \n     shareholder interest with consent of corporation and affected \n     shareholder. Current law requires that if a shareholder \n     terminates his interest in an S corporation during the \n     taxable year, the corporation and all persons who are \n     shareholders during the taxable year must agree to close the \n     books on the date of termination. The bill would eliminate \n     the requirement that all shareholders consent to the closing \n     and instead requires only that the ``affected shareholders'' \n     (the shareholder whose interest is terminated and all \n     shareholders to whom such shareholder transferred shares \n     during the year) consent to the closing. This change will \n     ease procedural problems in preparing and filing timely \n     corporate tax returns.\n       Allow charitable contributions of inventory and scientific \n     property to be the same for S corporations as for regular \n     corporations. S corporations would be permitted an increased \n     charitable contribution, equivalent to the deduction amount \n     allowed to regular corporations.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 759. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to limit \nthe adjustment of status of aliens who are unlawfully residing in the \nUnited States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce, for myself \nand Senator Hollings, the Illegal Immigration Enforcement Act of 1995. \nThis is a bill to improve the Federal Government's ability to deter \nillegal immigration by enhancing enforcement of existing laws that \nprohibit employment of illegal aliens and bar overstays by legally \nadmitted visitors.\n  Madam President, I have been watching the unfolding immigration \ndebate with real concern. As I followed California's proposition 187 \ncampaign, I realized the arguments over illegal immigration are \noccurring in a vacuum. We are trying to address the impact of \nimmigration without understanding how it relates to the deeper \ntransformations that are shaping our society. We find ourselves \nsusceptible to the demagogic quick fix, and risk undermining the \ndiversity that underlies our strength as an American people.\n  Peter Drucker once said:\n\n       Every few hundred years throughout Western history, a sharp \n     transformation has occurred. In a matter of decades, society \n     rearranges itself--its world view, its basic values; its \n     social and political structures; its art; its key \n     institutions. Fifty years later, there is a new world. And \n     the people born into that world cannot even imagine the world \n     in which their grandparents lived and into which their own \n     parents were born.\n\n  Madam President, we are currently living through such a period of \ntransformation. Not since the age of democratic revolution coincided \nwith the industrial revolution has our world undergone such sweeping \nchange as we are having today. The forces at work in our lives today \nare as dramatic and powerful as the Declaration of Independence and the \nsteam engine were two centuries ago.\n  We face today a rapidly transforming world full of new opportunities. \nBut those opportunities are accompanied by profound uncertainties and \npainful adaptations. Progress creates losers as well as winners. For \nexample, the death of the Soviet Union has ended our fear of nuclear \nannihilation. At the same time, the resulting military downsizing has \ncost over 1.1 million jobs in the defense sector alone since 1987. As a \nresult, and not for the first time in our history, politicians and \nvoters have seized upon immigration, especially illegal immigration, as \na scapegoat for the deeper uncertainties we feel.\n  Illegal immigration has also become a lightning rod for worries about \nthe budget crises we face at all levels of Government. There is no \ndoubt that illegal immigrants impose a cost on taxpayers. According to \nthe estimates by the Urban Institute, the seven most affected States \npay approximately $3.1 billion yearly on education, $471 million on \nincarceration, and $313 million on providing medical treatment for \nundocumented aliens. The Urban Institute's fiscal year 1993 estimates \nfor my own State of New Jersey, which has the sixth largest population \nof illegal aliens, are $146 million for education, $6.6 million for \nincarceration, and $0.5-3.9 million for Medicaid, for a total of \n$153.1-156.5 million.\n  Anger over illegal immigration inevitably creates a backlash against \nlegal immigrants and even citizens of different ethnic backgrounds. \nHowever, this is a self-defeating response. Our country is increasingly \na mixture of races, languages, and religions, as new immigrants arrive \nin search of economic promise and political freedom. By the year 2000, \nonly 57 percent of the people who enter the work force in America will \nbe native-born white Americans. That means that the economic future of \nall Americans will depend increasingly on the talents of nonwhite \nAmericans. We will all either advance together or each of us will be \ndiminished.\n  We most need to appreciate the remarkable opportunity that our racial \nand ethnic diversity represents for the future of our country. Our \nimmigrants and new citizens can be our guide to the cultural rhythms in \nthe fastest growing areas of the world economy. Given high-quality and \nprice-competitive goods, the cultural knowledge they have can American \nthe advantage.\n Our diversity can mean more jobs, more prosperity for all Americans, \nif we can seize the moment and not run away from it.\n\n  To do so, we must reinvigorate the institutions and organizations \nwhich integrate new arrivals into American society. I have spoken \nelsewhere of the crisis afflicting civil society in this country. One \nof the effects of the decline of the institutions of civil society is \nthe weakening of the lodges, clubs, churches, Scout troops, and other \norganizations which used to give immigrants entree into American \nsociety. As a result, we all too often see groups of teenage immigrants \noperating on the fringes of society instead of productive new members \nintegrating into the heart of American society.\n  We cannot realize the opportunity presented by our diversity if we \nlet frustration over the Federal Government's inability to control its \nborders spill over into action against those who are here legally. We \nmust control illegal immigration in order to make our country safe for \nlegal immigration. We must control illegal immigration if we are to \nmake our country safe for diversity.\n  There is no shortage of laws on the books to control illegal \nimmigration. There are laws to punish employers and smugglers of \nillegal aliens, to deny illegal aliens most Government benefits and \neven to compensate the States for some of the costs associated with \nillegal immigration.\n  The primary problem, however, is enforcement. The Immigration and \nNaturalization Service is underfunded and hindered by a history of \nincompetence that the current management is hard put to reverse. The \nINS cannot keep illegal aliens out of the country, track them once they \nenter, or remove them once they are identified. Its various databases \nare, frankly, a shambles.\n  [[Page S6179]] At the same time, certain economic interests benefit \nfrom the labor of illegal aliens. They profit from the general climate \nof neglect in which they can demand long hours of labor for low wages \nand few benefits.\n  Madam President, sweatshops manned by illegal men, women, and \nchildren are a disgrace to America and a drag on the fortunes of legal \nimmigrant and American workers. These are the very inhumane labor \nconditions and practices we try to improve in countries abroad, but \nthey are here, in America, today. American workers and honest American \nemployers should not have to compete against this exploited labor \nforce.\n  That brings me, Madam President, to my bill, the Illegal Immigration \nEnforcement Act of 1995. This legislation contains three major \nprovisions which can help end this gentleman's agreement and will \nenforce the laws that are on the books. The gentleman's agreement is: \npass tough legislation, but do not enforce it. Talk about being tough \non illegal immigrants, but allow certain economic interests to benefit \nfrom illegal immigrant labor.\n  The first provision goes to, I think, the root problem, which is \nemployment. Most illegal aliens do not come to the United States for \nhealth care or welfare or even education. They come to work. That means \nthat the way to discourage them is not to punish their children by \ndenying them medical care or education, as proposition 187 tries to do, \nbut instead remove the employment magnet and remove the incentive that \nattracts them to the United States.\n  Existing law, starting with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986, contains provisions which would reduce employment opportunities \nfor illegal immigrants if they were simply enforced. Before enacting \nfundamental changes in this bedrock piece of legislation, we should try \nenforcing the laws already on the books. Empty legislating is no \nsubstitute for enforcement.\n  The place to start is employer sanctions. The 1986 act, better known \nas the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, imposes civil penalties on employers of \nillegal aliens of up to $10,000 per alien for repeat offenders. There \nis also a criminal penalty of up to 6 months imprisonment and a $3,000 \nfine for pattern or practice violations.\n  Madam President, enforcement of employer sanctions is a low priority \nat INS. In part, this is because the labor regulatory function is \ndifferent from the policing function usually done by the investigative \nbranch of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As in any \nbureaucracy, ``different'' means ``low priority.''\n  In addition, this branch has a mandate to focus on antismuggling and \nremoval of criminal aliens. By implication, everything else has low \npriority.\n  This low priority shows up in the figures. The 1986 act authorized \n$100 million per year to enforce employer sanctions, and even that was \nprobably too little, but by fiscal year 1994, the appropriation had \nshrunk to $23 million. Funding has recovered somewhat since 1994, but \nremains well under the amount necessary to implement the law properly.\n  As a result, the number of cases investigated has declined by nearly \n50 percent from 1989 to 1994. In particular, the number of \ninvestigations resulting from leads, the most productive \ninvestigations, declined from 5,118 in 1989 to 2,240 in 1994.\n  It is clear that as long as the same INS branch tries to perform \ninvestigative and employer sanctions functions, the latter will have to \ntake a back seat. The way it is currently structured, employer \nsanctions will always take a back seat.\n  My bill fixes this problem by creating a separate Office for the \nEnforcement of Employer Sanctions and authorizing it for $100 million, \nthe figure that was contained in the 1986 Act.\n  This first provision of my bill also addresses the potential for \nemployment discrimination that exists in any employment eligibility \nlegislation. For example, in 1990, a GAO study found that the 1986 \nact's employer sanctions provisions resulted in employment \ndiscrimination. The study suggested three causes for this:\n  First, the employers do not understand the law's requirements; \nsecond, employers do not understand how to determine employment \neligibility; and third, the prevalence of counterfeit documents \nincreases employer confusion.\n  As the GAO study implies, the problem is not with the law but with \nthe INS's failure to educate employers about what the law requires them \nto do. Most employers, for example, still do not know that they must \nfill out an I-9 employment eligibility form for every employee, whether \nthat employee is white, African-American, Hispanic, Asian, or \notherwise. This is the key to combating discrimination, educating \nemployers that this form applies to all.\n  Note that the GAO study reports that an estimated 346,000 employers \nsaid that they applied the 1986 act's verification system only to \npersons who had a foreign appearance or accent,\n and recommends, among other steps, increasing employer understanding \nthrough effective education efforts.\n\n  Madam President, my bill takes this problem head on by mandating that \nthe INS Office for the Enforcement of Employer Sanctions be charged \nwith ``educating employers on the requirements of the law, and in other \nways as is necessary to prevent employment discrimination.''\n  The bottom line, then, is that my bill does not add to employers' \nburdens; it does not add one single form to the mountain of paperwork \nthey must already fill out when they hire a new legal worker. Instead, \nit requires the Federal Government to explain the existing law to them. \nIn this way, it will reduce the burden of uncertainty employers now \nbear.\n  Let me point out as well that the bill complements other efforts by \nthe administration, Senator Feinstein, Senator Simpson--the coauthor of \nthe 1986 act--and others, to reduce the number of documents that can be \nused to confirm employment eligibility, make it more difficult to \ncounterfeit the documents and develop a more reliable national \nemployment eligibility data base.\n  So, Madam President, the first initiative in the bill is to tighten \nup employer sanctions.\n  Second, the bill prevents illegal aliens from reaping the rewards of \ntheir illegal entry into the United States. It prohibits adjustment of \nstatus within the United States for those seeking employment-based \nlegal immigrant status. Further, it disqualifies those who have worked \nillegally in the United States from becoming legal immigrants. \nCurrently, those in the United States illegally can try to adjust to a \nlegal status, based upon family relationship or employment in a hard-\nto-fill job.\n  While I do not advocate separating families, we can and should go \nafter those who come to the United States illegally and expect to find \nan employer who will sponsor them for adjustment to legal status.\n  My bill does this by forcing those who want to adjust for work-\nrelated reasons to do so outside the United States. So that, if they \nare denied, they cannot simply melt back into the population. In \naddition, by making previous illegal employment a disqualification for \nadjustment of status for work-related reasons, this bill denies illegal \nworkers the benefit of their lawbreaking.\n  Finally, Madam President, the bill addresses the problem of overstays \nby visitors admitted to this country legally. The debate on illegal \nimmigration is focused on the United States-Mexican border. This is \nunderstandable, given the flow of illegal aliens across the border and \nthe impact of this flow on border States. However, even sealing off the \nUnited States-Mexican border would not solve the problem of illegal \nimmigration.\n  Indeed, Madam President, the United States-Mexican border is less \nthan half of the problem. The Immigration and Naturalization Service \nestimates that 52 percent of all illegal aliens residing in the United \nStates do not sneak across the U.S. border. Instead, they enter legally \non visitor's visas and then overstay their visas. The percentage in my \nState of New Jersey is even higher, given its distance from Mexico and \nthe sources of our illegal alien population. The INS estimates that 60 \npercent of New Jersey's illegal aliens enter the country legally on a \nvisitor's visa and then just overstay, convinced that the \n[[Page S6180]] INS will never find them. And most times they are right.\n  The administration and Congress, fixated on the Mexican border, are \nignoring this very substantial problem. My bill addresses it by \nrequiring the INS to develop an entry and exit data base that will \nalert it to overstays by legally admitted nonimmigrants. It is pretty \nsimple. We cannot hope to control our borders unless we know who is \ninside them. Once we know who is overstaying his or her visa and where \nthat person is staying, we can easily take steps to remove that person \nfrom our country. It is a very simple step. It is not taken today, so \nyou have 52 percent of the people who come on legitimate visas \ndisappearing into the society as a whole.\n  Madam President, the terrorist atrocity in Oklahoma City reminded us \nthat we live in a dangerous world. Of course, non-Americans have no \nmonopoly on terrorism. That is what Oklahoma City said as well. The \nevidence indicates that the Oklahoma City bombing was not perpetrated \nby an illegal alien. However, illegal aliens overstaying tourism visas \nhave been implicated in terrorism in this country. For example, take \nMohammad Salameh, who is accused of having rented the van used in the \nWorld Trade Center bombing. He was living in the United States \nillegally at the time of that crime. He entered this country legally, \non a 6-month tourist visa, on February 17, 1988. And he still had not \ndeparted at the time the World Trade Center bombing on February 26, \n1993--5 years later.\n  Under current procedures, the INS had no idea of Salameh's failure to \ndepart or his whereabouts in the United States. Under this bill, the \nINS would have been alerted to Salameh's overstay and illegal residence \nin the United States nearly 4\\1/2\\ years before the crime.\n  So, Madam President, there you have it. Enforcement of employer \nsanctions, restrictions on rewarding aliens for illegal work, and \nmeasures to discourage overstays by legally admitted visitors. With \nthese steps toward enforcing existing law, we can help to build common \nground here at home, to parlay our diversity into strength, to protect \nlegal immigration, and to lead the world by the power of our example.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

GIRLS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \n[[Page S6182]] referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 12\n\n       Whereas credible reports indicate that thousands of Burmese \n     women and girls are being trafficked into Thailand with false \n     promises of good paying jobs in restaurants or factories, and \n     then forced to work in brothels under slavery-like conditions \n     that include sexual and physical violence, debt bondage, \n     exposure to HIV, passport deprivation, and illegal \n     confinement;\n       Whereas credible reports also indicate that members of the \n     Thai police force are often actively involved in, and profit \n     from, the trafficking of Burmese women and girls for the \n     purposes of forced prostitution;\n       Whereas the United States Government conducts training \n     programs for the Thai police and United States arms and \n     equipment are sold to the Thai police;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women requires all States Parties ``to \n     take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to \n     suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of \n     prostitution of women'';\n       Whereas Article 1 of the 1956 Supplementary Convention on \n     the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions \n     and Practices Similar to Slavery calls for the complete \n     abolition or abandonment of debt bondage;\n       Whereas forced labor, defined under the 1930 Forced Labor \n     Convention as ``all work or service which is exacted from any \n     person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said \n     person has not offered himself voluntarily,'' is \n     internationally prohibited;\n       Whereas the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of Traffic \n     in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of \n     Others finds the traffic in persons for the purposes of \n     prostitution ``incompatible with the dignity and worth of the \n     human person,'' and calls on States Parties to punish any \n     person who procures for the purposes of prostitution, keeps, \n     manages or knowingly finances a brothel, or rents premises \n     for the prostitution of others;\n       Whereas Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and \n     Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck has testified that the \n     United States ``urgently needs to encourage countries in \n     which trafficking of women and children goes on with impunity \n     to enact new laws, and to enforce existing laws. A particular \n     target of this stepped-up law enforcement\n      should be government officials who participate in or condone \n     trafficking, as well as brothel owners and traffickers''; \n     and\n       Whereas Secretary of State Warren Christopher stated before \n     the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights that \n     ``(g)uaranteeing human rights is a moral imperative with \n     respect to both women and men'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) trafficking in persons violates the fundamental \n     principle of human dignity, and forced prostitution involving \n     physical coercion or debt bondage constitutes a form of \n     forced labor and a slavery-like practice;\n       (2) the United States State Department should continue to \n     press the Thai Government to strictly enforce all laws that \n     can lead to the prosecution of those involved in trafficking \n     and forced prostitution, including procurers, traffickers, \n     pimps, brothel owners, and members of the Thai police who may \n     be complicit;\n       (3) the State Department should ensure that Thai police \n     participants in the United States Government-sponsored police \n     training programs are systematically vetted to exclude those \n     who are implicated in trafficking and forced prostitution;\n       (4) the executive branch should take steps to assure that \n     weapons and equipment provided or sold to the Thai police do \n     not become available to members of those forces who might be \n     involved in trafficking, forced prostitution, or abuse of \n     women and girls who are apprehended;\n       (5) the State Department should urge the Thai Government to \n     protect the rights and safety of Burmese women and girls in \n     Thailand who are freed from brothels or who are arrested as \n     illegal immigrants because their status as trafficking \n     victims is unclear;\n       (6) the United States Agency for International Development \n     should target a portion of its assistance to Thailand for \n     AIDS prevention and control to the foreign population in \n     Thailand, particularly Burmese women and girls in the Thai \n     sex industry; and\n       (7) the State Department should report to Congress, within \n     6 months of the date of this resolution, on actions that it \n     has taken to advocate that the Thai Government implement the \n     above steps.\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of Congress concerning the trafficking of Burmese \nwomen and girls into Thailand for the purpose of forced prostitution. \nThis is identical to a resolution submitted in the House by \nCongresswoman Louise Slaughter.\n  I have long supported steps to help improve the gross human rights \nviolations inflicted on women around the world. I am outraged at \nreports from Human Rights Watch and others citing the egregious abuse \nof Burmese women and girls who are lured into Thailand with false \npromises to work at good paying jobs, and then confined in illegal \nbrothels. These women and girls live in brutal conditions, often forced \nto work 18 hours a day with several different clients. They are \nsubjected to physical and sexual abuse that makes escape practically \nimpossible. In addition, there is virtually no health care or birth \ncontrol available, and the HIV virus is rampant among these women and \ngirls.\n  Reportedly, these abuses take place with the knowledge of the Thai \nGovernment and the likely involvement of the Thai police. I am deeply \nconcerned by reports that these officials not only fail to protect \nthese women and girls, but actually provide support to the brothels and \nbrothel owners.\n  Mr. President, this resolution seeks to call attention to these \nabuses. In addition to stating that sex trafficking is a violation of \nthe fundamental principle of human dignity, it encourages the State \nDepartment to press the Thai Government to enforce the laws that can \nlead to the prosecution of these traffickers. It also encourages the \nThai Government to ensure the rights and safety of Burmese women and \ngirls in Thailand. In addition, any weapons and equipment sold to the \nThai police by the United States should be kept out of the hands of \nthose individuals who may be involved in trafficking these women and \ngirls. And, finally, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment should target a portion of its assistance to Thailand for \nAIDS prevention and control.\n  We in Congress must act now to help stop these brutal practices. The \nsavage treatment of Burmese women and girls in Thailand, and the abuses \nthey are subjected to, must cease. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution and help send a message that the trafficking and forced \nprostitution of women and girls around the world is simply \nunacceptable.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6181-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6182-S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\nTHE COMMONSENSE LEGAL STANDARDS REFORM ACT OF 1995 COMMONSENSE PRODUCT \n                      LIABILITY REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     ROCKEFELLER AMENDMENT NO. 686\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto amendment No. 645 proposed by him to amendment No. 596 proposed by \nMr. Gorton to the bill (H.R. 956) to establish legal standards and \nprocedures for product litigation, and for other purposes;

and\n       (2) If such results-oriented negotiations are not concluded \n     satisfactorily, appropriate and reasonable measures, up to \n     and including trade sanctions, should be imposed in \n     accordance with Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; and\n       (3) The Senate is prepared to fully support any such \n     measures that might be taken against Japanese products, \n     including appropriate legislation.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6182-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                       special committee on aging\n\n  Mr. COHEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere \ncondolences to the families and friends who \n[[Page S6184]] lost their loved ones in the horrible terrorist act \nwhich took place in Oklahoma City, OK, on April 19, 1995. My prayers \nare with the victims, with those who lost loved ones, and with those \nwho simply had to suffer through the agony of uncertainty. And, like \nevery Member of this Senate, I am determined to ensure that those \nterrorists who committed this crime will be prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the law.\n  Our top priority today and always ought to be the protection and \nsafety of all the citizens of our country. Though we in the Senate \nwill, as we already have, differ about the role of the Federal \nGovernment and the scope of Congress' authority, I think we can all \nagree that the first obligation of the Government is to protect its \ncitizens from harm. We must do everything we rightfully can to prevent \nfuture tragedies of this sort and to see to it that the perpetrators of \nthis terrible act are brought to justice.\n  One hope I have is that, in the process of focusing on the tragic \nincident in Oklahoma City involving one type of crime, we don't lost \nsight of the rising tide of all violent crime in this country. It did \nnot take the massive destruction of this bombing to make violence a \nmajor problem in America. The rate of violent crime is increasing and \nwill continue to do so if we do not put a stop to it now. Thus, it is \neven more urgent that government at all levels--Federal, State, and \nlocal--act accordingly to make sure that all types of criminal violence \nare prevented, or, that when these acts occur, to see to it that the \nresponsible parties are severely punished for their actions.\n  In my view, there is a continuum in our society, with the rights of \ncriminals on one end, and the rights of both victims of crime and the \nlaw-abiding on the other. More rights for criminals ineluctably \ntranslates to fewer rights for victims. I believe the pendulum has \nswung too far, and for too long, toward the right of criminals. It is \ntime for us to shift things in the direction of law-abiding citizens \nand the victims of crime.\n  Despite our best efforts, we must recognize that, no matter what we \ndo, we will never to able to eradicate crime, nor, though we would like \nto, eliminate the possibility of a violent fanatic detonating a \nfertilizer-based bomb. So long as human nature remains imperfect there \nare going to be murderers, there are going to be rapists, there are \ngoing to be violent fanatics. Prevention is critical, and all \nappropriate tools should be provided to law enforcement officials to \naid their preemptory efforts. But what is also important is the \nresponse which our criminal justice system is able to muster after the \nfact.\n  In short, we must ensure that the perpetrators of all criminal acts \nin this country are--as the President promised in this case--brought to \nswift and certain justice. Legal reforms that would permit the rapid \napprehension, trial, and punishment of the perpetrators of crime--all \ncrimes--would go a long way toward preventing future such crimes and \nassuring the victims that justice will be done.\n  I believe, with regard to Oklahoma City that what most affects us all \nis seeing the families of the victims. Like most Americans, I want to \nsee justice for those families prevail. I would like to be able to \nassure those families that they will not have to suffer through a 9-\nmonth trial on TV--including, for example, several weeks devoted to \nselecting the\n perfect, dispassionate and adequately uninformed jury. And I would \nlike to be able to tell those families that they will not then have to \nendure years upon years of repetitive trials and appeals, forcing them \nto relive over and over the nightmare of the past weeks. But I cannot.\n\n  Regrettably, our current system is all too often exploited by the \nguilty--at the expense of the innocent. That is why, as we move ahead \nwith any proposed antiterrorist legislation as well as with the Senate \nRepublican crime bill, S. 3, the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 1995, I hope we will seek to pass \nlegislation which does put the rights of victims and law-abiding \ncitizens first--where they belong.\n  Mr. President, on another note, I would like to also shed light on an \nunfortunate incident which took place during the aftermath of the \nbombing in Oklahoma City. Immediately after the bombing, many so-called \nexperts and news media outlets rushed to the judgment that this attack \nwas most probably the result of, ``Islamic radical fundamentalist \nterrorists from the Middle East.'' This inaccurate and prematurely \nreached conclusion did great damage to the millions of loyal Arab- and \nMoslem-Americans in the United States, producing a wave of anti-Moslem, \nanti-Arab hysteria in the days after the bombing. The windows of a \nmosque in Oklahoma City were shattered by bullets in the days after the \nbombing, and death threats were called in to many mosques across the \nUnited States--including several in my home State of Michigan. In \naddition, many Arab- and Moslem-American students were harassed at \ntheir schools and universities. All of these unfortunate incidents \ncould have been avoided had some in the media and their so-called \nterrorism experts refrained from jumping to such unsubstantiated \nconclusions.\n  The news media has a clear duty to the American people to report \nallegations of this type responsibly. The media has received many \ncompliments about its coverage of Oklahoma City, much of it deserved. \nHowever, those outlets which failed to show proper restraint or which \ncountenanced wildly speculative finger-pointing should, I believe, \nextend an apology to the Arab- and Moslem-American communities for the \ndamage done to the hardworking individuals and families that comprise \nthem. The American-Moslem community has donated $22,500 to assist the \nfamilies of the victims of the bombing in Oklahoma City--a story which \nI hope the media will also be reporting.\n  That said, I want to reemphasize my comments regarding this horrible \ntragedy in Oklahoma. Our criminal law enforcement community needs to \nhave the appropriate tools for prevention and punishment. If we, in the \nSenate, are able to pass the appropriate legislation which will assist \nthe law enforcement officials to effectively combat crime, then perhaps \ncriminals will be deterred from committing another tragic Oklahoma City \nincident anywhere in the United States. Amidst all the pain, we may \nhave learned a very valuable lesson from this incident--the worst \nterrorist crime in our Nation's history. The painful lesson learned may \nbe that Oklahoma City is a wake-up call to all Americans that we \ndesperately need to reform our criminal laws.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6183-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6184-S6187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                OPEN MARKETS AND FAIR TRADE ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I seek to have placed in the \nCongressional Record a copy of the ``Open Markets and Fair Trade Act of \n1995,'' S.756, that was formally submitted for the Record \nyesterday, May 3, 1995, but which was not printed in full.\n  The ``Open Markets and Fair Trade Act of 1995,'' will evaluate the \ncurrent conditions of markets around the world for American products \nand instigate a process of negotiating access to those markets. It also \ngives the President and Congress a new tool to use in those \nnegotiations--the threat of reciprocal trade action. Basically the bill \ntells our trading partners that if they refuse to give our products \nreasonable market access, we may impose the same kind of restrictions \non their products.\n  Mr. President, this bill was written in response to a problem that \npersists year after year. I am speaking, of course, of our trade \ndeficit, which is out of control. Certainly, we are making progress on \nsome micro-economic levels, and the Clinton Administration has hammered \nout more than 70 different trade agreements over the last two-plus \nyears--14 with Japan alone. These are helping some industries, some \nworkers, and some parts of our economy. But they have done nothing to \nshrink the trade deficit. Clearly, more must be done.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not single out any one country. It is \ndesigned to pry open markets wherever they're closed, wherever in the \nworld American products are denied access. This bill follows up on the \nUruguay Round and looks beyond tariffs--it is designed to deal with \nmarket barriers; the internal rules in various countries that are \npractical impediments to American businesses. I am seeking to open more \nmarkets across the globe in order to \n[[Page S6185]] bring about the increased exports and jobs that the GATT \npromised.\n  And I think it's high-time we question the wisdom that blames almost \nall of America's trade deficit problems solely on ourselves. For years, \nwe've heard the same assertions: ``Americans spend too much and save \ntoo little * * * the budget deficit is too high * * * we are growing \nfaster than other countries so we\n have more money to spend.'' Yes, these economic realities contribute \nto the problem, but under President Clinton's leadership, we have \nreduced the Federal fiscal deficit by over $700 billion, yet the trade \ndeficit goes up and up.\n\n  I think it's time we reverse the premise and look at how the trade \ndeficit fuels our savings and debt problems. The inability of American \ncompanies to sell in places like Japan, China, Germany and elsewhere \ncosts our corporations profits, our workers job opportunities, and our \nnation revenues--all of which weigh down our own economic growth and \nadd to our fiscal deficit.\n  Whether it is a requirement for American firms to hire local agents \nto conduct business; cumbersome inspection and customs procedures; bans \non the sale of products for dubious claims of national sovereignty or \nsome other sort of prerogative, the simple fact is that protected \nsanctuary markets abroad are a major contributor to America's economic \nproblems.\n  To explain this simply, I will use as an example the well known case \nof how Japanese manufacturers sell things like electronics in the \nUnited States at such cheap prices, even when the Yen is at a record \nheight. I am citing Japan here, but it could be any other country that \nhas a sanctuary market. It is well known that many Japanese-made \nproducts are cheaper in the United States than in Japan. That is \nbecause Japan's closed market is a sanctuary that effectively insulates \nproducers from competition, and allows them to overcharge Japanese \nconsumers, giving them enough of a profit margin at home to sell below \ncost here. That means American companies lose on both ends. We can't \nexport into these markets, and their subsidized exports harm our \ndomestic industries and costs us jobs.\n  My trade policy is quite simple, in addition to preserving the \neffectiveness of America's trade laws, I support measures that will \nincrease American exports, and West Virginia exports specifically. \nEvery $1 billion in exports supports about 17,000 jobs. So it follows \nthat if we increase American exports, we will create more jobs here in \nthe United States. And export related jobs are, on average, better, \nhigher paying jobs. That is why I have worked so hard to introduce West \nVirginia businesses to foreign market opportunities.\n  The ``Open Markets and Fair Trade Act of 1995'' is about market \nopportunities for American firms and especially markets for American \nindustries with the most export potential and which promote critical \ntechnologies. Most importantly, it instructs the Commerce Department to \nlook at markets which, if we can export there, offer the greatest \nemployment opportunities for American workers.\n  America cannot afford to be a market for everyone else's products \nwhen we don't get the same kind of access in return. Our economy, and \nthe global economy, cannot sustain that kind of imbalance. The American \npeople will only continue to support free trade if it means we are able \nto sell American products abroad as easily as Asian and European and \nLatin American manufacturers have access to our shelves and showrooms. \nWhile past negotiations should have made these points perfectly clear, \nthe ``Open Markets and Fair Trade Act of 1995'' will erase any doubts \nthat may have lingered with our trading partners.\n  Mr. President, I ask that following my statement the full text of the \n``Open Markets and Fair Trade Act of 1995'' appear, followed by a \nsummary of S. 756.\n  The material follows:\n                                 S. 756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPORTS ON MARKET ACCESS.\n\n       (a) Annual Reports.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report with respect \n     to those countries selected by the Secretary in which goods \n     or services produced or originating in the United States, \n     that would otherwise be competitive in those countries, do \n     not have market access. Each report shall contain the \n     following with respect to each such country:\n       (1) Assessment of potential market access.--An assessment \n     of the opportunities that would, but for the lack of market \n     access, be available in the market in that country, for goods \n     and services produced or originating in the United States in \n     those sectors selected by the Secretary. In making such \n     assessment, the Secretary shall consider the competitive \n     position of such goods and services in similarly developed \n     markets in other countries. Such assessment shall specify the \n     time periods within which such market access opportunities \n     should reasonably be expected to be obtained.\n       (2) Criteria for measuring market access.--Objective \n     criteria for measuring the extent to which those market \n     access opportunities described in paragraph (1) have been \n     obtained. The development of such objective criteria may \n     include the use of interim objective criteria to measure \n     results on a periodic basis, as appropriate.\n       (3) Compliance with trade agreements.--An assessment of \n     whether, and to what extent, the country concerned has \n     materially complied with--\n       (A) agreements and understandings reached between the \n     United States and that country pursuant to section 3, and\n       (B) existing trade agreements between the United States and \n     that country.\n\n     Such assessment shall include specific information on the \n     extent to which United States suppliers have achieved \n     additional access to the market in the country concerned and \n     the extent to which that country has complied with other \n     commitments under such agreements and understandings.\n       (b) Selection of Countries and Sectors.--\n       (1) In general.--In selecting countries and sectors that \n     are to be the subject of a report under subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall give priority to--\n       (A) any country with which the United States has a trade \n     deficit if access to the markets in that country is likely to \n     have significant potential to increase exports of United \n     States goods and services; and\n       (B) any country, and sectors therein, in which access to \n     the markets will result in significant employment benefits \n     for producers of United States goods and services.\n\n     The Secretary shall also give priority to sectors which \n     represent critical technologies, including those identified \n     by the National Critical Technologies Panel under section 603 \n     of the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, \n     and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6683).\n       (2) First report.--The first report submitted under \n     subsection (a) shall include those countries with which the \n     United States has a substantial portion of its trade deficit.\n       (3) Trade surplus countries.--The Secretary may include in \n     reports after the first report such countries as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate with which the United States \n     has a trade surplus but which are otherwise described in \n     subsection (a) and paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n       (c) Other Sectors.--The Secretary shall include an \n     assessment under subsection (a) of any country or sector for \n     which the Trade Representative requests such assessment be \n     made. In preparing any such request, the Trade Representative \n     shall give priority to those barriers identified in the \n     reports required by section 181(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     (19 U.S.C. 2241(b)).\n       (d) Information on Access by Foreign Suppliers.--The \n     Secretary shall consult with the governments of foreign \n     countries concerning access to the markets of any other \n     country of goods and services produced or originating in \n     those countries. At the request of the government of any such \n     country so consulted, the Secretary may include in the \n     reports required by subsection (a) information, with respect \n     to that country, on such access.\n\n     SEC. 3. NEGOTIATIONS TO ACHIEVE MARKET ACCESS.\n\n       (a) Negotiating Authority.--The President is authorized to \n     enter into agreements or other understandings with the \n     government of any country for the purpose of obtaining the \n     market access opportunities described in the reports of the \n     Secretary under section 2.\n       (b) Determination of Priority of Negotiations.--Upon the \n     submission by the Secretary of each report under section 2, \n     the Trade Representative shall determine--\n       (1) for which countries and sectors identified in the \n     report the Trade Representative will pursue negotiations, \n     during the 6-month period following submission of the report, \n     for the purpose of concluding agreements or other \n     understandings described in subsection (a), and the timeframe \n     for pursuing negotiations on any other country or sector \n     identified in the report; and\n       (2) for which countries and sectors identified in any \n     previous report of the Secretary under section 2 the Trade \n     Representative will pursue negotiations, during the 6-month \n     period described in paragraph (1), in cases in which--\n       (A) negotiations were not previously pursued by the Trade \n     Representative, or\n       (B) negotiations that were pursued by the Trade \n     Representative did not result in the \n     [[Page S6186]] conclusion of an agreement or understanding \n     described in subsection (a) during the preceding 6-month \n     period, but are expected to result in such an agreement or \n     understanding during the 6-month period described in \n     paragraph (1).\n\n     For purposes of this Act, negotiations by the Trade \n     Representative with respect to a particular sector shall be \n     for a period of not more than 12 months.\n       (c) Semiannual Reports.--At the end of the 6-month period \n     beginning on the date on which the Secretary's first report \n     is submitted under section 2(a), and every 6 months \n     thereafter, the Trade Representative shall submit to the \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (1) Report where negotiations pursued in previous 6-month \n     period.--With respect to each country and sector on which \n     negotiations described in subsection (b) were pursued during \n     that 6-month period--\n       (A) a determination of whether such negotiations have \n     resulted in the conclusion of an agreement or understanding \n     intended to obtain the market access opportunities described \n     in the most recent applicable report of the Secretary, and if \n     not--\n       (i) whether such negotiations are continuing because they \n     are expected to result in such an agreement or understanding \n     during the succeeding 6-month period; or\n       (ii) whether such negotiations have terminated;\n       (B) in the case of a positive determination made under \n     subparagraph (A)(i) in the preceding report submitted under \n     this subsection, a determination of whether the continuing \n     negotiations have resulted in the conclusion of an agreement \n     or understanding described in subparagraph (A) during that 6-\n     month period.\n       (2) Report where negotiations not pursued.--With respect to \n     each country and sector on which negotiations described in \n     subsection (b) were not pursued during that 6-month period, a \n     determination of when such negotiations will be pursued.\n\n     SEC. 4. MONITORING OF AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For the purpose of making the assessments \n     required by section 2(a)(3), the Secretary shall monitor the \n     compliance with each agreement or understanding reached \n     between the United States and any country pursuant to section \n     3, and with each existing trade agreement between the United \n     States and any country that is the subject of a report under \n     section 2(a). In making each such assessment, the Secretary \n     shall describe--\n       (1) the extent to which market access for the country and \n     sectors covered by the agreement or understanding has been \n     achieved; and\n       (2) the bilateral trade relationship with that country in \n     that sector.\n     In the case of agreements or understandings reached pursuant \n     to section 3, the description under paragraph (1) shall be \n     done on the basis of the objective criteria set forth in the \n     applicable report under section 2(a)(2).\n       (b) Treatment of Agreements and Understandings.--Any \n     agreement or understanding reached pursuant to negotiations \n     conducted under this Act, and each existing trade agreement \n     between the United States and a country that is the subject \n     of a report under section 2(a), shall be considered to be a \n     trade agreement for purposes of section 301 of the Trade Act \n     of 1974.\n\n     SEC. 5. TRIGGERING OF SECTION 301 ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Failure To Conclude Agreements.--In any case in which \n     the Trade Representative determines under section 3(c)(1) \n     (A)(ii) or (B) that negotiations have not resulted in the \n     conclusion of an agreement or understanding described in \n     section 3(a), each restriction on, or barrier or impediment \n     to, access to the markets of the country concerned that was \n     the subject of such negotiations shall, for purposes of title \n     III of the Trade Act of 1974, be considered to be an act, \n     policy, or practice determined under section 304 of that Act \n     to be an act, policy, or practice that is unreasonable and \n     discriminatory and burdens or restricts United States \n     commerce. The Trade Representative shall determine what \n     action to take under section 301(b) of that Act in response \n     to such act, policy, or practice.\n       (b) Noncompliance With Agreements or Understandings.--In \n     any case in which the Secretary determines, in a report \n     submitted under section 2(a), that a foreign country is not \n     in material compliance with--\n       (1) any agreement or understanding concluded pursuant to \n     negotiations conducted under section 3, or\n       (2) any existing trade agreement between the United States \n     and that country,\n\n     the Trade Representative shall determine what action to take \n     under section 301(a) of the Trade Act of 1974. For purposes \n     of section 301 of that Act, a determination of noncompliance \n     described in the preceding sentence shall be treated as a \n     determination made under section 304 of that Act.\n     SEC. 6. EXPEDITED PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN PRESIDENTIAL \n                   ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Authority for Reciprocal Actions.--In any case in \n     which--\n       (1) section 5 applies,\n       (2) the President determines that reciprocal action should \n     be taken by the United States in response to--\n       (A) a restriction, barrier, or impediment referred to in \n     section 5(a) with respect to access to the market of a \n     country, or\n       (B) noncompliance with an agreement, understanding, or \n     trade agreement referred to in section 5(b),\n\n     as the case may be,\n       (3) changes in existing law or new statutory authority is \n     necessary for such reciprocal action to be taken, and\n       (4) the President, within 30 days (excluding any day \n     described in section 154(b) of the Trade Act of 1974) after--\n       (A) the determination of the Trade Representative under \n     section 3(c)(1)(A)(ii) or (B), or\n       (B) the determination of the Secretary in the applicable \n     report under section 2(a),\n\n     as the case may be, submits to the Congress a draft of \n     implementing legislation with respect to the changes or \n     authority described in paragraph (3),\n\n     then subsection (c) applies.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``reciprocal action'' means action that is \n     taken in direct response to a restriction on, or barrier or \n     impediment to, access to the market in another country and is \n     comparable or of equivalent effect to such restriction, \n     barrier, or impediment; and\n       (2) the term ``implementing legislation'' means a bill of \n     either House of Congress which is introduced as provided in \n     subsection (c) and which contains provisions necessary to \n     make the changes or provide the authority described in \n     subsection (a)(3).\n       (c) Procedures for Implementing Legislation.--On the day on \n     which implementing legislation is submitted to the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate under subsection (a), the \n     implementing legislation shall be introduced and referred as \n     provided in section 151(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 for \n     implementing bills under such section. The provisions of \n     subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g) of section 151 of such Act \n     shall apply to implementing legislation to the same extent as \n     such subsections apply to implementing bills.\n       (d) Rules of House of Representatives and Senate.--This \n     section is enacted by the Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, and \n     such procedures supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent with such other rules; and\n       (2) with the full recognition of the constitutional right \n     of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to \n     the procedures of that House) at any time, in the same \n     manner, and to the same extent as any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 7. URUGUAY ROUND AGREEMENTS NOT AFFECTED.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to violate any \n     provision of the agreements approved by the Congress in \n     section 101(a)(1) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 \n     U.S.C. 3511(a)(1)).\n\n     SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Existing trade agreement between the united states and \n     a country.--An ``existing trade agreement'' between the \n     United States and another country means any trade agreement \n     or understanding that was entered into between the United \n     States and that country before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act and is in effect on such date. Such term includes, \n     but is not limited to--\n       (A) with respect to Japan--\n       (i) the Arrangement Between the Government of Japan and the \n     Government of the United States of America Concerning Trade \n     in Semiconductor Products, signed in 1986;\n       (ii) the Arrangement Between the Government of Japan and \n     the Government of the United States of America Concerning \n     Trade in Semiconductor Products, signed in 1991;\n       (iii) the United States-Japan Wood Products Agreement, \n     signed on June 5, 1990;\n       (iv) Measures Related to Japanese Public Sector \n     Procurements of Computer Products and Services, signed on \n     January 10, 1992;\n       (v) the Tokyo Declaration on the U.S.-Japan Global \n     Partnership, signed on January 9, 1992; and\n       (vi) the Cellular Telephone and Third-Party Radio \n     Agreement, signed in 1989;\n       (B) with respect to the European Union--\n       (i) the Agreement Concerning the Application of the GATT \n     Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft Between the European \n     Economic Community and the Government of the United States of \n     America on trade in large civil aircraft, with annexes, \n     entered into force on July 17, 1992;\n       (ii) the Agreement Concerning Procurement Between the \n     United States and the European Union, signed April 15, 1994; \n     and\n       (iii) the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Procurement \n     Between the United States and the European Union, signed May \n     25, 1993; and\n       (C) with respect to the People's Republic of China--\n       (i) the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Protection \n     of Intellectual Property Rights Between the United States and \n     the People's Republic of China, signed January 17, 1992;\n       (ii) the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Market Access \n     Between the United States and the People's Republic of China, \n     signed October 10, 1992;\n       (iii) the Bilateral Textile Agreement Between the United \n     States and the People's Republic of China, signed January 17, \n     1994; and\n       (iv) an exchange of letters with an attached action plan \n     between the United \n     [[Page S6187]] States and the People's Republic of China, \n     signed February 26, 1995, relating to intellectual property \n     rights.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Commerce.\n       (3) Trade representative.--The term ``Trade \n     Representative'' means the United States Trade \n     Representative.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          The Open Markets and Fair Trade Act of 1995--Summary\n\n\n                                  goal\n\n       The legislation will help the United States develop a \n     systematic, long-term trade policy that will pry open foreign \n     markets for American exporters. This bill supports the \n     Clinton Administration's results-oriented trade policy.\n       The U.S. has accumulated more than $1 trillion in \n     merchandise trade deficits since 1980. Countries like Japan--\n     which accounted for more than 43% of last years deficit and \n     China, which accounted for almost 20% of last years trade \n     deficit, continue to exclude U.S. products from their \n     markets.\n       This legislation will create a process for defining what \n     our goals and objectives should be in trade negotiations. It \n     will help ensure that our trade negotiations achieve \n     measurable results, not just empty promises. Additionally, \n     the legislation will grant the President the authority to \n     have Congress grant him reciprocal trade authority on an \n     expedited basis.\n\n\n                               specifics\n\n       The legislation instructs the Commerce Department to choose \n     a range of important American goods and services, and study \n     how well those products do in foreign markets. Then we'll \n     understand how well we should be doing if trade were free and \n     fair. Commerce will outline clear, objective criteria for \n     gaining market access and the USTR will be given authority to \n     negotiate to achieve these or similar goals.\n       The bill requires that in developing objective criteria the \n     Department of Commerce should give priority to industries \n     which will result in the greatest employment benefits for the \n     United States, industries which have the most export \n     potential and industries that promote critical technologies.\n       The legislation doesn't specify what objective criteria \n     should be used. It simply endorses a results-oriented trade \n     policy. The effect will not be ``managed trade''. Rather, it \n     will provide the basis for our negotiators and our trading \n     partners to know what ``success'' is. It seeks to create a \n     basis for open, honest negotiations where others understand \n     what our expectations are.\n       The legislation also gives the President the ability to \n     come to Congress to authorize reciprocal trade actions if he \n     deems it appropriate. This reciprocal trade authority would \n     be considered on an expedited basis.\n       The President has full discretion under this legislation. \n     But it sends a clear message to our trading partners: follow \n     the Golden Rule in trade. If another country believes that \n     its market access impediments are appropriate and should be \n     continued, then they shouldn't object to others following \n     their lead.\n       Nothing in this legislation violates our commitment to the \n     GATT. The process that the bill begins simply requires that \n     we define what our national interests and what fair play \n     would achieve. It does not specify how we will respond to the \n     market barriers our farmers, workers and businesses face, \n     although, through the expedited procedures provided for in \n     the bill, it shows a clear preference for reciprocity. \n     Reciprocity to respond to anticompetitive practices. Actions \n     that aren't covered by the GATT.\n       Those with a vested interest in the status quo have engaged \n     in an intensive public relations campaign to discredit the \n     President's trade policy. We must not retreat from our desire \n     to enforce the rights of our farmers, workers and \n     businesses.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6184-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS' REPORT ON HATE CRIME IN OHIO\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Ohio Advisory Committee to the \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights has released a report documenting hate \nactivity in that State. The Ohio Advisory Committee compiled hate crime \nstatistics from the five largest cities in the State, and found \ncontinuing reports of prejudice and hate ranging from racism, anti-\nSemitism, and homophobia. Unfortunately, Ohio's continued problem with \nhate crimes mirrors the national struggle against crimes based on \nprejudice.\n  The Ohio report serves as a reminder that there is still much work to \nbe done to reduce the incidence of hate crimes. The Hate Crimes \nStatistics Act, which I authored in 1990, has been an important first \nstep in this process. The reporting system established by this law \nsends a message to both the victims and the perpetrators of hate crimes \nthat law enforcement officials are committed to solving the problem of \nhate crimes.\n  Unfortunately, since States are not required to provide statistics on \nhate crimes to the FBI, many States have not yet fully complied with \nthis important effort. In this, Ohio again mirrors the problems in many \nStates. The Ohio Advisory Committee found that the reporting of hate \ncrime by local law enforcement agencies is still insufficient to gauge \nwith confidence the extent of hate crime activity in Ohio. Ohio has \nseen significant progress since 1991 when only 30 of 401--7 percent--\nlaw enforcement agencies who participate in the program submitted hate \ncrime reports to the FBI. That number increased to 125 of 401--31 \npercent--law enforcement agencies reporting in 1993. This progress is \nencouraging, but a greater commitment is needed.\n  In addition to the problems with insufficient reporting, the report \nfound that Ohio's reporting was plagued by wide discrepancies in \ninterpretation of the hate crime statute. This has been a problem in \nmany States, and highlights the importance of the FBI hate crime \ntraining programs. The FBI offers outreach and training programs for \nlocal law enforcement officials to ensure that hate crime reporting is \nconsistent and in keeping with the statute. I encourage Ohio law \nenforcement officials to take advantage of this useful training.\n  The Ohio report made several recommendations to improve Ohio's hate \ncrime reporting, from encouraging local law enforcement officials to \navail themselves of the hate crime training offered by the FBI to the \ncreation of a central depository of hate crime information in Ohio. \nThese changes would not only boost efforts to monitor hate crimes, but \nfacilitate more effective remedies and prosecutions of hate crimes in \nthe State. I encourage Ohio officials to review these recommendations.\n  The foundation laid by the 1990 Hate Crimes Statistics Act is an \nimportant step in solving the problem of hate crimes. But clearly this \nproblem is not going away. The problems in Ohio are not unique. \nGovernment officials, from local to Federal, need to look for ways to \nassist States and cities interested in training their law enforcement \nofficials to report hate crimes, and to encourage all States to \nparticipate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6187-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6187-S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Immigration Enforcement Improvements Act of 1995. The \napproach to immigration policy reflected in the administration's \nproposal is thoughtful and comprehensive, and I applaud it.\n  The Clinton administration's bill recognizes, as do the people of \nthis Nation, the need to formulate an effective response to the problem \nof illegal immigration, and proposes increased resources not only for \nborder enforcement, but also increased resources to eliminate the job \nmagnet that will continue to draw undocumented aliens into the Nation \nregardless of the success of our border policy. The proposal also \nstrives to improve our ability to deport those aliens that have been \nidentified as deportable.\n  To achieve each of these objectives the administration has proposed \nstern measures, and, in its fiscal year 1996 budget request, the \ncommitment of substantial resources; yet, at the same time, the \nadministration's proposal contains little that feeds the rampant anti-\nimmigrant sentiment that has pervaded the immigration policy debate in \nrecent years. Rather, the administration's proposal takes a measured \nyet aggressive approach to the problems we must face. In short, while \nit has taken an undeniably firm stance against illegal immigration, the \nadministration has not succumbed to the belief that immigration in all \nits shapes and forms is a bad thing. Quite the contrary: this \nlegislation reflects the fact that, as the President has said, an \neffective immigration policy must combine deterrence of illegal \nimmigration with an encouragement and celebration of legal immigration.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues \nin the Senate to effect this delicate balance, and to implement an \nimmigration policy that is both tough and fair. The administration's \nproposal is a great step in this direction.\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. RAY STOWERS\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nfellow Oklahoman, Ray Stowers, D.O. on his recent appointment to the \nPhysicians Payment Review Commission [PPRC].\n  Dr. Stowers is an osteopathic, family practice physician from \nMedford, OK. Since his first year in practice, Dr. Stowers has remained \ndedicated to the advancement of rural family medical practice, \nevidenced by his service as a faculty member of the Oklahoma State \nUniversity College of Osteopathic Medicine. During this time, Dr. \nStowers maintained his office at the rural site for the Enid Memorial \nHospital providing exceptional health care for the individuals in that \ncommunity.\n  One of Dr. Stowers' many successes occurred when he was appointed by \nthe Governor of Oklahoma to serve on the board of the Task Force on \nRural Health Care issues which was responsible for advising the \nGovernor on the State's health care manpower needs, and for convening a \nstatewide conference to discuss rural health care delivery issues.\n  Dr. Stowers is also an expert in physician payment issues. Since \n1992, he has served on the American Medical Association's Relative \nValue Update Committee [RUC]. As the first osteopathic physician \nappointed to serve on this committee, Ray has facilitated greater \nunderstanding, collaboration, and teamwork between the osteopathic \nmedical profession and the allopathic physician community, and has lent \nhis considerable expertise on physician practices to the RUC \nproceedings. Since 1994, he has also served as the osteopathic \nprofession's liaison to the American Academy of Physicians regarding \nreimbursement, certification, legislation, and managed care options.\n  Since PPRC was established by Congress in 1986, an osteopathic \nphysician has never served on the Commission. Dr. Stowers' appointment \nmakes him the first osteopathic physician to serve on the Commission \nand the medical profession could not have put forth a finer candidate. \nDr. Stowers represents what is best about medicine and physicians in \nAmerica today. During the time when the trend to become a specialized \nphysician is so strong and promises such great rewards, he has remained \ndedicated to the path of providing solo, rural family medicine for over \n21 years.\n  Dr. Stowers has served his family, his profession, his community, and \nhis State of Oklahoma well. The entire country will now benefit from \nthe same service of compassion and integrity. Dr. Stowers, the State of \nOklahoma is proud of your accomplishments. I am honored to join your \nfamily, friends, and colleagues in wishing you every success as you \nembark on your next challenge of serving on the Physician Payment \nReview Commission.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6187-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is Arson Awareness Week. In the \ntime it will take me to finish my first sentence, arson fires will \ndestroy at least $600 worth of property in this country. That is an \nannual cost of more than $2 billion. And while in recent years arson \nhas accounted for just over 15 percent of building fires, it has \naccounted for more than 30 percent of the dollar loss.\n  This, Mr. President, is a problem we all pay for. We pay for it in \nhigher property insurance premiums and in higher taxes.\n  Analysis of 1987 to 1991 fires by the National Fire Protection \nAssociation found that residential arson averaged a cost of $14,000 per \nfire. Fires set in stores, offices, and restaurants averaged a cost of \n$30,000 per fire. And arson fires in manufacturing sites averaged more \nthan $65,000.\n  Beyond the obvious economic costs associated with homes and \nbusinesses lost to arson, there is a severe social consequence. In many \ncases the remnants from acts of arson end up as hangouts and havens for \ndrug dealers, prostitutes, and other criminal elements. Put simply, \narson breeds crime in more ways than one, contributing to fear and \nfrustration, especially in our Nation's cities.\n  Finally--and more importantly--we pay for the heinous crime of arson \nin a way that cannot be measured--a loss that is beyond monetary \nconsiderations. This, of course, is the loss of life. Every year, Mr. \nPresident, more than 700 people--men, women, and children--die in arson \nfires. Beyond the deaths, there are the tortured survivors, people who \noften end up physically or emotionally scarred.\n  National Arson Awareness Week sponsored by the International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators begins the week of May 1. It serves \nto remind us of one of the more notorious and unfortunate chapters in \nrecent American history, the series of devastating fires set over 3 \ndays in Los Angeles in 1992. May 1 is the anniversary of the day those \nfires ended. It is my sincere hope that by focusing on the tragedy that \nis always, in one way, associated with arson, we can minimize, and even \nbring an end to this horrible crime.\n  As we focus attention on arson, we will better understand who sets \nfires and under what circumstances. Based on arson arrests, juveniles \nset approximately half of arson fires, usually as a way to commit \nvandalism. However, my definition of juveniles is broader than just \nteenagers. Of those arrested, 6 percent are under 10 years old.\n  However, it is the adult arsonists who are the most sophisticated and \nwho cause the greater amount of destruction. Revenge often serves as a \nmotive for their arson. In 1990, in New York City, a man who was angry \nwith his girlfriend, set fire to the restaurant where she worked. The \nend result was the death of 87 people turning his hateful act into the \nsecond-deadliest fire of the past 30 years.\n  What is being done to reduce the threat of arson? Many things.\n  Insurance companies report information on suspicious fires to the \nProperty Insurance Loss Register, a national database, which police and \nfire officials use to investigate fires and prosecute arsonists. While \nthis is not a recent development, increased use will pay bigger \ndividends as the amount of information in the database grows.\n  Also, firefighters have long received training in arson detection. \nSome even specialize in the field. They are highly trained and skilled \nin determining a fire's origin.\n  Recently, dogs have also assumed a new role, the role of a fire \ninvestigator's best friend. These specially trained dogs are sometimes \nable to sniff out what started a fire, such as gasoline, when human \ninvestigators cannot.\n  I am encouraged by the progress and the dedicated men and women who \ndedicate themselves to our safety. Arson Awareness Week is one way we \ncan demonstrate our gratitude and encourage the rest of America to join \nus in fighting this destructive and pointless crime.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6188-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6188-S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         DEMOCRACY IN TANZANIA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I speak to you today about an \nAfrican country that could, this year, take another major step on the \npath toward democracy.\n  The Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 through the merger of two \nindependent States: the East African State, Tanganyika, and the \nindependent island, Zanzibar. From 1965 until his retirement in 1985, \nPresident Julius Nyere, one of the greatest of African statesman, \nheaded the Tanzanian Government.\n  For most of its history, the Republic of Tanzania has had a single \nparty political system. In 1985, President Nyere was succeeded by their \ncurrent leader, President Ali Hassan Mwinyi in a single party election. \nPresident Mwinyi won that election with no opposition and 96 percent of \nthe vote. In 1990, President Mwinyi was again the sole candidate in the \nPresidential elections. Again, he won with 95.5 percent of the votes.\n  In 1992, Tanzania formally adopted constitutional amendments \nproviding for a multiparty system. This constitutional change was not \nforced on the Government by a popular uprising. Instead, it was \nrecommended by a Presidential commission and adopted by the ruling \nparty, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi [CCM] party. I commend\n President Mwinyi for his leadership in moving Tanzania a step forward \non the road to greater democracy and freedom.\n\n  Since mid-1992, numerous opposition parties have been registered in \nTanzania and multiparty elections have been held at local and the \nparliamentary by \n[[Page S6189]] election levels. Yet, as of the results available at the \nend of 1994, new political parties won only 7 percent of the seats in \ncontested elections. Half of the elections were uncontested. While the \nConstitution recognizes a multi-party system, the electoral policies \nand practices of Tanzania continue to support a single-party \ngovernment.\n  Clearly, a decision to hold multi-party elections does not mean that \ndemocracy, political rights and civil liberties have been fully \nembraced. Freedom House, a highly respected non-profit organization \nthat monitors political rights and civil liberties worldwide, rates \nTanzania as not free. Likewise the Carter Center describes Tanzania as \nbeing moderately democratic, reflecting that while the Government of \nTanzania makes formal commitments to a democratic transition, their \ndeeds are not yet commensurate with their pledges.\n  In October 1995, Tanzania will hold its first national multiparty \nelection. This could be, given transparent and unbiased election \npractices, a major achievement in the political life of Tanzania. But \nnow is the time for the Government of Tanzania to match the rhetoric of \ndemocracy with the tangible actions needed for real democracy to \nblossom and flourish.\n  Constitutional adoption of multi-party elections has provided an \nopportunity for greater democracy. Freedom of the press, equal access \nto the public media--particularly the national radio--for all political \nparties, and a politically independent election commission will move \ndemocracy closer to a reality. Tanzania has made some progress in \nrecent months. It can make significantly more in the months ahead. I \nencourage Tanzania's leaders to move forward to provide a level playing \nfield for all political parties for their upcoming national \nelections.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6188-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to make a few \ncomments on the pending product liability bill and the cloture votes \nwhich were taken today; that is, the vote to close off debate so that \nthere could be a vote on the bill ultimately on final passage, with the \nrules of our body having unlimited debate and the rules of our Senate \nrequiring there be 60 Senators join on what is called cloture to close \noff debate, and we had two such votes today. One was 46 in favor, 53 \nagainst. The second was 47 in favor and 52 against. So it is obvious on \nthe current State of the record, the Senate is long away from having 60 \nvotes to close off debate and move to a final decision on product \nliability.\n  I think that when there are significant, really major, really \nfundamental changes to a system as profoundly important as the legal \nsystem in the United States, that it is a matter that requires very, \nvery careful deliberation, and it is appropriate for the cloture route \nto be followed and for 60 votes to be required to pass legislation of \nthis importance, of this far-reaching nature.\n  Mr. President, I have stated on the floor of the Senate on a number \nof occasions that I believe that reforms are warranted on product \nliability, but I think they have to be very, very carefully crafted. I \nbelieve that after experience representing both plaintiffs and \ndefendants in litigation and having had substantial experience in \nproducts liability litigation.\n  The matter came up in the last Congress, and I voted for cloture at \nthat time in the hopes that we could get a carefully crafted bill. I \nthink that it is appropriate to have a bill which would provide for \nalternative dispute resolution, as is provided in the current \nlegislation, to adopt the collateral source rule which is contested. \nBut it provides that if an individual has bought insurance and has \ncollected on his or her own insurance policy, then that individual \ncannot collect again in a lawsuit. The plaintiffs and the individuals \nand the consumers objected to collateral source rule on the ground that \nthe individual has paid for it so that whatever benefit is received \nfrom the insurance policy ought not to be discounted for the defendant. \nBut I think that on balance, given all the factors, that it is \nappropriate to limit that aspect of a plaintiff's recovery.\n  I believe that it is worthwhile to have a tightening of the rules on \nfrivolous lawsuits, and perhaps the frivolous lawsuit is really at the \ncore of the litigation problem in America today, lawsuits which are \nbrought without any real merit or without any real foundation.\n  I think that if we could set the rules to discourage, to eliminate \nfrivolous lawsuits, we would have really solved most of the problem \nthat is present in the litigation system today, to stop lawsuits which \nare being brought where they do not have a real basis in fact and in \nlaw, where they are brought really to coerce settlements but not \nbecause the plaintiff has a real case.\n  The distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, offered an \namendment to tighten up the rules on \n[[Page S6190]] frivolous lawsuits, and I supported that amendment.\n  I think that there are things that can be done within the course of \nthe pending legislation which would strengthen the hand of the \ndefendants, such as the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, who wanted to have the same limitations on \ndefendants as on plaintiffs on the alternative dispute resolution \nissue. He wanted to leave it up to the States, many of which have \nprovisions on alternative dispute resolution--that is a fancy name for \narbitration--where if a plaintiff failed to be reasonable, there could \nbe sanctions on the plaintiff just as under the pending legislation. If \nthe defendant is not reasonable, there can be sanctions on the \ndefendant.\n  I think that the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, offered a very important amendment to limit product liability \nto Federal cases. That is in accordance with the principle that we \nought to allow States to make determinations and to have government \nclosest to the people, a matter related to an issue which has been \nhandled by, promoted by the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who now \npresides in the chair, Senator Kempthorne. He has been here only 2 \nyears and 4 months, if my mathematics are correct, and championed \nlegislation to eliminate Federal mandates, having been the mayor of \nBoise, ID, and having seen the imposition of mandates coming from the \nFederal Government--may the Record show the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer is nodding in the affirmative--really wanting to have \ngovernment closest to the people, letting the mayors and State \ngovernments decide these issues so that when Senator Thompson offered \nthe amendment, that it really ought to be a matter of federalism, and \nthat is something which is very heavily emphasized in the Contract With \nAmerica. I think that made good sense.\n  When it comes to a few of the fundamental issues, Mr. President, I \nhave grave reluctance to make very fundamental changes in the present \nsystem. One of those areas is on the matter of punitive damages. I do \nnot think that we have really come to grips with the question of \npunitive damages in our debate.\n  Punitive damages are set up as a form of punishment as the word \n``punitive'' says, when there is some egregious, willful, wanton \nmisconduct on the part of the defendant which really has to be \ncontrolled in a civil contest. And a number of the cases that I brought \nto the floor to illustrate what this really means, where you have a \nmatter like the notorious Pinto case, where the gas tank was in the \nrear of the car and exploded. As I recollect the figures, it would cost \n$11 apiece to modify that dangerous gas tank. Ford Motor Co. made a \ncalculated decision, figuring out how many personal injury cases there \nwould be, how many death cases and injury cases there would be, where \nthe motorists and the passengers would burn up, and figured it out that \nit made dollars and cents, economic value to them, to pay the cost of \nlitigation as opposed to correcting the car.\n  On the Cutter blood case where it was shown that the defendant had \nknowledge that blood was being transmitted which contained AIDS, they \nmade a calculation as to what it would cost to cure it and decided not \nto issue the warning and to have the blood circulated. That came to \nlight, as in the Pinto case, by going into the records of the defendant \nand finding that out. Or the IUD case, where women were subjected to \nthe IUD which caused infections, sterilization, and tremendous damages, \nalthough well known to the defendant company that that was a problem. \nOr the flammable pajama case. Because there had not been any standard \nset by the Federal Government, the manufacturer put out pajamas that \nthey knew would become flammable, that is burn up, with very little \nprovocation. Some of the cases put into the Record--one specifically \nthat I recollect involved a case where the conduct of the defendant \ncorporation was so aggravated that criminal charges were brought--\nreally, where you have a willful and malicious disregard for human life \nthat constitutes malice and is sufficient to have a criminal \nprosecution for murder in the second degree.\n  Some of the cases by big corporations, by big companies, on the cost \nbenefit analysis as to what it would cost to leave the damaged product \ngo on, those are present in many cases. They have been put into the \nRecord. That is why it seems to me, Mr. President, that we really ought \nnot to be making fundamental changes which would give a green light and \na license to disregard the interests of the consumer. What we are \nreally talking about is the interest of the consumer here, the interest \nof the general public in trying to weigh what is fair in terms of \nhandling the issues of defendant companies.\n  I am very concerned about American productivity and especially about \nthe ability of small business to function. I am concerned about some \nwho say, well, the claim is so large and the damages are so enormous, \npotentially, even though there is no merit, that we would be betting \nthe business if we went to trial and therefore really intimidated and \nintimidated into a settlement.\n  I filed an amendment which would limit recovery on punitive damages \nto 10 percent of the value of the company. I filed that amendment and I \noffered that as an alternative possibility, with some trepidation, \nfrankly, because of a concern I have that if you limit punitive \ndamages, it may be an incentive for somebody to be wantonly \ndisregarding of the safety of others. It may be that the punitive \ndamage issue could be further contained by analogy to the libel cases \nwhere, after a libel verdict is entered under a very tough standard of \nmalice--New York Times versus Sullivan, Supreme Court of the United \nStates. On appellate review, there is a de novo review, the Latin word \nwhich means a full review. It is not a matter limited to a decision on \nwhether there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the \njury.\n  Customarily, in litigation, when the jury enters a verdict and there \nis an appeal taken, the appellate court, the reviewing court, will look \nto see if there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the \njury. But in libel cases because of the interest in freedom of speech \nand the interest of limiting the liability of the media--newspapers, \nradio, television--there is a different standard. The standard is \napplied that the reviewing court will look at it fresh to decide if \nthere is sufficient evidence so that we will have a check on the jury \nsystem if they are capricious or arbitrary or really out of line.\n  Mr. President, I have expressed the same concern on changing the law \non joint liability. And bear in mind that as the cases are built up on \npunitive damages or joint liability, they are built up by courts which \nhave a very deliberate process, much more thoughtful process than the \nlegislative process. When we have hearings, it is well known, \nfrequently only one or two Senators are present. When we mark up the \nbill--that is, write it up--it is not really the essence of \nunderstanding of all of the provisions. On the issue of punitive \ndamages, there are learned opinions by Justice Scalia, a known \nconservative writing on punitive damages, from the constitutional \nperspective, saying there is a constitutional basis for punitive \ndamages and rejecting the claim that punitive damages ought to be \noverturned. That is in the context of whether there is a constitutional \nbasis for it as opposed to a public policy determination, which would \nbe up to the Congress.\n  But those kinds of issues are considered and considered very \ncarefully by the courts. I think, fairly stated, having been a party to \nthe judicial process and legislative process, I say unequivocally the \nanalysis given in the court is much more intricate and more thorough \nthan we are able to do in the legislative process. But there are points \nwhere we ought to legislate. When the issue of joint liability comes \nup, I have been reluctant to disturb that.\n  One of the cases which comes to my mind is the case involving the \nfatality of our distinguished and learned colleague, the late John \nHeinz, who was killed in April 1991 in a plane crash when he was riding \nin a charter plane and there was a noted problem with the landing gear, \nand they went by the airport and came away, and a helicopter owned by \nthe Sun Oil Co. came by trying to observe, and there was a crash. The \nplanes fell into a crowded school yard in suburban Philadelphia. There \n[[Page S6191]] were terrible injuries. If we had made changes in joint \nliability in that case, the children, some of whom were killed, and \nsome of whom were badly burned, would not be able to recover fully.\n  So when you have a case where there is joint liability and the issue \nis raised, why should a party who is only 50 percent liable pay the \nwhole thing when the other party is insolvent, or under the current law \nhas the full responsibility? The law has been established in that \neffect because joint liability is composed when there is substantial \nnegligent conduct by the party which causes the injuries. If you have \nto balance the injustice of having one party only partially liable pay \nthe full damages, where others are insolvent, it turns on who is going \nto bear the loss, the injured plaintiff, who is not at fault, as the \nchildren were not at fault in the air collision which took the life of \nSenator Heinz and others on the ground, and very serious burn injuries.\n  I filed an amendment at the desk which would seek to limit, to an \nextent, joint liability. You hear about the cases where somebody is \nliable only for 1 or 2 percent and the parties liable for 98 or 99 \npercent are insolvent and the party who is only peripherally involved \nhas to pay the full verdict. It seems to me that perhaps something in \nthe nature of 15 percent might be an appropriate cutoff. That joint \nliability would not attach if somebody were not liable beyond the \nextent of 15 percent.\n  Mr. President, I offer these observations about ways that product \nliability could be crafted so that we could get legislation out of the \nSenate,\n where we might have a different standard on punitive damages to \naccommodate different review by the appellate courts to eliminate the \nreally outlandish, runaway, or arbitrary jury verdicts, or limit it to \nthe percentage of the net worth of the company--10 percent as I have \nsuggested--so that a company, especially a small company, is not, in \neffect, intimidated or blackmailed into a settlement, because they \ncannot get the whole company. Or ways where we might have a limitation \non joint liability.\n\n  Mr. President, I have been in Congress, the Senate, since the 97th \nCongress, when we reported out a product liability bill from the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Kasten. It was a long time before the bill \ncame to the floor after that.\n  Last year, as I say, I voted for cloture, thinking we might get a \nbill. I believe that we could get a bill which would take significant \nsteps, most emphatically, on the issues of frivolous lawsuits. So that \nin opposing cloture--on a vote, we have only 46 Senators who voted for \ncloture, 53 against; on the second vote, 47 voted for cloture as \nagainst 52 against, a long way from the 60 votes.\n  I make these comments because I think that when we deal with the \njudicial system, it is not the plaintiff's trial bar which establishes \nthese rules. These rules were established by the courts of the United \nStates. As I say, I have been on both sides of the fence representing \nplaintiffs and defendants in personal injury cases.\n  I think where we have so many, many cases of outlandish conduct where \nbig companies put products on the market on a calculation that they \nwould rather pay for the deaths and the damages than to make the \ncorrection, if we take punitive damages away, it is not a wise thing \nfor the Congress to do.\n  I do not think many of our colleagues understand that. After I talked \nabout some of the cases, talked about the blood case with AIDS virus in \nit, being circulated by one of the big companies, and one of my \ncolleagues said, ``That is awful,'' and I made the comment about it. \nThey had not heard. I do not think they really have reached all of our \nMembers.\n  Usually, there is not more than one Senator present or two, one \npresiding, but the rule of this body is that these speeches are made \nand these presentations are made with not more than two or three or \nfour Senators on the floor. Some are listening in their offices, but \nrelatively few.\n  These are matters, I think, which yet have to be considered. It is my \nhope that we can craft legislation which will be curative on some of \nthe issues, especially that of frivolous lawsuits, which I think is at \nthe core of the problem in our courts today. I thank the Chair for \nstaying late. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/04/senate-section/article/S6189-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
