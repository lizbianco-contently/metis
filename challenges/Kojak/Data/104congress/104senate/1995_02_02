Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor before the \nFederal Reserve Board had finalized action, worried about whether they \nwould once again make another very \n[[Page S1970]] large mistake with respect to increasing interest rates \nand further injuring the American economy.\n  Of course, we know from news yesterday that the Fed raised short-term \ninterest rates again. Seven times in a year the Federal Reserve Board \nhas met in secret and then told the American people they have decided \nthat for the country's own good, interest rates must once again go up.\n  I was looking again at the Constitution, and the Constitution under \narticle I, section 8, says: ``The Congress shall have the power to coin \nmoney, regulate the value thereof,'' et cetera, et cetera. The \ninteresting thing about the Federal Reserve Board, it is a creature \ncreated by the Congress in the early 1900's with a national promise \nthat this will not become a strong central bank. Of course, it has \nbecome a strong central bank, accountable to no one.\n  I said yesterday that they apparently view themselves as a set of \nhuman brake pedals, whose mission in life is to slow down the American \neconomy. Well, unfortunately they will succeed beyond their wildest \ndreams. I think they risk throwing this economy into another recession.\n  More importantly, their actions mean that virtually every American \nwill pay more credit card interest; those millions of families out \nthere with adjustable rate mortgages will find that their home payments \nare going to go up. I had a fellow tell me recently, ``I am paying $115 \na month more now than a year ago because my adjustable rate mortgage \nwas adjusted.'' And I said that resulted not from some democratic \naction, not some concerted action in Congress where there was a big \ndebate and a discussion about what should be done; that happened \nbecause of a group of central bankers. They went into a room, shut the \ndoor, and made a decision outside of the view of the public citizens to \nincrease interest rates.\n  It will impact virtually every American. But more importantly, in my \njudgment, it risks throwing this country back into a recession.\n  I just do not understand why the current Federal Reserve Board \napparently feels unemployment should never go below 5 percent and \neconomic growth somehow should never be more than 2.5 or 3 percent. \nWhere on Earth did they get these notions? What schools out there could \npossibly teach this kind of nonsense?\n  There is not much we can do about what the Fed did yesterday, but \nshortly I intend to reintroduce the Federal Reserve reform legislation \nthat I have sponsored previously. I would introduce this even if rates \nwere going down, so it is not just that they are going up that causes \nme to come and describe to my colleagues what I think we should do. But \nI am very concerned that rates are going up at a time when they should \nnot be going up, when there is no credible evidence of inflation--none. \nInflation is down 4 straight years. Last year, 2.7 percent.\n  Mr. Greenspan, with whom I disagree substantially, says, ``We think \nit overstates inflation by up to 1.5 percent.'' If that is the case--I \ndo not agree with that. But using his own numbers and his own logic, \nmaybe inflation is only 1.2 percent. If that is really the case, then \nwhat on Earth are they doing raising interest rates seven times? How \ncan one conclude that inflation is somehow on the cusp of being out of \ncontrol if it is 1.2 percent? Again, I do not know just what kind of \nair they are breathing that can cause this kind of internal chaos and \nthis kind of unusual thinking.\n  We cannot do much about yesterday, but we sure can do something about \ntomorrow in terms of how decisions are made about monetary policy. \nShould decisions be made by a bunch of politicians? No, I do not think \nso. There are not enough cigars in the world to pass around to give \npoliticians the opportunity to close the door and make their own \ndecisions about money. I do not agree with that. That is not my \nsuggestion. But should monetary policy be conducted outside of the view \nof the American public in some closed room by a bunch of central \nbankers who serve their constituency, not ours? The answer is no. It is \nthe wrong thing. We should change it. Congress created the Federal \nReserve about 80 years ago. We should change it.\n  How would we change it? I recognize the minute we talk about changing \nanything here Wall Street has an apoplectic seizure. But most anything \ngives Wall Street seizures. Let us talk about what ought to be done and \nlet Wall Street worry about its future.\n  What ought to be done? Well, first of all, we ought to pass a Federal \nReserve reform bill that says the following: Nobody ought to vote on \nmonetary policy in this country in any room, locked or unlocked, unless \nthey are accountable to the American people. And the fact is those who \nvoted in the Open Market Committee on interest rates yesterday and who \nare the regional Fed bank presidents are neither appointed by the \nPresident of the United States, nor are they confirmed by the Congress. \nThey are unaccountable to anyone except their boards of directors, the \nmajority of which are private bankers. None of them should ever cast a \nvote on the Federal Reserve Board Open Market Committee. No regional \nFed bank president ought to have a vote on that committee. That is No. \n1.\n  No. 2, I think there ought to be immediate disclosure. There has \nbeen, incidentally, in recent months, immediate disclosure of actions \nby the Fed. When they take action in secret, it ought to be disclosed \nimmediately. I have read stories about people using voice stress \nanalyzers on speech by the Fed Chairman after a meeting was held and \nthey made a decision in secret but are not set to announce it until \nlater. So somebody is using voice stress analyzers on the voice of the \nChairman to figure out what has happened in the room. That is how \nbizarre the secrecy at the Fed has become. It has persuaded people to \ntry to penetrate the secrecy.\n  So, make a decision and announce it immediately. Let the small \ninvestor know as much as the big investors think they know.\n  Third, I think that the Federal Reserve Board budget ought to be \npublished in regular order and in regular form in the budget of the \nUnited States, and I think it ought to be subject to performance \naudits. The Federal Reserve Board ought to be like other Federal \nagencies and accountable.\n  Fourth, I believe the Federal Reserve Board ought to meet on a formal \nbasis with the executive branch of Government, especially the Treasury \nSecretary, who is involved in fiscal policy. If we have monetary policy \non the left hand and fiscal policy on the right hand, the two ought to \ntalk a little bit to figure out which direction they are going.\n  We have had circumstances in the past where they looked like they \nwere riding a bicycle built for two, with fiscal policy on the front \nend trying to chug uphill and monetary on the back end trying to keep \nthe brakes on. And they get somewhere near the cusp of the hill, and \nthey are talking to each other and one says, ``We are exerting a lot of \npressure to get away,'' and the other says, ``We are putting the brakes \non.''\n  What sense does that make? There ought to be some coordinated policy \nin this country, or at least some understanding of what one is doing \nrelative to the other.\n  Those are the things that I think need to be done to make changes in \nthe Federal Reserve Board. Very modest changes. This is not taking the \nFed and flipping it upside down and shaking the daylights out of it. It \nis not doing that. Would I like to do that? Maybe. But am I proposing \nthat? No, I am proposing very modest steps.\n  Even these steps, interestingly enough, are largely too much for most \nMembers of Congress, because they say, ``Oh, Lord we don't want to get \ninvolved in that. We don't want to talk about the Fed. It is some \nmysterious priesthood of action and language down there which we don't \nunderstand. Let's not interfere with it. Those who want to talk about \nthis basically want to put politics right in the middle of the Federal \nReserve Board System.''\n  Nonsense. Total baloney. We ought to do this. We ought to at least \ngive the American people some notion that monetary policy constructed \nin this country is of, by and for all the people, not just the \nconstituency of the big money center banks that is represented so well \nand so consistently by current policies of the Federal Reserve Board.\n   [[Page S1971]] I hope I do not come to the floor again in the months \nahead to be critical of the Federal Reserve Board. My preference would \nbe to praise the Federal Reserve Board for doing the right thing. But \nthey are doing the wrong thing. It is time for us to say when the \nFederal Reserve Board is on the wrong course doing something that is \ngoing to injure this country. When the Fed feels its role is to be a \nhuman brake pedal to slow the country down and risk throwing it into a \nrecession, it is time for some of us to stand up and say this makes no \nsense for our country.\n  I come from a State that is a heavy user of credit--agriculture. The \nfamily farmer plants in the spring and does not get a crop until fall. \nThey need to use credit to tide them over during the year.\n  Do you know what sort of behavior this does to a family farmer? It is \nan enormous hit for a family farmer or rancher. This substantially \nincreases their costs. Farmers in North Dakota will pay, on average, \nthousands of dollars more in interest payment because of the Fed's \nactions this past year. Did they have any opportunity to participate in \nthese decisions? Any voice at all? No. The interest of the family \nfarmer or rancher out there is subordinated to the interest of the \nmoney center banks. I guarantee you, the interest of the money center \nbanks is present, front and center in that room when these decisions \nare made.\n  But I also guarantee you that there is not anybody in that room \ntalking about my Uncle Joe, about people who produce things, about the \nfarmers out there who are planting and hoping, about the ranchers who \nare working in subzero weather trying to make sure their cows are all \nright and then come to the bank at the end of the year and decide they \nhave substantially increased costs. It has nothing to do with their \ncows, but it has to do with some folks down there behind a closed door \nat the Federal Reserve Board.\n  This ought to change. I would not be here if I thought the Federal \nReserve Board was on the right track and doing the right things for our \ncountry. I feel so strongly they are not. I think the Fed is moving in \na direction counterproductive to this country's interest.\n  That is what persuades me to talk and to, once again, want to \nintroduce this legislation. Let me in 1 final minute read something \nfrom the Washington Post today. After yesterday's action by the Federal \nReserve Board, it is not, I suppose, surprising for anyone to see a \nquote:\n\n       Many Wall Street analysts, however, praise the course of \n     Fed policy.\n\n  I tell you what, that probably is not very surprising to most \nAmericans. Many Wall Street analysts praise the Fed policy. Of course \nthey praise the Fed policy. Who do you think the Feds are doing this \nfor? It is not Main Street, it is not the family farmer, not the \nrancher, not the working person out there.\n  So I guess when previous Fed Reserve folks said to Members of \nCongress at a hearing, ``We are serving our constituency''--that is \nwhat they said arrogantly--we know who their constituency is. But it is \ndifferent than our constituency, and that is the dilemma.\n  I hope one of these days there is a reconciliation in this country \nabout who monetary policy is created and fashioned for and in whose \ninterest it now serves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1969-7", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1971-S1972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE CLINTON PLAN TO ASSIST MEXICO\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Tuesday, January 31, President Clinton \nannounced that he could no longer wait for the Congress to act on the \nMexican loan guarantee legislation that he had proposed to assist \nMexico with the serious economic crisis it confronts. Instead, he has \ndecided to act now to stem the tide of negative expectations that \nthreatens to overwhelm Mexican exchange and financial markets. \nUtilizing existing executive authority, the President has indicated \nthat the United States will make available a $20 billion swap \narrangement through the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n  The President, to his credit, has also enlisted the substantial \ninvolvement of the international community in this latest initiative. \nThe International Monetary Fund will provide an unprecedented level of \nassistance--$17.5 billion, and the European Community through the Bank \nfor International Settlements will make $10 billion available to this \neffort. Taken together, this package should be more than sufficient to \ndeal with the adverse market psychology that had developed over the \ninability of Congress to act on the guarantee proposal.\n  I believe that the President's decision is the right one in light of \nthe potential threat that the current instability poses, not only for \nMexico, but for our economy as well. It is important to remember that \nMexico has been an important player in the United States economic \npicture. Mexico has been our third largest trading partner. The United \nStates has represented two-thirds of Mexico's worldwide trading \nactivities. Up until now, Mexico has been an important and growing \nmarket for United States exports--we sold nearly $50 billion of our \nproducts there in 1994. Some 770,000 American jobs depend on our trade \nwith Mexico. U.S. investors also have a stake in the current situation. \nNot just large New York bankers and Wall Street investment brokers--but \nthousands of other Americans through their involvement in pension and \nmutual funds.\n  Even my State of Connecticut, thousands of miles from Mexico's \nborder, stands to reap the benefits of a vibrant Mexican economy, or \nalternatively suffer the pain of a collapsed one. In 1993 nearly 7,000 \nConnecticut workers were employed in producing products destined for \nsale in Mexico at a value of $365 million. My State is by no means \nunique on this score. California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico all have \nan enormous stake in Mexico's economic health.\n  That Mexico has a serious problem is not in question. Its financial \nand currency markets have been in a frenzy over the last several weeks. \nThe peso has lost more than 50 percent in value. Yesterday, the peso \nreached a historic low at 6.3 pesos to the dollar. The Mexican stock \nmarket has been rocked as well. The Zedillo government has been unable \nto refinance most of its debts\n coming due thus far this year--obligations that will reach $80 billion \nby year's end. Unless this crisis of confidence is reversed and markets \nstabilized, the Mexican economy will slide into serious recession and \nits financial system will all but collapse.\n\n  Clearly, the Mexican Government must take steps to help itself. And \nit has done so. On January 3, President Zedillo announced an emergency \neconomic program designed to stabilize the economy--allow the peso to \nfloat, reduce Government expenditures, accelerate Mexico's \nprivatization program for state enterprises, conclude a wage-price \naccord with business and labor in order to contain inflation, and open \nthe Mexican financial sector to foreign investment. Despite these \nefforts, the crisis of confidence continued.\n  I for one am firmly convinced that President Clinton has made the \nright decision in proposing that the United States intervene in order \nto restore confidence in Mexico's economy. It makes good economic \nsense. It makes good foreign policy sense. The American people stand \neverything to gain from a stable and prosperous Mexico. And, much to \nlose from one that is in disorder and poor.\n  If we sit back and do nothing, millions of Mexicans will lose their \njobs. This will produce social and political tensions. It will also put \nadditional pressure on our borders as Mexicans seek alternative sources \nof employment in the United States, further heightening tensions over \nimmigration between the United States and Mexico.\n  To those who point to NAFTA as an explanation for the current \neconomic crisis facing Mexico, I would say that they could not be more \nwrong. If anything, it is because of NAFTA that there is a clear \nframework for resolving the current economic problems confronting \nMexico. Many Americans currently doing business in Mexico have \nindicated that they intend to stay the course, to remain engaged, to \nride \n[[Page S1972]] out the current fiscal storm. Why? Because they believe \nthat the Mexican economy is fundamentally strong. A principle reason \nthey hold that view is because NAFTA has ensured the continuity of \nfundamental market reforms that has made it possible for Americans to \nsell products and do business there. Were it not for NAFTA, the crisis \nin Mexico would be far deeper and far more protracted.\n  I commend Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich for \ntheir willingness to act in a bipartisan fashion to assist the \nPresident in moving the original guarantee proposal through the \nCongress. Regrettably they were unable to garner the necessary \nbipartisan support required to pass the legislation in a timely \nfashion. I think that the President was right in the judgment that the \nMexican economy could not withstand the battering of another several \nweeks of uncertainty over whether the United States assistance would be \nforthcoming.\n  Mr. President, we engage in vigorous debate in this body day in and \nday out. Debate is clearly an integral part of the legislative process. \nHowever, from time to time, an issue comes before the Congress that is \nso important and so sensitive that it mandates that partisan politics \nbe set aside and that we come together in support of the President. I \nbelieve that the situation in Mexico is just such an issue.\n  Mexico and the United States have had a long and enduring friendship. \nWe share a 2,000-mile common border. We share a common commitment to \ndemocracy, liberty, and human freedom. We are partners in a global \neconomy that has inextricably linked our fates. For all of these \nreasons, United States' interests are served by helping Mexico at its \nmoment of need. I call upon all my colleagues to get behind the \nPresident in support of this effort--it is in the interest of all \nAmericans that this initiative succeed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1971-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            NATIONAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I was proud to cast my vote for the \nNational and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 when the conference \nreport came before the Senate for final approval last September. This \nwas important legislation intended to marshal the Nation's best \nresources--its citizens--to confront the many pressing problems facing \ncommunities across the country. The National Service Act, signed into \nlaw on September 21, 1993, has helped renew the ethic of civic \nresponsibility and the spirit of community service throughout the \nUnited States while also providing critical assistance in meeting vital \nhuman, educational, environmental, and public safety needs.\n  In light of this, I am troubled by recent statements by the House \nRepublican leadership expressing opposition to national service, \ndescribing it as gimmickry and coerced voluntarism. I would urge those \nwho put forward these views to look carefully at the new national \nservice program's centerpiece, AmeriCorps, a national network of local \nyouth service corps. Unlike previous volunteer-based programs, \nAmeriCorps is not one large Federal program, but a network of locally \ndeveloped and locally managed service corps which will give thousands \nof young people the kind of opportunity earlier generations had to \nserve their country and improve their own lives as well as those of \ntheir neighbors.\n  I am proud that my own State of Maryland has been a leader in the \narea of national service. The tremendous number of volunteer \norganizations across the State deserve credit for the enormous \ndifference that volunteers have made and continue to make in Maryland \neach and every day. Maryland has very deservedly been the recipient of \na number of first round AmeriCorps grants. I was privileged to be with \nthe President during the official kickoff of the AmeriCorps Program at \nAberdeen Proving Ground last September, the first campus selected under \nthe National Service Act as a cite for the National Civilian Community \nCorps [NCCC]. Using a converted barracks, the NCCC campus at Aberdeen \nhouses 250 young adults who work in 10-member teams on projects \nthroughout Maryland, the Northeast, and the Mid-Atlantic. The program \nemphasizes conservation of natural resources, public safety, and the \neducational and human needs of children and older Americans.\n  I was also privileged to meet earlier with members of Community Year \nin Montgomery County, Civic Works in Baltimore, and the Maryland \nConservation Corps to discuss their critical efforts to rehabilitate \nhousing for low-income families. More recently, my wife was able to \nvisit an AmeriCorps site at Frostburg State University in western \nMaryland. The local program, named Appalachian Service Through Action \nand Resources or A STAR, provides many types of assistance in areas \ninvolving social service and the environment. Participants perform \nduties as varied as coordinating environmental projects at Deep Creek \nLake, developing Victory Gardens in Garrett County, working with local \nHead Start programs in recruiting volunteers, providing independent \nliving assistance enlarging area food pantries, and establishing youth \nliteracy programs.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that national service, and those who \nparticipate in it represent the best of our Nation. AmeriCorps and \nother programs under the National Service Act of 1993 carry forward an \nidea rooted in the best traditions and values of America--the tradition \nof serving others, the value of taking personal responsibility for \nourselves and our communities, and the belief that to whom much is \ngiven, much is expected. Through programs like AmeriCorps we are \nproviding our Naiton's young people with both an opportunity and an \nobligation. It asks them to put something back into the community while \nalso providing them an opportunity to develop skills which will serve \nthem well throughout their lives.\n  As I have indicated through examples in my own State, the national \nservice program is working. Nationwide, there are other examples--the \nexecutive director of the National Association of Police Organizations \nhas called AmeriCorps a huge boost in the arm for law enforcement; \nofficials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency say that \nparticipants in AmeriCorps have helped thousands of disaster victims \npick up the pieces of their lives; Habitat for Humanity says they could \nnot do their job without such individuals.\n  In my view, Mr. President, those who have answered the call to \nservice by participating in AmeriCorps and other national service \nopportunities are taking part in the oldest and best of America's \ntraditions--a spirit of service. I would ask those who have criticized \nlegislation which has furthered national service to look again at the \nimportant efforts underway which serve to produce stronger families and \nstronger communities, and to join me in commending those who are taking \npart in this important renewal of service to our Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1972-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1972-S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE RETIREMENT OF RICHARD COLLINS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on January 31, Richard Collins of the \nstaff of the Senate Appropriations Committee retired. Mr. Collins has \nserved the committee and the Senate for the past 20 years. It has been \nmy pleasure to have worked closely with Richard throughout that period. \nRichard served as the clerk and staff director of the two subcommittees \nI had the fortune to chair in the 1980's and 1990's, Foreign Operations \nand Defense.\n  In each of these positions Richard has served me and the Senate \nprofessionally and faithfully. I will miss his knowledge and counsel in \nthe days and years ahead. I can take some solace knowing that Richard \nplans to remain in the Washington, DC, area. And, I know we shall call \nupon him often to provide the type of guidance that we have counted \nupon for the past 20 years.\n  Last Thursday night, the friends of Richard Collins gathered to wish \nhim a farewell and happy retirement. On that occasion, Richard spoke \neloquently about his career in the Senate, his many and varied \nexperiences, and what it meant to him to be a staff member for this \nbody. He spoke of his affection and reverence for the institution, the \nrelationship between Members and their staff and the importance of \nstaff in the operation of the Senate. I know that many of my colleagues \nwere in attendance that evening and had the good fortune to hear this \ngentleman's farewell remarks, but I believe the \n[[Page S1973]] words and thoughts should be shared with all my \ncolleagues. Therefore, today I have risen to place Mr. Collins' address \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, there are some 5,000 congressional staff members \nserving the House and Senate. They are bright, hard working, and \nvirtuous. Richard Collins has been one of the finest for many years. \nThe Senate will miss him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Richard Collins' address be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Farewell My Friends\n\n       My friends, I am pleased and honored that all of you have \n     come here to share in this celebration, this farewell. As you \n     may well understand, in the twilight of my career in the \n     Senate, I am tempted to delay the end of the day, to speak at \n     length and to try to reach each of you with a shared memory, \n     a common experience, a touch of friendship.\n       I will not do that now; it does not seem necessary. The \n     memories will linger, and try to as we might, our experiences \n     can never be relived as fully as we would wish (but we have \n     had them); and, in any event, you know, already, that you are \n     my friends. I will take but a brief moment, then, to burnish \n     those memories and to express my deep appreciation to you and \n     to those with whom and for whom I have worked.\n       First, I will say that I yield to no one in my love and \n     respect for the institution that I have tried to serve for \n     the past two decades. In my time here I have learned that the \n     Senate--the Congress--is, indeed, a reflection of the \n     American people. Now and then there may be a whiff of \n     scandal, of human frailty, but I think of greater importance \n     and of more lasting significance is the courage and heroism \n     of those who rise every day and strive to do what is right \n     for America and her people. I, and you, each of you, have \n     been privileged to be a part of that. For this, we should be \n     eternally grateful.\n       This is no easy task, this coping with daily life. Chekhov \n     said, ``Any idiot can face a crisis--it's this day-to-day \n     living that wears you out.'' He may have had something there.\n       It's true, as I have contemplated my retirement and the \n     onset of a new career, I have asked myself, do you have the \n     energy and resolve to start again?\n       Ubetcha!\n       I find myself remembering the advice of the American \n     philosopher and baseball player, Leroy Robert Paige. Among \n     the sayings of the great ``Satchel'' Paige perhaps the best \n     known is, ``Don't look back. Something might be gaining on \n     you.'' My favorite, however, is his dismissal of those who \n     put too much weight of the chronology of age. He said, ``How \n     old would you be, if your didn't know how old that you was?''\n       I am not worn out nor weary; I know that I will age, but I \n     am not going to grow old. I look forward to new challenges \n     and I will seek new ways to serve. I intend to set sail \n     again.\n       I am deeply, profoundly, honored to have known and worked \n     with Senator Inouye, Senator Hatfield, Senator Stevens, and \n     Senator Byrd--all my chairmen, all my leaders, all my \n     mentors, and friends.\n       There are many others, some of whom are still in the Senate \n     and some of whom are gone. I remember them all. John Stennis, \n     Lawton Chiles, Jake Garn, Tom Eagleton, Malcolm Wallop--so \n     many more who are no longer in the Senate. Barbara Mikulski, \n     Chris Dodd, Joe Lieberman, Don Nickles, Pete Dominici, Judge \n     Heflin, and many others who still serve.\n       I have so many special memories--few have listened to the \n     hopes of Peace Corps volunteers in the distant reaches of \n     Africa as they spoke of bringing water for the first time to \n     humble villages; few have met and wept for the children in \n     refugee camps on the Cambodian border; few have stood with \n     Senators Inouye and Stevens and Nunn and Warner in the desert \n     of Saudi Arabia and listened to the proud declarations of our \n     soldiers who accepted and fulfilled America's responsibility \n     in the world--few have been shot down in a helicopter over \n     Central America with Bennett Johnston and lived to hear him \n     tell the tale--both harrowing experiences, I assure you.\n       I have done these things. I have seen much. I have spent \n     the night in palaces and in truck stops. I have slept under \n     the sea and on the desert. I have been with kings and \n     vagabonds.\n       In my career, I traveled widely and learned a great deal--\n     how precious our democracy is, how much we are linked with \n     the world, how freedom and justice and human rights are \n     indivisible. John Donne was right when he wrote, ``No man is \n     an island *** any man's death diminishes me, because I am \n     involved in mankind.'' I believe my experiences, my travel to \n     foreign lands and in strange cultures, seasoned my academic \n     learning and enabled me to bring prudent judgment to my work \n     in the Senate. I believe the same is true for Senators. \n     Foreign travel, exposure to other cultures and other \n     governments should not be ridiculed; it ought to be required \n     of those who would seek to make America's way in the world.\n       Over the years, I learned from the humility and courage of \n     others. I remember the resolve of Robert Byrd when he quoted, \n     not Shakespeare, not a history of the English people, but \n     William Ernest Henley's poem ``Invictus.''\n\n     In the fell clutch of circumstance\n       I have not winced nor cried aloud.\n     Under the bludgeoning of chance\n       My head is bloody, but unbowed.\n\n       Chairman Byrd read that poem on the floor the day after the \n     Democrats lost control of the Senate in 1980. He inspired us \n     to carry on.\n       I remember the grace and charity of Chairman Hatfield, when \n     he called all of the appropriations staff together after that \n     election and thanked us--winners and losers--for the work we \n     had done and would still do. We felt like soldiers at \n     Gettysburg listening to Lincoln as he praised the sacrifices \n     of men on both sides of that terrible battle.\n       Throughout these 20 years and more, throughout it all, my \n     liege, foremost among those I have sought to serve, has been \n     Dan Inouye of Hawaii. He is a man of great courage and \n     integrity; a man who has suffered much, achieved much, and \n     has heard both the thunder of applause and the whisper of \n     unfair and unjust accusation--and he is a man who has always \n     risen to renew his service to his country, to the Senate, and \n     to the people of Hawaii.\n       Some of you know of my recent match with prostate cancer--\n     it's OK now, all is well. But, let me say that the example of \n     Dan Inouye, this man of strength and courage was the compass \n     by which I guided my behavior as I went through that \n     difficult passage. No honor has ever meant as much to me as \n     hearing him call me friend.\n       Well now, Senator Inouye once told me about the zori mochi. \n     He said, in ancient Japan, when the Emperor went out for an \n     evening, among his retinue was one man who sounded a gong to \n     alert others that the Emperor was coming. Another carried a \n     latern to light the way. The lowliest of all was the zori \n     mochi whose responsibility--when the Emperior removed his \n     sandals to enter a household--was to clutch them to his \n     breast to keep them warm for the Emperor's return. His sole \n     object in life was the comfort of the Emperor. The story was \n     not lost on me.\n       Another man, from whom I also learned a great deal, \n     expressed this concept a little more directly. Bill Jordan \n     once told me, ``Collins I brought you here to hold the ladder \n     steady while I climb to success; if I ever catch you with \n     your foot on the bottom rung * * *'' Well, I don't think he \n     meant it that strongly, but as someone once remarked, the \n     difference between Bill and Richard is that sometimes when \n     he's kidding, Richard's kidding.\n       Many, many others have taught me along the way:\n       Senator Stevens: ``There is no education in the second kick \n     of a mule.''\n       Senator Chiles: (Explaining why, during a late night \n     session, he supported a favored colleague on what I regarded \n     as a dumb amendment) ``Richard, sometimes you have to bet on \n     the jockeys and not the horses.''\n       And then there is another wise man, who shall remain \n     anonymous, who once told me: ``It is easier to get \n     forgiveness, than it is to get permission.'' (Libby and \n     Julia, you can forget that.)\n       I carried these expressions and others with me throughout \n     my Senate career as though they were amulets in a medicine \n     bag to be pulled out as needed and rubbed for luck or to ward \n     off evil. I've used them with many of you, sometimes--often--\n     not giving credit to those who originated them.\n       Now, I have spoken about the legendary zori mochi and about \n     service to Senators and the Senate and believe me I do trust \n     in and have followed that ethic. My colleagues and I adhere \n     to the ethic that service to Senators and to the Senate is \n     our purpose in being here. We are proud to be on the staff of \n     the United States Senate.\n       Pat Leahy is fond of saying that Senators are merely a \n     constitutional impediment to the full authority of staff. I \n     know he's kidding. I am certain he would agree that staff are \n     important. I think they are essential to the operation of the \n     Senate.\n       It happens that some people attribute all success, all good \n     works to Senators alone. I do not fully agree. Perhaps the \n     best way to explain my view is to recall a story my \n     grandfather--a swamp Yankee farmer from Connecticut--once \n     told me. His name was Everett Thompson. One day he was out in \n     one of his fields, tilling the soil. The rock walls which \n     surrounded the land which had been cleared of trees and stone \n     gave testimony to the hard work he had put into the farm. On \n     this day, a circuit preacher came riding up, saw my \n     grandfather and said, ``Why Mister Thompson, this is a \n     wonderful farm which the Lord and you have made.'' My \n     grandfather took out his large red farmer's handkerchief, \n     wiped his brow, and said, ``Maybe so, but you should have \n     seen it when the Lord had it by himself.''\n       I do think staff is important. I think the sacrifices which \n     we ask of the young who come to work here places a great \n     responsibility on us, Senators and senior staff alike, to \n     ensure that their dedication to the principles of democracy \n     and representative government is nourished and strengthened. \n     There will be partisan battles, to be sure. But we must also \n     remind them, by our example and by our counsel, of the \n     greatness of this institution.\n       That greatness, I fear, is sometimes lost in the thickets \n     of procedure. Reconciliation has in recent years come to \n     denote that onerous process by which the faulty spending \n     estimates of the budget committees are matched to the faulty \n     revenue estimates of the CBO. \n     [[Page S1974]] To me, another kind of reconciliation has \n     always been the wonder of this place. How to effect peaceful \n     social change? How to reconcile the views of a Paul Wellstone \n     with those of a John McCain, giving each a fair hearing and \n     then moving to decide what is best for democracy, best for \n     America. That is the Senate I revere.\n       It is of surpassing importance that the Senate recruit, \n     reward, and recognize its staff. We must have the best; we \n     must pay them competitive wages; we must acknowledge their \n     contribution to the legislative process.\n       All of this talk about limited terms--if they are enacted, \n     power will flow to the staff as the source of memory and \n     knowledge; if staff is cut too far; special interest groups \n     will become the source of information and power. We can and \n     should reduce staff; but we must be careful; they have become \n     a key part of the process.\n       I am not too worried about all of this. Staff has been a \n     part of Government for thousands of years. I know, because \n     just the other day I read in the Bible, ``And Joseph leaned \n     on his staff, and he died.''\n       My friends, I have gone on too long. I could have spared \n     you all of this by reading a few lines of poetry. I have \n     found poetry--the distillation of human emotion and \n     experience--to be a great source of comfort, insight, and \n     inspiration over the years. The poem which best sums up who I \n     am--at this stage in my life--is Tennyson's ``Ulysses.'' I \n     will leave you with a few fragments from this great work.\n\n     Much have I seen and known; cities of men\n     And manners, climates, councils, governments * * *\n\n     I am a part of all that I have met;\n     Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough\n     Gleems that untravelled world, whose margin fades\n     For ever and for ever when I move.\n\n     How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\n     To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!\n\n     Some work of noble note, may yet be done\n\n     Tis not too late to seek a newer world\n\n     Though much is taken, much abides; and though\n     We are not now that strength which in old days\n     Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;\n     One equal temper of heroic hearts,\n     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will\n     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n\n       Thank you my friends. Thank you for your friendship, your \n     counsel, your encouragement. Thank you for your work, which \n     made mine worthy.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1972-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nTHE RETIREMENT OF PHILIP A. HOLMAN, DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF POLICY \n           AND ANALYSIS IN THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a most \ndistinguished public servant who is retiring this month after nearly 33 \nyears of Federal service. Phil Holman, the Director of the Division of \nPolicy and Analysis in the Office of Refugee Resettlement is a man that \nI and my fine staff on the Immigration Subcommittee have worked with \nfor many years.\n  Phil Holman joined the Cuban Refugees Program in 1962, shortly after \nit was established by President Kennedy. He spent virtually his entire \nFederal career in the refugee resettlement program: from the early \n1960's Cuban refugee flow beginnings to the 1975 Indochinese Refugee \nAssistance Program to the current domestic program established under \nthe Refugee Act of 1980. Phil Holman's career has certainly come full \ncircle as we struggle today with the current Cuban migration crisis.\n  Millions of refugees admitted to the United States in the past 33 \nyears have had their new lives touched in some way by Phil Holman's \nwork. His decades of service are deeply appreciated, and I would urge \nmy colleagues to join me in expressing our gratitude for a fine job \nwell done.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1974-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1974-S1975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               FATHER WILLIAM CUNNINGHAM AND FOCUS: HOPE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, on which I serve, held 3 days of hearings on reforming the \nFederal Government's system of job training programs.\n  Over the course of the hearings, the committee heard testimony from a \nwide array of interested parties: Clients of training programs; experts \nfrom academia and think tanks; businessmen, organized labor, and the \nGeneral Accounting Office. Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson appeared and \ntestified about the laboratory the various States provide, where some \nof the most innovative reform ideas are already at work. In addition, \nSecretary of Labor Robert Reich and OMB Director Alice Rivlin presented \nthe administration's perspective on what shape reform of the system \nshould take.\n  However, this Senator thought the most interesting testimony came \nfrom the last panel to appear on the hearing's final day. Chairman \nKassebaum wished to supplement the testimony of the usual array of \nwitnesses with perhaps less conventional viewpoints. She selected \nindividuals from around the country who have personally been involved \nin starting and administering innovative, community-based training and \neducation programs. One of the individuals she invited to participate \nwas Father Bill Cunningham, the executive director of the Focus: Hope \nProgram in Detroit, MI.\n  Focus: Hope and Father Cunningham are certainly not strangers to the \nLabor Committee. Just last September, Father Cunningham appeared before \nthe Labor Committee to testify about the Focus: Hope Program and its \nwork in educating and training people. It is a testament to his \ndedication and success that Father Cunningham would be invited to \ntestify by both Democrats and Republicans when each had control of the \nLabor Committee.\n  Mr. President, Focus: Hope is often described as unorthodox in its \nmethodology. It is certainly unorthodox in one respect: Unlike the vast \nmajority of Federal job training programs, Focus: Hope actually works. \nIt produces real and lasting results; of course, that might seem \nunorthodox in this town, which sometimes appears immune to outrage over \nwasted tax dollars and obsolete or ineffectual social programs.\n  Let me offer a glimpse of the mindset which makes ``Focus: Hope so \nunique and--I believe--so successful. An article appearing in the March \n1994 issue of ``Ward's Auto World'' noted that father Cunningham saw \nFocus: Hope's mission this way:\n\n       Focus: Hope remains at its core a civil rights \n     organization, but [father Cunningham] cites [their] machinist \n     training effort as simply a new approach. Father Cunningham \n     says of 200 machine shops that hired graduates from the \n     [Focus: Hope] machinists institute, all except two were \n     hiring their first African-American or woman. We could have \n     been suing them, he shrugs.\n\n  Mr. President, while some groups are obsessed with talking about \nexpanding opportunities, Father Cunningham's approach is a breath of \nfresh air. He believes the best method for truly empowering people is \nto educate them, teach them a marketable skill, develop in them \nresponsibility, motivation, and maturity--not simply to file a lawsuit \non their behalf.\n  For the benefit of any of my colleagues who are not familiar with \nfather Cunningham's work, let me offer a few quotes from his testimony:\n\n       I would emphasize advanced job skills representing new \n     technologies, future technologies. In that vein, I would \n     require that defense and commerce play a larger role in \n     establishing national skills priorities * * * We must \n     understand and balance the difference between providing jobs \n     for the people--and everybody's hearts ought to be in\n      that--and keep attention on providing capable and skilled \n     persons for job demands. That is an entirely different \n     picture.\n       The industry was changing so rapidly that the machinist of \n     1981 was completely inadequate for the machine tools of 1988, \n     the computer and numerically controlled machines. * * * In \n     1993, the state of the art is already catapulting so rapidly \n     in technology that--well, I will just give you one figure. A \n     lathe in 1981 with 3,000 RPM is replaced by Ingersol, by a \n     machining center, with 60,000 RPM.\n       The universities are still dealing with the engineering \n     code of 1970. So what we are doing is very expensively \n     putting all these kids through college, getting them \n     engineering degrees, and then when they go to work for Ford \n     Motor Co., they have to spend another 6 years training them.\n\n  Finally, let me highlight one observation that was agreed to by \neveryone on Father Cunningham's panel. Chairman Kassebaum inquired \nabout the efficacy of requiring people to obtain employment first \nbefore receiving a voucher for further job training. It was noted that \noften the most effective training and education programs are those in \nwhich people both work and go to school either for education or to \nlearn a particular skill. On that point, Father Cunningham offered his \ninsight based on his work at Focus: Hope:\n\n       I am in total agreement with my colleagues up here. The \n     masters program we \n     [[Page S1975]] have in engineering at Focus: Hope requires a \n     40-hour workweek, and that is not work-study. It is not work-\n     study * * *. The work they do and the skills they are \n     developing dictate the knowledge they need to draw down. And \n     if the university cannot provide that knowledge, the \n     university is irrelevant. So the knowledge drawdown \n     assimilates knowledge at, as I said earlier, geometric \n     proportions. So the young people there are learning four and\n      five and six times faster than the normal engineering \n     candidate at a major university, simply because they are \n     seeing the relevance of what they are learning in terms of \n     the demands of the workplace.\n\n  Mr. President, judging by the testimony provided to the committee \nduring the 3 days of the hearing, Focus: Hope is precisely the type of \nprogram we should be attempting to replicate around the country. \nHowever, the lesson is not that the Government should dictate that all \nrecipients of Federal dollars exactly mirror Focus: Hope in concept and \ndesign, but that the Government seek out programs with a proven track \nrecord of success and a proven base of support in their community or \nregion.\n  This Senator believes the best method for accomplishing this is to \nget the money into the hands of State and local officials who have a \nbetter idea as to which programs are working and where our limited \nresources are best utilized, that certainly has been the experience in \nmy State of Michigan, where our citizens have had tremendous success \nunder the leadership of Gov. John Engler, in forging a statewide \npartnership to enact real reform in such areas as job training and \nwelfare.\n  Once again, let me congratulate Father Cunningham on his appearance \nbefore the Senate's Labor and Human Resources Committee and commend him \nfor his fine work at Focus: Hope. It is individuals like Father \nCunningham and organizations like Focus: Hope which have made this \ncountry great and stand to make a positive difference in our future. We \nwould be wise to offer them our assistance and follow their example.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1974-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Averaged out, every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica owes a share of this massive debt, and that per capita share is \n$18,262.11.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1975-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1975-S1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE CLINTON BAILOUT OF MEXICO\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, our offices in Washington and North \nCarolina have been inundated with calls protesting President Clinton's \ndecision to bypass Congress and, more importantly, Mr. Clinton's \nwillingness to ignore the emphatic will of the American people. In any \nevent, that is what Mr. Clinton has done with his unilateral $20 \nbillion bailout of Mexico.\n  I have opposed this scheme from the very beginning because it will do \nnothing to remedy Mexico's internal problem and it is unfair to \nAmerican taxpayers. Last week, I presided over in-depth hearings by the \nForeign Relations Committee. Witness after witness warned the President \nnot to violate the will of the American people in this matter.\n  Mr. President, if this were as important as the President would have \nus believe, then Congress should debate the bailout and vote on it, up \nor down, for or against. Before the taxpayers' money is put at risk, \nhowever, the people being forced to foot the bill should have a say. \nThe $20 billion in question is an enormous amount of money. It is more \nthan the annual budget of the State of North Carolina; it is larger \nthan the annual budgets of 16 of the 18 States represented on the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  I am not convinced that refusal to bailout Mexico would be the \ndisaster that the administration has described. Many topflight \neconomists say the same. The Mexican people are already suffering, a \ncondition that will improve only with solid political and economic \nreform, not as the result of a bailout.\n  Mr. President, on several occasions between 1980 and 1994, Mexico \nused dollars drawn from a special line of credit at the United States \nTreasury. The United States has also aided Mexico with bridge loans, \nbank credits, currency swaps, and guarantees, all to shore up \nconfidence in Mexico. Assistance from Uncle Sam usually has come right \naround election time in Mexico. Credit lines from the United States and \nother countries, amounting to as much as $12 billion, were negotiated \ntwice in the past 15 months alone.\n  With the exception of last week's hearings narrowly focused on the \npeso crisis, the Senate has not held hearings on the situation in \nMexico since 1986. Since the President is obviously willing to risk \nsaddling the taxpayers with $20 billion of debt, I believe Congress has \na fundamental obligation to examine carefully the political and \neconomic situation in Mexico and the administration's policy toward \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, the Mexican Government has a credibility gap, and for \nobvious reasons. Just one example: There are some 2,000 United States \nclaimants protesting Mexico's refusal to pay about $19 billion owed \nunder a little-known 1941 treaty--the Treaty on Final Settlement of \nCertain Claims--which provided for settlement of longstanding disputed \nproperty claims. The United States fully met its obligations by 1948, \nbut Mexico broke its promise. The Mexicans signed the treaty on the \ndotted line knowing full well that it was never intended that Mexico \nwould compensate these Americans. To this day, not a dime nor a peso \nhas ever been paid to an American claimant.\n  Mexico doesn't hesitate to break its promises to the United States, \nmuch less to violate United States policies. For example: Mexico is \ngiving aid and comfort to Fidel Castro by investing in Cuba's economy, \nnotwithstanding the United States trade embargo. According to Cuba \nReport, published by the Miami Herald, the Mexicans are financing \nCuba's telephone company to the tune of $1.5 billion, And, by the way, \nthe Cuban phone company is a confiscated United States business. Also, \na Mexican-Cuba joint venture will invest $100 million in a Cuban oil \nrefinery. The dominant member of this venture will be Pemex, the \nMexican's Government-owned oil company.\n  The Mexican Foreign Minister was quoted by the January 27 Financial \nTimes as saying that ``the typical U.S. politician is not necessarily \nsomeone who is very conscious of international subjects. Even supposing \nthey know where Mexico is * * * they lack information about what \nhappens in Mexico.''\n  Mr. President, this is the same fellow who came to Washington with an \noutstretched hand pleading for cash.\n  Mexico's international debt stands at $180 billion. According to the \nUnited States Treasury Department's own estimate, the Mexican debt \ncoming due in 1995 alone--both public and\n private sector debt--is more than $80 billion. What Mexico sorely \nneeds is to get at the root causes of its problems so that it will \ncease to require emergency intervention by the United States taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, Mexican President Zedillo has a tough road to travel: \nHe must solve the short term economic crisis; provide for a long-term \neconomic stability; end a civil uprising; address corruption; stop drug \ntrafficking, and initiate political reforms. Properly addressing these \nissues is what's needed to shore-up investor confidence.\n  Mexico would be better off letting the markets set the value of the \npeso and Mexican stocks and bonds. The U.S. Government has no business \nbailing-out private or public investors who lose money on highly \nspeculative investments.\n  In testimony last week before the Foreign Relations Committee, \nexperts \n[[Page S1976]] recommended that Mexico eliminate its wage and price \ncontrols; reform its banking industry; increase the pace of \nprivatization and further open their oil company and other State-\ncontrolled entities to foreign investment, and then tighten its fiscal \nand monetary policies.\n  A bailout of Mexico is bad policy. It may provide some illusory short \nterm relief, but it fails to address the root causes of Mexico's woes. \nWe've been told that the imposition of any conditions, such as: First, \ndrug trafficking controls; second, extradition of Mexican citizens \ninvolved in United States crimes, and third, resolution of all \noutstanding claims against Mexico by United States citizens--these \nconditions are too politically sensitive for the Mexicans. It might \nhurt somebody's feelings. But, I for one, wonder why the Mexicans seek \nUnited States financial aid with one hand, while they sustain Fidel \nCastro's brutal dictatorship with the other.\n  It boils down to this, Mr. President: When an American taxpayer gets \na loan from his local bank to buy a house, the property is security for \nthe loan, as Uncle Sam doesn't cosign the note. Yet, that is exactly \nwhat Mr. Clinton is proposing, namely that the United States sign the \n$20 billion note.\n  In my judgment, the United States and the Mexican Governments are \nperpetuating an unhealthy situation in which Mexico has grown dependent \non us to fix its financial problems. It's bad for Mexico and it's \nunfair to the American taxpayers. This is the seventh time since 1982 \nthat the United States taxpayers have bailed-out Mexicans and have \nrewarded wealthy bankers who have made bad loans.\n  The American taxpayers should not be placed at risk in bailing-out \nWall Street bankers and speculators, particularly since the Federal \nGovernment has already run up a 4 trillion, 800 billion dollar debt \nwhich our grandchildren and their grandchildren will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, on January 18, I sent the administration 35 questions \nabout the proposed bailout. I ask unanimous consent that the responses, \nwhich I received 8 days later, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Questions and Answers\n\n       Question 1. Is the Secretary of the Treasury prepared to \n     recommend to the President that he explain, in writing, to \n     the U.S. Congress the urgency and necessity of authorizing \n     $40 billion in loan guarantees to Mexico? If so, has such a \n     recommendation been made or when can it be expected?\n       Answer. The President addressed the urgency and necessity \n     of obtaining legislation authorizing a loan guarantee \n     facility in his January 18 remarks at the Treasury Department \n     and in the State of the Union. And he wrote to the bipartisan \n     leadership on January 19.\n       Question 2. What specific conditions will the United States \n     require of the Government of Mexico in order to ensure that \n     we are repaid?\n       Answer. Mexico will pay substantial fees upfront to more \n     than cover scoring costs.\n       Mexico will provide backing in the form of proceeds from \n     oil exports in the event it can't meet its obligations.\n       Mexico will be required to agree to strong economic \n     conditions and comply with them during the period that the \n     guarantees are made available.\n       These conditions will focus on the monetary and fiscal \n     policies necessary to restore growth and thereby generate \n     resources to repay its obligations.\n       We will prepare and transmit to Congress reports at least \n     quarterly on Mexico's compliance with the conditions as set \n     out in the legislation and elaborated in consultations with \n     Mexican officials.\n       Question 3. What specific economic structural adjustments \n     will the United States require of Mexico?\n       Answer. Mexico has implemented a number of structural \n     changes in its economy over the past decade, notably the \n     liberalization of trade restrictions, the privatization of \n     state-owned enterprises, the establishment of an independent \n     central bank, and the restoration of some balance to public \n     finances. Mexico has announced its intention to undertake \n     further structural changes, including further privatization \n     steps. Progress in making these reforms will be taken into \n     account in extending the guarantees.\n       Question 4. Will each and every condition be made public? \n     If not, will Members of Congress be able to obtain \n     information on those conditions.\n       Answer. The legislation will itself stipulate many \n     conditions. Conditions established in the agreement \n     negotiated between the U.S. government and Mexico prior to \n     the issue of guarantees will be provided to Congress if \n     appropriate on a confidential basis.\n       We also intend to prepare and transmit to Congress reports \n     at least quarterly on Mexico's compliance with the conditions \n     as set out in the legislation and elaborated in consultations \n     with Mexican officials.\n       Question 5. How was the $40 billion figure arrived at as \n     the appropriate amount to deal with the current situation?\n       Answer. A substantial amount of Mexican debt will mature \n     over the next 12 to 18 months. This includes public and \n     private external debt as well as the dollar-indexed \n     Tesobonos. We believe that $40 billion provides a reasonable \n     safety net to be used to refinance maturing debt that is not \n     being rolled over. The amount of $40 billion will convince \n     the market that Mexico will have more than adequate resources \n     to meet what we view as a short-term liquidity problem.\n       Question 6. Will the $40 billion in guarantees cover both \n     principal and interest?\n       Answer. Under the guarantee arrangement with Mexico, the \n     coverage will be up to 100% of principal and interest.\n       There are a number of U.S. Government guarantee programs \n     which provide full coverage of principal and interest. These \n     include the Israeli guarantees administered by USAID.\n       We will be charging the Mexicans substantial fees for this \n     full guarantee coverage. These fees will move than cover the \n     budget costs of the program, effectively reduce the exposure \n     of the United States Government, and encourage the Mexicans \n     to limit the use and coverage of the guarantees.\n       Question 7. What does the Treasury calculate to be the \n     total risk to the United States should the Government of \n     Mexico default?\n       Answer. We think the risks to U.S. taxpayers are small even \n     if Mexico defaults.\n       Mexico will pay substantial fees upfront to more than cover \n     scoring costs.\n       Mexico will provide backing in the form of proceeds from \n     oil exports in the event it can't meet its obligations.\n       Mexico will be required to agree to substantial economic \n     conditions and comply with them during the period that the \n     guarantees are made available.\n       These conditions will be designed to ensure that these \n     proceeds of the guarantee are used prudently.\n       Question 8. Will an authorization of $40 billion do the job \n     of stabilizing the situation? Is this the last time the \n     Administration will need to come back to Congress for loan \n     guarantees for Mexico?\n       Answer. We believe $40 billion will be sufficient to \n     restore stability, and in fact, we think it is highly \n     unlikely that Mexico would use the entire $40 billion of \n     guarantee authority.\n       Mexico has a liquidity problem that can be overcome in a \n     relatively short period of time. We anticipate that Mexico \n     will be able to return to private capital markets and borrow \n     in its own name within a relatively short period of time.\n       With these guarantees and an appropriate economic program, \n     we do not anticipate a need to return to Congress to request \n     additional guarantee authority.\n       Question 9. In Administration briefings to Congress on the \n     peso crisis, U.S. officials have stated that economic \n     policies and decisions made by former Mexican President \n     Salinas are directly responsible for the current crisis. \n     Given this, does the Administration continue to support \n     President Salinas to head the World Trade Organization?\n       Answer. The United States supports the candidacy of former \n     President Salinas to head the World Trade Organization. As \n     President of Mexico, Salinas led his country through a \n     successful process of economic reform and trade \n     liberalization. He also represents a bridge between the \n     developing world and the industrialized nations.\n       The issue of whether the Mexican government should have \n     devalued or not is a highly technical issue where economists \n     disagree. The decision not to devalue does not disqualify \n     former President Salinas. We continue to believe he is the \n     best candidate for the job and is well-qualified to take on \n     the challenges facing the global trading system.\n       Question 10. Please describe in detail all fees that will \n     be incurred by the Government of Mexico in order to secure \n     the guarantee. What will be the amount charged for each fee \n     category? How is the fee amount determined?\n       Answer. The fee will have three components: commitment \n     fees, basic fees, and supplemental fees.\n       The commitment fee will be set as a % of total guaranteed \n     authority.\n       The basic fee will be set to correspond to the U.S. budget \n     scoring cost as determined by OMB and CBO under the current \n     scoring system. It will be paid when each guarantee is \n     issued.\n       The supplemental fee will be set by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to ensure that Mexico return to private capital \n     markets as soon as possible.\n       These fees will more than offset any estimated budget costs \n     to the United States Government.\n       Question 11. Will the Government of Mexico be able to \n     borrow against the loan guarantees in order to pay the fees \n     mandated in any stabilization program?\n       Answer. Yes.\n       [[Page S1977]] Question 12. What amount of collateral does \n     the Treasury Department believe is sufficient to protect \n     against the risk should the loan guarantees be used by the \n     Government of Mexico? How was the amount of the collateral \n     determined?\n       Answer. Treasury and Mexico will establish the oil proceeds \n     facility to provide protection for the total potential U.S. \n     exposure under the guarantee program--dollar for dollar.\n       Question 16. What steps has President Zedillo taken to \n     alleviate the crisis since the situation began in December?\n       Answer. The initial action taken by President Zedillo was \n     to renegotiate the PACTO, a tripartite (government, business, \n     and labor) agreement that sets economic objectives, including \n     wage increases, inflation and economic growth.\n       The Mexican Government also announced plans to reduce the \n     growth of credit issued by the development banks and to \n     accelerate the privatization program.\n       The Mexican Government then requested the U.S. and Canada \n     to activate the swaps agreed to under the North American \n     Framework Agreement of April 26, 1995.\n       As the market reaction indicated a lack of confidence in \n     the Mexican economic program this program was strengthened. \n     On January 2, President Zedillo announced additional measures \n     aimed at restoring better economic balance. These include \n     plans to reduce government budget expenditures, to privatize \n     still more government-owned facilities. And to conduct a more \n     stringent monetary policy.\n       At this time, the establishment of a $18 billion facility \n     was announced. This included $9 billion from the United \n     States split equally between the Treasury and the Federal \n     Reserve, and $1.5 billion from the Bank of Canada, $5 billion \n     from a consortium of central banks organized under the \n     auspices of the Bank for International Settlements, and $3 \n     billion from a group of private banks.\n       The Mexican Government also announced its intention to \n     negotiate a Stand-by agreement with the International \n     Monetary Fund. Negotiations are ongoing regarding the \n     stabilization measures that Mexico will put in place under \n     this agreement.\n       Question 17. What steps did the United States Government \n     take in December to stabilize the peso?\n       Answer. The United States activated its $6 billion swap \n     facility and then temporarily increased it to $9 billion. We \n     did not intervene in the foreign exchange market, nor were \n     there any drawings on our swap facility during December.\n       In early January, the Mexican government announced that it \n     had made initial drawings from the Treasury and Federal \n     Reserve swap facilities.\n       Question 18. What is the Treasury Department's position as \n     to requiring, as part of a stabilization package, a \n     commitment by the Government of Mexico to create a currency \n     board or some other mechanism that will guarantee the \n     independence of the monetary authority?\n       Answer. The most important thing for Mexico to do in the \n     short-term is to put in place tight, effective controls on \n     credit and money. There are lots of ways to do this, and we \n     are looking at the alternatives with the Mexican authorities \n     and the IMF.\n       Currency boards have worked well in certain circumstances, \n     such as in Hong Kong. But they are controversial, and they \n     cannot substitute for the need to put in place a credible and \n     effective economic program. In addition, they require a \n     substantial cushion of reserves, which Mexico now lacks.\n       Question 19. What is the current amount (in dollars) of \n     both official and commercial debt that Mexico owes the United \n     States or U.S. institutions?\n       Answer. As of September 1994, reported U.S. private and \n     public debt claims on Mexico total $44 billion. These \n     include: claims on Mexico of U.S. based banks of $21 billion, \n     short-term claims held by U.S. non-banks of $4 billion, U.S. \n     holdings of Mexican bonds of $18 billion, and U.S. official \n     agencies' credits of $1 billion. (These figures do not \n     include U.S. holdings of stocks or U.S. direct investment, \n     which are substantial.)\n       Question 20. What is the current amount (in dollars) of \n     Mexico's international reserves?\n       Answer. As of January 6, the Banco de Mexico's \n     international reserves were $5,546 million.\n       Question 21. What is the amount, in dollars, of Mexico's \n     ``short-term obligations'' that are now coming due?\n       Answer. Mexico faces maturity obligations in 1995 totalling \n     approximately $81 billion. This sum includes both the \n     external debt of the public and private sector, as well as \n     public domestic debt obligations--Tesbonos--that are linked \n     to the peso value of the dollar.\n       Much of this debt will be rolled over in the normal course \n     of business. However, Mexico has been having a particularly \n     difficult time rolling over maturity Tesobonos. In addition, \n     some Mexican banks have had difficulty rolling over maturing \n     debt.\n       Question 22. What is the amount (in dollars) of gold that \n     Mexico either holds or has access to?\n       Answer. As of end-June, 1994, the gold holdings of the Bank \n     of Mexico were 425,000 Fine Troy Ounces. At $380 per ounce, \n     the value would be $161.5 million.\n       Question 23. What is the estimate of flight capital from \n     New Mexico over the past twelve months?\n       Answer. Flight capital is inherently difficult to measure. \n     The general consensus of economic experts on Mexico is that \n     Mexico's balance of payment from problem resulted more from \n     the drying up of foreign portfolio investment than capital \n     flight. According to the Federal Reserve, which uses World \n     Bank standard methodology, capital flight may have totaled \n     $8-$10 billion in 1994.\n       Question 24. What steps will the United States insist upon \n     to end flight capital?\n       Answer. The only enduring way is to restore confidence of \n     domestic and foreign investors in the economic policies and \n     exchange rate of Mexico. The measures that Mexico takes to \n     stabilize its economy--stringent monetary policies and \n     attractive real interest rates, are aimed at restoring \n     confidence.\n       Question 25. What specific assurances can the Treasury \n     Department give to the Congress that no loan guarantees \n     provided by the United States will be used to subsidize or \n     otherwise underwrite Mexican commercial transactions that \n     negatively impact on U.S. national interests, including \n     Mexican debt-for-equity swaps with Cuba?\n       Answer. The Government of Mexico has indicated that it is \n     prepared to make specific assurances that these loan \n     guarantees would not be used to subsidize or otherwise \n     underwrite the types of transactions with Cuba raised in the \n     above question.\n       Question 26. As the situation presently confronting Mexico \n     is also faced by other developing countries, is the \n     Administration prepared to propose similar stabilization \n     plans should other nations find themselves facing a situation \n     similar to that confronting Mexico?\n       Answer. Mexico is unique in terms of its strategic \n     importance to the U.S. The U.S. and Mexico share a 2,000 mile \n     border, rapidly growing trade and economic ties, and growing \n     prosperity. And, the crisis in Mexico presents a unique risk \n     of contagion to other emerging markets.\n       We will be exploring ways that international financial \n     institutions are prepared and can respond to similar \n     situations in the future.\n       Question 27. What other countries or international \n     institutions will be involved in providing financial support \n     to Mexico in response to the crisis? What specific steps are \n     being taken by the U.S. government to secure international \n     cooperation?\n       Answer. Canada is already providing about $1.5 billion \n     Canadian dollars (approx. U.S. $1 billion) in swap credits. \n     The central banks from other industrialized countries, under \n     the auspices of the Bank of International Settlements, are \n     arranging about $5 billion for Mexico.\n       The International Monetary Fund is arranging a sizable \n     credit in support of a program with Mexico. Mexico is \n     proceeding to negotiate with the World Bank and the Inter-\n     American Development Bank additional loans, which will \n     provide Mexico with a considerable amount of foreign exchange \n     this year.\n       We are now in the process of encouraging other countries to \n     join the effort.\n       Question 28. Has the Administration considered requiring \n     the Government of Mexico to make progress in solving and \n     bringing to justice those responsible for the recent \n     assassinations of prominent Mexican political candidates and \n     officials as a condition for authorizing loan guarantees?\n       Answer. In his inaugural address, President Zedillo said \n     that the Mexican people were not satisfied with the results \n     of the Government's inquiries into the killings of \n     presidential candidate Colosio, political party leader Ruiz \n     Massieu or Catholic Cardinal Posadas. He pledged that justice \n     will be served.\n       Zedillo instructed his Attorney General, a member of the \n     conservative opposition PAN party, to intensify efforts to \n     resolve these crimes. The Attorney General, in turn, \n     appointed a special prosecutor to investigate these cases. \n     The special prosecutor has already held public news \n     conferences to discuss the status of his inquiries.\n       In these circumstances, we consider that conditioning \n     authorization of loan guarantees on specific progress would \n     be inappropriate.\n       Question 29. How much does the Treasury Department estimate \n     U.S. companies/businesses have lost in Mexico since the \n     current situation began?\n       Answer. We have no reliable estimate on losses.\n       We have a substantial stake in Mexico, which has already \n     been adversely affected by the financial crisis.\n       There is $40 billion of exports at risk, which support \n     700,000 jobs.\n       The U.S. has $53.1 billion in foreign direct investment.\n       U.S. investors hold $36.5 billion in Mexican bonds and \n     equities.\n       Question 31. Will Mexican economic reform efforts and \n     austerity programs lead to a tighter monetary policy, higher \n     inflation, and high unemployment in Mexico? Has the Treasury \n     Department made projections as to the inflation and \n     unemployment rates in Mexico for 1995 and 1996?\n       Answer. The Mexican authorities have announced plans for \n     tightening marcoeconomic policy in 1995, and are in the \n     process of working with the IMF on a macroeconomics \n     stabilization program. These policy steps include a monetary \n     policy stance that will be considerably tighter in 1995 than \n     it was last year.\n       Inflation in Mexico--which was in single digits in 1994--is \n     expected to be considerably \n     [[Page S1978]] higher this year, reflecting increases in \n     prices of imports following the recent sharp depreciation \n     value in the peso. The tightening of policy, as well as the \n     international support program, is intended to keep a price-\n     wage spiral from getting underway and ultimately return \n     Mexico to a lower inflationary path.\n       The financial problems in Mexico can be expected to lead to \n     recession and higher unemployment in Mexico in the next year. \n     The Mexican authorities have taken steps to contain as much \n     as possible the wage pressures that are likely to be felt in \n     the aftermath of the peso depreciation. To the extent that \n     these efforts are successful, employment losses will be \n     reduced. The international support program, by averting a \n     protracted crisis and a potential collapse in Mexican \n     economic activity, should help minimize the rise in \n     unemployment associated with the nessary Mexican adjustment.\n       Treasury has not made projections for Mexican inflation and \n     unemployment for 1995 and 1996.\n       Question 32. Would higher inflation and higher interest \n     rates make it more difficult for Mexico to repay any loans \n     backed by U.S. loan guarantees? Would such economic \n     conditions increase the likelihood of default by Mexico?\n       Answer. Yes, higher inflation if sustained and especially \n     if accelerating, would impede the efficiency of the Mexican \n     economy and make it less attractive to foreign investors. \n     Both outcomes would undermine the peso and make it more \n     difficult for Mexico to service its external debt, including \n     that backed by U.S. loan guarantees.\n       The international support program is aimed at ensuring that \n     Mexican reforms continue in a stable macroeconomics setting. \n     The program will allow the Mexicans to make the necessary \n     adjustments with a lower inflation rate than otherwise would \n     be the case and in a political environment that would not \n     jeopardize their reforms. Restoration of a stable economic \n     and political environment will reduce the likelihood of \n     default by Mexico.\n       Question 33. As the Mexican economy contracts, what is the \n     Treasury Department's estimate as to the reduction in U.S. \n     exports to Mexico? And what will be the impact on U.S. \n     employment?\n       Answer. We have no precise number because the answer \n     depends on many factors which are unknown.\n       One that is particularly important is the length of any \n     decline because the growth gap compounds over time.\n       That is why restoring stability to the Mexican situation is \n     so important.\n       The U.S. exported over $40 billion in 1993 (estimated to \n     reach $50 billion in 1994.) representing 700,000 jobs.\n       Question 34. What is the Treasury Department's position on \n     requiring an economic stability assessment (e.g., inflation, \n     unemployment, current account balance ratios, ect.) for any \n     nation with which we are considering opening negotiations on \n     a trade agreement?\n       Answer. There would be no problem in compiling data. Such \n     information is widely available and would be easy to collect \n     in the context of considering trade agreements.\n       However, there is no common denominator for movements in \n     these indicators or the relation to benefits that the U.S. \n     derives from engaging in trade.\n       Our trading partners are diverse--in terms of economic \n     development, structure, and performance.\n       Question 35. What is the Treasury Department's assessment \n     as to whether there is a banking crisis looming in Mexico, as \n     some analysts have projected?\n       Answer. The banking system in Mexico has been adversely \n     affected by financial developments in Mexico in a number of \n     ways. Credit lines to Mexican banks have come under pressure, \n     making funding more difficult. The capital ratios for Mexican \n     banks are likely to have declined, since as a result of the \n     devaluation, the peso value of dollar-denominated assets has \n     risen, while the banks' capital remains unchanged in peso \n     terms. Finally, to the extent that recent developments have \n     increased the financial difficulties of some Mexican firms, \n     banks are likely to suffer from increased loan losses.\n       However, foreign banks will be given greater opportunities \n     to invest in the Mexican banking system, which should help \n     strengthen the banking system both in capital and management.\n       If the U.S. loan guarantee proposal for Mexico is approved, \n     it should help mitigate the risks to the Mexican banking \n     system.\n                    backing for the u.s. guarantees\n\n       The United States guarantees will be backed in two ways by \n     Mexico.\n       First, the Mexican commitments to the United States will be \n     backed by the full faith and credit of the Mexican \n     Government. This is a legal commitment by the Mexican \n     Government to repay the securities issued under U.S. \n     guarantees. The United States will only issue the guarantees \n     on the condition that the Mexicans adopt a strict economic \n     and financial program to help ensure that the Mexican economy \n     has the resources to meet these obligations. In addition, the \n     Mexican commitment to repay will be backed by Mexico's \n     revenues from oil exports. (Mexico exports about $6.5 billion \n     of oil each year.) The United States would have access to \n     these revenues in the event of non-payment by the Mexican \n     Government. The revenues would flow to the United States \n     Government through a four step process based on irrevocable \n     instructions:\n       1. Before a guarantee is given, Mexico's oil company, \n     PEMEX, will instruct its foreign customers to deposit the \n     payments for their oil purchases in a PEMEX account in a \n     commercial bank in the United States. Such payments will \n     begin on the first day when Mexico could be in default on its \n     payment obligations on its guaranteed securities.\n       2. If Mexico fails to make an interest or a principal \n     payment on its guaranteed securities, the oil proceeds will \n     be automatically transferred from the PEMEX account in the \n     U.S. commercial bank to a Mexican government account at the \n     same bank.\n       3. These proceeds will be automatically transferred again \n     to a Mexican government account at the Federal Reserve Bank \n     of New York (FRBNY).\n       4. The FRBNY will then have access to these funds and can \n     use them to reimburse the United States for any amounts it \n     had paid out on its guarantee, plus interest. In other words, \n     the funds would be transferred to the United States to \n     compensate for any payments made by the U.S. under the \n     guarantee.\n       This mechanism has been put in place several times before \n     by Mexico and Treasury for loans extended to Mexico. However, \n     it has never been activated because Mexico has always paid \n     off its loan obligations to the United States government.\n                       existing pemex commitments\n\n       Question. Has any PEMEX oil already been ``pledged'' to \n     anyone else?\n       Answer. Mexico earns about $6.5 billion from oil exports \n     each year.\n       PEMEX crude oil exports are subject to three existing \n     financing arrangements with non-Mexican banks. Under these \n     arrangements, in a worst case scenario, PEMEX would be \n     obligated to pay roughly ten percent of one year's proceeds \n     of Mexican oil exports.\n       PEMEX has also entered into an oil proceeds facility with \n     the United States and Canada to back up the drawings under \n     the swap lines established by the North American Framework \n     Agreement.\n       This facility is currently backing up the $1 billion that \n     Mexico has drawn this month.\n\n\n                    former oil facility arrangements\n\n       Question. Has this oil facility arrangement been put in \n     place before?\n       Answer. Yes, on five occasions since 1982.\n       However, oil proceeds have never been transferred because \n     Mexico has always paid off its loan obligations on time.\n\n\n                       constitutional obligations\n\n       Question. Are there any Mexican constitutional restrictions \n     on control and ownership of PEMEX that could undermine this \n     arrangement?\n       Answer. No. There are constitutional restrictions on the \n     foreign ownership and control of PEMEX, but they do not \n     affect the ability of PEMEX commit its resources to the \n     United States Government under this facility.\n       This mechanism has been put in place on five prior \n     occasions, and Mexican government attorneys have always \n     issued legal opinions stating that the mechanism is fully \n     consistent with Mexican law.\n                         possible pemex evasion\n\n       Question. Is there any way that PEMEX could get around its \n     obligations to the United States government in the event of a \n     non-payment by the Mexican government under a guaranteed \n     security?\n       Answer. We are making this facility as air tight as \n     possible.\n       Mexico has agreed that PEMEX will issue irrevocable \n     instructions to all of its existing foreign customers to have \n     dollar payments routed to a commercial bank in the United \n     States. Under these instructions, these payments would \n     automatically flow to the New York Federal Reserve Bank in \n     the event of a default.\n       This provides excellent protection because the funds will \n     be in the United States.\n       If PEMEX wants to sell oil currently sold to a U.S. company \n     to an alternative foreign customer, PEMEX would have to \n     secure our agreement in advance.\n       If Mexico failed to make payments on the guaranteed \n     securities, and PEMEX were to violate its obligations, Mexico \n     would lose all access to the international financial \n     community and face serious adverse consequences in its \n     relationship with the United States.\n\n\n                             full backing?\n\n       Question. Does the oil facility provide us full dollar \n     backing for our maximum exposure?\n       Answer. Yes. The facility provides full dollar backing for \n     our maximum exposure.\n\n\n                          mexican oil reserves\n\n       Question. How much oil does PEMEX have?\n       Answer. Estimates of Mexican oil reserves range from 25 to \n     50 billion barrels.\n       Assuming that 50 percent of Mexico's oil is exported at $10 \n     a barrel, PEMEX's total potential export oil revenues could \n     range from $12 to $250 billion.\n       In 1994, PEMEX earned approximately $6.5 billion from crude \n     oil exports and $1 billion from oil product exports.\n\n\n                         u.s. legal protections\n\n       Question. What legal protections does the United States \n     have in the oil proceeds facility?\n       Answer. The United States has strong legal protection \n     through the recognized banker's \n     [[Page S1979]] right of ``set off'' against Mexican oil \n     proceeds in the New York Federal Reserve Bank (FRBNY).\n       This means that the FRBNY has access to the Mexican oil \n     proceeds and can use them to reimburse the United States for \n     any amounts it had paid out on its guarantee, plus interest.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1975-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     DEATH OF RICHARD L. ROUDEBUSH\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the world lost a great public servant and \nwell-known Hoosier last weekend with the death of the Honorable Richard \nL. Roudebush.\n  He was born on a farm in Noblesville, IN, 77 years ago. In 1941, he \ngraduated from Butler University in Indianapolis with a degree in \nbusiness administration. Soon after, he enlisted on the Army just 1 \nmonth before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and was shipped out to \nEgypt in September 1942, where he joined with British Forces during \nfive major battles in North Africa. While participating in the invasion \nof Italy, his landing craft was hit and was sunk by the enemy, but he \nsurvived and continued the fight with the 15th Air Force.\n  Richard Roudebush's distinguished career of serving United States \ndoes not end with his role in World War II. He demonstrated his \nleadership among his war veteran peers with being actively involved in \nthe Indiana Department of Veterans of Foreign Wars and eventually being \nelected as national commander in chief of the national VFW.\n  A friend of Mr. Roudebush's remarked that he was so discouraged at \nthe way Hoosier Congressmen were handling things in Washington, that he \ndecided to run for Congress himself. He did, and in fact, he was \nelected to the House of Representatives five times, and from three \ndifferent districts. Through his own efforts, he quickly rose from the \nranks to become the assistant minority whip and ranking member of his \nparty on the Committee on Science and Astronautics where he was best \nknown for his instrumental efforts in helping to get America's space \nprogram successfully off the ground.\n  No challenge was ever too great for Richard Roudebush. This was most \napparent in the contest for the Senate seat of then-Senator Vance \nHartke. Mr. Roudebush did not win the race, but it was the closest \nSenate election race in Indiana history. Out of 2 million votes cast \nonly 4,000 votes kept him from victory.\n  His deep affection and commitment to his fellow veterans led him on a \ncontinued mission, especially after his congressional days, to help \nmake better the lives of his fellow comrades. After working in the \nVeterans Administration for 3 years as the No. 3 man, President Gerald \nFord nominated Mr. Roudebush as Veterans Administrator in 1974. His \ndedication to veterans continued later in life as he served on veteran \nadvisory boards and was honored with life membership to most veteran-\nrelated organizations.\n  Richard Roudebush fought for United States and served his country in \nthe public sector as representative of the people. He was a Hoosier \nhero who exemplified the very best in public service. His vision, \nknowledge, and zeal for excellence, and determination to see \ninitiatives through to their successful conclusion are some of his \nqualities that have endured in the Veterans Administration and the \nCongress. His honors and awards are a treatment to the depth of his \nservice dedication and the impact of his efforts. His presence will be \ngreatly missed, but his work on behalf of veterans and the residents of \nIndiana will remain a great legacy of which all Americans can be proud.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1979-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE 200TH BIRTHDAY OF THE U.S. NAVY SUPPLY CORPS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the more than \n5,000 men and women of the U.S. Navy Supply Corps, active and reserve, \nwho on February 23, 1995, will celebrate the 200th birthday of their \ndistinguished service to our Nation and Navy. The naval officers who \nproudly wear the Supply Corps oak leaf are the business managers of the \nNavy and are responsible for the logistics support of operating forces \nin the fleet and naval shore installations worldwide.\n  The Supply Corps has come a long way since its birth in 1795, when \nTeach Francis of Philadelphia took the helm as the first Purveyor of \nPublic Supplies. The original charter of the Supply Corps was to \nsupport the six wooden frigates of a young American Navy. The Supply \nCorps has distinguished itself throughout its long history by ensuring \nthat the United States has been ready to defend American freedom and \ninterests in every conflict since the War of 1812. Its responsibilities \nhave grown tremendously and have kept pace with the challenge of \nproviding logistics support to a modern and highly technological Navy, \nwhich has grown in size and complexity. Today, the Navy Supply Corps \nemploys the latest technologies and management skills to supply our \nNavy at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest efficiency.\n  Having progressed from supplying wooden frigates with cannon balls to \nsupplying AEGIS destroys with Tomahawk cruise missiles, the U.S. Navy \nSupply Corps continues to carry out its vital mission to keep our Navy \nwell equipped and ready to respond at a moment's notice. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating the officers of the U.S. Navy \nSupply Corps on its 200th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1979-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF DONALD E. GESSAMAN\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nconcerning the retirement of Mr. Donald E. Gessaman of Dayton, OH.\n  Upon Mr. Gessaman's retirement, the Federal Government will lose one \nof its most effective public servants. Mr. Gessaman served as the \nDeputy Associate Director for National Security in the Office of \nManagement and Budget. I would like to take this opportunity to commend \nMr. Gessaman on 32 years of outstanding service to his country. He is \nknown for exceptional intelligence, common sense, and good humor. Mr. \nPresident, his counsel and wisdom will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. Gessaman began his career in 1963 as an analyst for the Air Force \nspace program. In 1966, he moved to Washington to become a management \nintern in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The following year, \nhe began his work at OMB and has remained there since, rising through \nthe ranks and becoming a member of the Senior Executive Service. In \n1990, he assumed his present position as Deputy Associate Director for \nNational Security.\n  Mr. Gessaman dedicated his career to ensuring that the taxpayers' \ninvestment in our Nation's Armed Forces is well spent. The importance \nof national security issues and the spending constraints imposed by the \ndeficit have made this a daunting task. Yet, time and time again, Mr. \nGessaman has shown that judgment, analysis, and a thorough \nunderstanding of defense programs can serve both our national security \nand our economic security.\n  Mr. Gessaman's professionalism, his thorough analyses, and his \ncommitment to the highest standards throughout his career have inspired \nhis colleagues. I want to join those colleagues and his many friends in \nthanking Mr. Gessaman and wishing him all the best for the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1979-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1979-S1980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO M.R. SENI PRAMOJ\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to offer congratulations and best \nwishes to M.R. Seni Pramoj, one of America's great friends, and one of \nAsia's most accomplished democratic leaders, as his 90th birthday \napproaches.\n  And as we prepare to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of \nthe Second World War, I would like to remind the Senate of Seni's great \nservice as Thai Ambassador to the United States when the war began.\n  Seni Pramoj began his career in the 1930's, as one of Thailand's \nfirst legal scholars. During that decade, he helped to draft many of \nThailand's modern laws, including the law abolishing the unequal \ntreaties Thailand was forced to sign during the colonial era. He \nlectured to a generation of students at Thammasat School of Law, and \nbefore the end of the decade was made a judge on Thailand's Supreme \nCourt.\n  These accomplishments gained him national recognition far beyond the \nlegal field. And in 1940, at the young age of 35, Seni found himself \nappointed Ambassador to the United States.\n   [[Page S1980]] A year and a half later, on the day of the surprise \nattack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese Army entered Thailand. A powerful \nfaction within the Thai Government, favoring collaboration, ordered the \nThai military not to resist. And later in December, now in full \ncontrol, they signed a military alliance with Japan.\n  Their next step was to order Seni by cable to deliver a formal \nDeclaration of War to the U.S. Government. As a patriot and a man of \nconscience, Seni did not hesitate to do his duty as he saw it. As he \nrecounts the story, he went to the State Department the day after \nreceiving this cable, and told then-Secretary of State Cordell Hull:\n\n       Sir, I regret to say that I have been instructed by my \n     government to declare war on the United States. But I refuse \n     to do it because there is no reason, and I have already cut \n     myself loose from Bangkok. I cannot bring myself to declare \n     war on the United States.\n\n  Seni placed the Declaration of War in a safe at the Embassy on \nKalorama Road, where it remained for the rest of the war. He refused \nfurther to leave the Embassy when the ruling faction in Bangkok ordered \nhim to do so. And instead, he devoted himself to the Allied cause, \nwriting every Thai student in the United States to announce his \ndecision to form a resistance force called the Seri Thai or Free Thai \nmovement.\n  Virtually all of the 110 Thai students in the United States at the \ntime joined the Seri Thai. Seventy of them trained under the OSS as \nguerrilla fighters. Others served as technical experts. Some carried \nout broadcasts in the Thai language. Still others helped American \nmilitary authorities to identify sites of great cultural and historical \nvalue to Thailand, in order to preserve them from Allied bombing raids \ntoward the end of the war.\n  The Seri Thai movement was equally successful inside Thailand. \nInspired by Seni's wartime broadcasts, and trained by his student \nrecruits, it ultimately armed about 50,000 Thai partisans. And \nfollowing the Japanese surrender, Seri Thai formed the first postwar \ngovernment, with Seni himself as Prime Minister.\n  Seni's career since then has been just as distinguished. He was a \nfounder of the Prachatipat or Democrat Party--now Thailand's oldest \npolitical party, and ably led by Prime Minister Chuan. He has been, as \nwell, a highly successful lawyer and musician; and Prime Minister once \nagain in the 1970's.\n  Altogether, it is no exaggeration to say that for the past 60 years, \nSeni has been at the center of Thai law and politics. And his sincere \ncommitment to democracy, moderation, and the rule of law has helped \nThailand become the prosperous democracy so many people around the \nworld admire today.\n  In a letter to President Franklin Pierce, written in 1856 and \nreprinted in the book ``A King of Siam Speaks,'' which Seni and his \nbrother Kukrit Pramoj edited some years ago, King Rama IV expressed the \nhope that the United States and Thailand would forever regard one \nanother with ``friendship and affection,'' and support one another in \ntimes of difficulty. And nearly 150 years later, few have done more to \nmake the King's hope a reality than Seni Pramoj.\n  All American friends of Thailand join in wishing M.R. Seni Pramoj \nbest wishes as his 90th birthday approaches. And we thank him for a \nservice to both our countries which we will not forget.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1979-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      IN HONOR OF FRANK E. RODGERS, RETIRING MAYOR OF HARRISON, NJ\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, on December 31, 1994, a very special man, \nFrank E. Rodgers, served his last day as mayor of Harrison. After 48 \nyears of public service, Mayor Rodgers is being honored for his life-\ntime commitment to the citizens of Harrison, NJ.\n  Mayor Frank Rodgers won his first term as mayor of Harrison after the \nwar in 1946 and began the distinguished career that would make him the \nlongest-serving mayor in the history of the United States. Epitomizing \nthe old adage that all politics is local, Mayor Rodgers campaigned \ndoor-to-door all 24 times he sought reelection and maintained an open-\ndoor policy at town hall.\n  In addition to his time as mayor, Frank Rodgers held a variety of \nelected and appointed jobs in government, including 6 years from 1977 \nto 1983 as a State Senator and 10 years as a town councilman. Frank's \nservice in the Army during World War II did not interfere with his \ncommitment to public service; he was reelected as a councilman while in \nbasic training at Fort Dix and managed town affairs through calls and \nletters to his wife and family while working as a military intelligence \nofficer on assignment along the east coast.\n  Diligence, dedication, and a true commitment to his constituency were \nthe hallmarks of Frank Rodger's career. In his retirement letter to the \nresidents of Harrison, Frank wrote, ``I believe our years together hint \nat a mutual respect and caring that goes far beyond the requirements of \ngoverning.'' Frank Rodgers possessed both the insight to know what it \nmeans to govern and the willingness to devote himself wholeheartedly to \nthe task.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering an amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. This is not a usual matter and ought not be \ntreated as such. Changing the U.S. Constitution is a very solemn \nresponsibility, and those who wrote the Constitution made changing it \nvery difficult, by design.\n  I have in my hand a copy of the Constitution. This is a little \nbooklet put out by the bicentennial group that worked on a program to \neducate the American people about the Constitution. The Constitution \nbegins, as all Americans know, ``We the people of the United States.'' \n``We the people.''\n  I was privileged to go to a celebration in Philadelphia about 8 years \nago or so. It was the 200th birthday of the signing of the \nConstitution. The birthday, the 200th anniversary, was held in the very \nsame room in Philadelphia, called ``The Assembly Room,'' in \nConstitution Hall, the same room where the Constitution was written in \nthe first place 200 years previous, when 55 white, largely overweight, \nmen sat in a very hot Philadelphia room in the summer and wrote a \nconstitution.\n  We know that because we know who they were. Two-hundred years later \nfifty-five people, men and women of all races went back into that room \nto recreate in celebration the writing of that Constitution. I was one \nwho was picked to be among the 55. And to go into that room on the \n200th anniversary of the date of the writing of this Constitution was \npretty special. George Washington's chair is still at the front of the \nroom, the chair he sat in when he was presiding, and Franklin sat over \nthere.\n  It was very remarkable to be in this room where they wrote this \nConstitution. Even more remarkable was that it was written over 200 \nyears ago by patriots, by people who cared deeply for this country, but \nalso by a homogenous group of people, only white men who came from \nvarious parts of the colonies to join in that room and write this \ndocument.\n  We have come a long way. Two-hundred years later it was a diverse \ngroup of men and women of all races who celebrated. I sat there kind of \ngetting some goose bumps about the history of it all. I thought: as a \nlittle boy I grew up studying about George Washington \n[[Page S1981]] and now I am in the room where he helped write this \ndocument. It reminded me of what a solemn responsibility it is for us \nto understand this document and what it means for this country.\n  We have had all kinds of proposals to change it. I think there have \nbeen over 2,000 proposals made over the years to change the U.S. \nConstitution. Every time somebody gets a notion they want to change it, \njust change it. Some scruffy little guy in Texas says change the \nConstitution to prohibit something. One of these days somebody is going \nto burn the Bible. They say change the Constitution to prohibit \nsomething. There are all kinds of ideas on how to change the \nConstitution. Yet, this living document has served this country for 200 \nyears creating the oldest, most successful representative democracy \never on this Earth. So we are here today to talk about a proposal to \nchange it.\n  If I might give just one quick story about the understanding of \nhistory here, some years ago Claude Pepper, the oldest Member of \nCongress, was standing out in front of the Cannon House Office Building \nwith young Jimmy Hayes, who was in Congress as a freshman. He was \nstanding next to Claude. Claude I think was 87, the oldest Member at \nthat time. And they were standing talking on the sidewalk when a group \nof Boy Scouts with their leader breathlessly came running down and \nlooking for directions. They stopped next to old Claude and young Jimmy \nand they had no idea who they were. They said, ``Can you tell us where \nthe Jefferson Monument is?'' Old Claude Pepper said, ``You go right \nacross the Capitol Plaza to that building with the flag on it, and take \na right and go one block, and you will find it.'' Jimmy looked at \nClaude with a kind of certain strange look. Claude was aged 87. After \nthey left, Jimmy said, ``I think you have given them bad directions. I \nknow where the Jefferson Memorial is. The Jefferson Memorial is a mile \naway, by the river.''\n  Well, Jefferson was not around when they wrote the Constitution. He \nwas in Europe. But he contributed mostly through writings and through \nthe force of his thought and various ways to the writing of the Bill of \nRights, the most important of which, of course, was free speech. And \nClaude said, ``Since they asked to see a monument to Jefferson, there \nis a demonstration on the subject of abortion going on over in front of \nthe Dirksen Building. I feel there is no better place to see a monument \nto Jefferson and free speech than in front of the Dirksen Senate Office \nBuilding today.''\n  I imagine that the Boy Scout leader did not think of it this way, but \nhe was looking at a monument to Jefferson contained in this \nConstitution.\n  There are plenty of monuments in this Constitution that represent \ntimeless truths that have served this country, and will for a long, \nlong time. The question is, should a change be made in this document? \nShould we change the Constitution in order to respond to the budget \ndeficit? Should we require a balanced budget?\n  I have spoken on the floor on many occasions on this subject. I have \nsaid before--and let me repeat again--that a balanced budget itself is \nnot necessarily the most important goal. Does anyone in America believe \nthat it would be imprudent for us to spend $400 billion more than we \nhave this year and create a deficit of massive proportions if by doing \nso we could with one stroke eliminate cancer? Does anybody believe we \nshould not do that? Of course not. The question is though whether the \nbudget should be balanced. The question is: What are you doing as a \nresult of these deficits? What is causing them?\n  What is the result of the deficits? The fact is the deficits that we \nnow have in this country are operating budget deficits. They are not \ninvestments in the future. They are operating budget deficits because \nour fiscal policy has rolled out of control. The question should not \nbe, in my judgment, whether we have on obligation to deal with them. \nThe question is, how?\n  I came to Congress a number of years ago not thinking we should \nchange the Constitution in this area. Some years ago I changed my mind. \nWe started in 1981 when President Reagan proposed to us a fiscal policy \nstrategy that he said would result in a balanced budget. We had \nsomewhere around a $60 billion to $80 billion Federal deficit at that \npoint. He said, if we simply cut taxes and double defense spending, we \nwill have a balanced budget by 1984. Well, Congress cut taxes and \ndoubled defense spending, and we all know what happened to the deficit.\n  This line has gone way out of control. These are deficits that are \nserious, and these are deficits that have accumulated to make a $4.8 \ntrillion debt for this country. That threatens this country's future.\n  So the question is not whether. The question is what we do about it? \nThe top of this line on this chart is about deficits, and shows \nsomething that I think is important. A couple of years ago we had on \nthe floor of this Senate a proposal to deal with the deficits. It was a \ntough proposal and hard to vote for. It raised some taxes--and nobody \nwants to pay for increased taxes--and it cut some spending, a lot of \nfolks did not agree with cutting spending in these areas. Yet, our \ndeficit cut actually increased after we passed the bill. We thought it \nwould cut $500 billion, that it would cut the Federal deficit by $500 \nbillion in 5 years. We now know it was over $600 billion. So we have \ngotten some additional advantage.\n  My point is that we did something significant in law on the floor of \nthis Senate. You see what happened to the Federal deficit since that \npoint. I am proud to say I voted for that. People come up to me and \nsay, ``How dare you, you voted for that?'' I think the political vote \nwould have been, ``No, count me out. I am not part of the solution. I \nam not going to make the tough vote.'' I did not say, ``Count me out.'' \nI voted yes because I want this deficit to come down.\n  I might say there was not one single vote in this Chamber to help us \nfrom the other side of the aisle; not one. Not one Republican voted for \nthis. I am not going to question their motives. They fell very strongly \nphilosophically about some things. When it comes time for heavy \nlifting, it is very important that everybody be lifting. And we on this \nside of the aisle did it. I am proud we did it.\n  The problem is this line does not keep going down.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we did this and it was important to do, \nbut all of us know that because of health care costs and other things, \nthis line starts going back up. So this is not enough. The question is: \nWhat do we do now to solve this problem in the future?\n  The Senator from Utah brings to the floor, with many of his \ncolleagues, a proposal to change the U.S. Constitution. I respect him \nfor that. I voted for a change in the U.S. Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget last year. I likely will vote for one again, although \nthere are some changes in this proposal that I do not like.\n  I want to talk today about a couple of changes we want to make to \nthis proposal and why. As I do that, I want to say that somebody on the \nother side of the aisle was quoted, I guess yesterday, as saying that \nthose who say the American people have a right to know how we propose \nto balance the budget are joking. He said that the Senators who make \nthis argument simply do not want to balance the budget.\n  Wrong. I want to balance the budget. I have voted for a \nconstitutional amendment in the past, and I likely will again. But the \nquestion, in my judgment, is not whether we balance the budget; the \nquestion is: How?\n  I think the Senator from Utah and the other original cosponsors of \nthis particular constitutional amendment will agree with me that if it \npasses 90 seconds from this moment, not one single penny of the Federal \ndeficit will be reduced--not one. This will simply represent a bunch of \nwords that go into the document called the Constitution. And the \nrequirement, then, will be that changes in taxing and spending will \nhave to occur in the magnitude of somewhere around $1.5 trillion in 7 \nyears to accomplish a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  I happen to think there is a special responsibility at this moment. \nThe special responsibility is for this reason: The majority party, \nhaving won last November, proposes a contract for this country. In the \ncontract, they say two things. They say they want to decrease \n[[Page S1982]] taxes, which means cut the Government's revenue, No. 1; \nNo. 2, they want to increase defense spending. If you decide you want \nto cut the Government's revenue and increase one of the largest areas \nof Government spending, it seems to me it is logical to ask, if we \nchange the Constitution to require a balanced budget, how do we do it? \nHow do we get to that point, if you say we should cut revenue and \nincrease one of the largest areas of spending?\n  For that reason, many of us--some who are opposed to the balanced \nbudget amendment, others who support it--do support an amendment called \nthe right-to-know amendment. Once again, the questions for the American \npeople are: What are we going to do, and how are we going to do it? The \nproposal to change the Constitution answers the question ``what?'' What \nare we going to do? But the question of how we are going to do it, we \nare told, is an improper question; leave it for later.\n  Well, my colleagues, that is business as usual. If ever I have heard \nbusiness as usual, that is business as usual. I have heard that in \n1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. Business as usual is: Trust me; I \npromise you; we will tell you later. No, we do not have the details, \nbut they are there; believe us, trust us; we promise you.\n  Well, look, how many times do you accept a promise? The American \npeople, it seems to me, have every right to understand the answer to \ntwo questions: What are we going to do, and how are we going to do it? \nThe American people have a right to know, from those who say, ``I want \na balanced budget by 2002,'' and ``I want increased defense spending,'' \nand ``I want revenue cuts,'' they have a right to know how we are going \nto get there.\n  If I said to the Presiding Officer that I want you to ride with me \ntoday and we are going to go to New York City, the Presiding Officer \nmight want to get to New York City; he might have a desire to visit. He \nmight say that sounds like a good trip, and he would like to go. He \nwould probably ask, ``How are we going to get there? Are we going to \ntake the train; are we going to walk; are we going to take a motor \nscooter; are we going to go through Atlanta or maybe through Los \nAngeles to get from Washington, DC, to New York?'' He would have every \nright to want to know how we were going to do it.\n  That is the purpose of the right-to-know amendment. Its purpose is \nnot to derail the balanced budget amendment. I happen to think we ought \nto pass the constitutional amendment. I voted that way in the past, as \nI said, and I probably will this time. The purpose of the right-to-know \namendment is to say this must be more than an empty promise. We must, \nthis time, develop a national awareness of what the heavy lifting means \nto all of us. We need to get the Nation behind us to do it.\n  Mr. Armey, on the House side, said, ``Well, we cannot tell the \nAmerican people what is required here; it would make their legs \nbuckle.'' I think that is far too little faith in the American people, \nhonestly. We have to do this together. This country belongs to them, \nnot us. This is their country, their democracy. This book, this \nConstitution, means it is theirs. They have the powers, not us. We have \na responsibility to them at this point to tell them what we are going \nto do and how are we going to do it.\n  There are plenty of areas of the Federal Government that can be cut \nand will be cut under any scenario, whether this amendment passes or \nnot. I led a project on Government waste when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives and then here in the Senate. I can cite chapter and \nverse about wasteful spending. I mentioned before the 1.2 million \nbottles of nasal spray on inventory at the Department of Defense. There \nare a lot of plugged noses you are going to be able to treat for two or \nthree or four decades. That is the sort of bizarre kind of thing that \nis in the defense inventory. It makes no sense at all. There is too \nmuch waste.\n  The fact is that it is not the waste--while we should eliminate \nthat--that drives these numbers. All of us know what drives this. This \ncountry is growing older. More people are eligible for Medicare and for \nSocial Security. What is happening is that entitlement programs are \nratcheting up costs. But there are no votes on those programs in \nCongress. Those are entitlement programs whose appropriations are \nvirtually automatic. We have to respond to that.\n  Some of us are also going to offer an amendment on Social Security, \nand we are going to disagree on that. The Social Security system has \nnot caused one penny of the Federal deficit. This year, we will collect \n$69 billion more in Social Security than we spend out. That is not an \naccident. We are doing that by design. We need to save that money for \nwhen the baby boomers retire. But if it is not saved, if it is used as \nan offset to other spending in order to balance the budget, we will \nhave broken the trust and the promise between people who work and \npeople who are retired.\n  We must, it seems to me, say that we are not going to balance the \nbudget by raiding the Social Security trust funds. For those who say \nlet us not pass that amendment, not give that assurance, I say do not \ngive me five reasons; just give me one reason. There is only one reason \nyou would not want to give that assurance to seniors, and that is \nbecause you want to use that money. To use that money is, in my \njudgment, breaking a promise. The money is collected for only one \npurpose. It comes out of the paychecks; it is called the FICA tax, and \nit goes into Social Security, the trust fund, and it is promised that \nit will be saved for only one purpose, and that is Social Security.\n  How on Earth can anybody justify saying, well, we do not want to set \nthat aside because maybe we will want to use it sometime? For what? It \ncan only be used for Social Security. Those are two amendments that we \nare going to have to deal with. And just because we offer them, others \non this floor should not argue that we do not support a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. The wrong way is \nto provide empty promises and assurances that we are not going to keep. \nThe right way is to tell people you have a right to know; you should \nknow this, and here is the plan. We are going to increase defense, \naccording to some, and cut revenue and, therefore, here is how we are \ngoing to deal with other spending.\n  That is important. It is important for the American people to know.\n  I want to mention one other thing as I am talking about this. I am, \nfrankly, a little tired of people in this country in politics and \nespecially people in the House and Senate who keep repeating the notion \nsomehow that Government is unworthy.\n  Government is the way we do things together. It is the way we created \nour schools to educate our kids. It is Government. It is the way we \nbuilt our police forces to keep our communities safe. It is Government. \nIt is the way we inspect meat so when you buy some meat someplace you \nhave some assurance that it is not contaminated. It is the way we \nregulate our skies so when you are flying up there in a jet airplane \nyou are not gong to hit another jet airplane. Government is something \nwe do together. We ought to be proud of it, for gosh sakes.\n  You must have Government in the affairs of people in a nation like \nthis, and we ought to have the best possible Government we can for the \nAmerican people.\n  There is a sense in this country these days of a kind of anarchist \nmentality. This philosophy suggests somehow, that our Government is \njust something that just spends all this money and wastes all this \nmoney, and is totally unworthy, and that what we ought to do is just \nget rid of it.\n  But, you know, the fact is this country has changed a lot in recent \nyears. The rich have gotten much, much richer, the poor have gotten \npoorer, and there are more of them, more vulnerable people in this \ncountry. We have to start thinking together, all of us, to try to \nfigure out how to respond to some of these problems, how do we deal \nwith some of the vulnerabilities in our country. This is how we spend \nour money. And all of us know where our money goes.\n  This pie chart shows where Federal spending goes. Defense, 18 percent \nof the spending; Social Security, 22 percent; health care, Medicaid and \nMedicare, 17 percent. And, of course, that is going up every year, \nbecause more people are getting older, we have more \n[[Page S1983]] poor people, and health care costs increase every year. \nWe have to do something about health care costs because if we do not we \ncannot deal with the budget deficit.\n  Interest on the debt is 15 percent of the budget. We cannot negotiate \nthat. We have had to pay for that. And if Greenspan gets his way, we \nwill pay a lot more for it.\n  So Medicaid, Medicare are going up. Interest is going up. Social \nSecurity, more people growing older and on disability. In fact, in the \nSocial Security trust fund, we have a surplus for just that reason.\n  Defense? My Republican friends say we need more defense, so that is \ngoing to go up.\n  So where do you get the rest of it? International--some people say \nforeign aid, of course, is the biggest area of public spending. It is \nnot. We spend 1.4 percent of the budget for international programs.\n  So you have other mandatory spending. For domestic discretionary \nspending, 16.5. Now the 16.5 percent of discretionary spending, that is \nthe kind of spending that we send out to deal with kids' nutrition, all \nsorts of issues that help people out there who need help.\n  I know it is easy to talk about these things in the abstract. But now \nevery day you can go out and find what really matters and you can \ndetermine how this affects real people. You can go to a food pantry and \nwho walks in and try to figure out what this means in their lives.\n  You say, ``Well, let's cut off funding that does not make any \nsense.'' Nutrition programs? That makes no sense. ``The WIC Program; \nyou know, Head Start, we can do without it.''\n  Yes, I suppose the country can do without it but it will also be a \ncountry that is less worthy. It is a country that is not investing in \nits health and in its children, trying to make life better for \nchildren.\n  You know I remember being at a town meeting in eastern North Dakota \none day. An old fellow came up to me by the name of Thor, a guy who had \nflown combat airplanes in the Second World War. Thor came up to me and \nsaid, ``I want to show you my mouth. I got sores all around my mouth,'' \na guy in his seventies. He said, ``I need teeth.'' This was an old \nveteran. He said, ``I have no money. I have nothing.'' And he said, ``I \nneed teeth. I have no teeth. I went to the VA and I got a set of teeth \nfrom them and they don't fit. And so when I use them, it creates sores \nall around my mouth. So I can't use them and I want to show you these \nsores around my mouth.''\n  And I am thinking to myself--this was at a town meeting--he walked \nall the way up to the front, had his mouth open showing me how badly he \nneeds his new set of teeth.\n  Is it not pretty remarkable, in a country as wonderful as this, that \nold Thor, who went off to fight for his country and flew in combat and \nis now in his seventies and for one reason or another ends up with \nnothing, that Thor has to go to a meeting and stand up to beg to try to \nget a set of teeth.\n  That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about things \nthat improve the lives of people.\n  Senator Burns from Montana is on the floor. I was in community near \nthe Montana line recently, touring a hospital where they showed me this \nspace where the carpenters were knocking out two-by-fours. They were \ngoing to put in big, breathtaking new things. I think it is was an MRI; \nyou know, the technology to look through human flesh to see what is \nthere, a diagnostic tool. Breathtaking technology.\n  Then about 100 feet down in this hospital wing, they had me hold a \nlittle baby, tiny little baby, that had been born some while before, \nborn premature, as a matter of fact. The mother had come to the \nhospital to have a third child, unmarried. She checked in on a \nSaturday. Her blood alcohol content was .25 when she delivered the \nbaby. They checked this baby's blood and this baby was born with a \nblood alcohol content of .21, a little premature baby born dead drunk, \nand the mother did not even want to see the baby, wanted nothing to do \nwith it. The baby will probably be fetal alcohol syndrome damaged, they \ndo not know.\n  But think of the consequence of these things, day after day in our \ncountry. And we have to be concerned about how we respond to them and \nhow we deal with them. We cannot ignore them. These things tear this \ncountry up from the inside.\n  I am not making a case for massive new programs for spending, because \nI do not think this is a case where you have kind of a vending machine, \nwhere you put in a quarter and get out a national program. But some \nthings we do in this country are very, very important.\n  Head Start. Boy, you know, we should understand that is a good \ninvestment. The WIC Program, we know that is a wonderful investment to \ninvest in kids and low-income pregnant women.\n  I could tell you a hundred stories, as could all of my colleagues, \nabout the value of some of these things we do that make life worthwhile \nand make life helpful to people who need help.\n  I should tell you that Thor has new teeth. Thor got new teeth. Well, \nit was from a dentist. I talked to a friend of mine, personal friend of \nmine, and he got Thor some new teeth. But should a veteran have to beg \nfor new teeth? No, I do not think so.\n  The point is there are programs now to help that young baby. Young \nTamara Demeris, who I have talked about on the floor before, a 2-year-\nold, hair pulled out, nose broken, arm broken, because she was put in a \nfoster home and nobody checked to see whether the people were \ndrunkards. So this little girl was abused.\n  The fact is, there are things we can do about that. And we have done \nsome things about that. When they come to our attention, we invest and \nwe do some things to try to help people.\n  But all of these things relate to the decisions we are going to make \nabout what are we going to do. People have a right to know. What are we \ngoing to invest in? Are we going to invest in star wars, or are we \ngoing to invest in Head Start for our kids? The people have a right to \nknow that.\n  And to those who say this is joke, I say you are wrong. You know \nbetter than that. This is not a joke. This is very serious business. We \nare talking about changing the Constitution and we are talking about \nimposing requirements that will make massive changes in the way the \nFederal Government spends money. And count me in, because I want to \nforce those changes. I have two children and I do not want to give them \na $10 trillion debt when they get out of school. So count me in.\n  I just say this: We have a responsibility, all of us, to tell the \npeople what we are going to do and how we are going to do it. To those \nwho say, ``Let's not tell them what we are going to do,'' I say that is \nbusiness as usual, the same old tired promises I heard for 15 years. To \nthose of us who say, ``Let's together tell them how we are going to do \nit,'' we say the people have a right to know. And when we offer our \namendment on the right to know, we say to you, ``Join us, accept the \nresponsibility; accept the challenge of closing the loop to give the \nAmerican people the opportunity to know exactly what we are going to \ndo, to whom and how.''\n  The American people can take it. The American people deserve it. And \nto do less, in my judgment, is the same old tired unfinished business \nof Congress that says, ``Here's our political answer. Now trust us. \nDetails later.'' That is not the way we ought to do business.\n  I hope that, as we in the coming 2 or 3 weeks move down this road to \ntry to consider in a serious way not only what we are going to do but \nhow we are going to do it, those of us, Democrats and Republicans, who \nbelieve the current situation in this country is a crisis,\n the current deficits threaten this country's future. The current \nFederal debt and the prospect of burgeoning future debt are challenges \nwe cannot ignore. The question cannot any longer--for anybody on the \nfloor of this Senate--be whether we do something about it. The question \nis, what?\n\n  To those who oppose a constitutional amendment, I say I voted for it \nin the past and will likely vote for it again. I say to Members, as \nwell, on the other side of the aisle, Members have a responsibility to \njoin in the second step of this journey. The second step, just like a \nMontana dance, joins the first step. It is change the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget. And as we do it, tell the American people \nhow we will accomplish it because if we fail to do the latter, we know \nthe former is \n[[Page S1984]] nothing more than a bunch of words in a document like \nthis.\n  So, Mr. President, we will have a lengthy debate and an aggressive \ndebate on this subject. The debate will not be, I think, as the Senator \nfrom Utah occasionally would suggest, on whether a constitutional \namendment is worthy. This Senator has said before, he thinks it is. I \nsay now I think it is. But I say to the Senator from Utah and his \ncolleagues and my friend from Montana, we have an obligation to do more \nthan this.\n  I will join Members on this. We have an obligation to do more. We \nhave an obligation to give the people the right to know, as we pass \nthis, what does it mean; what does it mean to their future, and what \ndoes it mean to their lives, and how will we respond to it as a \nnational commitment in this country.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my friend from \nNorth Dakota.\n  As he held up the Constitution, I want to go back to an article that \nwas printed in, I think, the Richmond Times, some time ago, and this \nlast Sunday in the Washington Times. It was taken from the life and \ntimes of Davy Crockett, whenever he represented Tennessee and the House \nof Representatives, and he had to cast a vote to help people when their \nhouses had burned down in Georgetown.\n  We hold up that Constitution, remember, is a double-bit ax. There is \nnothing in that Constitution that says we have the right to take my \nmoney and give it to somebody else, free, gratis.\n  So, when we talk about a balanced budget amendment, be very clear \nthat this is not the first time this was a concern of people and \nleaders in this country. The first constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget was in 1936. And there was a time, I think, this country \npretty well held its discipline on spending, until we really learned as \na Government to borrow money, that we could borrow money against future \ncollections, and those are taxes.\n  I have heard the same old argument, saying, ``How are you going to do \nit?'' Well, I would say I am going to have to approach this just as I \napproached running a farm or a ranch. You do not do the same thing \nevery year or nail yourself into a situation that if time and \ncircumstance changes, a person cannot. They do that.\n  I worked in county government where we balanced the budget. The \ndebate started among the commissioners on what is going to get funded \nor how much it is going to get funded; and what, maybe, if we do not \nhave the funds, should be cut out. It serves a purpose, but maybe is \nnot as high on the priority list as we would like to see it.\n  That is what a balanced budget amendment does. It creates the arena \nfor debate. It forces us, as debaters or policy setters, to make those \nhard choices between doing this or that, and reexamining the mission of \ngovernment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is exactly right. What is the purpose \nof government? Why do free people establish a government, especially in \na free society? No. 1, public safety; he is right. That is an \nobligation of the total society, public safety. Now, public safety \ncould be food safety, it could be in hygiene; but mostly it is in our \nfire departments, our police departments, our immediate-response \npeople.\n  The next obligation, we could say, probably is transportation, \nbecause we have to keep the roads and the bridges so that the area of \ncommerce can be carried out. In this great land of ours, we have \nchanged everything around to where it is a global economy and global \ncommunication as to where our roads and bridges are satellites, fiber \noptics, new communications. Those are areas that will be debated here \non this floor, as new policy is going to be formed that can keep up \nwith the new technologies that are out there.\n  What some folks would call investment, other folks would call \nspending. If we want to define them, I guess they are about the same. \nThen I guess when we get down to the definition, we come down again to \nthe bottom line, and that is priorities.\n  Now, with a debt of $4.7 trillion, for too long now after we learned \nto borrow against future collections, we started to move that national \ndebt up. As I said, the first balance-the-budget amendment was in 1936. \nIn 1934, and that is under the Roosevelt administration, someone had \nthe idea that this thing could get out of hand and was concerned about \nit. We were in the depth of the Depression. We were trying to help so \nmany people who had been hit by this devastating time; not only the \nDepression, but drought. And I could write a book on that.\n  I do not remember those days in 1936, because I was born in 1935. I \nguess I was a result of the drought; I surely was not a result of the \nDepression. The last thing you wanted in 1935 was kids, living on 160 \nacres of two rocks and one dirt.\n  But the debt that started out, we lost our way a little bit and our \ndiscipline. So that debt continues, because we continue to deficit \nspend. We should get two things straight right here. There is a \ndifference between deficit spending and debt. Deficits cause debt. We \ndeficit spend; we create debt. So no matter that that line goes down, \nwe are still deficit spending. It is still of concern to people who \nhave some kind of sense of responsibility, of fiscal responsibility.\n  Ever since I came here 6 years ago, that has been a concern, because \nour concern should be for our children and grandchildren, and the bill \nthey will have to pay later on because we are mortgaging their future.\n  I was not a Member of Congress when the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was \npassed, but it was one of the many efforts to control Government \nspending. While well intentioned, this law fell short of eliminating \nthe deficit. In other words, we as a body of policymakers never really \ncommitted ourselves to that law to make sure it worked.\n  Even with a balanced budget amendment, I am not really sure that we \nhave that discipline today, but I think it will make Members get in the \ndebate and talk about priorities. It is true that we do have laws in \nplace to balance a budget. We did not have the will to really take it \nserious, to really look at programs, and to take some of the fraud out \nof it.\n  My good friend from North Dakota was talking about the man who flew \nthe missions that could not get a set of teeth. And we have people that \ntake advantage of the veterans programs that never got anything, to \nreally have the privilege of using those programs.\n  The balanced budget amendment would change all of this rhetoric by \ninstilling the necessary fear needed to make the tough decisions and \ntake the hard steps. What are we talking about, even in food stamps; $1 \nbillion a year, $3 billion a year in savings, if we could take the \nfraud out of it?\n  Now, that has nothing to do with a balanced budget amendment, but I \ncan remember when talking to the former Secretary of Agriculture in the \nBush administration, Ed Madigan and, of course, Ed is no longer with \nus. We started with a smart card and we saw where we could take some of \nthe fraud out of it. Do you know what stopped the expansion of that \nidea? The bureaucracy did, because it cost some jobs in Government. \nDoes that not seem strange? We had an opportunity to do that. This will \nforce us to do something about that, whether we want to or not. It will \nforce Members to do it.\n  So as we go down this trail, trying to come up with a mechanism to \ninstill fiscal responsibility in ourselves, this is, I think, a \ncommonsense approach. And yet there are people that want to make it \nvery complicated.\n  I came up in 1990 with an idea called the 4-percent solution.\n  We wanted to deal with the deficit. At that time, if you wanted to \nreform something to really make it work, the 4-percent solution merely \nsaid this: Do away with baseline budgeting, but budget and spend based \non previous years' expenditures and only let Government grow 4 percent \na year. Based on previous years' expenditures, not previous years' \nbudgets, and not an automatic built-in 6 percent as happens in baseline \nbudgeting.\n  And you know what, next year we would have been looking at a whole \nlot \n[[Page S1985]] different deal had we done that. We had a few cosponsors \non that. It is a very simple thing. Maybe it was too simple. Nobody \nwanted to really get into it. But basically it just said, ``Government, \nonly grow 4 percent. If you don't want to spend the 4 percent over \nhere, you can spend it over here. You can move it around. But the total \ngrowth, bottom line, 4 percent.''\n  It would have given Congress the flexibility to increase funding at \nrealistic levels for many programs while reducing others and phasing \nout some that have not worked since World War II and they are still \naround here.\n  It did not pass, and now the problem is even worse where even the 4-\npercent idea will not work. It will not get us to where we want to go.\n  I think also we have to look at a way to see how this budget or \nbalanced budget will be scored by the CBO and whoever is doing the \nbottom-line figuring.\n  There was a joint budget hearing a couple of weeks ago that would do \nexactly that. I am pleased that that hearing looked at the dynamic \nmodeling and am encouraged that it gave it the attention it deserves. \nThe current revenue method calculates outlays from the Treasury, no \nmatter what the cost-benefit ratio. I believe dynamic review estimating \nwould be a good way to put Government spending priorities in order.\n  What we are saying is, the policies we set here, tax policies, \nwhatever, change people and the way they do business. It just changes \nhuman behavior.\n  The dynamic modeling of a program would be scored on its merits. \nInstead of only looking at the amount of money the program costs in \noutlays to the Treasury, it also would take into account how much money \nis raised for the Treasury.\n  I have heard this argument on capital gains. Capital gains is a \nvoluntary tax. How many ranches and how many businesses are we looking \nat today that are not being sold or even offered to be put on the \nmarket because of capital gains? They find other ways of transferring \nthat property, some way to do it. It is a voluntary tax. You do not \nhave to pay the tax because you do not have to sell. So what happens? \nIt does not go up for sale and their commercial activity is lost.\n  So we have to look for a way, a program which creates jobs, opens up \nemployment opportunities, boosts the economy and raises money for the \nTreasury. It is commercial activity that does that. Of course, I was \nnot trained in economics. I pretty much have street economics. It is \npretty simple: This is accounts receivable over here; this is accounts \npayable over here. Nothing happens in accounts payable until something \nhappens in accounts receivable. That is the way it is. That is a pretty \nsimple way to go through life. Nonetheless, that is the way we have to \nscore and take a look.\n  Montanans, like all other people around America, sent a loud and \nclear message last November 8. There are still some people who are \ntrying to interpret that message, and there will be different \ninterpretations of it as long as there are writers of editorials, as \nlong as there are coffee klatches, as long as there are service clubs. \nWherever you hear public discourse, there will be an array of messages \nthat was heard November 8.\n  But I think I heard the message. I heard the message that says we \nhave to change some things before we really get the job done. Three \nreforms have to happen: Spending reform, budget reform and regulatory \nreform; and also something that puts some steel or backbone, as far as \npicking those winners and losers in spending and the way this \nGovernment spends money--priorities. It makes you get on the field and \ndebate the priorities of which direction we are to be going.\n  An ABC-Washington Post poll taken early in January showed that 80 \npercent of those polled said they support a constitutional amendment to \nrequire a balanced budget.\n  When looking at budget priorities the Federal Government seems like a \ngood place to start. The Federal Government consumes 23 percent of GDP. \nThe current growth rate of Government spending is 2 percent per year \nfaster than the economy. It's time to get a tight rein on the power and \nsize of the Federal Government. The economist, Milton Friedman, put it \nbest when he said, ``There is nothing so permanent as a temporary \ngovernment program.''\n  The Federal Government has encroached on State's rights and spending \nhas gone up to keep pace. Its over-ambitious agenda steals individual \nrights even as it indebted the people. Congress and the Federal \nGovernment have to get their hands out of their pockets.\n  It's time to redistribute the power to the States. Shrink the Federal \nGovernment and given the money straight to the States. Cut out the \nmiddle man--the paper pusher in Washington, DC.\n  By giving the States block grants they can use the money as they see \nfit, tailoring it to their specific needs. Every State is different and \nhas different needs. One size does not fit all and the Federal \nGovernment should not be trying to force one program to fit every \nState. What works in California, doesn't always make sense for Montana \nand West Virginia.\n  Once again, opponents of the amendment are using scare tactics to \ndefeat this measure. They threaten that important programs will be cut \nor even eliminated, that it will endanger our economic recovery. There \nhas to be plenty of places to make responsible cuts in a $1.6 trillion \nbudget. And by balancing the budget, Congress can ensure our continued \neconomic strength and future power.\n  House Joint Resolution 1 allows Congress plenty of time to get the \nfiscal house in order. Under this amendment, Congress would have until \nthe year 2002 to balance the budget. That's 7 years.\n  Over the course of 7 years, spending can be reduced gradually. The \nbudget does not have to be balanced overnight. Seven years is a long \nenough lead time to do the job, and do it fairly.\n  The President will be required to offer his budget that is balanced \nbased on good faith, but Congress will be forced to stick within its \nbudget.\n  Balancing the budget is going to take some hard decisions, some \npolitically distasteful choices. But the reward will be a balanced \nbudget and a more prosperous America. It's time to stop impoverishing \nthe next generation of Americans. Pass the balanced budget amendment \nand put some discipline in the budget process.\n  I feel very strongly--very strongly--if we do nothing else in this \n104th Congress and we pass this balanced budget amendment, I think we \nhave sent a strong message to the American people: We hear you. We \ncare.\n  But they also hear another message; that they, too, in their \nneighborhoods also have some responsibility of participation to make \nsure it works and to help us. That is the message back to the voters: \nHelp us. Help us set those priorities on maintaining this Government \nand also this great, great free society in which we live.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to reemphasize that this is one of \nthe most important debates that has ever taken place in the U.S. \nSenate. The subject matter indeed goes to the very heart of the hope of \nthe Framers of the Constitution for the constitutional system--a system \nthat would protect individual freedom and restrain the size and power \nof the Federal Government. In the latter half of this century, however, \nthe intention of the Framers has been betrayed by Congress' inability \nto control its own spending habits. I want to explain how passage of \nthe balanced budget amendment will further the intent of the Framers of \nthe Constitution. I also want to demonstrate that Federal balanced \nbudgets--up to very recently in our history--was a customary norm. We \nmust return to that norm if we ever hope to assure the economic well-\nbeing and vibrancy of these United States.\n\n\n           the balanced budget amendment and the Constitution\n\n  Mr. President, let me first say what the modern day crisis is: Our \nNation is faced with a worsening problem of rising national debt and \ndeficits and the increased Government us of capital that would \notherwise be available to the private sector to create jobs to invest \nin our future. Increased amounts of capital are being wasted on merely \nfinancing the debt through spiraling interest costs. This problem \npresents risks to our long-term economic growth and endangers the well-\nbeing of \n[[Page S1986]] our elderly, our working people, and especially our \nchildren and grandchildren. The debt burden is a mortgage on their \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for a solution strong enough that it \ncannot be evaded for short-term gain. We need a constitutional \nrequirement to balance our budget, Mr. President, House Joint \nResolution 1, the consensus balanced budget amendment is that solution. \nIt is reasonable, enforceable, and necessary to force us to get our \nfiscal house in order. But it not only furthers the economic welfare of \nour Republic; it fosters the Constitution's purpose of protecting \nliberty through the framework of limited Government.\n  James Madison, in explaining the theory undergirding the Government \nhe helped create, had this to say about governments and human nature:\n\n       Government [is] the greatest of all reflections on human \n     nature. If men were angles, no government would be necessary. \n     If angels were to govern men, neither external or internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government that is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place \n     oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is no \n     doubt the primary control on government; but experience has \n     taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. \n     [Federalist No. 51.]\n\n  Mr. President, we are here to debate such an auxiliary precaution, \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States to require a balanced budget, because our recent \nhistory has shown us that Congress is not under control.\n  The balanced budget amendment helps restore two important elements in \nthe constitutional structure: Limited government and an accountable \ndeliberative legislative assembly, both of which are vital to a free \nand vibrant constitutional democracy.\n  A deliberative assembly, the essence of whose authority is, in \nAlexander Hamilton's words, ``to enact\n laws, or in other words to prescribe rules for the regulation of \nsociety'' for the common good, was considered by the Framers of the \nConstitution the most important branch of Government because it \nreflected the will of the people. Yet, as the maker of laws, it was \nalso considered the most powerful and the one that needed to be guarded \nagainst the most.\n\n  Recognizing that ``[in] republican Government the legislative \nauthority, necessarily, predominates'' and to prevent ``elective \ndespotism,'' James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, recommended \nthat the Philadelphia Convention adopt devices in the Constitution that \nwould safeguard liberty. These include: Bicameralism, separation of \npowers, and checks and balances, a qualified executive veto, limiting \ncongressional authority through enumerating its powers, and, of course, \nthe election of legislators to assure accountability to the people.\n  However, in the late 20th century, these constitutional processes, \nwhat Madison termed ``auxiliary precautions,'' have failed to limit the \nvoracious appetite of Congress to legislate into every area of private \nconcern, to invade the traditional bailiwick of the States, and, \nconsequently, to spend and spend to fund these measures until the \nFederal Government has become functionally insolvent and the economy \nplaced in jeopardy.\n  Congress has been mutated from a legislative assembly deliberating \nthe common interest into the playground of the special interest.\n  The balanced budget amendment, Mr. President, will go a long way \ntoward ameliorating this problem. It will create an additional \nconstitutional process--an auxiliary precaution--that will bring back \nlegislative accountability to the constitutional system. The balanced \nbudget amendment process accomplishes this by making Federal deficit \nspending significantly more difficult. Significantly, it advances \nliberty by making it more difficult for the Government to fund \noverzealous legislation and regulation that invades the private lives \nof citizens.\n\n\n            The Historical Norm of Federal Balanced Budgets\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to read two quotations:\n  First, ``The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a \nrepublican Government.''\n  Second, ``Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \npopulation will be relieved from a considerable portion of its present \nburdens and will find * * * additional means for the display of \nindividual enterprise.''\n  These quotations are not recent statements by current proponents of \nthe proposed amendment. The first statement was made by Thomas \nJefferson and the second by Andrew Jackson.\n  These two quotations illustrate an important truth: No concept is \nmore a part of traditional American fiscal policy than that of the \nbalanced budget. In fact, Jefferson himself wished the Constitution had \nincluded a prohibition on Government borrowing--an early version of a \nbalanced budget amendment, if you will--because he thought that one \ngeneration should not be able to obligate the next generation.\n  Throughout most of the Nation's history, the requirement of budget \nbalancing under normal economic circumstances was considered part of an \nunwritten customary national policy.\n  Influenced by individuals such as Adam Smith, David Hume, and David \nRicardo, the drafters of the Constitution and their immediate \nsuccessors at the helm of the new Government strongly feared the \neffects of public debt. The taxing and borrowing provisions of the new \nConstitution reflected a need of the new Republic to establish credit \nand governmental notes and negotiable instruments that would spur \ncommerce.\n  Yet, the Founders and early American Presidents were in virtual \nunanimous agreement on the dangers of excessive public debt. \nConsequently, for approximately 150 years of our history--from 1789 to \n1932--balanced budgets or surplus budgets were the norm.\n  While budget procedures had little of their present organization, the \nconcept of a balanced budget was accepted widely as the hallmark of \nfiscal responsibility. Those deficits that did occur--during wartime or \nduring\n the most severe recessions--normally were offset by subsequent \nsurpluses.\n\n  Between 1932 and 1960, the rigid rule of annual balanced budgets gave \nway to a fiscal policy in which balanced budgets remained an overall \nobjective, but in which deficit spending was also viewed as a tool \noccasionally useful to affect appropriate economic results. \nNonemergency deficit spending was legitimized in 1936 with the \npublication of John Maynard Keynes' ``General Theory.'' Great weight \nwas placed upon the ability of the Federal Government to manage the \neconomy through fiscal policy; that is, through spending and taxation.\n  However, a real turning point in the history of U.S. fiscal policies \noccurred during the 1960's. Even the Keynesian objective of balancing \nsurplus years with deficit years succumbed to the idea of regular, \nannual uncompensated-for deficits. In other words, our deficits, which \nwere historically cyclical, reflecting boom and bust, war and peace, \nbecame structural and permanent.\n  During the 1960's, we were paying for the Vietnam war at the same \ntime as the war on poverty. The Great Society had noble goals and great \nintentions. But, the Great Society, on top of the war, was financed \nthrough debt and helped to develop our proclivity for deficit financing \nour national aspirations.\n  During the past three decades, the Federal Government has run \ndeficits in all but a single year. The deficits have come during good \ntimes, and they have come during bad times. They have come from \nPresidents who have pledged themselves to balanced budgets, and they \nhave come from Presidents whose fiscal priorities were elsewhere. They \nhave come from Presidents of both parties.\n  Even more alarmingly, the magnitude of these deficits has increased \nenormously. During the 1960's, deficits averaged $6 billion per year. \nIn the 1970's, deficits averaged $36 billion per year. In the 1980's, \ndeficits averaged $156 billion per year. And, in the 1990's so far, \ndeficits have averaged $259 billion per year.\n  The total national debt now stands at over $4.8 trillion. While it \ntook us over 200 years to acquire our first trillion dollars of debt, \nwe have recently been adding another trillion dollars to our debt about \nevery 5 years and will \n[[Page S1987]] continue to do so under current projections at a \nslightly faster rate as we approach the end of the decade.\n  Deficits and the national debt have grown, in large measure, because \nGovernment spending has grown. As total Government spending has \nincreased, so has Government's relative share of the economy. In 1929, \nFederal expenditures of $3 billion represented just 3 percent of GNP. \nBy 1950, the Federal share had risen to 16 percent of GDP or about $43 \nbillion. For fiscal year 1993, Federal Government spending of over $1.4 \ntrillion commanded nearly 23 percent of GDP.\n  To illustrate this growth in another way, the first $100 billion \nbudget in the history of the Nation occurred as recently as fiscal year \n1962, more than 179 years after the founding of the Republic. The first \n$200 billion budget, however, followed only 9 years later in fiscal \nyear 1971. The first $300 billion budget occurred 4 years later in \nfiscal year 1975; the first $400 billion budget 2 years later in fiscal \nyear 1977; the first $500 billion budget in fiscal year 1979; the first \n$600 billion budget in fiscal year 1981; the first $700 billion budget \nin fiscal year 1982; the first $800 billion budget in fiscal year 1983; \nthe first $900 billion budget in fiscal year 1985; and the first $1 \ntrillion budget in fiscal year 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1995 \nwas over $1.5 trillion.\n  Under current projections, Government spending will continue to rise, \nusing capital that would be put to better use by the private sector to \ncreate jobs. To starve the primary engines of economic growth of needed \ncapital is to risk our long-term economic security.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely clear that to restore the \nconstitutional concept of limited Government and its protection of \nliberty--as well as to restore fiscal and economic sanity--we must pass \nthis balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been focused in the last 6 months on \nthe O.J. Simpson trial, and one of the first mistakes made in that case \nby one of the defense lawyers was when the defense lawyer allowed O.J. \nSimpson to give a long statement to law enforcement. It led to that \nattorney being fired by O.J. Simpson because O.J. Simpson, could have \ngiven testimony incriminating himself.\n  Those of us who have practiced criminal law recognize that people \nhave a constitutional right to not incriminate themselves. The fifth \namendment provides for this right. I am sure we have all seen movies \nwhere people stand and say, ``I refuse to testify for fear that I will \nincriminate myself.''\n  The reason I mention that today, Mr. President, is the majority of \npeople pushing the balanced budget amendment are unwilling to tell the \nAmerican public what they have a right to know: How the budget will be \nbalanced. They, in effect, are taking the fifth amendment because they \ndo not want to incriminate themselves. They do not want to tell Social \nSecurity recipients, and others, that they are going to use the Social \nSecurity trust funds to balance the budget.\n  I believe that this right-to-know amendment that will be offered by \nthe minority leader tomorrow is an important amendment. It is an \nimportant amendment because I believe that we have an obligation to \ntell the truth to whomever asks us for the details. And that is the \nquestion that is being asked in the form of the Democratic leader's \namendment: How are you going to arrive at the numbers in 2002 to \nbalance the budget?\n  I think it is important that we recognize that the American people \ncare about this. Eighty percent of the American public believes that \nthere should be a balanced budget amendment. I believe that. But you \nask that same number of people whether you should balance the budget \nusing Social Security trust funds, and over 85 percent of the people \nsay it should not be done that way.\n  So, in effect, the numbers do not support a balanced budget amendment \nif you are going to use Social Security.\n  The reason I have been such an advocate of the right to know is \nbecause I am the one who last year offered an amendment to protect \nSocial Security. I am going to offer that same amendment. I am going to \nbe joined by a significant number of my colleagues to exclude Social \nSecurity from the balanced budget amendment.\n That in fact should be done.\n\n  I believe it is important the American public know how we are going \nto balance the budget. Why? My friend, the majority leader in the other \nbody, Representative Armey from Texas, has stated that we cannot have \nthe right-to-know amendment passed, for if we did, the knees of all \nMembers of Congress--in both the House and the Senate--would buckle and \nthey would not vote for the amendment. Why? Because the American public \nthen would know, in his words, too much. So I believe the American \npublic has a right to know.\n  Maybe what we should do is change the name of this balanced budget \namendment to the trust me amendment. Just trust me. Everything will be \njust fine. Do not worry about it. We do not need to tell you how we are \ngoing to do it. Just trust me. We will call it the trust me amendment.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the Democratic leader's demand for \ngreater details is the right way to go. It is insulting to the American \npublic, the people of the State of Nevada, to suggest that we cannot \ntell the American people how we will balance the budget because, if \nthey knew, they would not support the passage of this amendment. So let \nus call this the trust me amendment rather than the balanced budget \namendment. The American people, you see, Mr. President, should not be \ntreated like sick children: Take the medicine; it will taste fine; it \nwill make you feel better. Trust me.\n  No, I do not think we can treat the American people like sick \nchildren: Just open up and swallow the medicine; it is good for you. \nThey have a right to know and we have an obligation to tell them. We \ncannot, I repeat, take the fifth amendment and say we do not have to \ntell you for fear you will hold it against us.\n  Amending the Constitution is serious business that carries with it \nfar-reaching ramifications. Like a patient about to undergo serious \nsurgery, the American people ought to be told of all the options and \nall the possible ramifications.\n  Mr. President, when I first started practicing law many years ago, a \ndoctor did not have a profound obligation in law to tell the patient \nwhat might happen to them when they undertook a procedure. They really \ndid not have to sit down the night before the operation and indicate to \nthem: You are going to be just fine, but you should know that in 10 \npercent of these surgeries this dire result takes place.\n  No, that was not the rule. But it is now. The case law has made it so \nthat physicians now have an obligation to tell a patient what are the \nramifications from the procedure they are about to undertake. The \npatient has a right to know. The American public, being the patient in \nthis instance, has a right to know what is going to happen, and that is \nwhy we are asking that there be a glidepath as to how the balanced \nbudget is going to be reached.\n  All we are asking--it does not seem too much--is an honest, up-front \naccounting of how we will be able to balance that budget.\n  Let us assume that today or tomorrow we passed an amendment to the \nConstitution that outlawed all violent crimes. It sounds good: We are \ngoing to outlaw all violent crimes. But unless we set out a detailed \nplan as to how this amendment would be enforced and the crimes to \nnecessarily be included, it would not be worth the paper on which it is \nwritten.\n  That is what the balanced budget amendment or the trust-me amendment \nis all about. We are going to do the right thing, and balancing the \nbudget sounds like the right thing to do.\n  It kind of reminds me of about 15 years ago at Caesar's Palace in Las \nVegas. They were going to have an event. The event was that Evel \nKnievel was going to jump across the fountains at Caesar's Palace. None \nof us thought he could do it. He said, ``Trust me; I can do it.'' I can \ndrive my motorcycle and make this giant leap of faith and I will be \njust fine.\n  Thousands of people went to Caesar's Palace that day to watch this \nman perform this act that no one thought he could do. Millions of \npeople watched it \n[[Page S1988]] on television. And sure enough, he could not do it. He \nrevved up that motorcycle in his red, white, and blue jumpsuit and off \nhe went. The motorcycle turned in the air, and he was splattered all \nover the pavement at Caesar's Palace. He still has wounds and he still \nlimps as a result of that event.\n  Well, that is just like this trust me amendment. There can be no way, \nin this Senator's opinion, that you can balance the budget by 2002 \nunless you take Social Security trust fund moneys. Logic tells me that \nis the case. And as I said yesterday on this floor, Willie Sutton, the \nfamous bank robber, after he got out of prison was interviewed. He was \nasked: Why do you rob banks? Willie Sutton said, ``Because that's where \nthe money is.''\n  Well, with the Social Security trust fund, that is where the money \nis. We are going to have surpluses of billions and billions of dollars \nby the year 2002 or 2003. It will be about $800 billion. It will go up \nhigher than that, into the trillions, before the downside starts.\n  I see seated in the Chamber today my friend from Wyoming, the senior \nSenator from Wyoming. He and I serve together on the entitlement \ncommission. Social Security has problems if we do not bother it, but if \nwe take those Social Security trust fund moneys and use them to retire \nthe debt, we have big problems real quick.\n  Also, one of the first things I learned in law school is that if you \nare going to have a contract, you should put it in writing. We have \nheard a lot on this Senate floor, and especially in the other body, \nabout a Contract With America. We all realize that the real contract \nwith America was negotiated in 1935 when Social Security was passed. \nThat is the real contract with America. And I believe that the trust-me \namendment should be an amendment that is a real, true, balanced budget \namendment and Social Security should be excluded from it. And to do \nthat we have to put it in writing. We can no longer say to the Social \nSecurity recipients--and that is not only old people in this country. \nIt is my children and my grandchildren. I want them to be able to have \nthe ability to receive Social Security. So we want this Social Security \nexclusion to be put in writing, not some kind of a resolution that does \nnot mean anything.\n  I have heard that there is going to be a resolution offered that will \nget overwhelming support in this body. The resolution will say, ``We \nwill not touch Social Security, cross my heart.'' But the American \npublic should understand that resolution does not mean anything \nlegally. I say we must put it in writing in the amendment itself in \norder to have a real binding, meaningful balanced budget amendment.\n  So those who may offer a resolution declaring Social Security not \napplicable under the balanced budget amendment should understand that \nit will pass overwhelmingly but it means nothing. I respectfully \nsuggest that we need to make sure and understand that such a resolution \nis only a figleaf to make people's consciences seem a little bit \nbetter. Unless it is in the balanced budget amendment--that is, the \nexclusion for Social Security--Social Security will be the tool used \nbecause it is ``where the money is,'' as Willie Sutton said.\n  On this floor yesterday--I had a dialog with my friend from Utah, the \nsenior Senator from Utah, who has for a considerable period of time \nmanaged this bill. Referring to the Record of yesterday, I read a \nstatement from my good friend the senior Senator from Utah, where he \nsaid:\n\n       Now, that is where we are headed. Make no bones about it. \n     The only way to protect the Social Security trust fund and \n     the Treasury bonds it buys, is to pass this amendment and \n     balance the budget.\n       Now, Senator Reid says we must exempt Social Security \n     because what is--[it says ``what'' but it means ``that\"]--\n     that is where the money is. That just is not true. That is \n     where the Treasury bonds are. There is no money there. There \n     are only IOU's which will be valueless if we do not get \n     spending under control.\n       How do we protect Social Security? We who support this \n     amendment know how. Through good economics, and through a \n     balanced budget amendment. It is the best protection we could \n     give them. The Social Security trust fund is not where the \n     money is. There is no money there. There are only IOU's \n     there.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We have already used the money to pay for other bills of \n     the Federal Government and other spending items.\n\n  That is my whole case. That is my whole case. We do not want to do \nthat anymore. This year there will be an excess, a surplus of $70 \nbillion and they will continue to grow. We want to maintain those \nmoneys. We do not want to do what my friend from Utah recognizes has \nbeen done.\n  So I am for the right-to-know amendment. I believe that amendment \nsuggests we should have an exclusion for Social Security. If we do not, \nwe are going to have a cruel hoax perpetrated on the people of this \ncountry.\n  My friend from Utah further is quoted in today's Washington Post as \nsaying, ``The right to know is a joke by those who don't want to vote \nfor the amendment anyway.'' Mr. President, I support the balanced \nbudget amendment and have for many years. But I also support the \nAmerican public's right to know how we will get the budget in balance. \nI suggest the only joke we are hearing around here is voices saying, \n``trust us.'' The sad fact, however, is that this joke is at the \nexpense of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask the Chair notify me when I have \nconsumed 14 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this is probably one of the most important \nissues we are going to be asked to debate in this Congress, or maybe \nseveral Congresses. I suggest if the Senate today was debating whether \nMembers of the Senate should be allowed to have lunch with a lobbyist, \nthe press gallery would probably be overflowing. They would be \nlistening to every word we say on whether we should have lunch with \nlobbyists when we come to Washington. But here we are, talking about \namending the Constitution of the United States, a decision that can \naffect every single individual American today--the press gallery looks \nlike a hurricane has just blown through it.\n  This is an incredibly important decision we are embarking on, taking \non in a relatively short period of time--to amend the Constitution of \nthe United States. The balanced budget amendment, it is like apple pie \nand motherhood and the San Francisco Forty-Niners, everybody loves it \nin concept. But the devil is really in the details of what we are \ntalking about, and I suggest the details are well hidden. Details about \nwhat this means are still in the dark and I suggest that is not the way \nthe U.S. Senate and Congress of the United States should legislate. I \nthink we have an obligation to be honest and frank with the American \npeople, and tell them what we are getting ready to do to them and to \nthe respective 50 States of the United States.\n  I will start off by saying I support the balanced budget amendment. I \nhave supported it in the past. I have voted for it in the past. I think \nit is incredibly important that the Federal Government do what most of \nthe States do, although they differ and do it in a very different \nfashion with the type of budgets they have to keep in balance. They \nhave a capital budget and an operating budget. If the Federal \nGovernment had a capital budget and an operating budget, it would be a \nlot easier for us to balance the budget. We do not have that luxury \nlike most of the States have. We have only one budget and everything is \nput in. So an effort to balance the budget by the year 2002 is a noble \nidea, one I support, but one that is not going to be very easy.\n  My point is everybody is for this in concept but nobody knows the \ndetails. So many, in fact, are concerned about what the details really \nmean and how we are really going to go about doing it that the \nRepublican leader in the House of Representatives, when they asked him \nwhat about spelling out the details of how you are going to do this so \nthe people can see it, suggested that we really cannot talk about the \ndetails because if we do it nobody will vote for it.\n  Is that not a heck of a statement to make in the Congress of the \nUnited States? That the details are so difficult, and what we are \nasking the American people to face having happen to them is so \ndifficult to face we cannot tell them about it because, guess \n[[Page S1989]] what, if we tell them about it we may not be able to do \nit.\n  What kind of principles does that stand for? What does that say? We \nhave to pass this in the dark because if we open it up nobody will vote \nfor it? Are we telling the 50 State legislatures if we tell you exactly \nwhat this means you will never pass it so we are not going to tell you \nwhat it means, we are just going to give you a title and the title says \nwe are going to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002?\n  If it is good enough to do it is good enough to do in the daylight. \nWhy do we have to do it in the dark? What is wrong with telling them \nwhat a balanced budget by the year 2002 really means?\n  We have to understand in Washington that this balanced budget \namendment is not something we are doing here by ourselves. We cannot \nbalance the budget in Washington, amend the Constitution in Washington \nwith a balanced budget amendment, without a partnership arrangement \nwith the States. They have to ratify the amendment that we send to \nthem; 38 States have to analyze it, take a look at it, and say: Our \nlegislators say this is good policy; we will vote to put a balanced \nbudget amendment in the U.S. Constitution.\n  So they have to be involved. It is a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the various States in amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Therefore I suggest the States need to know exactly what \nthis is going to mean-- not in Washington, but what it means in the \nvarious State capitals around the United States. And I suggest it is \nnot enough for us to say, ``trust us,'' here in Washington--a very \nnovel idea at best. Trust us to do what is right. Trust us to pass this \nin a way that you are going to be very happy with, trust us to do the \nright thing that is not going to abnormally affect your States and your \ncitizens. Trust us to make it in a way that you will like. But do not, \ndo not ask us to tell you what it is all about, because you know if we \ntell you what it really involves you may not vote for it and, boy, \nwould that not be terrible? So please trust us.\n  President Ronald Reagan used to have a great line when he was talking \nabout the Soviet Empire and all the meetings they had. All the meetings \nwere going fairly well and Reagan would get up in the press conference \nand say, ``trust but verify.''\n  It was a great line. It made sense. We wanted to make sure that, yes, \nwe trusted the Soviets to do what was right because that is what they \ntold us, but he also said yes, but let us verify. Let us make sure the \ntrust is more than a promise to do it right, that we actually see in \nwriting what they are going to do. Trust but verify.\n  The right-to-know amendment that we are suggesting to be added to \nthis balanced budget amendment is really that: Trust but verify. Tell \nthe States what it is going to mean when that balanced budget amendment \nhits the capital steps in the various State capitals. What does it \nmean?\n  I spoke to the National Governors' Conference the other day and I \nasked the Governors, I said, Governors: What are you going to say to \nthe President of your senate or the speaker of your house when this \namendment hits the steps of your capital and you submit it for them to \nratify and those gentlemen or ladies come up and say: Governor, what \ndoes it mean for us to vote yes to ratify this amendment? What does it \nmean to my State of Louisiana? Does it mean we are going to have \nprograms cut and if so which ones are we going to have to cut or \neliminate or change? Governor, does it mean we are going to have to \nincrease taxes on the State level if the Federal Government quits \ngiving us these moneys for these programs?\n  Under the current suggestion of our Republican colleagues, do you \nknow what the answers would be of the Governor? ``I don't know. They \ndidn't tell me. They just said we are going to balance the budget. I \ndon't know how we are going to do that. They never told me that. I'm \nsure they are going to do it right. Trust them.''\n  I suggest any State legislature that is comfortable with the concept \nof trusting Washington to do something that makes them feel good and \nsolves their problems without giving them an unnecessary burden has not \nbeen in State office very long.\n Trust but verify.\n\n  I looked at the Department of the Treasury. These are folks who \ncrunch numbers, that wear the green eyeshades, and they really work on \nnumbers all the time. They are not political appointees. These are \neconomists who have probably been through several administrations.\n  Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, the past president of the National \nGovernors Association, has done a tremendous job in this area. He was \nconcerned, just as I am, and he wrote the Treasury Department. He said, \n``Can you tell me, making various assumptions, what a balanced budget \namendment would mean to the various States?'' That is a partnership \nidea. Remember? It is not just us doing it. The States want to know how \nit is affecting them. Governor Dean wrote to the Treasury Department \nand said, ``Give me a projection as to what it means to the various 50 \nStates if the Congress passes a balanced budget amendment which \nrequires a balanced budget by the year 2002.''\n  He got an answer from the Treasury Department. He mentioned all 50 \nStates. I am particularly interested in one State, the State of \nLouisiana, that I represent. They said this--this is really important \ninformation--about the impact of the balanced budget amendment and the \nContract With America on the State of Louisiana. They said that for all \ncalculations if a balanced budget is achieved by the year 2002 through \nacross-the-board spending cuts that exclude defense and Social \nSecurity--that is probably a fairly reasonable assumption. Our \ncolleagues on this side are talking about increasing defense spending. \nI think in some areas we need to increase. I would agree with them in \nsome areas. We just had our colleague from Nevada saying do not cut \nSocial Security. Does anybody believe that this Congress or the next \nCongress or any Congress is going to slash Social Security in order to \nbalance the budget? I doubt it. So I think this assumption is fairly \nsignificant, and probably pretty reasonable.\n  Here is what it said about my State. A balanced budget amendment \nwould reduce annual Federal grants in Louisiana State government by $2 \nbillion. There is $1.5 billion per year in lost funding for Medicaid. \nMy State has a $750 million shortfall in Medicaid this year without the \nbalanced budget requirement being in effect. It would mean $94 million \nper year in lost highway trust funds. What is going to happen to the \nroads of Louisiana? Are they going to crumble and fill up with water? \nThere will be $48 million per year in lost funding for welfare \nprograms, AFDC for our children; $324 million per year in lost funding \nfor education, for job training, and the environment, housing, and \nother areas. Talk about the devil is in the details. This is really \ndevil in the details.\n  Then it said Louisiana would have to increase State taxes by 27.8 \npercent across the board to make up for the loss in grants. A 27-\npercent tax hike? I think not. Louisiana is not going to raise taxes 27 \npercent. They are not going to raise them 2 percent. The conditions in \nthe State do not allow it. It is not good fiscal policy.\n  Some of my particular colleagues said that is just the Treasury \nDepartment's assumptions, and that is not correct, and you cannot \ndepend on that. Fine. Tell them what they can depend on. If it is not \nthese assumptions that are going to go into play, let us know what \nthese assumptions are. Tell us by showing the States what we are going \nto have to do to get to that point in the year 2002 when the budget is \nin balance so that when that State legislature, when the President of \nthe Senate, the Speaker of the House, goes to the other legislators and \nasks them, ``Bob, Susan, Bill, I need your vote on this,'' they will \nsay, ``Well, you know, if it is going to mean we have to raise taxes 27 \npercent, I do not think that is a great idea. I am not going to vote \nfor that,'' because they will have the right to say the Federal \nGovernment is getting ready to stick it to the States, getting ready to \nstick it to them in the dark because we are not telling them what it is \nall about.\n  I would suggest very simply, if these numbers that the Treasury \nDepartment have presented here are not accurate, then, fine. But we in \nthe Congress have an obligation to give them accurate figures as to how \nwe are going to \n[[Page S1990]] reach that goal of a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  Here is the resolution that the Governors have adopted, the \nDemocratic Governors. Everybody was all for it. They thought they were \ngoing to make us do something that was uncomfortable. Now they are \nfiguring out how it directly affects them. They are saying, ``Wait a \nminute.'' The Democratic Governors said:\n\n       We support a federally balanced budget amendment. The \n     Democratic Governors believe the citizens of this country \n     also deserve the right to know the implications of a \n     federally balanced budget amendment. Congress must detail its \n     plans to balance the budget before sending the resolution to \n     the States for ratification.\n\n  I think that is at least the minimum that we can do here at the \nFederal level as we debate this particular resolution. I suggest that \nit is important for us to let the States know what we are talking about \ndoing to them.\n  Final point: Some of my colleagues on this side have said, ``Well, we \ncannot do that. We do not know what it is going to be like 7 years from \nnow.'' I mean we do not know the economic conditions. We cannot project \nout 7 years. Last year and the year before last we passed the budget \nreconciliation bill. We did exactly what we are talking about doing \ntoday for 5 years. Would my colleague, since they cannot go 7 years, at \nleast tell the States what they can expect for 5 years? We do that all \nthe time. Every bill we bring up has a 5-year glidepath. How much are \nwe going to lose in taxes? How much are we going to raise? What kind of \nprograms are going to have to be cut to meet certain goals?\n  Let me ask my colleagues who say we cannot do it for 7, would you go \n5? Would you consider we do a budget resolution for 5 years and spell \nit out for 5 years as part of this balanced budget amendment? At least \nthe State of Louisiana would know what it is going to be like for 5 \nyears. I will go 5 years if we cannot go 7. Do not tell them we cannot \ngo 5 because we do that all the time. When we passed the budget \nreconciliation years ago, we cut the deficit by one-half trillion \ndollars. Not one Republican colleague stepped up to the plate to \nsupport that because it was tough.\n  I would simply suggest that it is not that we cannot do it, but \nrather that we will not do it. It is easy to pass a balanced budget \namendment in general terms, but this Congress, I would suggest, does \nnot have the courage or the wherewithal or the strength to tell the \nStates what it really means to them. How is it going to affect them? A \nbudget resolution accompanying this balanced budget amendment would let \nthe States know what we are really getting ready to do to them. \nShifting the burden of taxation is really easy. It is real easy. I will \ntell you. If I was a State, I would want this Congress and any Congress \nto accompany that balanced budget amendment with a budget resolution \nthat spells out exactly what it is going to mean. Without that, we do \nnot have a partnership. Without that, they do not have the information \nto make the right decision. I want to give it to them. I think that \nthey ought to look at it and decide whether that is what they want to \nratify. But do not ask them to do it in the dark.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on behalf of Senate Joint \nResolution 1, the resolution to provide for the ratification of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I want to commend Senator Hatch for his extraordinary work and \npatience in regard to this measure.\n And also Senator Simon, Senator Heflin, Senator Thurmond, and back \nthrough the years, Senator DeConcini. So many of us have worked for so \nlong on this measure. There are really no other questions to ask about \nthis measure. We have asked them all. We have heard every hypothetical, \nevery argument, every horror story. Everything that could possibly be \nlaid out would fill the Chamber to the seals on the ceiling.\n\n  Recently, the President, working with the then Democratic majority in \nboth Chambers of Congress, passed the latest in a series of deficit \nreduction plans. We have heard reference to that. We did the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993, or OBRA, and it was supposed to \nshave $500 billion off of the Federal deficit over the next 5 years. \nThis, of course, was $500 billion in ``deficit reduction,'' as defined \nin the exceedingly perverse language employed only here in Washington. \nMind you, this meant not that deficits would be $500 billion lower, or \nthat the total debt would be ``reduced''; it meant that rising deficits \nwould cumulatively amount to $500 billion less than some esoteric, \nabstract figure which only Washington policymakers seem to understand, \nand it is quaintly called ``the baseline.''\n  The ``baseline,'' of course, is everchanging. Lord only knows how the \nbaseline is properly figured, but its chief function seems to be as a \ndevice of consolation for the poor, beleaguered American taxpayer. Debt \ncontinues to compound and annual deficits are projected still to \nskyrocket. But, take heart, ye of the faithful, unwashed taxpayers, \nthere was an even worse scenario out there for you called ``the \nbaseline.'' Thank heavens we have all done better than that, and the \npublic is then assured that all is well.\n  Mr. President, all is not well, and all will not be well until this \nsituation is brought under control with finality. The 1993 budget was \nonly the latest in a long series of similarly hyped budget procedures. \nBoth parties and all Presidents have been so good at it. 1990 was the \nlast one before that, and I voted for that one. We have been passing \ndeficit reduction acts around here for as long as I can recall, and the \nnumbers are always off. They never match; they are never right. Five \nyears later, there was always some dramatic thing that skewed the \nnumbers.\n  Time and again, they have failed to resolve this situation once and \nfor all. Why is that? One reason and one reason only: Each one of them \nhas failed to deal with the fundamental problem of the entitlement \nspending explosion. The 1993 Budget Act most certainly failed to do \nthat. President Clinton proposed only modest reforms in Medicare, and \nhe had to face down a revolt from his own liberal wing and remove even \nthose slight changes in order to pass his Budget Act and leave that \nspending to grow on, unabated, unrestricted. All the while, Congress \nwas debating a huge new entitlement in the form of the Health Security \nAct.\n  What is the latest verdict on the 1993 Budget Act? Where are we \nheading now that we have passed this landmark legislation? The CBO has \njust reexamined the entire Federal budget outlook, and here is what \nthey find: In fiscal year 1994, the annual deficit amounted to $202 \nbillion. In fiscal year 1995, they project that figure will shrink to \n$176 billion, and there is joy in the streets with regard to that \nfigure--at least more joy on the other side of the aisle than here, \nbecause that does not mean we now will owe less money as a Nation; it \nis $176 billion more in debt that future taxpayers will have to pay \noff, but it would represent slightly less than we added in fiscal year \n1994.\n  Where do we go from here? In fiscal year 1996, the CBO tells us the \nannual deficit will again be back up to $207 billion--more than either \nof the 1995 or 1994 figures--and it keeps going up after that. We all \nknow it and we talk about the figures on the floor. It will go up to \n$253 billion in fiscal year 1999, and we all know it.\n  Not only do hundreds of billions in debts stand to be added to \nposterity's burden every year, but we stand to add to that debt still \nmore quickly--not at some distant, far-flung date, but next year, 1996, \naccording to CBO, is when annual deficits begin to skyrocket again.\n  Mr. President, the 1993 Budget Act affected no fiscal years earlier \nthan 1994. This is progress? Skyrocketing annual deficits are still \nprojected for as far as the eye can see beginning next year. I can \npersonally tell you that the long-term picture is much, much worse than \nthat.\n  I had the ``honor''--and I put that in quotation marks--to \nparticipate in the collective suicide mission that was known as the \nPresident's Bipartisan Entitlement Commission, or the Kerrey-Danforth \ncommission, named after its tireless chairman and vice chairman. If you \nwant to know what will happen to this country in the next century, in \nthe next 25 years, the next 50 years, get a copy of our report. There \nwere more than several Senators \n[[Page S1991]] on the bipartisan commission, a wonderful group of \npeople, Democrats and Republicans alike. Get a copy of the report that \nwas released last Friday. It lays it all out in vivid, full-color \ngraphs. The Senators involved on the entitlements commission were \nSenators Kerrey, Danforth, Moynihan, Sasser, Moseley-Braun, Reid, \nBumpers, Domenici, Gregg, Cochran, Wallop, and myself. We all were \ninvolved. See our work product. See that 30 of the 32 of us agreed that \nin the year 2012, even with no new spending initiatives and with no \nincrease in taxes, there will be only sufficient funds to pay for \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, the other \nentitlement programs, and interest on the national debt; and there will \nbe nothing--nothing--for defense, transportation, education, WIC, WIN, \nHead Start, NEA, NEH, or any other discretionary program of the Federal \nGovernment. Zap. Nothing. We all know that, too. At least 30 of 32 of \nus who sat for nearly a year know that. I would think our colleagues \nwould want to listen to what we presented.\n  But I favor the balanced budget amendment because I just simply think \nit is ``shock therapy.'' There is no other purpose for it. It is to \nforce us to confront the real components of the Government's spending \nproblem. The opponents of the balanced budget amendment say it is not \nneeded, that all is needed is for Congress to ``screw up'' its \ncollective courage to pass legislation curbing rising deficits. That is \nan appropriate, I think, two-word description of what we have been \ndoing with regard to the budget for years.\n  I know all too well what happens when you try to do that. You get \nexactly the sort of hysterical propaganda that is currently being \nhauled out in bales by the metric ton in opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Phrases ring through the Chamber: ``Tell us how you are going to take \nfood away from starving seniors and hungry children,'' they say. Spell \nit out to us. When you try to explain that you are only talking about \nmore modest increases in Government spending, you are lost and they are \nlost. And then they unleash on you.\n  We have not proposed a ``cut'' of anything in Social Security. We \nhave not proposed a ``cut'' of anything in Medicare, or a ``cut'' in \nMedicaid. We are just trying to slow the growth. Apparently, it is \nstill not being heard. So if Medicare is going up 9 percent, we say let \nus let it go up only 6 percent, and it is described to the American \npeople as a ``cut.'' It is a sad day for the use of the English \nlanguage and a true distortion of what is being said.\n  A 6-percent increase is not a cut. And it is sad to watch that \ncontinual description over the media and in this Chamber about cuts \nwhen all you are trying to do, and we all are trying to do, is limit \nthe increase in growth. Not a cut in a carload.\n  In short, Federal budget policy debates are eternally paralyzed \naround this place because the real issues are obscured in a haze of \nmisleading anecdotes, rhetoric, and carefully crafted statistics. Just \ntry to come down to the floor, as I say, and suggest that this year we \nare going to let Medicare go up only 8 or 6 percent instead of the 10 \nor 9 percent projected. Broadsides will be fired all across the country \nsaying that you are planning brutal cuts in Medicare. How could you--\nchoke, gasp, sob--do such things?\n  Why should you make such a heartless proposal anyway? Why not just \ncut foreign aid, or raise taxes on the rich, or get rid of the tse-tse \nfly study? That is a marvelous thing, if we could just get rid of the \ntse-tse fly study. It is only 100,000 bucks. Or get rid of the highway \ndemonstration projects. Try that one, at least in the House. They used \nto try it. That is like pulling teeth with no anesthetic. Or, of \ncourse, if we get rid of the restoration of Lawrence Welk's house, that \nwould do it. If we could only end that sort of thing. Or congressional \npay raises and we should look at that, indeed.\n  And we never did one of those here in all my time here while in the \ndark. The last one which was reported to the American public by the \nmedia was that we voted in the middle of the night for a pay raise. I \nthink it was about 9:45 in the evening and everybody was here and \neverybody voted ``yes'' or ``no.'' I do not think that is too much of a \nsecret endeavor. And anybody can go look and see how anybody voted. We \ndo not do it that way.\n  Well, maybe get rid of the franking privilege. That's it. That would \nsolve all our problems. Or just simply abolish waste, fraud, and abuse. \nOh, if we all did that, there would be no problem.\n  Well, so long as Congress is not forced to actually balance its \nbooks, it will be possible to survive politically--and there is the \nkey, ladies and gentleman--while pandering to every public \nmisconception there is about the structure of the Federal budget.\n  I have served our party as assistant leader for some 10 years. And I \ncommend my successor. He is doing a splendid job. I am proud of him, my \nfriend, Senator Trent Lott.\n  And, as an aside here, let me tell you why I am going to vote for \nterm limits, so that you may hear. Of course, I was not for it when I \nwas running for my third term, but that is another story! But I can \ntell you, I will vote for that and I will tell you why.\n  I cannot tell you how often--about once a month--in my duties I would \nsay, ``We need your vote. It is a very critical vote for the Nation's \nbest interest. We need it.'' And they would say, ``I know it is a \ncritically important vote and we do need it, but I cannot vote for it \nbecause if I do I will be history. I will be gone. I will not get \nreelected.'' And I would say, ``So this is your sole reason for not \nvoting for this amendment or this bill, is that you will not get \nreelected?'' And they would say, ``You got it.''\n  And so I say, nothing would be better than the term limits \nlegislation, because once it kicked in, one-third of this body would be \nvoting right. One third of these Senators would vote right. And then, \nin the duties of the leadership, all you would have to do is go find 18 \nother people out of that pool of about 40 who always cast the tough \nvotes. There are a group of about 40 in here, Democrat and Republican \nalike, who often cast the tough votes, consistent tough votes. Do term \nlimits, then you would have a third of them doing it right. They would \nbe unshackled and you then go dig up 18 more and you have your 51 to \npass an issue. It would change this body immensely.\n  So I certainly look forward to the day when the Congress actually has \nto balance the books as would be required by the Constitution of the \nUnited States and as required in constitutions of other States. And I \nsaid before and say again, it would be ``shock therapy.'' And I would \nrelish it.\n  Because everyone who has been making a lifetime career of running \nagainst foreign aid or for increased taxes on the rich or always \nprattling about class warfare and why cannot we just do what we were \nhired on to do--let us check them out in the old hypocrisy index. The \nindex hurt a lot of them in the last cycle. It scored up how much they \ntalked about cutting and how they actually voted, especially and solely \non spending. We all do it. I do it. We all do it. Look at our votes. \nOne man's junk is another man's treasure; some pet project, some \nmassive public works. We all do it. Every single one of us do it.\n  And so, if we would do those things, we would see those people \nexposed in one fell swoop. They will then be bound to the Constitution \nwith hoops of steel to balance the books, and when they come out with a \nproposal to eliminate the 1 percent of the budget that goes to foreign \naid--1 percent--that just will not get the job done, and they will be \nforced to come back and try again.\n  Or they will say, let us raise those taxes on ``the rich,'' and they \nwill get about a half inch closer to solving the problem that way and \nonce more they will have to try again.\n  I have a certain perverse strain in my nature. When people at a town \nmeeting say, ``Why don't you just nail the rich and we could seal this \nhole and make progress?''\n  I say, ``No, no. Let's not increase their taxes. Let's take \neverything they've got. Why mess around? Let's take every stock \ncertificate, every ranch, every yacht, every piece of property. Let's \ntake it all. Let's take every debenture. Let's take all the big family \nmoney in America, all the Wal-Marts, all of this, all of that.''\n  Guess what? It would be about $800 billion and that would run the \ncountry for 6 months--$800 billion would run the United States for \nabout 6 months. \n[[Page S1992]] That is in taking it all. That is in taking the Fortune \n500, the Forbes list, the whole works. Take it all, $750 billion or \n$800 billion, and yet the budget this year is $1.506 trillion. Not a \nvery good idea then, but it sounds so good.\n  Certainly, just as there are today, there will be those who will win \nelections by uttering such platitudes, and in today's process, they can \nstill go back to the electorate the next time around and say, ``Well, \nwe failed to balance the budget because the Congress didn't adopt my \nwisdom. We aren't taxing the rich enough, we did not cut foreign aid.'' \nAnd there are still some to cut out there. I saw it myself. ``There is \n$15 billion out there, folks,'' and they all get glandular reactions \nfrom that. But $15 billion will not get you there because the budget is \n$1.506 trillion. And who is the wiser in that process?\n  But with this amendment, this courageous amendment, the American \npublic will become educated in a real hurry about where and how the \nGovernment spends its money, and I am greatly looking forward to the \nanguish connected to it all. No wonder it is opposed by every special \ninterest group whose job it is to drain the Federal Treasury. Their \nexecutive directors are paid to horrify the membership to get them all \nworked up, to be sure that they earn their salary, to be sure the \nletters come cranking in, without regard to the burden placed on future \ntaxpayers.\n  Do you really think that the AARP--the American Association of \nRetired Persons--really wants the people of the United States, or even \ntheir membership, to really find out that you cannot enact their $1.3 \ntrillion--get this figure, $1.3 trillion--agenda and balance the books \nat the same time?\n  Hear me. This is a report from the National Taxpayers Union \nFoundation of April 28, 1993. The next time you go to a town meeting \nand the AARP is out there--and let us remember who they are--there are \n33 million of them who pay 8 bucks dues and they are bound together by \na common love of airline discounts,\n and automobile discounts and pharmacy discounts.\n\n  Do their members know what their agenda is, ladies and gentlemen? \nTheir agenda is this: Long-term health care for everyone in the United \nStates, regardless of their net worth or their income. Ring that one \nup. Universal long-term health care, regardless of wealth. That is $60 \nbillion over 10 years. Second, expand Medicaid to cover all below \npoverty, $35.7 billion over 10 years. Catastrophic care, $15.8 billion. \nMedicare to cover ``near elderly''--I suppose those are people that \nfall into the 45-year-old category, because that is only 5 years below \nthe admission date of your ``elderly'' age to get into the AARP; \nmembers only have to be 50, so I suppose ``near elderly'' is defined as \none 45 years old--that is $10 billion. Expanded Medicaid long-term \ncare, $7.3 billion. Changes in Social Security benefit formulas, $19.1 \nbillion. Expansions in earned income credit, $15.2 billion. Expansions \nof SSI, $7.7 billion. Housing assistance for all who qualify, $34.6 \nbillion.\n  So the next time Members are getting in a little scrap from the old \nAARP, and they are out there with signs and posters, ask them if they \nhave any grandchildren, first. That will get a rise out of them. Then \nask them how we are supposed to pay $1.3 trillion for the next 10 years \nto take care of their agenda they tell their Members about in their \nmagazine that looks like a clone of the Smithsonian magazine. Ask them.\n  I imagine my mail will pick up when I return to my chamber. There \nwill probably be a little bit of light anecdotal material like, ``You \nrotten--.'' I do not know what it will be, but it will be heavy, and it \nwill come from AARP members who do not know one thing about their \nmembership asking this Treasury to cough up 1.3 trillion bucks in the \nnext 10 years for people, regardless of their net worth or income.\n  Some of it is not ``affluence tested.'' We ought to affluence test it \nall. I want to be very clear. I am not talking about people who are \npoor. I am not talking about seniors who have no proper nutrition. I am \nnot talking about Meals on Wheels. I am not talking about Green Thumb. \nI am talking about people who, to some, the cost of living index and \nthe cost of living allowance is the cost of ``living it up.''\n  One of the saddest things--the saddest thing--that I saw in the \nentitlements commission was where a young man came and testified with a \nyoung people's advocacy group. Boy, young people better start paying \nattention here. These young people came and testified, one young man \nwith sadness, said that he visited his grandfather in Florida, and he \nloved his grandfather dearly. And the COLA, cost-of-living-allowance--\nto his grandfather, who was a lovely man and had done well in life, was \nwhether he would be able to upgrade his country club membership. Ladies \nand gentlemen, that is not what a COLA is for. A cost-of-living-\nallowance is something to take care of someone who is truly needing \nthat.\n  We are going to have to start affluence testing the COLA's. We are \nnot talking about cutting a single cent from a Social Security benefit. \nHear that one. I do not want to hear any more of that babble. Nobody \nhere except one group, which I believe is a remarkable group, including \nour former friends from the Senate, Paul Tsongas and Warren Rudman, \nhave suggested affluence testing of the benefits. I have not subscribed \nto that. But we are certainly going to subscribe to affluence testing \nof the COLA's or we will not make it, because they range between $7 \nbillion to $22 billion a year, depending on the Consumer Price Index, \nthe CPI. Unless we breathe reality into that index, we will not make \nit, either. It is distorted. It needs correction. It still has a \ncommodity designation in it called typewriters. It is not even current.\n  Well, I could go on, and Members are thinking, ``He is going to.'' \nBut I will say this. This is a tremendous challenge. The House has \ntaken up the burden. They secured 300 votes. We in the Senate should \npay careful attention.\n  Let me conclude with what should be obvious to all Members, if not so \nalready, is that the struggle is between those who are seeking to keep \nthis amendment in a form that can pass this Congress, and those who \nwill find every single indirect means to bring it crashing down.\n  I applaud the distinguished Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], \nthe very able, venerable conscience of the Senate, for his \nforthrightness and courage in opposing the balanced budget amendment. \nSubterfuges are not for him. Deception and chicanery are not his tools. \nHe is right out front. He openly declares his opposition to this \namendment, honestly lays himself out to the judgment of his \nconstituents, makes his argument, and states his reasons for opposition \nas his means of fighting hard against the passage of the amendment.\n  But it is my view that the greatest danger comes from those who will \nbe tripped up in supporting, with all good intention, any number of \namendments that will be offered as a means of peeling away the two-\nthirds majority support that the amendment must have. Members will see \nthose. And the House protected itself against those carve-outs.\n  Make no mistake: We will kill the balanced budget amendment if we \npass any modification that will leave us with a resolution where we \ncannot secure the necessary two-thirds in both the Senate and the House \nand we must not do that.\n  Let me put it quite bluntly: A vote to exempt Social Security from \nthe balanced budget amendment is a vote to kill the balanced budget \namendment; a vote to include a tax limitation is a vote to kill the \nbalanced budget amendment. I am not talking about motives here. I am \nspeaking of the serious practical effects. That is what will happen if \nthese modifications pass. A vote to create a capital budget is a vote \nto kill the balanced budget amendment. Those issues have been tested, \nfought over already in the House, and in the Senate for years in the \nJudiciary Committee. We want to send the balanced budget amendment to \nthe States for ratification. We need to keep it in a form we know to \nhave the requisite support. Every supporter of the balanced budget \namendment needs to clearly understand this, as there is little margin \nfor error at this stage of the game.\n  To those who assert that the balanced budget amendment would impose a \nterribly unfair burden on individual States as the Federal Government \npares down its spending, I make two \n[[Page S1993]] points in response, in final response. First, we just \ncompleted action on the unfunded mandates legislation. This is the best \never protection of its kind for State budgets. Second, it seems to me \nthat the States are in the best position to decide that, after all, and \nthis must be ratified by the States; three-fourths of them have to \ndecide that they want this. They are far better custodians of their own \ninterests than we could ever be.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to vigorous and healthy debate. I \nthink we have begun this on this issue of central importance to our \ncountry. I have great enthusiasm for this one, albeit a bit of a \npersonal stake. I personally assumed the ill-advised and totally \npolitically incorrect responsibility of charting out just how I would \nget this country's fiscal house in order during the coming decades. It \nis enclosed with the Entitlements Commission report. Members may ask me \nfor a copy, and I shall send it to Members in a brown, unmarked \nenvelope so Members need not know that we are really proposing some \ndramatic things. No one will know Members received it. And there is \nnothing I would enjoy more than some added company in the suicide \nmission, however involuntarily compelled. I seek your assistance if \nthis earnest effort.\n  I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the recognition. I \ndo not plan to take a long time in my remarks here on our \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I want to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] for her \ncooperation in allowing me to go forward. I want also to commend her \nfor her very fine statement on the balanced budget on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, the election of 1994 was more than the usual biennial \ncontest for seats in the Congress. It was, in effect, a national \nreferendum. The American people made a historic choice between more \ngovernment and less government. They chose the latter--less government. \nTheir message to us could not have been more clear. They want \nfundamental changes in the way the Congress conducts business.\n And the most important change they want is in the way we spend their \nmoney.\n\n  Every Member of Congress knows that the public wants a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. Poll after poll shows that. The \nonly question is whether we will give them what they want.\n  I think we will. I am convinced that no matter how ferocious the \nopposition, the time has finally come when the Congress will submit a \nbalanced budget amendment to the States.\n  I do not say that as boast or bravado because the drive for a \nbalanced budget amendment is not something for which we can take \ncredit. I do not think any of us in Washington can.\n  If there has ever been a grassroots crusade, this is it. If ever the \nAmerican people were determined to take the future back into their \nhands, I think it is now. That is the reason the House has already \npassed the joint resolution for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, the one we are debating now, by an overwhelming vote of \n300 to 133. That was a bipartisan vote, or rather, it was nonpartisan. \nAfter a lot of debate, after rejecting some tough amendments, and after \nresisting pressure from all the usual special interest groups, 300 \nCongressmen voted for this balanced budget amendment.\n  I hope the amendment will have the same broad support in the Senate. \nEven if, in the past, most of the votes have come from this side of the \naisle, it is obvious that there is support for it on the other side as \nwell. There is support for a balanced budget amendment from Republicans \nand Democrats, from conservatives, moderates, and liberals. And we \nshould come together, after full debate, vote on this issue and pass \nit.\n  The reason for the amendment's broad support, both in the Congress \nand most importantly among the public, is that it is no longer just a \nfiscal issue, no longer an accounting question. More than anything \nelse, it has become a moral issue with the American people. It has \nbecome a question of what we are doing to our children and our \ngrandchildren--leaving them a monstrous national debt of some $4 \ntrillion, a debt that will eventually crush the life out of their \neconomy and the spirit out of their enterprise.\n  There will be those who will say, ``Well, how did we get here? Why \ndidn't you fix this problem in the eighties? Why didn't we do more in \nthe seventies?'' We can debate that and we can point back, but I am \nreluctant to do that. A lot of us in this Chamber have to take some of \nthe blame. I think we all do, especially those of us who have been here \nmore than a couple of years.\n  So I am not trying to say the blame should go back to President \nCarter or President Reagan or President Bush or a Democrat Congress, or \nto the Appropriations Committee in the House or the Senate. That is \npast. Let us talk about how we can go forward and get control of the \ninsatiable appetite that we have developed over the last 40 years to \nspend and spend and spend. It is really that simple.\n  We cannot fix the deficit this year or in 2 years or in 3 years. But \nwe have to begin sometime, someplace. Now is the time, and this is the \nplace. We can get the budget on a glidepath toward balance over a \nperiod of years.\n  The number of years it takes is not as important as the fact that we \nget started.\n  Thomas Jefferson summed up the matter two centuries ago. This is not \none of his more familiar quotes, but I think it is important that \nThomas Jefferson, in retrospect, thought it was a mistake not to \ninclude a balanced budget requirement in the Constitution. This is what \nhe wrote:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     fundamental importance as to place it among the fundamental \n     principles of the government. We should consider ourselves \n     unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally \n     bound to pay them ourselves.\n\n  Those are powerful words from Mr. Jefferson. And when I said, a \nminute ago, that the deficit is more than an accounting problem or a \nfiscal problem, I was echoing Jefferson's observation that we are \nmorally bound to pay, ourselves, the debts that we incur and not dump \nthem off on our children. That is what is involved here.\n  Jefferson's advice has fallen on deaf ears in Congress, at least for \nthe last several decades. Even when the Republican economic program of \nthe early 1980's launched the longest peacetime economic expansion in \nour country's history, with a tremendous increase in revenues for the \nFederal Government, the Congress--and perhaps the executive branch as \nwell--managed to spend all that new money and still go deeper into \ndebt.\n  For the last 2 years, some people have been trying to revise history \nby making the decade of the eighties a bad time. But in fact, the \neighties were prosperous. A tremendous explosion of additional revenue \ncame into the Treasury. And with it, we should have been able to \ncontrol the deficit. But we did not do so because we kept spending even \nmore. Every time we got more revenue, we would spend more money.\n  We all go home to our States, counties, and cities and they say, \n``Can you help us with the water system?'' ``Can you help us with \nanother highway project?'' ``Can you help us with more funds for this \ngood program or that good program?\"\n  We all say, ``Gee, you're right.'' We want to do that. So we come \nback up here and want to give them everything they want. But in \nfairness, it should also be our responsibility to balance the books. We \nhave forgotten that part.\n  It is not as if we have not had enough revenue. We have had ever-\nincreasing revenue every year. But in search of even more revenues, \nCongress raised taxes in 1982, in 1984, in 1987, in 1989, in 1990, and \nmost recently in 1993 with a whopping $241 billion hike. Through it \nall, spending outran those revenue increases.\n  I voted for some of those tax increases because I thought, if the \npeople want all these expenditures, then we have to pay for them. So I \nvoted for the tax increases in 1982 and 1984 and, I recall, reluctantly \nin 1987. But then I said, ``Wait a minute, I'm not doing this anymore. \nEvery time I vote that way, it doesn't help reduce the deficit. We just \nspend even more.'' So I did not vote for a tax increase in 1990 when \nGeorge Bush was President, and I did not vote for it in 1993 when Bill \nClinton \n[[Page S1994]] was President. I decided that more revenue would not \nhelp to control spending or reduce the deficit. We would just spend it.\n  Time and again Congress promised to reform, lamely requiring a \nbalanced budget at sometime in the future. We had Gramm-Rudman. I voted \nfor that. I thought it would work. What did we do? We started off \nsaying, ``Look, we can't have it apply to this program or that \nprogram,'' and after a while, 21 programs were exempt. I was in the \ngang of 17 in the eighties when we tried to get control of spending. We \nhad the Fort Belvoir exercise in budget control. That didn't work \neither.\n  So time and time again we in Congress have tried to do it ourselves, \nto find a procedure to make it happen. It did not work. Those votes we \nhad did not do any good. The debt continued to increase to the point \nthat interest payments alone are costing us $230 billion in the current \nfiscal year.\n  It would be nice to think, Mr. President, that everyone on Capitol \nHill has learned their lesson and that things will be different from \nhere on. That is what Lucy tells Charlie Brown every time she pulls \naway the football and he lands flat on his back. Sooner or later, even \nCharlie Brown may run out of trust. The American people certainly have, \nand they said so last November. We fooled them too many times. That was \nthe real meaning of the 1994 elections.\n  In simplest of terms, the public took back the football. Now they are \ndemanding a permanent structural change in official Washington. They \nwill not be content with superficial adjustments. Who can blame them? \nThe Congress has not balanced the budget in a quarter of a century--\nsince 1969. And without the discipline of the balanced budget \namendment, I do not see any prospect of our doing it any time soon.\n  In recent years, poll after poll showed the public's poor regard for \nthe Congress. And yet, just recently our positive polling numbers \ndoubled, from the 20's to the 40's. What has happened in the last 2 or \n3 months that caused the approval rating of the Congress to go up?\n  I found out this past weekend when I went home. I went to Hernando, \nMS, to Grenada, Carroll County, and Cleveland. You know why people are \npleased with us now? Because they think we are beginning to do some of \nthe things they want us to do.\n  Now, they are still dubious. They want to see action, not just words. \nBut they like better what they see us talking about. They like the fact \nthat we are doing more things in a bipartisan way, and that maybe we \ncan work with the President. That's progress.\n  In recent years this institution, in my opinion, has been viewed as \nthe pickpocket at the parade. When we do business, the cheering stops. \nWe have to change that image.\n  This balanced budget amendment is our best means to set things \naright. It will do more than restore fiscal sanity to the Congress. It \nwill go a long way toward restoring the trust of the American people in \ntheir institutions of Government. That task is probably even more \nurgent than balancing the budget, although I think that is an important \npart of regaining that trust.\n  I realize that amending the Constitution is not a casual exercise. I \nstruggled with that. It is a last resort, sometimes a desperate resort, \nwhen all else has failed. That is the case with the amendment before \nus.\n  Many of us in Congress, both in the House and Senate, have worked \nover the years to stop, or at least slow down the spiral of debt. We do \nnot have much to show for our work. In the same way, the American \npeople have tried by protest and petition, by their voices and their \nvotes, to discipline the appetite of the Federal establishment, to \nrestrain its growth and limit its intrusion into their lives.\n  Those ways have not worked. So now we have no recourse. If the \nCongress would be fiscally restrained no other way, by either honor or \ncommon sense, then let it forever be bound by a constitutional \namendment.\n  If we want the people to trust us, we have to trust the people. We \nhave to trust their judgment about this amendment. Remember, they will \nmake the final decisions as to whether it becomes a part of the \nConstitution. Our vote here will only give the States the opportunity \nto vote. The State legislatures, on behalf of the people, decide \nwhether the language we have before us actually goes into the \nConstitution.\n  Sometimes they surprise us. If we get carried away, the States do not \nratify the amendments we send them. Recall that after the equal rights \namendment passed the Congress, and even after Congress gave it a \nlegally dubious extension of time to seek ratification, it did not get \nthe approval of three-quarters of the States.\n  The last constitutional amendment Congress approved, giving the \nDistrict of Columbia the same voting representation in Congress as the \nStates, failed miserably. Only a handful of States ratified it.\n  So if we do not deal with this amendment in the right way, the States \nwill simply not approve it. They will not rubberstamp the balanced \nbudget amendment or any other constitutional amendment we send them.\n  There are those who are going to say, ``Show me how you are going to \nbalance the budget. You say you are for a balanced budget amendment. \nShow me your cards.'' I think we could turn that around and say, ``Show \nme how you are going to do it if we do not pass a balanced budget \namendment.'' We have been going through that exercise for years. We \ncannot bind future Congresses. Budget projections are so unreliable, we \ncan barely depend on them for a year or two, much less through the \ndecade ahead. So much always depends on things we cannot know at the \npresent. We cannot say with great detail what money will be required \nfor defense or welfare or disaster relief in the future. We just have \nto get started. But there has to be a hammer, and this constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget is the hammer.\n  That is all the more reason to keep the language of this amendment \nclean. It is not a mere law, which we could come back to in a month and \namend. If ratified, it will be a part of the most remarkable political \ndocument in history: the Constitution of the United States.\n  That political treasure should not be made to read like a section of \nthe Code of Federal Regulations, citing chapter and verse of various \nprograms. Attempts along those lines are rightly suspect when they come \nfrom those who, for years or for decades, played key roles in running \nup the staggering deficits we now face.\n  The Federal deficit is like a fire consuming our national prosperity. \nAnd now the barnburners want to tell everybody else how to put out the \nflames and where to aim the hoses.\n  Their advice has a hollow ring. It seems designed to insulate the \nFederal spending machine, not any particular program. No one should be \nsurprised at that. The special interests that have, for so long, \ndominated the Government's budget do not want to leave their places at \nthe public trough. So they are fighting this amendment with every \ndiversion, every red herring they can devise.\n  Those liberal lobbies had their chance to appeal to the American \npeople last fall, but the voters resoundingly rejected their case. That \nis why we are now considering this amendment: Because the Federal gravy \ntrain stops here.\n  I realize that, to some of my colleagues, the balanced budget \namendment must seem like a repudiation of their entire career, negating \ntheir lifetime in public office. So be it. We are guaranteed a \nfavorable place in history only when we write it ourselves. This time \naround, others are doing the drafting.\n  Some may find comfort in the past, when it was political summertime, \nand the spending was easy. But those days are over. The American people \nare looking to the future, and they are determined to shape it their \nway, this time around.\n  The balanced budget amendment is one instrument for doing that. It \nshould not be delayed, or stalled, or stonewalled. But if it is, we can \ntake the time, days or weeks, with the Nation watching and listening.\n  After all, it took us decades to get this far. And with all due \nrespect to my colleagues who oppose the balanced budget amendment, I \nsay, in the words of the old song, ``we ain't gonna let nobody turn us \nround.''\n   [[Page S1995]] I feel sure I will be back in the Chamber before we \nfinish on this amendment to speak again. But we have a great \nopportunity here. The amendment is the responsible thing to do. There \nmay be efforts to distract us, and there are of course legitimate \nconcerns as well, but let us keep our eyes on the ball. If you are for \nthe balanced budget amendment, you should vote for the balanced budget \namendment, rather than finding excuses to oppose. There will not be any \nplace to hide this time. The American people will know who is for it \nand who is against it when we take the vote in a few days.\n  Mr. President, in view of the fact there are others on the floor \nwaiting to speak, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON.

Mr. President, I rise today to present the results \nof a very important study that has been conducted by the General \nAccounting Office on the condition of America's schools and to \nhighlight the merits of the Education Infrastructure Act.\n  Mr. President, this report by the GAO, entitled ``School Facilities--\nCondition of America's Schools,'' was issued yesterday, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the entire report by the GAO be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the U.S. General Accounting Office]\n\n           School Facilities--Condition of America's Schools\n\n     February 1, 1995.\n\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n       The nation has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in \n     school infrastructure to create an environment where children \n     can be properly educated and prepared for the future. Almost \n     exclusively a state and local responsibility, this \n     infrastructure requires maintenance and capital investment. \n     However, public concern is growing that while laws require \n     children to attend school, some school buildings may be \n     unsafe or even harmful to children's health. Recently, for \n     example, a federal judge would not allow the schools in our \n     nation's capital to open on time until thousands of life-\n     threatening fire code violations were corrected. Similarly, \n     noncompliance with asbestos requirements kept over 1000 New \n     York City schools closed for the first 11 days of the 1993 \n     school year. Although such situations may be well-publicized, \n     little information exists documenting the extent to which the \n     nation's schools may lack the appropriate facilities to \n     educate their students.\n       Widely quoted studies\\1\\ conducted in recent years report \n     that school facilities are in poor condition. While these \n     studies documented some problems and provided much anecdotal \n     information, they had different methodological problems \n     limiting their usefulness. Further, the Department of \n     Education has not assessed the condition of the nation's \n     school facilities since 1965. Accordingly, you requested that \n     we conduct a study that could be used as a basis for \n     determining the condition of the nation's school facilities.\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In response to your request and subsequent discussions with \n     your office, this report presents national information on (1) \n     the amount of funding that the nation's public elementary and \n     secondary schools report needing to improve inadequate \n     facilities and (2) the overall physical condition and \n     prevalence of schools that need major repairs. Another report \n     is forthcoming shortly that will report the location of and \n     other demographic analyses for schools that need major \n     repairs. These reports are the first in a series responding \n     to your request.\\2\\\n\n\n                            results in brief\n\n       Based on estimates by school officials in a national sample \n     of schools, we project that the nation's schools need about \n     $112 billion\\3\\ to repair or upgrade America's \n     multibillion\\4\\ dollar investment in facilities to good \n     overall condition.\\5\\ Of this, $11 billion (10 percent) is \n     needed over the next 3 years to comply with federal mandates \n     that require schools to make all programs accessible to all \n     students and to remove or correct hazardous substances such \n     as asbestos, lead in water or paint, materials in underground \n     storage tanks (UST), radon, or meet other requirements.\n       About two-thirds of America's schools reported that all \n     buildings were in at least overall adequate condition, at \n     most needing only some preventive maintenance or corrective \n     repair. However, about 14 million students attend the\n      remaining one-third of schools that reported needing \n     extensive repair or replacement of one or more \n     buildings.\\6\\ These schools are distributed nationwide. \n     Also, problems with major building features, such as \n     plumbing, are widespread even among those schools reported \n     in at least adequate condition. Almost 60 percent of \n     America's schools reported at least one major building \n     feature in disrepair, needing to be extensively repaired, \n     overhauled, or replaced. Most of these schools had \n     multiple problems. In addition, about half reported at \n     least one unsatisfactory environmental condition in their \n     schools, such as poor ventilation, heating or lighting \n     problems, or poor physical security. Most of these schools \n     also had multiple unsatisfactory environmental conditions. \n     Some district officials we spoke to told us that a major \n     factor in the declining physical condition of the nation's \n     schools has been decisions by school districts to defer \n     vital maintenance and repair expenditures from year to \n     year due to lack of funds.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       Elementary and secondary education, the nation's largest \n     public enterprise, is conducted in over 80,000 schools in \n     about 15,000 districts. America's public schools serve over \n     42 million students. About 70 percent of schools serve 27 \n     million elementary students; 24 percent serve 13.8 million \n     secondary students; and 6 percent serve 1.2 million students \n     in combined elementary and secondary and other schools.\n       America's traditional one-room school houses have been \n     replaced by larger facilities that may have more than one \n     building. Comprising classroom, administrative, and other \n     areas like gymnasiums and auditoriums, a school may have an \n     original building, any number of permanent additions to that \n     building, and a variety of temporary buildings--each \n     constructed at different times. Buildings that have been well \n     maintained and renovated at periodic intervals have a useful \n     life equivalent to a new building.\n       A number of state courts as well as the Congress have \n     recognized that a high-quality learning environment is \n     essential to educating the nation's children. Crucial to \n     establishing that learning environment is that children \n     attend school in decent facilities. ``Decent facilities'' was \n     specifically defined by one court as those that are ``* * * \n     structurally safe, contain fire safety measures, sufficient \n     exits, an adequate and safe water supply, an adequate sewage \n     disposal system, sufficient and sanitary toilet facilities \n     and plumbing fixtures, adequate storage, adequate light, be \n     in good repair and attractively painted as well as contain \n     acoustics for noise control. . . .''\\7\\ More recently, the \n     Congress passed the Education Infrastructure Act of 1984,\\8\\ \n     in which it stated that ``improving the quality of public \n     elementary and secondary schools will help our Nation meet \n     the National Education Goals.''\\9\\ Despite these efforts, \n     studies and media reports on school facilities since 1965 \n     indicate that many public elementary and secondary schools \n     are in substandard condition and need major repairs due to \n     leaking roofs, plumbing problems, inadequate heating systems, \n     or other system failures.\n       Although localities generally finance construction and \n     repair, with states playing a variety of roles,\\10\\ federal \n     programs have monies to help localities offset the impact of \n     federal activities, such as Impact Aid,\\11\\ improving\n      accessibility for the disabled, and managing hazardous \n     materials. However, these programs do not totally offset \n     all costs. For example, prior GAO work found that federal \n     assistance provided for asbestos management under the \n     Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984 did not meet \n     the needs of all affected schools. From 1988 through 1991, \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received 1,746 \n     qualified applications totaling $599 million but only \n     awarded $157 million to 586 school districts it considered \n     to have the worst asbestos problems. EPA was aware of the \n     shortfall in federal assistance but believed that state \n     and local governments should bear these costs.\\12\\\n       Because of the perception that federal programs--as well as \n     current state and local financing mechanisms--did not begin \n     to address the serious facilities needs of many of America's \n     schools, the Congress passed the Education Infrastructure Act \n     of 1994. The Congress then appropriated $100 million for \n     grants to schools for repair, renovation, alteration, or \n     construction.\n\n\n                         scope and methodology\n       To determine the amount of funding needed to improve \n     inadequate facilities and the overall physical condition and \n     prevalence of schools that need major repairs, we surveyed a \n     national sample of schools and augmented \n     [[Page S1996]] the survey with visits to selected school \n     districts. We used various experts to advise us on the design \n     and analysis of this project. (See app. III for a list of \n     advisers.)\n       We sent the survey to a nationally representative \n     stratified random sample of about 10,000 schools in over \n     5,000 school districts. The sample was designed for the \n     Department of Education's 1994 Schools and Staffing Survey \n     (SASS), which is sponsored by the National Center for \n     Educational Statistics.\n       We asked about (1) the physical condition of buildings and \n     major building features, such as roofs; framing, floors, and \n     foundations; exterior walls and interior finishes; plumbing; \n     heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); and \n     electric power; (2) the status of environmental conditions, \n     such as lighting, heating, and ventilation; (3) the amount \n     districts and schools had spent in the last 3 years or plan\n      to spend in the next 3 years due to federal mandates that \n     require managing or correcting hazardous materials \n     problems and providing access to all programs for all \n     students; and (4) an estimate of the total cost of needed \n     repairs, renovations, and modernizations to put all \n     buildings in good overall condition. (See app. IV for a \n     copy of the questionnaire.)\n       We directed the survey to those officials who are most \n     knowledgeable about facilities--such as facilities directors \n     and other central office administrators of the districts that \n     housed our sampled school buildings. Our analyses are based \n     on responses from 78 percent of the schools sampled. Analyses \n     of non-respondent characteristics showed them to be similar \n     to respondents. Findings from the survey have been \n     statistically adjusted (weighted) to produce nationally \n     representative estimates. All of the data are self-reported, \n     and we did not independently verify their accuracy. See the \n     forthcoming report on location and demographic analyses of \n     schools in need of major repair for a detailed description of \n     our data collection methods and analysis techniques, \n     confidence intervals and the like.\n       In addition, we visited 41 schools in 10 selected school \n     districts varying in location, size, and minority \n     composition. During these visits, we observed facility \n     conditions and interviewed district and local school \n     officials to obtain information on facilities assessment, \n     maintenance programs, resources, and barriers encountered in \n     reaching facility goals. (See app. I for profiles on the \n     districts visited.)\n       We conducted this study from April 1994 to December 1994 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n\n\n                           principal findings\n\n         Schools Report Needing Billions to Improve Facilities\n\n       On the basis of our survey results, we estimate that the \n     nation's schools need $112 billion to complete all repairs, \n     renovations, and modernizations required to restore \n     facilities to good overall condition and to comply with \n     federal mandates. (See fig. 1.) This amount includes $65 \n     billion--about $2.8 million per school--needed by one-third \n     of schools for which one or more entire building needs major \n     repairs or replacement. Another 40 percent of schools (those \n     in adequate or better condition) reported needing $36 \n     billion--$1.2 million per school--to repair or replace one\n      or more building features,\\13\\ such as the plumbing or roof \n     or to make other corrective repairs.\n       [Figure 1 not reproduced in the Record.]\n       Almost two-thirds of the schools reported needing $11 \n     billion--an average of $.2 million per school--to comply with \n     Federal mandates over the next 3 years. Of this amount, about \n     $6 billion (55 percent) is needed by schools to make programs \n     accessible to all students while about $5 billion (45 \n     percent) is needed to correct or remove hazardous substances \n     such as asbestos, lead in water or paint, materials contained \n     in USTs, radon, or meet other requirements.\n       This $11 billion is in addition to the $3.8 billion \n     reported spent by three-quarters of all schools in the last 3 \n     years to comply with Federal mandates. Of the money schools \n     reported that they spent to comply with Federal mandates, \n     $2.3 billion (60 percent) went to correct or remove hazardous \n     substances--primarily asbestos--while $1.5 billion (40 \n     percent) to make all programs accessible to all students.\n       [Figure 2 not reproduced in the Record.]\n       District officials we spoke with reported that they must \n     also comply with many State and local mandates. For example, \n     one urban district reported how Federal, State, and local \n     regulations govern many of the same areas such as hazardous \n     materials management and some aspects of indoor air quality. \n     In addition, officials cited numerous State health and \n     sanitation codes, State safety inspections for building \n     features, as well as city zoning ordinances, local building \n     codes, and historic preservation regulations. By 1992, the \n     enormity of the requirements as well as decades of capital \n     needs underfunding have resulted in only the 2 newest of \n     their 123 schools complying with all current codes.\n       The district further described how these regulations and \n     the accompanying cost could apply to the installation of air \n     conditioning. For example, air conditioning could be \n     installed in a building for $500,000. However, this may also \n     require an additional $100,000 in fire alarm/smoke detection \n     and emergency lighting systems as well as $250,000 in \n     architectural modifications for code compliance. \n     Additionally, the location of outside chillers may be \n     regulated by zoning and historic preservation ordinances.\n       In our visits to selected districts, officials from major \n     urban areas reported needing billions to put their schools \n     into good overall condition.

About 60 percent (including some \n     schools in adequate condition) reported that at least one \n     building feature needed extensive repair, overhauling, or \n     replacement; and three-quarters of those schools needed \n     multiple features repaired. Features most frequently reported \n     in need of such repairs were HVAC; plumbling; roofs; exterior \n     walls, finishes, windows, and doors; electrical power; \n     electrical lighting; and interior finishes and trims. (See \n     fig. 4 and pictures in app. II.) Further, while 41 percent of \n     all schools reported unsatisfactory energy efficiency, 73 \n     percent of those schools with exterior walls, windows, and \n     doors and 64 percent of those with roofs in need of major \n     repair reported unsatisfactory energy efficiency. These \n     unrepaired features not only reduce energy efficiency but may \n     also have an adverse environmental effect on students.\n       As one Chicago elementary school principal told us, ``Heat \n     escapes through holes in the roof; the windows leak (the ones \n     that are not boarded up) and let in cold air in the winter so \n     that children must wear coats to class.''\n       In New Orleans, the damage from Formosan termites has \n     deteriorated the structure of many schools. In one elementary \n     school, they even ate the books on the library shelves as \n     well as the shelves themselves. (See app. II.) This, in \n     combination with a leaking roof and rusted window wall, \n     caused so much damage that a large portion of the 30-year-old \n     school has been condemned. The whole school is projected to \n     be closed in 1 year.\n       At a Montgomery County, Alabama, elementary school, a \n     ceiling weakened by leaking water collapsed 40 minutes after \n     the children left for the day.\n       Water damage from an old (original) boiler steam heating \n     system at a 60-year-old junior high school in Washington, \n     D.C., has caused such wall deterioration that an entire wing \n     has been condemned and locked off from use. Steam damage is \n     also causing lead-based wall paint to peel.\n       Raw sewage backs up on the front lawn of a Montgomery \n     County, Alabama, junior high due to defective plumbing.\n       [[Page S1997]] A New York City high school built around the \n     turn of the century has served as a stable, fire house, \n     factory, and office building. The school is overcrowded with \n     580 students, far exceeding the building's 400 student \n     capacity. The building has little ventilation (no vents or \n     blowers), despite many inside classrooms, and the windows \n     cannot be opened, which makes the school unbearably hot in \n     the summer. In the winter, heating depends on a fireman's \n     stoking the coal furnace by hand.\n       In Ramona, California, where overcrowding is considered a \n     problem, one elementary school is comprised entirely of \n     portable buildings. It had neither a cafeteria nor auditorium \n     and used a single relocatable room as a library, computer \n     lab, music room, and art room.\n       Last year, during a windstorm in Raymond, Washington, the \n     original windows of an elementary school built in 1925 were \n     blown out, leaving shards of glass stuck in the floor. The \n     children happened to be at the other end of the room. This \n     wooden school is considered a fire\n      hazard, and although hallways and staircases can act as \n     chimneys for smoke and fire, there is only one external \n     exit on the second floor.\n       In rural Grandview, Washington, overcrowded facilities are \n     a problem. At one middle school, the original building was \n     meant to house 450 students. Two additions and three \n     portables have been added to accommodate 700 students. The \n     school has seven staggered lunch periods. The portables have \n     no lockers nor bathrooms and are cold in the winter and hot \n     in the spring/summer.\n       In a high school in Chicago, the classroom floors are in \n     terrible condition. Not only are floors buckling, so much \n     title is loose that students cannot walk in all parts of the \n     school. The stairs are in poor condition and have been cited \n     for safety violations. An outside door has been chained for 3 \n     years to prevent students from falling on broken outside \n     steps. Peeling paint has been cited as a fire hazard. Heating \n     problems result in some rooms having no heat while other \n     rooms are too warm. Leaks in the science lab caused by \n     plumbing problems prevent the classes from doing experiments. \n     Guards patrol the outside doors, and all students and \n     visitors must walk through metal detectors before entering \n     the school.\n       During our school visits, we found wide disparities between \n     schools in the best or even average condition and schools in \n     the worst condition, and these schools were sometimes in the \n     same district.\n\n                        Environmental Conditions\n\n       About 50 percent of the schools reported at least one \n     unsatisfactory environmental condition; while 33 percent \n     reported multiple unsatisfactory conditions. Of those, half \n     reported four to six unsatisfactory conditions. Those \n     conditions most frequently reported to be unsatisfactory were \n     acoustics for noise control, ventilation, and physical \n     security. (See fig. 5.) Additionally, three-quarters of \n     schools responding had already spent funds during the last 3 \n     years on requirements to remove or correct hazardous \n     substances such as asbestos (57 percent), lead in water or \n     paint (25 percent), materials in USTs such as fuel oil (17 \n     percent), radon (18 percent), or other requirements (9 \n     percent). Still two-thirds must spend funds in the next 3 \n     years to comply with these same requirements--asbestos (45 \n     percent), lead (18 percent), UST (12 percent), radon (12 \n     percent), or other requirements (8 percent).\n       We saw numerous examples of unsatisfactory environmental \n     conditions during our school visits:\n       In the Pomona, California, school district, the student \n     body has increased 37 percent over the last 10 years. Some \n     schools must have five staggered lunch periods to accommodate \n     all students. As a result of overcrowding, in one elementary \n     school, students are housed in temporary buildings installed \n     in 1948 that are unattractive, termite ridden, dark, and \n     underequipped with electrical outlets. The temporary \n     buildings get very hot as well as very cold at times because \n     of poor insulation.\n       A Raymond, Washington, high school--a three-story structure \n     with walls of unreinforced concrete with roof and floor not \n     adequately secured to the walls that may not withstand \n     earthquakes--contains steam pipes that are not only extremely \n     noisy but provide too little or too much heat from room to \n     room.\n       In Richmond, Virginia, schools in the district close early \n     in September and May because the heat combined with poor \n     ventilation and no air conditioning creates health problems \n     for students and teachers, especially those with asthma.\n       A Chicago elementary school, built in 1893 and not painted \n     for many years, had walls and ceilings with chipping and \n     peeling lead-based paint, contains asbestos and has several \n     boarded-up windows. Some rooms have inadequate lighting due \n     to antiquated lighting fixtures that are no longer \n     manufactured, so bulbs could not be replaced when burned out. \n     One section of the school has been condemned due to \n     structural problems. However, the auditorium and gym in this \n     area are still used. The school was scheduled for closure in \n     1972 but remained open due to community opposition to the \n     closure with promises of renovation by the district.\n\n     Insufficient Funds Contribute to Declining Physical Conditions\n\n       District officials we spoke to attributed the declining \n     physical condition of America's schools primarily to \n     insufficient funds, resulting in decisions to defer \n     maintenance and repair\\15\\ expenditures from year to year. \n     This has a domino effect. Deferred maintenance speeds up the \n     deterioration of buildings, and costs escalate accordingly, \n     further eroding the nation's multibillion dollar investment \n     in school facilities. For example, in many schools we \n     visited, unrepaired leaking roofs caused wall and floor \n     damage that now must also be repaired. New York school \n     officials told us that, while a typical roof repair is $600, \n     a full roof replacement costs $300,000, and painting and \n     plastering 10 rooms on a top floor that has been damaged by \n     water infiltration costs $67,500 plus $4,500 to replace \n     damaged floor tiles. In other words, for every $1 not \n     invested, the system falls another $620 behind. In addition, \n     unrepaired roofs cause energy costs to increase as heat \n     escapes through holes, further depleting already limited \n     funds. Further, due to lack of routine maintenance in the \n     Chicago district, many schools have not been painted since \n     they were painted 20 years ago with lead-based paint.\n       In an elementary school in New York City, repair problems \n     had not been addressed since the school was built 20 years \n     ago. Problems that could have been addressed relatively \n     inexpensively years ago have now caused major problems such \n     as sewage leaking into the first grade classrooms, a leaking \n     roof that is structurally unsound, and crumbling walls.\n       Similarly, in Chicago, we visited an elementary school \n     whose roof, the principal told us, had needed replacement for \n     20 years. Because it had only been superficially patched, \n     rather than replaced, the persistent water damage had caused \n     floors to buckle and plaster on the walls and ceilings to \n     crumble. It had also flooded parts of the electric wiring \n     system. One teacher in this school would not turn on her \n     lights during rainstorms for fear of electrical shock; in \n     another classroom the public address system had been rendered \n     unusable. Buckets had to be placed on the top floor of the \n     school to catch the rain.\n       Some district officials we spoke with reported that they \n     had difficulty raising money for needed repairs and \n     renovation due to an anti-tax sentiment among voters \n     resulting in the failure of bond issues as well as passage of \n     property tax limitations. About one in three districts \n     reported that\n      they have had an average of two bond issues fail in the past \n     10 years. Further, school officials told us that often \n     bond proceeds are far less than needed for repairs. For \n     example, in Pomona, California, a $62.5 million bond issue \n     was submitted to the voters after a survey indicated that \n     the $200 million needed for repairs would be rejected. At \n     the time of our survey, 6 percent of districts had a bond \n     issue before the electorate. However, as one survey \n     respondent commented, ``the current public attitudes about \n     the economy and education are generally so negative that \n     passing a bond referendum is a fantasy.'' Other states \n     have reduced school funding by passing property tax \n     limitations. One survey respondent reported, ``The state's \n     contribution to local schools has dropped by 40 percent \n     over the last few years * * *.'' According to another \n     survey respondent, ``This is a 1913 building which many of \n     the taxpaying citizens feel was good enough for them * * * \n     it is looked at as a monument in the community. Unless \n     some form of outside funding is arranged, the citizens may \n     never volunteer to replace this building since it will \n     require raising their taxes.''\n       Further, districts reported a lack of control over some \n     spending priorities as they must fund a large portion of \n     federal mandates for managing or correcting hazardous \n     materials as well as making all programs accessible to all \n     students. A recurring theme in comments from survey \n     respondents was that ``Unfunded federal and state mandates \n     are one of the prime causes of lack of funds for replacing \n     worn-out heating and cooling equipment, roofs, etc. * * *'' \n     Another survey respondent stated, ``The ADA requirements were \n     a major reason we had to replace two older schools. These \n     costs, when added to other costs for renovations and \n     modifications, resulted in overall costs for repairs, which \n     exceeded the costs for new facilities.'' On the other hand, \n     Chicago school officials told us that due to limited funds \n     and the cost of installing one elevator being $150,000, very \n     few schools are able to provide program access to all \n     students.\n       In looking at the uses of bond proceeds in the districts, \n     the average amount of the most recently passed bond issue was \n     $7 million. While about 3 percent was provided for federal \n     mandates, 54 percent was provided for school construction and \n     38 percent for repairing, renovating, and modernizing \n     schools. The remaining 5 percent was spent for purchases of \n     computers and telecommunications equipment.\n       Districts also said that they must sometimes divert funds \n     initially planned for facilities maintenance and repair to \n     purchase additional facilities due to overcrowding. This\n      has resulted from both demographic and mandated changes. For \n     example, additional funds were required for construction \n     and purchase of portables due to large immigrant influxes \n     as well as population shifts in districts or climbing \n     enrollment due to overall population increases. Further, \n     some mandated school programs, such as special education, \n     require additional space for low pupil-teacher ratios.\n       One survey respondent described the competing demands on \n     limited funds as follows: \n     [[Page S1998]] ``Our school facilities are not energy \n     efficient or wired for modern technology. Our floor tile is \n     worn out and the furniture is in poor shape. Our taxpayers \n     don't want to put any more in schools. Our teachers want \n     better pay. Our students and parents want more programs and \n     technology. HELP!!!''\n\n              Building Age--By Itself--Is Not Significant\n\n       While some studies cite building age as a major factor \n     contributing to deteriorating conditions, older buildings \n     often have a more sound infrastructure than newer buildings. \n     Buildings built in the early years of this century--or \n     before--frequently were built for a life span of 50 to 100 \n     years while more modern buildings, particularly those built \n     after 1970, were designed to have a life span of only 20 to \n     30 years. A study of English school facilities found that the \n     schools built during the 1960s and 1970s were built quickly \n     and cheaply and have caused continuing maintenance \n     problems.\\16\\ As one survey respondent commented, ``the \n     buildings in this district are approximately 20 years old, \n     but the exterior siding was inferior from the beginning * * * \n     it has deteriorated and ruptured extensively. * * *'' A \n     principal in Chicago stated about her 1970s building, ``our \n     most pressing problem is that the school is crumbling down \n     around us * * *. From the beginning, this building has had \n     serious roof problems. Water leaks throughout the building \n     from the roof and from the walls. Pools of water collect in \n     the floors of the classrooms. One wall has buckled and is \n     held in place with a steel stake. The windows leak and let \n     cold air in * * *.'' According to some school officials, the \n     misperception about the age factor has been reinforced \n     because older buildings are sometimes not maintained but \n     allowed to deteriorate until replaced.\n       Three schools we visited in Chicago presented a good \n     example of the difficulty of using age to define condition. \n     All three were built between 1926 and 1930 and had the same \n     design and basic structure. Today, their condition could not \n     be more different. One school had been allowed to deteriorate \n     (had received no renovation since the 1970s) until it reached \n     a point where local school officials classified it as among \n     those schools in the worst physical condition. The second \n     school had received some recent renovation because of \n     community complaints about its condition and was classified \n     as a typical school for the school district. The third school \n     had been well maintained throughout the years, and now school \n     officials classified it as a school in the best physical \n     condition. (See pictures contrasting the three schools in \n     fig. 6.)\n       [Figure 6 not reproduced in Record.]\n                              conclusions\n\n       Two-thirds of America's schools report that they are in \n     adequate (or better) overall condition. Still, many of these \n     schools need to repair or replace one or more building \n     feature, manage or correct hazardous materials, or make all \n     programs accessible to all students. Other schools have more \n     serious problems. About 14 million students are required to \n     attend the remaining one-third of schools that have one or \n     more entire buildings in less-than-adequate condition, \n     needing extensive repair or replacement. These schools are \n     distributed nationwide.\n       Our survey results indicate that to complete all repairs, \n     renovations, or modernizations needed to put school buildings \n     into good overall condition and comply with federal mandates \n     would require a projected investment of $112 billion. \n     Continuing to delay maintenance and repairs will defer some \n     of these costs but will also lead to the need for greater \n     expenditures as conditions deteriorate, further eroding the \n     nation's multibillion dollar investment in school \n     infrastructure. In addition, if maintenance continues to be \n     deferred, a large proportion of schools that are in only \n     adequate condition and need preventive maintenance or \n     corrective repair will soon deteriorate to less-than-adequate \n     condition.\n       As one survey respondent observed, ``It is very difficult \n     to get local communities to accept this burden (facilities \n     construction/renovation). Our district, one of the wealthiest \n     in the state, barely passed a bare bones budget to renovate. \n     It must be a national crisis.''\n\n\n                            agency comments\n\n       We spoke with Department of Education officials at the \n     National Center for Educational Statistics who reviewed a \n     draft of this report and found the report well done and \n     generally approved of the approach. In addition, staff from \n     the Office of the Undersecretary provided us with technical \n     comments that we incorporated into our report.

During \n     these visits, we observed facility conditions and interviewed \n     district and local school officials to get information on \n     facilities assessment, maintenance programs, resources, and \n     barriers encountered in reaching facilities goals. We asked \n     officials to show us examples of ``best,'' ``typical,'' and \n     ``worst'' schools and verified the reliability of these \n     designations with others. In some small districts, we visited \n     all schools.\n\n\n                           chicago, illinois\n\n                                Overview\n\n                      TABLE I.1.--CHICAGO, ILLINOIS                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnrollment.........................  400,000.                           \nNumber of schools..................  553.                               \nRacial composition.................  56 percent black.                  \n                                     30 percent Hispanic.               \n                                     14 percent other.                  \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..  67 percent.                        \nType...............................

Widespread disparities exist, however, between \n     schools in the best and worst condition. About 15 percent of \n     the schools were built before 1900, and over half are more \n     than 50 years old. Slightly more than 25 percent were built \n     during the fifties and sixties to handle the baby boom, and \n     20 percent were built during the last 25 years. However, a \n     number of the newer structures are temporary buildings or \n     ``demountables'' (large sections of prefabricated frames put \n     together on a cement slab). These buildings now show major\n      structural damage, and the seams of the buildings are \n     splitting apart. Permanent buildings also have structural \n     damage. For example, we visited two schools that had \n     chained exit doors to prevent students from either being \n     hit by debris from a cracking exterior brick wall--in a \n     ``typical'' Chicago school--or falling on collapsing front \n     steps--in a ``worst'' school.\n       Schools in the worst condition need new exterior building \n     envelopes (roofs, tuck pointing, windows, and doors), have \n     asbestos or lead-based paint, suffer ceiling and floor \n     problems from leaky roofs, and need to replace outdated \n     electrical and plumbing systems. Schools in the best \n     condition tend to be newer, need few or no repairs, have a \n     more flexible space design, contain electrical systems \n     capable of housing new technology, have air conditioning, and \n     offer brightly colored walls and low ceilings. However, \n     condition does not depend on age alone; three schools we \n     visited typifying best, worst, and typical were all over 60 \n     years old.\n       Officials report that their biggest facility issues are \n     deferred maintenance and overcrowding. They say that a \n     shortage of funds, caused by a lack of taxpayer support, \n     hinders the district from either upgrading or maintaining its \n     facilities. About 30 to 40 percent of needed repairs have \n     been deferred from year to year for decades with priority \n     given to repairs that ensure student safety. Additionally, \n     some federal mandates--particularly lead and asbestos removal \n     abatement programs--have caused major expenditures as most \n     schools built between 1920 and 1979 contain asbestos, and all \n     schools were painted with lead paint before 1980.\n       Overcrowding began in the seventies with a great increase \n     in the Hispanic population. However, in some instances, \n     individual schools may be overcrowded, while neighboring \n     schools remain underenrolled. One official told us that this \n     is due in part to the problems caused by gang ``turf'' and \n     the threat of extreme violence or even death to individuals \n     who wander into ``enemy'' territory. School officials are \n     reluctant to reassign students if the receiving schools are \n     in territory controlled by a different gang than that of the \n     overcrowded school the children presently attend.\n\n                          Facilities Financing\n\n       Officials estimate that they need $2.9 billion to put \n     schools in good overall condition. While the primary source \n     of school funding is local property taxes, smaller amounts of \n     state and federal funds are also used. Although the 1994 \n     school facilities budget is $270 million (10 percent of the \n     total education budget), only about $50 million is used for \n     maintenance and repair. To obtain funds for building and \n     renovating, the district relies on bonds, we were\n      told, as politicians hesitate to ask anti-tax voters for \n     even a minimal increase in taxes.\n\n\n                         grandview, washington\n\n                                Overview\n\n                    TABLE I.2.--GRANDVIEW, WASHINGTON                   \nEnrollment.........................  2,800.                             \nNumber of schools..................  5.                                 \nRacial composition.................  67 percent Hispanic.               \n                                     32 percent white.                  \n                                     1 percent other.                   \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..  65 percent.                        \nType...............................

While the high school, built in 1978, is in \n     excellent condition, the other four schools, built between \n     1936 and 1957, need to be totally renovated or replaced over \n     the next 10-20 years. In addition, a student population \n     increasing annually at about 4 percent since 1986 has \n     resulted in overcrowding. Although Grandview's middle school \n     was built to house 475 students, current enrollment stands at \n     about \n     [[Page S1999]] 700. One elementary school designed for 375 \n     students now has 464. Another crowded elementary school \n     converted the gymnasium into two classrooms. The district \n     currently has 14 portable classrooms in use and anticipates \n     needing 4 more in the next 3 years.\n\n                          Facilities Financing\n\n       Grandview schools have an annual budget of $13.5 million, \n     about 2 percent of which goes for maintenance. They receive \n     funding from local tax levies and from the state and general \n     apportionment of about $4,000 per student. They are also \n     eligible for state equalization funding contingent on passing \n     their levy. New construction and renovation are funded by \n     bond issues and state funding assistance contingent on \n     passing the bond issue. An $11 million bond issue to build a \n     new middle school to alleviate crowding failed in February \n     1994 and again in the fall of 1994.\n       Funding problems include public resistance to raising taxes \n     and decreased state assistance due to a reduction in the \n     timber sales on the public lands that support school \n     construction funding.\n\n\n                       MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA\n\n                                Overview\n\n                 TABLE I.3.--MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA                 \nEnrollment.........................  35,000.                            \nNumber of schools..................  54.                                \nRacial composition.................  45 percent black.                  \n                                     55 percent white.                  \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..  58 percent.                        \nType...............................

However, approximately 10 \n     percent of the schools need to be replaced. In the last 20 \n     years, about 8 schools were built. The oldest building is a \n     portion of an elementary school built in 1904.\n       Schools built during the early 1900's are not air \n     conditioned and need new roofs. At one elementary school we \n     visited, a ceiling recently collapsed just 40 minutes after \n     the children left for the day. Some schools have had students \n     in ``temporary'' buildings for years. In addition, many \n     repairs and renovations are needed to maintain schools, \n     accommodate overcrowding and comply with federal mandates.\n       Overcrowding problems have resulted in the use of 284 \n     portable buildings to house students. In the 1980's, \n     Montgomery County's student population increased, creating \n     the need for new elementary populations at some schools \n     through voluntary student movement, through a minority to \n     majority transfer process. This process allowed minority \n     students to attend any school in the county with a more than \n     50-percent majority of white students. Primarily, we were \n     told, minority students chose to attend schools on the east \n     side of town because the school facilities were better \n     equipped and\n      nicer. To provide adequate instructional space for the \n     influx of children at the east side schools, portable \n     rooms were added.\n\n                          Facilities Financing\n\n       Lack of money prohibits the district from making needed \n     facilities repairs. The operations and maintenance budget has \n     dropped 10 percent in the past 3 to 4 years. The current \n     facilities budget is $1 million of a $6 million total \n     education budget. The district has no capital improvement \n     budget. On June 28, 1994, voters defeated a local tax \n     referendum for bond money the county had planned to use to \n     remove all portable buildings, make all needed repairs and \n     renovations and build new schools located so that children \n     from the west side of town would not have to travel so far \n     for better school accommodations.\n\n\n                         new orleans, louisiana\n\n                                Overview\n\n                   TABLE I.4.--NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA                   \nEnrollment........................................  85,000.             \nNumber of schools.................................  124.                \nRacial composition................................  90 percent black.   \n                                                    10 percent other.   \nStudents on free or reduced lunch.................  85 percent.         \nType..............................................

Suffering \n     from years of neglect due to lack of funds for repair and \n     maintenance, New Orleans students attend schools suffering \n     from hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of uncorrected \n     water and termite damage. Fire code violations are so \n     numerous that school officials told us, ``We don't count \n     them--we weigh them.''\n       Most of the buildings have no air conditioning, though the \n     average morning relative humidity in New Orleans is 87 \n     percent. One high school recently had an electrical fire that \n     started in the 80-year-old timbers in the roof. No one was \n     hurt but the students were sent to other buildings for the \n     rest of the year. An elementary school, built in 1964, was \n     condemned and closed in 1994 due to water and termite damage.\n\n                          Facilities Financing\n\n       New Orleans uses local property taxes and federal asbestos \n     loans to upgrade its buildings. The district has submitted \n     five bond issues to the voters in the last 20 years, for a \n     total of $175 million, but only two of the bond issues have \n     passed. The school facilities annual budget in 1994 is $6 \n     million or 2 percent of the total education budget. This has \n     decreased in the past 10 years from $9 million (4 percent of \n     the education budget).\n\n\n                           new york, new york\n\n                                Overview\n\n                     TABLE I.5.--NEW YORK, NEW YORK                     \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnrollment.....................................  700,000.               \nNumber of schools..............................  1,229.                 \nRacial composition.............................  38 percent black.      \n                                                 36 percent Hispanic.   \n                                                 19 percent white.      \n                                                 7 percent Asian.       \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..............  64 percent.            \nType...........................................

The ``best'' school we saw--a $151 \n     million state-of-the-art science high school--was only blocks \n     away from an example of the ``worst''--another high school in \n     a 100-year-old building that had served as a stable, fire \n     house, factory, and office building. This high school's \n     elevators do not work, its interior classrooms have no \n     windows, it has little ventilation and no air conditioning, \n     and its heating depends on a fireman's stoking the coal \n     furnace by hand.\n       Overcrowding and generally poor condition of the school \n     buildings--many over 100-years-old and in need of major \n     renovation and repair--are New York's main facilities \n     problems. Since the fiscal crisis in the 1970s, maintenance \n     and repair of the city's school buildings have been largely \n     neglected. Twenty years of neglect compound problems that \n     could have been corrected much more cheaply had they been \n     corrected earlier. As the city seeks the funds for repairing \n     leaking roofs, plumbing problems that cause sewage to seep \n     into elementary school classrooms, and ceilings that have \n     caved in, its school enrollment is dramatically increasing. \n     After losing more than 10 percent of its population in the \n     sixties, a vast migration of non-English speaking residents \n     in the last 3 years has resulted in overcrowding in 50 \n     percent of New York's schools. One school is operating at \n     over 250 percent of capacity. Because classrooms are \n     unavailable while under repair, in some cases improvements \n     are postponed.\n\n                          Facilities Financing\n\n       The New York City schools' maintenance, repair, and capital \n     improvement budget is approved annually by the city council. \n     While the state provides some loan forgiveness, the city is \n     largely responsible for all of the costs.\n       Each school is allocated a maintenance and repair budget \n     based solely on square footage. As a result, schools--even \n     new schools--frequently cannot repair problems as they arise, \n     which often leads to costly repairs in the future. In 1988, \n     the estimated cost of upgrading, modernizing, and expanding \n     the school system by the year 2000 was over $17 billion. The \n     total capital backlog at that time was over $5 billion. The \n     capital plan for fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 1994 \n     was funded at $4.3 billion: barely 20 percent of the amount \n     requested.\n\n\n                           pomona, california\n\n                                Overview\n\n                     TABLE I.6.--POMONA, CALIFORNIA                     \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \nEnrollment.........................  29,000.                            \nNumber of schools..................  35.                                \nRacial composition.................  67 percent Hispanic.               \n                                     13 percent black.                  \n                                     12 percent white.                  \n                                     8 percent Asian-Pacific.           \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..  70 percent.                        \nType...............................

The \n     oldest school was built in 1932. The worst schools were built \n     in the mid-1950s to early 1960s and face many repair \n     problems--poor plumbing, ventilation, lighting, leaking \n     roofs, and crumbling walls. In contrast, one new school that \n     opened last fall is state-of-the art. Only three schools have \n     been built in the last 20 years.\n       Like many school districts in California, Pomona's biggest \n     facilities issue is overcrowding. Because the student body \n     has increased 37 percent in the last 10 years, the district \n     relies on what school officials call ``God-awful'' \n     portables--bungalows that are ugly, not air conditioned, \n     termite-ridden, dark, and have too few electrical outlets. \n     The portables generally provide sufficient classroom space \n     but leave schools suffering from a severe lack of common-use \n     areas and space for student movement. For example, some \n     schools have to schedule five lunch periods to handle \n     overcrowded campuses.\n\n                          Facilities financing\n\n       In 1991 the district passed a $62.5 million bond measure--\n     significantly short of the $200 million it says it needs to \n     put its schools in good overall condition. Officials \n     attribute their facilities' financial problems to state \n     cutbacks, the passage of Proposition 13 in 1979, which \n     greatly reduced local tax revenues, and unfunded federal \n     mandates that drain the district's budget. As\n      a result, the district must function without enough \n     facilities staff and continue to defer maintenance and \n     repair while using temporary ``band-aid'' measures. \n     However, the passage of Pomona's 1991 bond measure and two \n     1992 state bond measures increased the district's capital \n     improvement budget to $14 million or about 16 \n     [[Page S2000]] percent of the district's $85 million \n     education budget. Pomona's maintenance and repair budget is \n     usually about 2 percent of the education budget.\n\n\n                           ramona, california\n\n                                Overview\n\n                     TABLE I.7.--RAMONA, CALIFORNIA                     \nEnrollment........................................  6,500.              \nNumber of schools.................................  9.                  \nRacial composition................................  78 percent white.   \n                                                    18 percent Hispanic.\n                                                    4 percent other.    \nStudents on free or reduced lunch.................  35 percent.         \nType..............................................

Four of its nine schools are more than 25 \n     years old; its oldest was built over 50 years ago. Although \n     Ramona's oldest schools tend to be well constructed, they \n     suffer from seriously deteriorating wiring and plumbing and \n     inadequate or nonexistent heating, ventilation, air \n     conditioning, and communications systems. The school district \n     also suffers from the lack of an adequate, stable funding \n     source that would allow it to modernize and expand its \n     facilities. Consequently, most of Ramona's schools are \n     underbuilt and must rely on portables for overcrowding. One \n     elementary school we visited was comprised of only portables, \n     with no cafeteria nor auditorium. One portable served as a \n     library, computer lab, music room, and art room. In contrast, \n     two new schools were built in the last 5 years that are \n     bright, have flexible space and are wired for the latest \n     technology. The portables are difficult to maintain, and \n     repair costs are higher in the long run than if real \n     additions had been built in the first place. The most common \n     repair needs in Ramona's schools are roofs, signal systems \n     (alarms, bells, and intercoms), and paving.\n\n                          Facilities financing\n\n       Officials attribute its facilities' funding problems to the \n     community's inability to pass a bond issue--two attempts in \n     the past 8 years have failed--their small rural district's \n     competitive disadvantage in applying for state funds, and the \n     state's emphasis on building new schools rather than \n     retrofitting.\n       The district's facilities budget varies each year but \n     comprises (1) a new building program that uses matching state \n     funds, (2) a routine maintenance budget that is about 2 \n     percent of the district's $30 million education budget \n     ($600,000), and (3) a deferred maintenance budget that is 0.5 \n     percent of the education budget ($150,000) and is supposed to \n     be matched by the state but rarely is in full.\n\n\n                          raymond, washington\n\n                                Overview\n\n                     TABLE I.8.--RAYMOND, WASHINGTON                    \nEnrollment.....................................  760.                   \nNumber of schools..............................  3.                     \nRacial composition.............................  69 percent white.      \n                                                 21 percent Asian.      \n                                                 5 percent Hispanic.    \n                                                 5 percent Native       \n                                                  American.             \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..............  50 percent.            \nType...........................................

The \n     town and student populations have declined, and the \n     demographics have changed dramatically. All three Raymond \n     schools are old and two may be unsafe. The high school was \n     built in 1925. It is a three-story structure of unreinforced \n     concrete that may not safely withstand the possible \n     earthquakes in the area. In addition, the\n      buiding's systems are old and inadequate. Steam pipes are \n     noisy and provide too little or too much heat from room to \n     room. One 1924 elementary school is built of wood--a \n     potential fire hazard--and will be closed in 2 years. A \n     third school was built during the 1050s and will received \n     a major remodeling and new addition next year.\n\n                          Facilities financing\n\n       Raymond recently passed its first bond issue since the \n     1950s to fund the remodeling of and addition for an \n     elementary school. A bond issue proposed in 1990 to build a \n     new facility for grades kindergarten to 12 failed. The public \n     does not want to spend money on school maintenance and \n     construction, and the tax base is too low to raise adequate \n     funding. According to the school superintendent, the Columbia \n     Tower (a Seattle skyscraper) has a higher assessed value than \n     the entire district of Raymond. The district's budget is $4 \n     million, which is made up of local levies and state funding. \n     Over the next 2 years, they will ask for a levy increase of \n     $75,000, specifically for needed repairs.\n\n\n                           richmond, virginia\n\n                                Overview\n\n                     TABLE I.9.--RICHMOND, VIRGINIA                     \nEnrollment.........................  28,000                             \nNumber of schools..................  58.                                \nRacial composition.................  88 percent black.                  \n                                     12 percent other.                  \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..  68 percent                         \nType...............................

Their 58 buildings are visually appealing \n     yet old-fashioned compared with 21st century learning \n     standards. Many, if not most, of the district's renovation \n     needs are due to the buildings' age: The average building was \n     built around the time of World War II. Ninety percent of the \n     buildings lack central air conditioning; many schools close \n     early in September and May/June\n      because the heat and poor ventilation creates breathing \n     problems for the children.\n       In the past 20 years, 20 schools have been closed; only 2 \n     new schools have opened.\n\n                          Facilities financing\n\n       Richmond is a poor city: the average family income is \n     $17,700. The facilities director says he usually asks for $18 \n     million but only gets $3 million and about 3 percent of the \n     education budget for maintenance. He says city planners and \n     voters view the buildings as architectural landmarks and \n     think of them in terms of 1950s standards of learning. Also, \n     the money he would have used for renovations has been spent \n     on meeting ``federal codes.''\n       The district has tried twice to get the state to match \n     funds for deferred maintenance but was rejected each time. \n     New construction gets funded through bond issues.\n\n\n                             washington, dc\n\n                                Overview\n\n                       TABLE I.10.--WASHINGTON, DC                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \nEnrollment.........................  85,000.                            \nNumber of schools..................  164.                               \nRacial composition.................  95 percent black.                  \n    ...............................  5 percent other.                   \nStudents on free or reduced lunch..  62 percent.                        \nType...............................

Only 22 schools of \n     164--mainly elementary--have been built in the last 20 years. \n     According to the district's facilities manager, the average \n     age of Washington's schools is 50 years. While structurally \n     sound, these older buildings house old--sometimes original--\n     systems, such as the heating and air conditioning or \n     electrical systems, which have major repair problems.\n       Washington schools have many urgent repair needs, according \n     to the district facilities manager. Old boiler systems have \n     steam leakages causing such infrastructure erosion that whole \n     school wings have been condemned and cordoned off; leaky \n     roofs are causing ceilings to crumble on teachers' and \n     students' desks; fire doors are warped and stick. In \n     addition, the district was under court order to fix the most \n     serious of an estimated $90 million worth of fire code \n     violations by the start of the 1994-95 school year. These \n     violations included locked or blocked exit doors, defective \n     or missing fire doors, broken alarms, malfunctioning boilers, \n     and unsafe electrical systems. Many of the schools also lack \n     air conditioning and are so poorly insulated that children \n     must wear coats to keep warm in winter weather.\n\n                          Facilities financing\n\n       From the school district's total operating and capital \n     budget of about $552 million in fiscal year 1994, about $100 \n     million (18 percent) was allocated to school maintenance and \n     capital improvement. Of this, approximately $25 million \n     (including salaries) goes to the district's facilities \n     office, with the balance given directly to the schools for \n     their on-site maintenance and operations. The building \n     maintenance budget has declined from about 18 percent to 14 \n     percent of the total school budget in the past 10 years.\n       Funds for school maintenance and repair and capital \n     improvements come from the District of Columbia's general \n     budget, over which the Congress has authority. Until 1985, \n     the District's capital improvement program was financed only \n     through money borrowed from the U.S. Treasury. After 1985, \n     the District was given authority to sell general obligation \n     bonds in the capital markets. From 1985 through 1994, the \n     schools received $314 million to finance capital \n     improvements: $232 million through general obligation bond \n     issuances, $59 million borrowed from the U.S. Treasury, and \n     $23 million from District tax revenue.\n       [Appendix II not reproduced in the Record.]\n                              APPENDIX III\n\n                            Project Advisers\n\n       The following individuals advised this report either by (a) \n     serving on our expert panel on January 31, 1994; (b) helping \n     with the development of our questionnaire; or (c) reviewing a \n     draft report.\n       Allen C.

While several limited studies have \n     been done recently, no comprehensive national study of school \n     facilities has been done in 30 years.\n       The Congress needs this information to shape the details of \n     federal policy, such as funding for the School Infrastructure \n     Act of 1994. All responses are confidential. We will report \n     your data only in statistical summaries so that individuals \n     cannot be identified.\n       This questionnaire should be answered by district level \n     personnel who are very familiar with the school facilities in \n     this district. You may wish to consult with other district \n     level personnel or with school level personnel, such as \n     principals, in answering some questions.\n       We are conducting this study with only a sample of randomly \n     selected schools, so the data on your school(s) is very \n     important because it represents many other schools. Please \n     respond even if the schools selected are new. If you have \n     questions about the survey, please call Ms. Ella Cleveland \n     (202) 512-7066 or Ms. Edna Saltzman (313) 256-8109.\n       Mail your completed questionnaire in the enclosed envelope \n     within 2 weeks to: Ms. Ella Cleveland, U.S. General \n     Accounting Office, NGB, Suite 650, 441 G St., NW, Washington, \n     DC 20548.\n       Thank you for your cooperation in this very important \n     effort.\n           Sincerly yours,\n                                                   Linda G.

Mr. President, I wish to thank the GAO staff for \ntheir exhaustive work in an area that Senator Harkin and I have \nrecognized as a critical issue of readiness for educational excellence \nin this country. And that is what I call the dirty little secret of the \ncondition of America's schools.\n  [[Page S2004]] The GAO report makes it clear what the American people \nalready know: our schools are deteriorating and we need to fix them. \nInfrastructure investment is just another way of saying the obvious; \nthat we need to reverse the decades-long habit of trying to ignore the \ndecay while we struggle to eke out money for programs. We have delayed \nmaintenance for too long in too many schools and now the results of \nthat neglect are unmistakable. The chickens, literally, have come home \nto roost.\n  Some 14 million children, Mr. President, attend schools that are \nreported needing extensive repair or replacement. These schools are \ndistributed nationwide. Recent research has concluded that facilities \nin poor condition may contribute to students' poor performance. It is \ninherently unfair to hold youngsters to nationwide standards for \nachievement if they do not have an equal opportunity to learn. It is \nfrightening that major repair and renovation needs exist in fully a \nthird of the 80,000 schools in our country and that over 60 percent of \nthat number reported at least one major feature in disrepair, needing \nextensive overhaul if not replacement. Most schools reported multiple \nproblems of this nature.\n  These are not just cosmetic concerns. And I would like my staff to \nput up some pictures.\n  This is a series of pictures showing classroom conditions. You will \nnotice that this science lab looks like it has been the victim of a \nfailed science experiment. But can you imagine our youngsters trying to \nstudy the sciences and be competitive in this world economy trying to \nlearn in facilities like that.\n  Here is one with peeling lead-based paint; burned out lights; \nunrepaired fire damage. Here is one: Water damage caused buckling \nfloors and missing tiles; more water damage; termites eating out the \nschool library shelves. Here is a basement in a school in Chicago. Here \nis one of peeling lead-based paint and burned out lights, which is not \nreplaceable. But the irony of it, Mr. President, is the little sign \nhere on the blackboard that says ``academic success.'' It is hard to \nthink that someone can achieve academic success in a setting like this.\n  These are not just cosmetic concerns. When we speak of major repair \nneeds, we are referring to conditions that are unsafe or even harmful \nto children's health. The GAO report estimates that the Nation's \nschools need $112 billion to repair and upgrade America's investment in \nschool facilities to bring them to good overall condition. Just to \ncomply with the Federal mandates to remove asbestos, or lead paint, or \nradon and pesticides and hazardous materials is estimated to require \n$11 billion. We are courting disaster if we fail to recognize that \nthese capital needs relate directly to the health and safety of our \nchildren in the environment second in importance only to the home.\n  For example, some 7 million children attended schools with life \nsafety code violations, some 11 million in schools with electrical \nproblems, 15 million in schools with heating and air quality problems, \nand 12 million with plumbing problems; 11.9 million children attend \nschools with leaky roofs, and 7 million with hazardous floors. We have \nallowed the deterioration to continue to a point that the courts are \nbeginning to step in, as was done here in the Nation's Capitol and in \nNew York, to require that life-threatening conditions be rectified. \nSometimes, as in a recent student strike in Chicago, the children take \nmatters in their own hands.\n  The Education Infrastructure Act is a small, first step toward \nputting Federal support where the needs are. It is included in Goals \n2000, and was appropriated last year at the $100 million level. I hope \nwe will have the support of the President to keep this money in the \nbudget, and to increase the appropriation this year. Time is not on our \nside, deferred investment will just make it more, not less expensive to \ncorrect. I hope to have the support required to give this initiative \nthe priority it deserves.\n  I first became aware of the problems facing our Nation's education \ninfrastructure while serving in the Illinois House of Representatives. \nThroughout my 2\\1/2\\ terms in office, I visited school districts across \nthe State and witnessed the deteriorating condition of public school \nfacilities in both urban and rural districts alike.\n  Yet, it was not until I began working on education legislation in the \nU.S. Senate, that I learned that the Federal Government had not \ncollected data on the condition of our Nation's public school \nfacilities since 1965.\n  Knowing that my efforts to improve our Nation's education \ninfrastructure would be limited by insufficient data, I sent a letter \nto the General Accounting Office last year, which was cosigned by \nSenators Kennedy, Pell, Simon,  and Wellstone, requesting a \ncomprehensive, nationwide study on the condition of our Nation's public \nschool facilities.\n  In responding to my request, the General Accounting Office surveyed a \nrandom sample of our Nation's 15,000 school districts and 80,000 public \nschools from April to December 1994. GAO staff members also visited 41 \nschools in 10 school districts across the country to supplement their \nquantitative data with personal observations.\n  Based on responses from 7.8 percent of the schools sampled, GAO \nconcluded that our Nation's public schools need $112 billion to restore \ntheir facilities to good overall condition--including $6 billion to \nmake programs accessible to all students and $5 billion to correct or \nremove hazardous substances.\n  More specifically, GAO found that out of the 42 million public school \nstudents in the United States: 14 million or 33 percent of all students \nattend schools that need to extensively repair or replace one or more \nbuildings; 59 percent attend schools that need to repair or replace one \nor more building features; and 52 percent attend schools that have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental condition.\n  As I said, we are not speaking of cosmetic concerns. We are referring \nto conditions that are unsafe or even harmful to the safety and well \nbeing of our children.\n  According to the GAO report, this situation is one that is pervasive, \nit is widespread, and runs the gamut in terms of conditions. I would \nlike my staff to take this set of pictures down and put up the one \nregarding plumbing conditions and the like.\n  Mr. President, I am going to digress for a moment while my staff \ndisplays the next set of pictures. I have a teenage son. If anything, \nthe youngsters know this. This is not a surprise to any of the pages \nsitting here. They know of some school in the community from which they \ncome that has this kind of problem. It is a widespread problem. It is a \nnationwide problem. It is an urban as well as rural problem. These \npictures are from urban school districts specifically.\n  Here is a toilet used to redirect sewage from a broken pipe in the \nwall here in Washington, DC--our Nation's Capital. This is the kind of \ninfrastructure disrepair that youngsters must try to learn in on a \ndaily basis. Can you imagine the activities in the classroom right \nnext-door to this bathroom?\n  This next picture is of a home economics sink--small wonder you could \nnot do very well in home economics, if that is the kind of conditions \nin which you have to work.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these plumbing concerns, I would also \nlike you to take an opportunity to look at some of the external \nproblems. Young people do not cause the fascia to crack or the \nstructural damage. Here is one of a front door which is a life and \nsafety violation. The front door is chained so the students cannot be \ninjured by the holes in the crumbling front steps of this particular \nschool.\n  This picture shows structural damage which I can see in the \nbrickwork, in the fascia. Again, a function of the failure to invest in \nrepairs and maintenance over time. This picture is of a 30-year-old \nportable classroom in New Orleans that was built to last for 10 years. \nIt was designed to be temporary. A portable classroom that was designed \nto be temporary. It is still there and that is the condition in which \nit is in--coming apart at the seams. This picture shows a demountable \nclassroom held in place by a steel plate and the wall, of course, is \ncrumbling under the windows.\n  Mr. President, 7 million students attend schools with life safety \ncode violations; 11 million attend schools with electrical problems; 15 \nmillion attend schools with heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning \nproblems; 12 million \n[[Page S2005]] attend schools with plumbing problems; and 11.9 million \nstudents attend schools with leaky roofs.\n  Mr. President, in preparing their report, GAO staff members traveled \nacross the country to examine public school facilities in America's \nurban communities and found that: In New York City, A $151 million \nstate-of-the-art science high school is only blocks away from another \nhigh school housed in a 100-year-old building which has served as a \nstable, fire house, factory, and office building; this school's \nelevators do not work, its interior classrooms have no windows, it's \nventilation system needs major repairs, and its heating depends on a \nfireman's stoking the coal furnace by hand. In Chicago, a leaking roof \nat one elementary school caused floors to buckle and plaster on the \nwalls and ceilings to crumble; since the leaking roof also flooded \nparts of the electric wiring system, one teacher would not turn on her \nlights during rainstorms for fear of electric shock--or fire. In \nWashington, DC, water damage from an old steam-heating system at a 60-\nyear-old junior high school has caused so much wall deterioration that \nan entire wing has been condemned; steam damage is also causing lead-\nbased wall paint to peel. And, in New Orleans, most of the school \nbuildings have no air-conditioning although the average morning \nrelative humidity in New Orleans is 87 percent; Formosan termites have \nalso deteriorated the structure of many schools; in one elementary \nschool, ants ate books on shelves as well as the shelves themselves.\n  GAO staff members also visited public school facilities in America's \nrural communities and found similar problems.\n  In Raymond, WA, one elementary school is made of wood, a potential \nfire hazard, and the 70-year-old high school is made of unreinforced \nconcrete that probably can not withstand earthquakes.\n  In Ramona, CA, one elementary school is comprised solely of portable \nclassrooms with no cafeteria or auditorium; one portable room serves as \na library, computer lab, music room, and art room. and, in Grandview, \nWA, the middle school, which was built to house 475 students, currently \nenrolls 700, while the elementary school designed for 375, now enrolls \n464 students.\n  At this point I would also like to raise the issue of school \novercrowding, because, this issue also causes facilities to become \ninadequate. So you have damage as we see here in these pictures \nexacerbated by just the numbers of children that are crowding into \ninadequate facilities.\n  Mr. President, the American system of public education has \nhistorically given local school boards primary responsibility for \nmaintaining our Nation's education infrastructure.\n  For a long time, local school boards were able to meet that \nresponsibility. However, the ability of local school boards to continue \nto meet that responsibility has steadily declined, in large part \nbecause of escalating costs in the operating budget.\n  To build schools, local school boards rely on local property taxes. \nAnd, as we all know, school boards in every State in the country are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to support their instructional \nprograms, much less their school facilities, with local property taxes.\n  Local property taxes are an inadequate source of funding for public \neducation because they make the quality of public education dependent \non the local property wealth.\n  Two districts in Illinois illustrate the gross disparities created by \nour current school financing system.\n  In 1990, the owner of a $100,000 home in a prosperous community paid \n$2,103 in local property taxes. This community spent an average of \n$10,085 per child in its public schools. On the other hand, the owner \nof a $100,000 home in a low- and moderate-income community paid $4,139 \nin local property taxes, almost twice as much, but was only able to \nspend $3,483 per child in its public schools--less than one-third of \nthe money the more prosperous\n community was spending, and for a host of reasons that goes to local \nschools.\n\n  In their responses to the GAO survey, school officials reported that \nthey have difficulty raising money for needed repairs and renovation, \nin large part, because of the demands of their operating budgets as \nwell as an antitax sentiment among voters resulting in the failure of \nbond issues.\n  In other words the local property tax is an inadequate, inelastic \nbase for funding schools generally, but it has the particularly \nDraconian effect with regard to infrastructure and facilities because \nthe school districts do not want to have to go back to the taxpayers in \norder to meet these kinds of repairs.\n  In fact, 33 percent of school districts reported that they have had \nan average of two bond issues fail in the past 10 years and that bond \nproceeds are often much less than needed for repairs. For example, GAO \nfound that: In Montgomery, AL, voters defeated a local tax referendum \nto remove all portable buildings and build new schools on June 28, \n1994; and, in Pomona, CA, a $62.5 million bond issue was submitted to \nthe voters after a survey indicated that the $200 million needed for \nrepairs would be rejected by the voters.\n  In short, one survey respondent commented that:\n\n       The current public attitudes about the economy and \n     education are generally so negative that passing a bond \n     referendum is a fantasy.\n\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government, as well as most States, \ncontinue to force local school districts to rely increasingly on local \nproperty taxes for public education, in general, and for school repair \nand construction projects, in particular.\n  In Illinois, for example, the local share of public education funding \nincreased from 48 percent during the 1980-81 school year to 58 percent \nduring the 1992-93 school year, while the State share feel from 43 to \n34 percent during this same period.\n  So what we see is a continuing shifting of the burden to the local \nproperty taxpayer, and the local property taxpayer is not able to go \nany further to meet this need.\n  At the same time, State support for the repair, renovation, \nalternation, and construction of public school facilities has fallen \neven more dramatically in illinois--one of 23 State that provides \nlittle or no funding for school facilities projects.\n  Although the Illinois General Assembly created the Capital Assistance \nProgram in the early 1970's to help local school districts finance \nschool repair and construction projects, support for this program has \ndiminished rapidly.\n  During fiscal years 1985 through 1990, the State of Illinois \nappropriated only $18 million for local school repair and construction \nprojects, and then only on an individual direct-grant basis.\n  I point out also that the last time this issue even was reviewed at a \nState level in our State was in 1987 when the Illinois Board of \nEducation that our rural districts alone needed over $500 million to \nrestore their facilities to good overall conditions. The GAO report \nfound that Chicago public schools need $2.9 billion.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government must accept a share of the \nblame for failing to provide our Nation's children with school \nenvironments which are conducive to learning.\n  In just the last decade alone, the Federal Government's share of \npublic education funding has dropped from 9.8 to 6.1 percent.\n  That could make a lot of difference when it comes to providing an \nenvironment in which young people can learn.\n  The Federal Government has historically addressed the problems facing \nour Nation's public schools by passing important legislation including: \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Asbestos Hazard \nEmergency Response Act of 1986; and the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990. While these laws have laudable goals, they have the effect of \npassing on even greater costs to already overburdened school districts.\n  The GAO report states clearly that these mandates alone, account for \n$11 billion of the $112 billion needed to fix our schools.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act which \nPresident Clinton signed into law on March 31, 1994. I supported this \nlegislation because it promises to create a coherent, national \nframework for education reform founded on the national education goals.\n  Since one essential building block of reform is better school \nfacilities, I am pleased that Goals 2000 includes an \n[[Page S2006]] amendment I introduced that directs the national \neducation standards and improvement council to develop voluntary \nnational opportunity-to-learn standards which address the condition of \nschool facilities.\n  Nonetheless, I firmly believe that it is inherently unfair to expect \nour children to meet national performance standards if they do not have \nan equal opportunity to learn.\n  That is why I introduced the Education Infrastructure Act last April. \nThis legislation, which was included in the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act [ESEA], is specifically designed \nto help local school districts ensure the health and safety of students \nthrough the repair, renovation, alteration, and construction of school \nfacilities.\n  With the help of my distinguished colleague from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], I \nwas able to include $100 million in the 1995 Department of Education \nbudget for the education infrastructure program. While this \nappropriation level represents a drop in the bucket in terms of our \nNation's education infrastructure needs, it is significant, \nnonetheless, because it is the first drop.\n  The Education Infrastructure Act requires the Secretary of Education \nto award funds to school districts with at least 15 percent child \npoverty rates and urgent repair and renovation needs.\n  This legislation further targets program funds by requiring the \nSecretary to award funds among eligible school districts on the basis \nof:\n  The number or percentages of children in poverty;\n  The extent to which they lack the fiscal capacity to undertake the \nproject without Federal assistance;\n  The threat the physical condition of the plant poses to the safety \nand well-being of students; and\n  The age of the facility to be replaced.\n  Mr. President, the Education Infrastructure Act does not infringe \nupon local control over public education in any way. Rather, it seeks \nto supplement, augment, and assist local efforts to support education \nin the least intrusive way possible by helping local school boards \nsupport the repair, renovation, alteration, and construction of our \nNation's public elementary and secondary school facilities.\n  Mr. President, the Education Infrastructure Act will help our \nchildren learn by providing an environment conducive to learning. In \nher research at Georgetown University, Maureen Edwards found that \nstudents in poor school facilities can be expected to fall 5.5 \npercentage points below those in schools in fair condition and 11 \npercentage points below those in schools in excellent condition.\n  For all of these reasons, the Education Infrastructure Act was \nenthusiastically endorsed by the National PTA, the National Education \nAssociation, the National School Boards Association, the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, the Council\n of Great City Schools, the National Committee for adequate School \nHousing, the City University of New York, the AFL-CIO Building and \nTrades Commission, the Military Impacted Schools Association, the \nAmerican Library Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the \nNational Association of Federal Education Program Administrators, \nASPIRA, the Council of Education Facilities Planners International, and \nthe American Federation of School Administrators.\n\n  Mr. President, I have taken the time today to highlight the results \nof the GAO report as well as the merits of the Education Infrastructure \nAct because Republican Members of Congress are currently preparing \nlegislation that would rescind the $100 million appropriated for the \nEducation Infrastructure Act in 1995.\n  Needless to say, I am vehemently opposed to any proposal that would \nforce Congress to take this giant leap backward. In my view, it would \nbe unconscionable for Congress to withdraw funding for the Education \nInfrastructure Act--especially now given the results of the GAO report.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks by urging my \ncolleagues to read the ``Condition of America's Schools'' report for \nthemselves and to join me in working to secure funding for the \nEducation Infrastructure Act in 1995 and 1996.\n  Rather, I believe that President Clinton should include at least $200 \nmillion for the Education Infrastructure Program in his fiscal year \n1996 budget request and that Congress should meet this request.\n  By providing this needed and long overdue support, we will begin to \naddress our failure to adequately engage Federal resources in behalf of \npreparing our children for competition in this global economy and \nsecuring the future of our Democratic institutions. This is not our \nchildren's interest; this is in our national interest.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S1995-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2006-S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are involved here in a truly historic \ndebate. The proposed balanced budget amendment will decide the fate of \nAmerica for years to come. Our decision will dictate whether our \nchildren and grandchildren will live free and prosper from the fruits \nof their labor or, on the other hand, live in a Third World economy \nsubservient to the economic leaders of other industrialized nations in \nthe world.\n  Debtors are never free to choose. They are never free to choose. They \nare only subject to the dominion of their creditors. We all know this.\n  Interest payments on the national debt now are expected to be $310 \nbillion this year. Interest payments on the national debt are expected \nto be $310 billion. Think of it. That comes out to be about $4,600 per \nfamily, or 52 percent of all individual income taxes collected in \nAmerica this year. The national debt itself is over $4.75 trillion, \ngoing on $5 trillion. Gross domestic product is only about $6.5 \ntrillion.\n  Combined, these numbers produce a debt-to-GDP ratio of 73 percent. As \nthe debt continues to grow, so inevitably does the tax burden on the \nAmerican people. Granted, Mr. President, we have gotten away with debt \nin the past, but the time to pay the bill is rapidly approaching. The \nglobal markets are beginning to experience a capital crunch. European \neconomies are expanding and picking up steam. Southeast Asian markets \nare booming. Japan is calling on its reserves to rebuild infrastructure \nafter the earthquake.\n  In short, Mr. President, demand for capital is simply growing faster \nthan can be supplied and, as a result, investors are being more \nselective about which markets they place their money in, as they should \nbe.\n  A very clear and primary concern of financial markets is a nation's \npoor economic policies and its debt structure. I submit here today that \nthe lack of budget discipline we display here in the United States is \nnot highly regarded among any investor in the world. Our current \naccount stood at $104 billion in 1993. This means we either sold $104 \nbillion in assets to foreign entities, borrowed $104 billion from \nforeign entities, or a combination of the two.\n  Although a current account deficit in and of itself is not a bad \nthing, the accumulation of persistent current account deficits, over \ntime, leads to a great big external debt. These deficits identify a \nsystematic shortfall of savings below investment, due to an expansion \nof consumption relative to income. The implication is that we borrow to \nfinance current consumption expenditures that have no effect on \neconomic growth or future income in this country. In other words, the \nGovernment is borrowing abroad to finance an excess of expenditures \nover income. We are living beyond our means.\n  Projections of higher current account deficits run well into the \nforeseeable future. The former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nPaul Volcker, for whom we all have great respect, has warned of the \ncurrent account deficit addiction, as he calls it.\n  He said:\n\n       * * * we simply cannot afford to become addicted to drawing \n     on increasing amounts of foreign savings to help finance our \n     internal economy. Part of our domestic industry--that part \n     dependent on exports, or competing with imports--would be \n     sacrificed. The stability of the dollar and of our domestic \n     financial markets would become hostage to events abroad. If \n     recovery is to proceed elsewhere, as we want, other countries \n     will \n     [[Page S2007]] increasingly need their own savings. Although \n     we do not know when, the process eventually would break down.\n\n  Those are not my words. They are the words of Dr. Volcker. We cannot, \nMr. President, continue to finance our debt through a balance of \npayments deficit unless we want to find ourselves in the same type of \ncrisis as Mexico, or perhaps Canada.\n  Mexico, as we all know, is in dire financial straits. The cause of \nMexico's problems is based on large budget and current account \ndeficits. Mexico tried to finance consumption by running a current \naccount deficit at nearly 8 percent of the gross domestic product, \nliving well beyond their means. Financial markets realized the risk of \nholding Mexican currency and proceeded in a widespread selloff of the \npeso. Mexico was virtually helpless in its ability to manage monetary \npolicy due to what? Their structural debt problem.\n  Now, Mr. President, private investors will not even prop up the peso \nwithout a guarantee from the United States or something similar to \nthat, the President announced.\n  If you look to our north, another neighbor is financially destitute. \nCanada's long-suffering dollar is at a 9-year low. Canada has the \nsecond highest ratio of debt-to-gross domestic product of any \nindustrialized country, and 35 percent of all Federal revenues in \nCanada go to service the debt. In addition, Canada ran a $30 billion \nbalance of payments deficit in this past year. Canada is in serious \ntrouble. Some Third World countries have a better handle on their debt \nthan our neighbor to the north.\n  The fiscal order of Canada is forcing real budget decisions and real \nbudget cuts. No fiddling around the edges, Canada is on the verge of \nbecoming a Third World country if they do not take immediate and \nradical steps to address their debt problem.\n  Mexico and Canada, for us, provide valuable, tangible lessons of what \nhappens if a country does not address its debt. Some will agree but \nthen point out that a balanced budget amendment is not the means to \nachieve fiscal restraint. We have heard it before. They say, ``All we \nneed is the will to balance the budget.'' That is a common refrain. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, the collective will is not present in \nthis body.\n  In a 1932 radio speech, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, \n``Any government, like any family, can for a year spend a little more \nthan it earns. But you and I know that a continuance of that habit \nmeans the poorhouse.''\n  Well, President Roosevelt knew what he was talking about. Our \ncontinued habit has produced deficits in 33 out of the last 34 years in \nthis country. Can you imagine? In 33 of the last 34 years we have run a \ndeficit. Presently, there is no end in sight. I believe every Senator \nhas the will to balance the budget. What they will not agree on is the \nway to get there. The nature of this institution instills incentives to \nvote for additional expenditures and deficit financing.\n  No one likes to take the heat for cutting specific programs. Indeed, \nmany Senators do not vote to cut programs for that very reason.\n That is why we need a balanced budget amendment--to instill the \nindividual will for action on the collective body. Planning strategic \ncuts over a period of 7 years will be much less painful than waiting \nuntil the debt collector is standing at our door.\n\n  Currently, 48 States possess one sort of a balanced budget \nrequirement or another. For them, these restrictions provide a source \nof discipline throughout the budget process. It is an extremely \naristocratic notion to believe we are better than the States and do not \nneed such forced discipline to help us balance the budget, because we \nall know better. Congress has proven we cannot balance the budget on \nour own, and we will not.\n  Canada and Mexico are wake-up calls. I do not want the United States \nto be like Britain in the 1970's or New Zealand in the 1980's. Both had \nto call in the International Monetary Fund to stabilize its falling \ncurrency. We had a scare last year and unless we pass this amendment, \nwe may very well experience far worse in the future.\n  Government deficits reduce national savings. As a result, the economy \naccumulates less domestic capital and fewer foreign assets. The lack of \nGovernment investment means that borrowing is not being used to finance \nincreased productivity and therefore will not provide a foundation for \nfuture repayment of the debt. Federal Government surpluses are \npertinent to the repayment of the public debt. Some will say we can \nraise taxes. I, for one, will not support an increase in taxes. It has \nbeen proven time and time again, higher taxes do not eliminate the \ndeficit. Instead, experience suggests Congress will spend all tax \nrevenues plus the highest deficit markets will accept.\n  The accumulation of debt will cause our children and grandchildren to \nhave lower standards of living, because they will inherit a smaller \ncapital stock and because they will have to pay more interest to \nforeign investors. This reduction in future living standards reflects \nthe true burden of Government debt.\n  To vote against this amendment is to disregard the obligation we have \nto protect and serve not only this country but the children that we \nbequeath this burden to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the \nbalanced budget amendment. I could not think of a single issue--not \none--that is more central nor more tied to what the American people \nwere saying in these past elections than the balanced budget amendment.\n  It is interesting to me that in the President's speech on the state \nof the Union, he said something to the effect that the American people \nwere not singing to us, they were shouting at us. On that point, the \nPresident is absolutely correct. They were shouting at Washington and \nthey were demanding change in the way we govern ourselves. Eighty to \neighty-five percent of the American people have indicated support of \nthe passage of an amendment to the Constitution to balance the budget.\n  The President said he heard the shouting, but apparently he has not \nbecause if you heard what they were saying, you would be in front of \nthe train trying to bring the change that they are asking for here to \nWashington and he would be leading the charge for passage of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The President is going to be submitting his budget next week and we \nwill see what kind of glidepath or pattern he sets toward approaching a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002.\n  I want to repeat, Mr. President, in the last election, there was no \ngreater centerpiece than the issue of passage of a balanced budget \namendment. None. That election had a profound effect on this \nadministration, which is obvious. It has found itself in deliberation. \nIt is talking about reinventing, the President rereading the speeches \nof 1992, trying to understand where a disconnect occurred. I would \nsuggest that the administration need not go no further than to read \nwhat America is saying about the passage of a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Very often those who speak in opposition to the passage of the \namendment will cite various sectors of our society and suggest harm \nwill come to them if we exercise the discipline of balancing our \nbudget. I would suggest the complete reverse.\n  Mr. President, if we do not take charge of our financial health, the \nvarious constituencies--children, the poor, the aged, whatever--of our \nNation will be the first victims of a Nation so financially unhealthy \nthat it cannot take care of its critical needs. It is exactly those \nconstituencies.\n  There is an article in my home paper, the Atlanta Constitution, that \nsuggests that a balanced budget amendment could only be achieved on the \nbacks of children. How absurd.\n  The balanced budget amendment is exactly for children, for the \nfuture, for guaranteeing a country that has sufficient financial \nstrength to defend itself, financial strength to care for itself. Have \nwe ever known a family, Mr. President, or a business or a community \nthat was able to function if it was financially unhealthy? I mean, are \nbankrupt companies able to do what they are supposed to do? Absolutely \nnot. If a family is charged too much on a credit card, what happens? \nThey are in trouble. It often leads to even breakup of the family. A \ncountry without \n[[Page S2008]] having secured financial health cannot care for itself.\n  Mr. President, we are engaged in a defining moment in the history of \nthis Nation and specifically on the issue of a balanced budget \namendment. This is a clarification of exactly where we stand. Are we \nfor changing the way we govern ourselves in this country in Washington \nor are we for leaving everything just the way it is?\n  Mr. President, America has already made up her mind. She has said \njust as loudly as she can--the President is correct, shouting at us--\n``change.''\n  One of the reasons I think the President had difficulty in the last \nmidterm election was that they thought that was what he was going to \ndo, fight for change, and they came to know that he would not. And he \nhas defined the next 2 years of his administration by saying that he \nwill not support a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this is a defining moment. You either stand \nwith the country that called for change, we change the manner in which \nwe govern our finance, or you reject the elections, you reject what the \nAmerican people have called for and you become a defender of Washington \njust the way it is. It is just that clear. Are you for change or do you \nwant it to stay the way it is?\n  America is calling for change. This is the chance to answer the call.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of cutting \nwasteful spending and closing tax loopholes. I also rise in opposition \nto this balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. I rise in strong \nsupport of fiscal discipline, but in opposition to a fiscal \nstraitjacket that could cripple our economy and possibly even cause a \ndepression.\n  I rise in strong support of balancing our operating budget, but in \nopposition to using the Social Security trust fund to do it.\n  I rise in support of a pay-as-you-go approach to the Government's \noperating expenses, but in opposition to an amendment that ignores the \nfundamental principles of capital budgeting under which virtually all \nbusinesses and States operate.\n  And I rise in strong support of holding Congress accountable for \ndeficit spending, but in opposition to giving unelected judges the \npower to raise taxes and to cut Social Security benefits.\n  Mr. President, I know that very deep public concerns have led to the \nconsideration of this amendment. The American people have made it quite \nclear that they want to do more to cut wasteful spending, and I agree. \nWe have made some progress, but there is still far too much waste from \ntop-heavy Government bureaucracies to farm subsidies, the B-2 bomber, \nstar wars, the space station, and a variety of special interest tax \nloopholes. We should do better.\n  Americans have every right to be angry about the deficits and the \nwaste that contributes to it. Unfortunately, the balanced budget \namendment is not a magic bullet that is going to kill the deficit. I \nonly wish it were. We must be frank with the American people. This \namendment will not cut a dime of spending or close a single tax \nloophole.\n  As many of my colleagues have urged on this floor, it is critical \nthat before this amendment is approved, its proponents should tell the \nAmerican people how this is going to get the job done. Unfortunately, \nso far, we have seen very little inclination to do so.\n  Proponents do not want to tell the people that taxes for ordinary \nAmericans could skyrocket. They do not want to tell the people that \nSocial Security benefits could be slashed. They do not want to tell the \npeople about lost Medicare services or fewer FBI agents or fewer border \nguards, or weakening of immigration enforcement.\n  Mr. President, are these kinds of drastic consequences really likely? \nLet us just take a look at the numbers. Proponents of this amendment \nclaim that they can balance the budget while increasing military \nspending and cutting taxes for the very wealthy.\n  But according to an analysis by the staff of the Budget Committee, to \naccomplish that and meet the Government's existing commitments to \nretirees and Medicare, you would have to cut everything else literally \n50-percent. Think about that for a moment, Mr. President: A 50-percent \ncut in law enforcement, a 50-percent cut in education, a 50-percent cut \nin immigration enforcement, a 50-percent cut in job training.\n  The people in my State of New Jersey would pay a very high price for \nthis amendment, especially if it is adopted in conjunction with other \nitems in the so-called Contract With America.\n  According to a study by the Department of Treasury, New Jersey would \nlose almost $1 billion annually for programs like education, job \ntraining, environmental protection, and housing. We would lose another \n$200 million for highways. And to make up for these and other cuts, \nState taxes would have to increase by 17.5 percent across the board, \n17.5 percent.\n  Our Governor has been working very hard to reduce the tax burden on \nthe citizens within our State. Her target is 30 percent. And with this \nchange, we could be looking at a 17.5 percent increase in taxes.\n  The balanced budget amendment also could wreak havoc on our State's \neconomy. There is a study by a well-respected organization, the Wharton \neconometrics group, or WEFA, as they are known, which analyzed how the \namendment would affect the economy in the year 2003.\n  According to WEFA, the amendment would mean that more than 178,000 \npeople would lose their jobs and the unemployment rate would increase \nby almost 5 percent and personal incomes would decline by about 12 \npercent.\n  Again, Mr. President, these are figures from a well-respected, \nnonpartisan research organization and they should at least give us \nserious pause.\n  I wonder if the American people have any idea that we are talking \nabout these kinds of drastic steps. I doubt it. And one reason is that \namendment proponents have kept the public in the dark. They refuse to \nsay what will be necessary if this amendment passes.\n  Why? Because the public would turn it down and it would remove this \nkind of hide-and-seek cover that is being used to present this \ndeception, to suggest that the way we are going to solve our problems \nis by some formula change to our Constitution which has as its \nstructure the separation of powers and the responsibility for each one \nof those divisions of Government.\n  No, Mr. President, what we are trying to do is escape by this the \nresponsibility that each of us took when we took our oath under the \nConstitution to protect our public and the Constitution of the United \nStates. What we are doing is we are seeing a duck-for-cover tactic that \nI do not think, in the final analysis is, A, going to work and, B, \ngoing to answer the problems.\n  Unfortunately, by the time the public learns what this amendment will \nreally do, it may be too late. That, in fact, is the admitted strategy \nof its proponents, and it is outrageous and abhorrent as a way to \ndebate an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  We should be honest not only about the cuts and tax increases that \nare likely to result from this amendment, but also about the way the \namendment would hamstring critical efforts to stimulate the economy \nduring serious recessions.\n  When the economy suffers a cyclical downturn, tax revenues go down, \nand spending for unemployment benefits and other items go up. So the \ndeficit increases. Under this amendment, Congress would then have to \nmake up the difference with measures that will stifle the economy even \nfurther.\n  That is not good economic policy, and it will have extremely serious \nconsequences for ordinary Americans. It will mean lost jobs and lost \nwages and, quite possibly, could send us into another Great Depression \nbefore we would know what hit us. Having lived through the Depression \nas a child, I can tell you, that is something to avoid like the plague.\n  Let me discuss another aspect of this amendment that will take us \nbackward. The amendment proposes to balance the budget by raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund. Social Security represents a sacred trust \nbetween the Government and our citizens. Often, it is the mainstay of \nretirees. We have made a commitment, virtually a contract, with the men \nand women who \n[[Page S2009]] have been paying into that trust fund. And so it is \ncritical that we keep it off budget.\n  If Congress spends too much on welfare or the military or farm \nprograms, or if we give too many tax breaks to the wealthy, why should \nSocial Security beneficiaries have to suffer as a result? They earned \ntheir benefits. They paid into that fund, and it is wrong to make them \npay for Congress' overspending.\n  Just as it is wrong to include Social Security in the budget, it is \nalso wrong to commingle the capital and operating budgets.\n  Mr. President, how many times have we heard the same line: ``If \nordinary Americans can balance their family budgets, if State \ngovernments can balance their budgets, and if businesses can balance \ntheir budgets, why can't the Federal Government?''\n  It is a good question. The real answer is that families, States, and \nbusinesses balance their operating budgets most of the time.\n  But they also borrow for long-term investments. Families borrow to \nbuy a house. They borrow to buy a car. States borrow for capital \nprojects that will benefit future generations. Every day, individuals \nborrow to invest in their future by taking student loans. Every day, if \nthey did not, most would have no future, especially in today's \nincreasingly technological age. That is why they do not balance all \nreceipts and expenditures. They balance only their operating budgets.\n  By contrast, Mr. President, this amendment lumps the capital and \noperating budgets together and makes no distinction between investments \nand operational expenses. This ignores the basic standards of budgeting \nunder which virtually every business in America operates. As a former \nCEO of a major public corporation, Mr. President, I can attest to that. \nCommingling the capital and operating budgets threatens to rob us of \ninvestments that are critical to our Nation's future.\n  Mr. President, investments are necessary in our Nation's roads, in \nour bridges, in our airports, in our air traffic control systems, \ninvestments in the information superhighway, and the technology of \ntomorrow. To ignore these kinds of investments is to ignore our own \nfuture.\n  We hear it said many times that if we do not have the balanced budget \namendment, we are delegating to our children and future generations \nhuge obligations to repay debt, interest, and principal. Mr. President, \nas all know, if you do not make investments in tomorrow, that really \ndeprives our children and our grandchildren of opportunities to learn, \nto earn, to work, to develop. That is when the real penalty to our \nchildren and grandchildren is going to come into place. And we can do \nsomething about it. We can reduce our spending, and we can proceed to a \ncloser balance of our budgets.\n  We have seen in the last few years, with the President's leadership, \nwe have been able to substantially cut our annual deficit, somewhere \naround a half-trillion dollars over the 3-year period as contemplated.\n  This amendment also violates a fundamental principle upon which our \nNation was founded, and that is the principle of no taxation without \nrepresentation. The balanced budget amendment is intended to encourage \nthe Congress and the President to agree on measures to eliminate the \ndeficit, but what happens if the two branches disagree? What happens if \nnotwithstanding the amendment the budget is still not in balance? The \nanswer most likely at least as presently designed is that the courts \neventually would step in to implement the constitutional requirement. \nThat could mean not only cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and other \nFederal benefits but substantial tax increases.\n  Some proponents of a balanced budget amendment may say that that is \nnot their intent, but the courts will not be able to rely on such \nclaims. First, there is real disagreement among amendment proponents, \nand some insist the courts must enforce the amendment. More \nimportantly, there is nothing in the amendment itself that seeks to \npreclude the courts from enforcing the amendment's provisions. This \ncontrasts starkly with other versions of a balanced budget amendment. \nAnd so the obvious question for the courts will be if the amendment is \nnot intended to preclude judicial enforcement, why does it not include \nan explicit statement to that effect?\n  Mr. President, the court's power to interpret and enforce the \nConstitution has been well established since the famed case of Marbury \nversus Madison. That long established power is not likely to be \nrelinquished. So, Mr. President, the threat of judicial taxation under \na balanced budget amendment is not hypothetical; it is very real. And \nthat is not just my opinion. Legal experts of all political stripes \nagree.\n  For example, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has testified that \n``Judicial enforcement of the proposed balanced budget amendment would \nnecessarily plunge judges into the heart of the taxing, spending and \nbudgetary process.''\n  Similarly, the conservative former Supreme Court nominee, Robert \nBork, who also opposes the balanced budget amendment, has warned that \nthe amendment could lead to tax increases mandated by unelected, \nlifetime-tenured judges. In his words, ``The judiciary would have \neffectively assumed a considerable degree of control over the fiscal \naffairs of the United States. That outcome cannot be desired by anyone, \nincluding the courts.''\n  Mr. President, over 200 years ago, this country was born after \ncitizens were burdened with stiff tax increases imposed by distant \nelite rulers who did not represent the people and who were \nunaccountable to them. The rallying cry of our oppressed forefathers \nwas clear and compelling, and that same rallying cry applies to this \namendment--no taxation without representation. I say it again: No \ntaxation without representation. It is permanently embedded in the \nearliest of our schoolchildren. They know about that episode in \nAmerican history. They know the impact that had in the creation of this \nwonderful democracy of ours.\n  Mr. President, it is bad enough that ordinary Americans are now \npaying an unfair portion of the tax burden, but that burden may get a \nlot heavier when judges inherit the task of balancing the budget. After \nall, the judiciary is the branch of Government that by design is most \ninsulated from the public. In fact, judges are supposed to ignore \npublic opinion.\n  Mr. President, if we think the American people are angry today, just \nwait. Wait until they get hit with a huge tax increase by a district \ncourt judge who they have never heard of, never voted for, and they \nwill never be able to vote out of office. The reaction will make the \nfamous Boston insurrection look really like a tea party.\n  I know that some amendment proponents are convinced that the courts \nwill not intervene to enforce this amendment. Some have pointed to the \ndoctrines of standing or justiciability and conveniently assume that \nthese old doctrines would apply to a newly adopted constitutional \namendment. But supporters of the amendment cannot have it both ways. If \nthis amendment really will force Congress to reduce the deficit, who is \ngoing to force us if not the courts?\n  After all, Congress has already passed laws to force itself to \nbalance the budget, but without an effective enforcement mechanism we \nsimply sidestepped our own law. And now amendment proponents assure us \nthat the same evasion will not be possible under a constitutional \namendment. But just as prohibition did not stop drinking because it was \nunenforceable, a balanced budget will not stop spending if courts are \nimpotent to enforce it.\n  I find it absolutely astounding to hear amendment proponents argue \nthat the courts would never enforce this amendment. We are talking \nabout an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, not a \nsense-of-the-Congress resolution. Can the proponents really believe \nthat the balanced budget amendment is nothing more than a meaningless \nscrap of paper that cannot be enforced? Could they really be that \ncynical? I do not think so, Mr. President. And I do not think the \ncourts will either. As Laurence Tribe and Robert Bork concluded, the \ncourts will not presume that this is a meaningless and utterly \nunenforceable scrap of paper. To the contrary. And that is why the \nthreat of judicial taxation is so real.\n  Mr. President, there is no need to rely on the judiciary to reduce \nthe deficit. Congress could do it. We could \n[[Page S2010]] start now if we had the political will. In fact, we have \nalready made significant progress which I have talked about earlier.\n  Consider what happened over the past 15 years. In 1981, the deficit \nwas $79 billion, but then President Reagan's huge military buildup, \ncombined with tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, led to massive \nborrowing on an unprecedented scale. By 1992, Republican policies had \nincreased the deficit from $79 billion to $290 billion. Since President \nClinton began to reverse those policies, however, there has been a \ndramatic improvement. The deficit this year will be about 40 percent \nsmaller than in President Bush's last year. For the first time in a \ndecade we will have reduced the deficit for 3 consecutive years. The \nnumber of Federal employees is the lowest since the Kennedy \nadministration. And though much remains to be done, we have shown that \nit does not take a constitutional amendment to reduce the deficit in a \nmeaningful way.\n  The irony, Mr. President, is that passing the balanced budget \namendment actually will make it far less likely that Congress will \nbalance the budget any time soon. This amendment does not require a \nbalanced budget until the year 2002. Meanwhile, Members who vote for \nthe amendment will be able to point to their vote as evidence of their \nsupposed commitment to fiscal discipline. I called it a coverup, and I \nuse the same term now. What do you want from me? I voted for a balanced \nbudget. Yes; I did not do my share by cutting expenses properly or \nbalancing revenues with expenses, but I did vote after all for a \nbalanced budget amendment. It is hide and seek. Hide the mission and \nseek the culprit.\n  Meanwhile, Members who will have voted for the amendment can draw a \ndegree of satisfaction, not for the job done but for escaping \nresponsibility. If you can say that you voted for a balanced budget, \nwhy bother to antagonize constituents by cutting their benefit programs \nor raising taxes? There is far less incentive to make those hard \nchoices.\n  Mr. President, we should not play games with the American people. We \ndo not want to shift, or should not shift, the burden of our \nresponsibilities to the judiciary. Let us not put off the hard \ndecisions for another 7 years. Let us take personal responsibility for \nthe problem and make those tough choices now.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly support cutting wasteful \nspending and reducing our deficit. I want to work with my colleagues to \nactually cut the spending and close tax loopholes. This balanced budget \nproposal does not help reach that goal. Its proponents refuse to spell \nout what steps they would actually take to reduce spending. Whose \nbenefits will be cut and whose taxes will go up? But one thing we do \nknow for sure. The impact on our Nation could be disastrous. It could \nhamstring our ability to respond to economic and other emergencies, \nundermine our entire Social Security system, rob us of investments for \nour future, and allow unelected and unaccountable judges to impose huge \ntax increases on ordinary Americans.\n  Mr. President, this amendment could go down as one of the most tragic \nmistakes ever made by this Nation. I hope that my colleagues will face \nup to the reality of the situation. As has been said before, you can \nrun but you cannot hide. That is what happens if we pass this amendment \nwithout detailing how it is that we are going to balance their budget \nand how it is that we are going to deal with the responsibility and \nmaintain it where it belongs, in the House and in the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Mr. \nLautenberg, for his excellent statement. He has very eloquently stated \nthe clear and present dangers with which this amendment is fraught.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for momentarily indulging me.\n  I have listened to the claims of the proponents of the constitutional \namendment for several days now. I compliment them on their dedication \nto their cause as they see it. I respect their viewpoints. I respect \ntheir sincerity. I realize that not everyone will agree with my \nviewpoint.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] for his \nsteadfast adherence to the belief that the way to get our deficits \nunder control and lower the interest on the debt and reduce the debt is \nto adopt a constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. I respect \nhis viewpoint. I differ with it. But we can differ as friends and we do \ndiffer as friends.\n  I also speak with respect to the distinguished Senator from Utah, \n[Mr. Hatch] the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary who, \nlikewise, is a very formidable and principled supporter of the \nproposal.\n  I think they are wrong. They think I am wrong. But it is the people \nout there that we hope to try to persuade as to which viewpoint is the \nright one under the circumstances that obtain.\n  So, I have listened to the claims of the proponents of the \nconstitutional amendment for several days now. As I listen, it seems to \nme that the proponents are selling this amendment very much as the \noldtime peddlers sold tonic and liniments, kidney pills and snake oil. \nTo hear the proponents tell it, this amendment will cure everything \nthat is wrong with America today. Just take a good swig of this magic \ntonic, Mr. and Mrs. America, and your problems will disappear. Your \nhead will stop aching, your arthritis will clear up, your fingernails \nwill grow long and strong, your taste buds will tingle, your hearing \nwill become more acute, you can throw away that old hearing aid, your \neyesight will sharpen--you can just pitch those glasses out in the \ngarbage can, your dandruff will cease if you have any hair, and if you \ndo not have hair, it will grow hair, and your teeth will whiten, and \nyour marriage will probably improve. Well, never mind what is in the \nbottle, Mr. and Mrs. America. Truth in labeling does not apply here. \nTruth in advertising has no place in this debate. Just swallow this \nmagic elixir and all will be well.\n  The American people are usually good consumers. They are smart \nconsumers. They read the labels on the grocery store shelf to get the \nfat content of the food they purchase. They read the labels on the cans \nof food that they buy. I know that I do. I want to find out how much \nfat there is in the contents, how much sodium, how much cholesterol, \nand how much by way of proteins and carbohydrates, and so on. They look \nunder the hood of cars that they buy. They kick the tires. They squeeze \nthe cantaloupes and the cabbage heads and the other vegetables that \nthey buy. They read the fine print. And by law that fine print has to \nbe placed on those labels.\n  But, I do not believe that the U.S. Senate is helping the people to \nexercise their prowess as good consumers with the debate so far on this \nfloor.\n  We are not discussing national priorities. We are not spelling out \nthe contents of this snake oil amendment. We are not talking about what \nshould or should not be on the chopping block for cuts. We are not \ndebating the impact such an amendment might have on the economy. We are \nnot talking about the hard choices that will have to be made by \nsomebody if we enact this amendment.\n  The proponents have steadfastly refused to lay out a plan to get to \nbalance. Take it on faith, America. It will be good for the Nation. I \nask the American people this question. How will you know if this \namendment will be good for the Nation, if you do not know what cuts \nwill be made, how much each State, how much each county, how much each \nmunicipality across this land will have to absorb as a result of the \ncuts, how much your State taxes will rise as a result of Federal cuts, \nwhat will happen to Federal aid to education, what will happen to \nMedicare, what might happen to our ability to compete with other \ncountries in the global marketplace, what the amendment might mean in \nterms of clean water, clean air, veteran's pensions, the national \ndefense? In short, what is good for the Nation cannot be determined \nwithout these critical details. To claim otherwise is simply untrue. \nThe American people are entitled to more than a wink and a nod and an \nempty promise. We cannot treat the American people like children. If \nthey \n[[Page S2011]] want us to balance the budget, we must honestly try to \ndo it, but we must also honestly tell them what it will take and that \nit will mean radical changes in their personal lives. We owe the people \nthat. To do less is to betray their faith in sending us here.\n  It is puzzling to me that after the results of this election, when \nthe people said that they were tired of Washington politicians telling \nthem what to do, we come right out of the box with this proposed major, \nmajor, major change in our organic law and with the proponents claiming \nthat the people do not need details. In other words, once again, we in \nWashington know what is good for you, Mr. and Mrs. America.\n  This balanced budget amendment is good for you. You do not need to \nknow the details. Take the tonic. Swallow the snake oil. Do not read \nthe label. There is no label to read. Take our word for it.\n  Well, if the American people let us get away with that dodge, then \nthey have done themselves a giant disservice.\n  If they swallow this quack medicine without being sure that it will \nnot be toxic to the system, they surely may regret the results.\n  If the Governors and the mayors and the State legislators do not \ndemand to know just exactly what we have in mind when we talk about \nbalancing this budget in 7 years, then how can they have an informed \ndebate if and when the matter rests squarely on their doorsteps? How \nwill they explain to their own constituents what the amendment means?\n  If I were a Governor contemplating the enactment of this amendment, I \nwould be very, very nervous about any promises that I had made to lower \ntaxes. I know that I have heard some of the Governors throughout the \nland boast about how much they have cut taxes in the States. They want \nthe Senate to adopt this balanced budget amendment, and they talk about \nhow much they, the Governors, have cut taxes in their States. I heard \nthe Governor from New Jersey speak about how many taxes she had cut and \nhow much more in taxes she proposes to cut. Well, I have news for you, \nGovernor, if this amendment is adopted, you will not be cutting taxes, \nyou will be raising taxes--and remember that.\n  With the magnitude of cuts that will have to be made to get a \nbalanced budget by 2002, the States are going to have to pick up an \nawful lot of slack. Essential services will have to continue. \nUnemployment, dirty air, dirty water, hazardous waste, hungry children, \nnatural disasters--all of these problems will still be with us. A \nbalanced budget amendment will not change any of those things. Not one. \nState and local officials should know what we here in the Congress \npropose to do before they are asked to buy this pig in a giant poke. We \ndo not even know if there is a pig in that poke. We cannot even get a \nsqueal out of that pig. If State and local officials do not trust the \nFederal Government to make decisions involving the States, how in the \nworld can they sit on their hands and trust us with the mother of all \ndecisions? That is what we are talking about. How in the world do we \ndare to ask the people and the Governors and the mayors and the State \nlegislators to make this giant leap of faith?\n  What will the people do if they do not like the plan that emerges? \nWhat if we adopt this amendment without laying out the plan? Well, it \nwill be too late then. The contract with evasion will have been signed, \nsealed, and delivered, right to your doorstep. Once the amendment is in \nthe Constitution, the politicians do not have to listen to the people's \nvoices on the matter anymore. The politicians can cut and run. They can \nsay we have to cut Medicare, whether you like it or not, because the \nConstitution has this new amendment in it and it says we have to; we \nhave to do that. The politicians can say to the States, you have to pay \nfor these services now with hikes in your own taxes. You told us to \nbalance the budget in 7 years, so we have to cut money to the States. \nOr the politicians can commit the ultimate act of evasion and say we \ncannot do this, Mr. and Mrs. America. We told you that we could, but it \nis too harsh and we will not do it. The President will have to do it. \nHe will have to impound funds, or the courts will have to order us to \nbalance the budget, and they will also have to tell us which taxes to \nraise and which programs to cut.\n  What then will we have done to our country? What then will we have \ndone to the Constitution, as written by the Framers 208 years ago? It \nhas been in effect now for 206 years. What then will we have done to \nrepresentative democracy?\n  We must not treat the people as children. We must tell them the \ntruth, even though it is inconvenient for us politicians to do so. What \nkind of Senators are we if we simply pass this amendment without \nourselves knowing what it means? We say that the American people ought \nto know what it means. We, as their representatives in this great \nassembly, have a right to know what it means and have a duty to ask \nwhat it means before we vote. What kind of representation are we giving \nto our people if we do not demand to know the details of this proposal \nbefore we vote on it? We as Senators cannot say, ``Let this cup pass \nfrom me,'' vote on the amendment and then let us tell the people what \nis in it. We cannot say, ``Let this cup pass from me.'' We cannot say \nthat we shall wash our hands of it. We have a duty to those \nconstituents who send us to this forum of the States to know what we \nare doing, what we are buying onto, and what we are about to perpetrate \non the people, before we cast our votes. I say we will not be giving \nthe people very worthy representation unless we insist on it. I say we \nought to feel like backing up to the pay window if we cannot do better. \nThe American people pay us very well. We ought to be willing to do what \nthey pay us to do, which is to make intelligent, well-informed \ndecisions in their behalf and in their best interests. We cannot do the \njob they sent us here to do if we are simply going to be stonewalled by \nthe proponents and prevented from knowing what we are about to do to \nour country.\n  Talleyrand, who was Napoleon's foreign minister, and who dominated \npolitics in Europe for 40 years, said, ``There is more wisdom in public \nopinion than is to be found in Napoleon, Voltaire, or all the ministers \nof state, present and to come.'' And that is true. But there is wisdom \nin public opinion only if the public is informed, if the public is duly \nand well informed about the subject on which a judgment is to be made. \nWoodrow Wilson said that the informing function is as important as is \nthe legislative function of a legislative body. Inform the people who \nsend us here.\n  At this point in time, this amendment is nothing more than a slogan. \nIt has no teeth at this point in time. Its impact is unknown. It is \nnothing more than an empty promise. Many of the Members who will vote \non it will not even be here when it has to be fulfilled. It is, in that \nsense, a fraud. It is a fantasy created for children, and the American \npeople are not all children. It is an illusion without substance. It is \ncotton candy for the public mind. It is Tinkerbell on wings of \ngossamer. Disneyland has really come to Washington after all. But the \nAmerican people are not children and Senators are not elected to simply \npacify the American people with fairy tales.\n  Let us demand to know the proponents' plan to achieve a balanced \nbudget by 2002 before we ask the States to decide and before we graft \nthis pneumatic excrescence, this wart filled with wind onto our time-\ntested Constitution.\n  Mr. President, if this amendment is adopted, it will likely mean \nmassive cuts in Federal spending over the next 7 years.\n  As the chart to my left states, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that a balanced budget amendment would require a cut of $1.2 \ntrillion in Federal spending by the year 2002. To make matters worse, \nthe so-called Contract With America; which I did not sign onto, Mr. \nPresident. I carry my contract right here over my heart. Alexander the \nGreat idolized ``The Iliad'' and he kept a copy under his pillow at \nnight. I keep a copy of my contract with America--right here, here it \nis--over my heart, the Constitution of the United States of America. It \nis a contract that was signed 208 years ago, not something that just \nblew up out of the wind before last year's election.\n  To make matters worse, the so-called Contract With America calls for \ntax cuts--tax cuts; what a folly--tax cuts along with balancing the \nbudget. This \n[[Page S2012]] would require a cut of $1.5 trillion in Federal spending \nby the year 2002.\n  How much is $1 trillion? Count it at the rate of $1 per second--\n32,000 years.\n  Now, you may ask, what will get whacked? What will get whacked? What \nwill get whacked?\n  CBO tells us that if we were to cut all Federal spending across-the-\nboard, except interest on the debt, it would require a\n 13-percent cut in all programs in the year 2002 alone. That means \ncutting defense, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' \npensions, veterans' compensation, veterans' medical care, prison \nconstruction and operations, environmental cleanup, civilian and \nmilitary pensions, housing, education, all student loan programs, \ninfrastructure investments on transportation projects, water projects, \nlocks and dams, the FBI, national parks, food stamps, WIC, and the list \ngoes on and on--all will have to be cut 13 percent across-the-board. \nBut, there are a number of Senators who want to take Social Security \noff of the deficit-cutting table. If we do that, everything else will \nhave to be cut 18 percent.\n\n  The so-called Contract With America--which I did not sign. This is my \ncontract with America, the Constitution of the United States. I have \nsworn 13 times to support and defend that Constitution over the last 48 \nyears--13 times.\n  But it calls for increases, not cuts, in defense spending. If we \nexempt interest, if we exempt Social Security, if we exempt defense, \nthen everything else will have to be cut 22 percent. And the so-called \nContract With America calls for tax cuts which, if they are enacted, \nwill increase the across-the-board cut to 30 percent--30 percent.\n  This next chart to my left shows the Federal budget for fiscal year \n1995. That is all we have to go on as of now. The President will send \nus up his proposed budget next week. In the upper left-hand corner, we \nsee that total spending for 1995 equals $1,531 billion; in other words, \n$1.531 trillion. Of that amount, 22 percent, or $334 billion, will be \nspent on Social Security; 18 percent, or $270 billion, will be spent \nthis fiscal year on defense; net interest on the national debt will \ntake up $235 billion, or 15 percent of the whole budget; Medicare will \ntake up 11 percent, or $176 billion; State and local grants will take \nup $231 billion, or 15 percent of the total; and all other Federal \nspending in fiscal year 1995 will equal $286 billion, or 19 percent of \nthe Federal budget.\n  What is it that could be cut from this and future budgets if this \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget is put in place? \nWell, as I have said, there is strong interest in exempting Social \nSecurity--they want to exempt Social Security--so let us take that \nslice out of the pie. Then, the so called Contract With America says we \ncannot cut defense, so let us take that slice out of the pie. Then, as \nwe all know, we cannot cut the interest on the debt--we all agree on \nthat--so out comes that piece of the pie. So, lo and behold, what do we \nhave left? All that we have left to cut are: Medicare, State and local \ngrants, and the rest of the Federal Government, all of which total less \nthan half of the Federal budget. We have, therefore, exempted 55 \npercent of the budget from cuts--Social Security at 22 percent, plus \ndefense at 18 percent, plus net interest at 15 percent--and the $1.5 \ntrillion in budget cuts would have to come from this remaining 45 \npercent of the budget.\n  That is all there is. There ``ain't'' any more.\n  Now, let us look at what this means when we have to take the cuts all \nfrom this remaining 45 percent of the budget. Let us take a look at \nwhat this means.\n  How do the States get stuck? How do the States get stuck?\n  This chart to my left sets out the Federal spending that will be \nsubject to cuts, if one excludes Social Security, defense, and net \ninterest. For fiscal year 1995, the total spending that would be \nsubject to cuts is $693 billion.\n  This pie represents Federal spending subject to cuts, once defense is \ntaken off, once Social Security is taken off, if it is, and once \ninterest is taken off the table, which it has not been taken off the \ntable. All three of these categories of Federal spending shown on this \npie chart will have to be cut across-the-board by 30 percent--by 30 \npercent--in the year 2002 if we exempt Social Security, defense, and \nnet interest from any cuts and if we enact the tax cuts being called \nfor in the so-called Contract With America. This includes unemployment \nbenefits, veterans' benefits, education programs, the FBI and the \nJustice Department, including prison construction and operations, the \nJudiciary and the Courts, infrastructure, health programs, safety \nprograms, health and safety programs for our food and water, aviation \nsafety--including air traffic control--civilian and military \nretirement, all agriculture programs--all of them--national parks--\nnational parks, I say that to the West in particular--highways, \ntransit, environmental cleanup, NASA, research and development, the \nNIH, and on and on and on. If we want to exclude any of the spending \nshown on the pie chart, then everything else will have to suffer an \neven larger cut than 30 percent. If we exclude Medicare, for example, \nthen the cut that would be required for everything else would rise from \n30 percent to a cut of 46 percent. Can you imagine the devastation this \nwould cause throughout the Nation?\n  Now, let us examine the effects that this level of cuts would have on \nthe States. This is the forum of the States. Let us examine the effects \nthat the cuts would have on the States.\n  Which States get the sharpest stick by the knife? Which States get \nthe sharpest stick by the knife? And that is some knife, I want to tell \nyou, and they will know when they are stuck with that knife. They are \ngoing to bleed.\n  This chart sets out the total Federal dollars that will go to the top \n20 States. I have set aside that chart for the moment. But \nnevertheless, it would set out the total Federal dollars that would go \nto the top 20 States in 1995 for 149 grant programs.\n  The top prize goes to the State of New York, which will receive \n$22,261,068,000 in Federal grants. That is the total amount of dollars \nin Federal grants that the State of New York will receive this year. \nThat is 10.8 percent of the total grants for all States.\n  Second prize goes to California. That State will receive this year \n$21,661,615,000, or 10.5 percent of the total Federal grants to States \nfor 1995.\n  Third prize goes to Texas, $12,292,605,000, or 5.9 percent of the \ntotal. And these top three are followed by Pennsylvania, \n$8,232,634,000, or 4 percent; Florida, No. 5, $8,067,751,000, or 3.9 \npercent.\n  Ohio is No. 6, with $7,837,289,000, or 3.8 percent. Illinois is next, \n$6,858,553,000, or 3.3 percent of the total. Michigan, $6,745,979,000, \nor 3.3 percent; New Jersey, $5,523,542,000, or 2.7 percent; \nMassachusetts with $5,400,302,000, or 2.6 percent; Louisiana, \n$5,300,141,000, or 2.6 percent; North Carolina, $4,741,842,000, or 2.3 \npercent; Georgia, $4,638,039,000, or 2.2 percent; Indiana, \n$3,945,534,000, or 1.9 percent; Tennessee, $3,889,558,000, or 1.9 \npercent; Washington, $3,517,731,000, or 1.7 percent; Wisconsin, \n$3,407,554,000, or 1.6 percent; Missouri, $3,381,960,000, or 1.6 \npercent; Minnesota, $3,010,222,000, or 1.5 percent; Kentucky, \n$3,004,724,000, or 1.5 percent.\n  These are the top 20 States in terms of receiving Federal grants in \nthis fiscal year. I hope that these 20 States--and all other States--\nrecognize that these grants are going to be cut dramatically in the \ncoming years if the balanced budget amendment goes into effect, and \nthose cuts will affect people. Those cuts will affect people in every \nState throughout the land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the table to which I have \njust referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  FEDERAL DOLLARS TO THE STATES--FISCAL YEAR 1995 FUNDING FOR 149 GRANT \n                                PROGRAMS                                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Percent\n                  State                           Amount        of total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew York.................................      $22,261,068,000      10.8\nCalifornia...............................       21,661,615,000      10.5\nTexas....................................       12,292,605,000       5.9\nPennsylvania.............................        8,232,634,000       4.0\nFlorida..................................        8,067,751,000       3.9\nOhio.....................................        7,837,289,000       3.8\nIllinois.................................        6,858,553,000       3.3\nMichigan.................................        6,745,979,000       3.3\nNew Jersey...............................        5,523,542,000       2.7\nMassachusetts............................        5,400,302,000       2.6\nLouisiana................................        5,300,141,000       2.6\nNorth Carolina...........................        4,741,842,000       2.3\nGeorgia..................................        4,638,039,000       2.2\nIndiana..................................        3,945,534,000       1.9\nTennessee................................        3,889,558,000       1.9\nWashington...............................        3,517,731,000       1.7\nWisconsin................................        3,407,554,000       1.6\nMissouri.................................        3,381,960,000       1.6\nMinnesota................................        3,010,222,000       1.5\n\n\n                                                                        \n[[Page S2013]]\n  FEDERAL DOLLARS TO THE STATES--FISCAL YEAR 1995 FUNDING FOR 149 GRANT \n                           PROGRAMS--Continued                          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Percent\n                  State                           Amount        of total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKentucky.................................        3.004,724,000       1.5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: OMB, Budget Information for States--Fiscal Year 1995.           \n\nMr. BYRD. Mr. President, now let us explore what these Federal grants \nto the States consist of. What do the States use this money for? What \ndo the cuts mean to you, Mr. and Mrs. America, and your children? What \ndo the cuts mean to you and your children?\n  This next chart sets out what these grants to State and local \ngovernments consist of in fiscal year 1995, ``Grants to State and Local \nGovernments in Fiscal Year 1995.'' The largest amount goes to the \nStates for Medicaid--$102 billion, or 44 percent of the total. Then, \ngoing counterclockwise on the chart, we see that transportation grants \nto the States equal $24 billion, or 10 percent of the total. Next, we \nhave income security programs which total $54 billion in grants to the \nStates for such things as AFDC, Section 8 and other housing, school \nbreakfast and lunch programs, and WIC. Then we come to grants for \neducation, training, employment, and social services, which total $35 \nbillion in fiscal year 1995. Finally, there is the category designated \n``all other,'' which equals $16 billion, or 7 percent of the total. \nThis category includes grants to the States for community development, \nhealth, water infrastructure, disaster assistance, justice assistance, \nincluding law enforcement programs such as ``cops on the beat'', and \nthe Federal payment to the District of Columbia.\n  A large part of all of these programs will obviously have to be \npicked up by the State and local governments if the balanced budget \namendment goes into effect. What will that mean to the budgets of the \nvarious States?\n  I say to the State senators out there--and I once was one--I say to \nthe members of the House of Delegates in West Virginia and the lower \nhouses in other States--and I was once one of those members--what will \nthat mean to your budgets, the budgets of the various States? Will \nGovernors and State legislators have to increase State taxes in order \nto continue to provide adequate services for these programs that we \nhave been talking about here? According to the Treasury Department they \nsurely--surely--will.\n  They will have to increase State taxes in order to continue to \nprovide adequate services for these programs.\n  The chart to my left was prepared based on information provided by \nthe U.S. Treasury Department to the National Governors Association. It \nis the Treasury Department's opinion that State taxes would have to be \nraised by the percentages shown on this chart if States are to fully \nreplace the reductions in Federal grants that will occur if the \nbalanced budget amendment goes into effect under the terms I have \npreviously stated.\n  State legislators in Alabama would have to increase their State taxes \nby 16.4 percent; Alaska, 9.8 percent; Arizona, 10.4 percent; Arkansas, \n16.5 percent; California, 9.2 percent; Colorado, 11.8 percent; \nConnecticut, 11.2 percent; Delaware, 7.2 percent; District of Columbia, \nLord knows how much, but the Treasury Department says 20.4 percent; \nFlorida, 10.2 percent; Georgia, 12 percent; Hawaii, 6.8 percent; Idaho, \n9.9 percent; Illinois, 11.6 percent; Indiana, 13.8 percent; Iowa, 10.9 \npercent; Kansas, 13 percent; Kentucky, 14.5 percent; Louisiana, 27.8 \npercent; Maine, 17.5 percent; Maryland, 9.9 percent; Massachusetts, \n12.6 percent; Michigan, 13.2 percent; Minnesota, 9.4 percent; \nMississippi, 20.8 percent; Missouri, 15.5 percent; Montana, 19.8 \npercent--up go your taxes; Nebraska, 13.3 percent; Nevada, 6.2 percent; \nNew Hampshire, 17.6 percent; New Jersey, 12.7 percent; New Mexico, 12.9 \npercent; New York, 17.4 percent; North Carolina, the State in which I \nwas born and whose motto is ``to be rather than to seem, 11.1 percent; \nNorth Dakota, 19.7 percent; Ohio, 14.4 percent; Oklahoma, 12.4 percent; \nOregon, 12.2 percent; Pennsylvania, 12.7 percent; Rhode Island, 21.4 \npercent; South Carolina, 14.3 percent; South Dakota, 24.7 percent; \nTennessee, 19.5 percent; Texas, 14 percent; Utah, 11.4 percent; \nVermont, 17.4 percent; Virginia, 8.2 percent; Washington, 8.4 percent; \nWest Virginia, 20.6 percent; Wisconsin, 10.3 percent; and Wyoming, 18.7 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the table to which I \nreferred showing these tax increases be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  TAX INCREASES TO OFFSET SPENDING CUTS                 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Required\n                                                               State tax\n                            State                               increase\n                                                               (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama......................................................       16.4\nAlaska.......................................................        9.8\nArizona......................................................       10.4\nArkansas.....................................................       16.5\nCalifornia...................................................        9.2\nColorado.....................................................       11.8\nConnecticut..................................................       11.2\nDelaware.....................................................        7.2\nDistrict of Columbia.........................................       20.4\nFlorida......................................................       10.2\nGeorgia......................................................       12.0\nHawaii.......................................................        6.8\nIdaho........................................................        9.9\nIllinois.....................................................       11.6\nIndiana......................................................       13.8\nIowa.........................................................       10.9\nKansas.......................................................       13.0\nKentucky.....................................................       14.5\nLouisiana....................................................       27.8\nMaine........................................................       17.5\nMaryland.....................................................        9.9\nMassachusetts................................................       12.6\nMichigan.....................................................       13.2\nMinnesota....................................................        9.4\nMississippi..................................................       20.8\nMissouri.....................................................       15.5\nMontana......................................................       19.8\nNebraska.....................................................       13.3\nNevada.......................................................        6.2\nNew Hampshire................................................       17.6\nNew Jersey...................................................       12.7\nNew Mexico...................................................       12.9\nNew York.....................................................       17.4\nNorth Carolina...............................................       11.1\nNorth Dakota.................................................       19.7\nOhio.........................................................       14.4\nOklahoma.....................................................       12.4\nOregon.......................................................       12.2\nPennsylvania.................................................       12.7\nRhode Island.................................................       21.4\nSouth Carolina...............................................       14.3\nSouth Dakota.................................................       24.7\nTennessee....................................................       19.5\nTexas........................................................       14.0\nUtah.........................................................       11.4\nVermont......................................................       17.4\nVirginia.....................................................        8.2\nWashington...................................................        8.4\nWest Virginia................................................       20.6\nWisconsin....................................................       10.3\nWyoming......................................................       18.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Department of the Treasury, Jan. 12, 1995.                      \n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope that my remarks today will have \nhelped to shed light on the devastation which will take place if we do \nnot muster up the courage to say no to the balanced budget amendment \nnow before the Senate. It does not make any difference, Mr. President, \nif you have a vocabulary of 10,000 words, make it 20,000, make it \n30,000. If you cannot say no, then all of that vast vocabulary will not \namount to a great deal. We have been elected by the people to come here \nand to work hard to develop and enact legislation that is in their best \ninterest--not in ours as politicians, not what will get us votes in the \nnext election or the next one or the next one, but in the best interest \nof the people. Surely we can screw up our courage to the sticking place \nto stay the course and continue to cut the Federal deficit in \nresponsible doses. We cannot afford to risk the economic security of \nthis Nation by passing this unseen pig in a very large poke.\n  I remind the Governors, Mr. President, that the devastation to the \nStates, as shown through these charts, is going to happen irrespective \nof the recently passed, highly touted unfunded mandates legislation. \nCongress will brush that aside. It only takes a majority vote. That is \nnot binding on the next Congress, not even binding on this one, if \nCongress chooses to brush it aside. That bill is not going to protect \none single State from the costs and responsibility of dealing with \ntheir problem absent Federal dollars. If State officials are leaning on \nthe weak reed, the flimsy reed of the unfunded mandates bill, they are \nbadly mistaken. It will be as a straw in a hurricane; as a leaky boat \nin a tidal wave.\n  I say to the American people, no one--no one, no one--is going to \nescape the wrath of the balanced budget mandate.\n  We cannot run to the mountains and pray that the rocks will fall upon \nus, put us out of our misery. No one can come to this floor and, in all \nhonesty, tell the people of America that they will escape real pain \nunder the amendment.\n  Finally, I remind my colleagues that the American people have a right \nto know what is going to happen to them as a result of the balanced \nbudget amendment, if it is riveted in the Constitution.\n   [[Page S2014]] A new poll, in fact, underscores the people's demand \nto know what will happen to them at this time shows overwhelming public \nsupport for the ``right to know.''\n  This poll, released just this morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, my \ncolleagues on the right and on the left, this poll released just this \nmorning by the American Association of Retired Persons and conducted by \nthe Wirthlin Group, shows that support for the ``right to know'' cuts \nacross party lines: 68 percent of the Republicans, 77 percent of the \nDemocrats, and 83 percent of the independents want to know what will be \ncut. And they want to know what will be cut before Congress passes a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Not afterwards. Before.\n  In addition, 85 percent agree that Social Security should be exempted \nfrom the amendment. But under House Joint Resolution 1, Social Security \nis not exempt. It is on the chopping block no matter what anyone says.\n  If this amendment is passed, what will Senators say to their \nconstituents? How will Senators explain the fact that, despite the \npublic's desire to know beforehand what cuts will be made, Senators \ntook it upon themselves to substitute their wills, our wills for the \nwill of the people out there. Talk about arrogance. That is the height \nof arrogance.\n  So I implore my colleagues to heed the wisdom of the people. Let us \ntell the American public what is involved here. Tell them and tell them \nnow. That is what the people in the poll want to know. Let us not \ncontinue this vow of silence. Let us not close out the sunshine. Let us \nnot pull the shutters on the windows and shut out the scrutiny of the \npublic.\n  Mr. President, Shakespeare, in ``Timon of Athens'', said it best:\n\n       The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he \n     crossed himself by't: and I cannot think but, in the end, the \n     villainies of man will set him clear.\n\n  Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch versus Maryland said:\n\n       We must never forget, that it is a Constitution we are \n     expounding.\n\n  Mr. President, if I might add my own modest footnote, we must not \nforget that it is a Constitution that we are amending.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the floor unless a Senator \nwishes to ask me a question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there are very few people in this body who \nhave more respect, in fact I do not think there is anybody who has more \nrespect for the distinguished Senator from West Virginia than I have. I \nlearned early in my Senate career that he is very, very formidable. And \nhe is, I think, one of the people who is the most dedicated to this \nbody and to what the Senate means in the United States of America.\n  I might mention that I believe that he is as dedicated to the \nConstitution as anybody I know. And I also believe that he is, without \nquestion, without peer with regard to Senate rules and procedure. I \nhave had personal experience of being on the wrong side of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia and I admire him and care a \ngreat deal for him. I do not know when I have heard a more interesting \nset of remarks than he has just given to the Senate this day. I think \nwe should all pay heed to what he has said. I think his comments are \nimportant.\n  But I also think the Senator is wrong. If I did not believe that I \nwould not be out here fighting for a balanced budget amendment. He \nknows that. And he knows that I believe this very deeply, as he \nbelieves his position. And I respect him for his commitment to his \nposition.\n  He has taken a goodly amount of time, but not enough, perhaps, to \nexplain his position. I think it is critical that the American people \nsee the two sides of this subject and I do not know of anyone in the \nbody who could have articulated his side any better.\n  I think a lot of this great Senator and, when histories of the Senate \nare written to include his time here, certainly he will be shown to \nhave played a pivotal and very important role in the history of this \ninstitution.\n  But let me just see if I can respond to some of the things my friend \nand colleague has said. First of all, the American people are not \nstupid. They know that this Federal Government is a money eating \nmachine. They know that billions, hundreds of billions of dollars are \neaten up right here in Washington, without much care for the American \ntaxpayers.\n  They also know that we have built the most gargantuan bureaucracy in \nthe history of the world. Keep in mind, our Founding Fathers wanted to \nhave a central Government that was limited, not all-embracing; where \nthe people in the States do not just look to the Federal Government to \nsolve all their problems, but where they solve them for themselves for \nthe most part. The Federal Government as originally intended was to be \na limited Government to take care of our national security interests, \nto do the few commerce things that should be done by the Federal \nGovernment: To watch over the public welfare.\n  I think our Founding Fathers would be absolutely devastated if they \nsaw the state of the Federal Government today. If they saw the \ndomination of the States by the Federal Government that we have going \non today, if they saw the way the Federal Government soaks up the \npublic's money today, if they knew--as some argue very eloquently, \nmaybe not as eloquently as my friend from West Virginia--that of all \nthe public welfare money that we spend through the Federal Government, \nthis wonderful stuff we do for the States--when it comes to welfare \nonly about 28 percent of every dollar gets ultimately to the people who \nneed it.\n  We in the Federal Government act like we know more about what people \nneed than they do, so we study things, we build bureaucracies, we hire \nsociologists and Ph.D.'s and other specialists and experts and we use \nup the people's money here like it is going out of style while the \npeople who need it--the people we are supposedly helping--get 28 \npercent of it. That is what is wrong with a bloated Federal Government. \nThat is what the Founding Fathers were trying to guard against. \nAvoiding this was the work of Madison and Jefferson and Washington.\n  I might have a number of others who are maybe not quite as well \nknown, but certainly well known by my friend from West Virginia, who is \na great scholar of history, and especially the history of this country. \nWe know the Federal Government right now means a lot to the States \nbecause they cannot make a move without its consent.\n  We also know that if we pass a balanced budget amendment, every \ndollar will become more valuable. If we pass a balanced budget \namendment that stops this continual drop into the abyss of deficit \nspending, which we have been doing now for 60 years, certainly 26 of \nthe last years in unbalanced budgets, and in recent years because of \nGreat Society programs, these reasonable--reasonable is not the word--\nthis overwhelming desire by everybody to do everything good for \neverybody in our society.\n  We now have deficits that, after the turn of the century, are going \nto be over $300 billion a year, and the interest against the national \ndebt has now become the second highest item in the Federal budget. And \nit is going up exponentially with compound interest. We all understand \ncompound interest, do we not? The interest just starts to multiply like \nyou cannot believe. If we do not get control over the spending of this \nall-eating, voracious, money-grubbing Federal Government, if we do not \nbring it to heel, then all of these gifts and grants to the States that \nthe distinguished Senator has so eloquently spoken about are not going \nto be worth anything anyway, assuming that we can afford to make any \nmore of them. They are going to look to us and say, ``You people did it \nto us. You did not have the guts to balance the budget.'' Let me just \nsay this about my friend from West Virginia. He has the guts. I believe \nin him with regard to his comments that he would balance the budget. He \nwould find ways to do it. I think he would do everything in his power \nto. I believe that. I have faith that he would do that.\n  But when he was majority leader, he was not able to do that, not \nbecause he did not try. He could not. People in both parties spent us \nright down the \n[[Page S2015]] drain. He tried as President pro tempore, certainly one \nof the most dignified and knowledgeable people in this body, if not the \nmost dignified and knowledgeable. He could not do it then, and neither \ncould I. Neither could the Senator from Illinois. Neither could a lot \nof us who want to get this tremendously expensive Federal Government \nunder control.\n  We have reached a point really of no return, that if we do not do \nwhat is right now, all this money, these hundreds of billions, \ntrillions of dollars that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis talking about that go to the States over the years are not going to \nbe worth anything. Then what happens to those who need health care? \nWhat happens to women and children who need women's, infants', and \nchildren's programs? What happens to food stamps? Will we be able to \npay for them? If so, are they going to be worth anything? We know a lot \nof them are being picked up by the Mafia in exchange for drugs and \nbooze, and then they make a lot of money cashing in those food stamps \nat a tremendous cost to the American taxpayer.\n  Let me tell you something. I enjoyed the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator about magic potions and elixirs and snake oil. I \nknow a lot about those things because I have been watching the Congress \nfor these last 18 years as I have sat here. You talk about snake oil. \nYou talk about magic potions and elixirs. You can find them here every \nday in budgetary matters because Congress is not willing to do anything \nabout deficits and spending.\n  I have heard people time after time say this, and they are courageous \nin standing up here and saying we have to do it; we have to get control \nof this thing, and we have to balance the budget, and it stops here \nwith us. The problem is for all of my 19 years, it has never stopped \nonce. It is not going to, either, without a mechanism in the \nConstitution that encourages us to do it.\n  By the way, this balanced budget amendment does not cut all of these \nthings out. It does not say that we have to balance the budget. We do \nnot have to balance the budget under this amendment if we do not want \nto. The only difference is instead of playing games here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate and in the House with voice votes and a lot of ways \nof hiding so the American people do not know who is voting to spend all \nof this money, we have to vote if we do not want to balance the budget. \nIf we are going to have a deficit, we are going to have to give a \nthree-fifths vote to do it. I am not saying that is insurmountable. I \nhave seen debt ceilings lift where we did not need a three-fifths vote, \nnot many. But from this point on, I have to say it will be money in the \nbank for the American people because they will know who did it to them \nfrom this point on, if this amendment is adopted and ratified.\n  By the way, if we want the President's solution for deficit \nreduction, which is to increase taxes like he did last year, with the \nlargest tax increase in history, which some have praised here on the \nfloor during this debate, by gosh, we can do that. All we have to have \nto do that is a constitutional majority here on the floor of the Senate \nand on the floor of the House.\n  What does that mean? If we have 51 Senators here, we have a quorum. \nWe could vote on anything, by and large, or should I say most anything, \nby a majority vote. We could have 26 votes for and 25 against and, by \ngosh, it passes. With a constitutional majority, you cannot do that. It \nis not a mere majority of those voting. It is a majority of the whole \nnumber of both Houses. You have to have 51 votes in the Senate, 218 in \nthe House.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I did not utter one word yesterday on the balanced \nbudget amendment. But I want to serve notice that I am going to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator want to do that now? I will be happy to \nconclude this. I do want to make a few more points.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I really apologize for interrupting the Senator. I do \nwant to say I am not so concerned about the requirement of a \nconstitutional 60 percent, three-fifths vote in the Senate to balance \nthe budget. That will almost certainly happen.\n  I had my staff do a study of all the appropriations bills for fiscal \nyear 1995. Last year, the average vote for all of the 13 appropriations \nbills was 84.5 votes in the Senate. So I expect it is not going to be \ntoo difficult to get 60 votes to override the amendment. But my concern \nis not that. My concern is the potential damage that can be done by 41 \nobstreperous ideologues who care more about their ideology than they do \nthe future of the country.\n  Let us assume we are in a recession headed for a depression, and \nevery economist in the country tells us the only way in the world you \ncan head off massive unemployment and massive social and cultural \ndisaster is for the Government to create job-producing projects. And 41 \nSenators, far fewer than a majority, can say, ``We don't care what the \neconomists said. We are for a balanced budget. And we are not going to \nstand for allowing 60 Senators to unbalance this budget.'' So the \ncountry goes right into the tank.\n  That is my real concern. I am interested in the reaction of the \nSenator.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a good question, and I think one deserving of an \nanswer.\n  First of all, you will never get all the economists to say the \nGovernment has to help us solve the employment problem or that make-\nwork jobs are going to get us there.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Again, just so we make this point, I am one of the \npeople in this body, along with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, who remembers well the Depression. I was just a child. We \nwere very poor. There was no snob value in it. Everybody in town was \npoor. But I can remember.\n  The reason I still believe in Government is that the Government did \nsome good things and created jobs at the same time. They helped us pave \nour streets where we choked to death on dust and mud. We lived a block \nfrom Main Street, and you could not get there when it rained. I can \nremember when we got an indoor john for the first time. We were rich. \nBefore that we had a ``two-holer'' out back. Most people just had a \n``one-holer.'' We got running water, clean water. People quit having \ntyphoid fever and the farmers got low-interest loans. As a matter of \nfact, the Government built houses for them.\n  I could go on about rural electrification, which saved my father's \nbusiness. He was a small hardware merchant. As a result of rural \nelectrification he was able to sell refrigerators, radios, ranges, all \nof those things.\n  So I think Government does some things well. And we could face a time \nlike the Depression again if we have 41 obstreperous Senators saying, \n``No; that does not fit with my philosophy.''\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer comes from a State where we built \nTVA power, and the people of Tennessee enjoy very low rates as a result \nof TVA power. I promise you, he does not think Government is all bad, \neither.\n  All I am saying is, if those things happen--and they most certainly \nwill at some point--what happens? I do not believe in Government by \nminority rule. That is what we will have.\n  Mr. HATCH. Neither do I.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator to yield? He mentioned \nmy name.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me yield first to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, and then I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes. I would like to respond to my friend from Arkansas. \nFirst of all, I believe that Government can do very good things. I \nbelieve it more than my friend from Utah does. I am for a WPA program \nright now. I put in the Record yesterday an article by a distinguished \neconomist, as well as a couple of other things by other economists, \nsaying that the evidence now is that because of the heavy debt we have, \nwe simply are not responding.\n  You can remember when the President of the United States, when he \nfirst came in, asked us for $15 billion for a jobs program, but because \nof the deficit, we could not do it. Fred Bertston, a former Assistant \nSecretary of the Treasury, whom you know, has said, if you had asked \nhim 10 years ago would he be for a constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget, he would have said absolutely not. He says, ``Now I \nthink it is essential.'' The only \n[[Page S2016]] way he says you are going to have a response to \nrecessions that is adequate is to build up about a 2-percent surplus, \ngive the President the authority to respond with certain specific \nprograms when unemployment goes above a certain level in various \nStates.\n  I would say, finally, to my friend from Arkansas, where we have \nresponded is in the extension of unemployment compensation. I went back \nover several decades when we have extended unemployment compensation. I \ncould find only one time--in 1982--when we did not have more than 60 \nvotes to respond to that. So the reality is that we are frozen by this \nhuge deficit from responding adequately now. We can build in a system \nwhere we can respond much more adequately to recessions than we now do.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could add something to that. I agree with the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois. I am not fighting with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. There is no question, the Government can play a role. \nWhere you have valid social programs, I do not think you would have a \nrough time getting a three-fifths vote.\n  We are talking about a bigger picture than that. The force of this \namendment is that you have to vote, you have to vote. You are going to \nhave to have a three-fifths vote to increase the deficit as a whole. \nYou are going to have to make priority choices among competing \nprograms. I remember the depression, too. I was born and we lost our \nhome right after I was born. We also did not have indoor facilities for \nmany of the early years of my life. It has been said of me that I never \npass a bathroom. Having to walk 100 yards in the mud was no fun for me, \nand I did that all too often.\n  But the fact of the matter is that we are talking about a much bigger \npicture here than any single program. We do not even have to balance \nthe budget under this amendment, but it does point us in the right \ndirection, it does give incentives, and it makes us vote on whether we \nare going to have deficit spending or whether we are going to increase \ntaxes or whether we are going to do both. I am not saying we cannot do \nboth. I think under strenuous times, such as war, severe depression, or \nrecession, we are going to get the votes.\n  I also believe if there were obstreperous minorities of 41, they are \ngoing to find a rough time at the ballot box if that is what happens. \nIt is the same with those who always want to spend regardless of \nwhether we have the money. They can do it if they get control of the \nCongress and if they have a constitutional majority vote to raise \ntaxes, but they are going to pay a price at the polls.\n  Those are just some of the values of this amendment. I said I would \nyield to my dear friend and colleague from West Virginia. I did not \nmean to say so much before I yielded.\n  I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. He always treats me with the utmost \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. HATCH. Deservedly so.\n  Mr. BYRD. I heard the Senator say, I believe, that this amendment \ndoes not require that the budget needs to be balanced.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is not required.\n  Mr. BYRD. This amendment is being sold to the American people as a \nway to balance the budget. Is that not a bit misleading?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not at all, because if we required you to balance the \nbudget every year, that would fly in the face of the right to do \nsomething when we have exigent and difficult times.\n  The fact of the matter is, what this amendment always represented \nitself to be, and what it always will be, is an amendment that says, \nhey, Members of Congress, the game is over. You are going to have to \nvote if you want to increase the deficit. You are going to have to vote \nif you want to increase taxes. Both votes are more significant than a \nmajority vote. And you are going to have to have a three-fifths vote. \nIf you want to increase the deficit, you are going to have to have a \nconstitutional majority to increase taxes.\n  My personal belief is that it will be much easier to get that three-\nfifths vote to increase the deficit than to get a constitutional \nmajority to increase taxes. I have no doubt in my mind about that. But \nboth of them point us in the right direction by saying, look, we have \nto work on making priority choices. We just cannot fund everything \nanymore, and anybody with any modicum of sense knows that. We cannot \nfund everything anymore. We have to make priority choices and keep the \nbest programs we can, and we might have to wait for a few years to get \nsome of these less important programs.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. My friend, the Senator from Utah, is \nnow telling the Senate and the American people that this amendment does \nnot require a balanced budget.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is precisely what this amendment is being sold as. The \nAmerican people are being told--and I have heard it said by many of the \nproponents on the floor this week already--that this is the way to \nbalance the budget. ``We have to have something to force us to balance \nthe budget.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah is saying that this amendment \ndoes not require a balanced budget. I think we ought to tell the \nAmerican people that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have.\n  Mr. BYRD. I read this in the first section: ``Total outlays for any \nfiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.''\n  I know there are some loopholes whereby we might vote by three-fifths \nof a majority of each House, about which I will express myself at \nanother time. But this amendment, we are now being told, does not \nrequire a balanced budget.\n  Let me ask the Senator this: He also said in his statement that we--\nmeaning the Congress--are unwilling to do anything about it--meaning \nthese massive deficits; we are unwilling to take the courageous action \nthat is needed to bring them under control. We are unwilling to do it.\n  Mr. President, I remind my friend that we in the Congress were \nwilling in 1990, under the agreement that was achieved at the so-called \nbudget summit, where the representatives of the Bush administration \nsat, and the leadership on both sides of the aisle in this body and the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle in the other body were present. \nWe agreed on a package that would reduce the deficits over a period of \n5 years by something like $482 billion. And then in 1993, working with \nPresident Clinton, the Democratic Congress enacted legislation that, \nover a period of 5 years, reduces the budget deficit by $432 billion. I \nknow it really cuts, because we froze domestic discretionary spending, \nand because of that package, we are presently operating under a freeze. \nSo we really cut discretionary spending, which includes both defense \nand domestic.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend that when the time came to vote on \nthat package, where was the courage? The Congress, under Democratic \ncontrol in both Houses, demonstrated the courage to do something about \nit. We enacted that package, cutting $432 billion over a period of 5 \nyears. We enacted that package, but without the help of a single vote \nfrom my friend's side of the aisle. Not one Republican Senator from \nthese 50 States, not one Republican House Member from these 50 States, \nscrewed up the courage to vote for that package, which cuts deficits, \nover a period of 5 years, by $432 billion.\n  And so, it was the Democrats in the Senate and in the House who \ndemonstrated a willingness--I refer to the Senator's statement, when he \nsaid we are unwilling to do anything about it--it was the Democratic \nSenators and Democratic House Members under Democratic leadership and \nworking with a Democratic President who demonstrated a willingness to \ncast a hard vote and to make some hard choices in the 1993 \nreconciliation bill.\n  So let it not be said that Congress does not have the courage to do \nit. I say why do we not do it again? Why do we not do it, I say to my \nfriend? Why do we not do it again?\n  If the proponents of this amendment have--pardon me for imposing on \nthe time; I will just say this and I will sit down--but if the \nproponents of this amendment have two-thirds of the vote to adopt this \nconstitutional amendment in the House, and two-thirds of the vote in \nthe Senate to adopt this constitutional amendment, meaning they have \n290 votes in the House and 67 votes in the Senate, if they have the \n[[Page S2017]] votes to adopt this constitutional amendment, why do \nthey not get on with passing bills now? It only takes a majority of \neach body to pass bills, not two-thirds. Why do we not get on with it \nnow? Why wait 7 years?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think that is a legitimate question. But \nkeep in mind, both the 1990 bill and the 1993 bill were tax increase \nbills. And there is only so many times you can increase taxes on the \nAmerican people.\n  What this amendment does is--yes, it does not require a balanced \nbudget--it just says that it should be the rule and we have to work to \nget there. And if we do not want to get there, we are going to have to \nvote not to and the American people will know who did it to them. That \nis the difference. It will take a supermajority vote of three-fifths, \nif you want to increase spending beyond our revenues, and a \nconstitutional majority, no less than 51 in the Senate and no less than \n218 in the House, if you want to increase taxes.\n  And I have to tell you, one of the reasons we believe this has to \nhappen is because for the last 26 years we have not reached a balanced \nbudget with all the tax increases we have had.\n  I remember back in 1982, when we increased taxes under Reagan, on the \nassumption that for every dollar in increased taxes we get $2 in \ndeficit reduction. We increased taxes and we spent $1.32 more for every \ndollar, and now we are spending almost $1.90 more for every dollar we \nincreased in taxes.\n  Now I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, if he had \nhis way would be able to do this, to balance the budget, and I would \nhelp him; at least I would try. I might not want to increase taxes to \ndo it, but I would help him balance the budget.\n  But, I have to say, he is singular in getting it done. Now, I respect \nhim. And I have no qualms about saying I think he would do that if he \ncould. If he was a dictator or even a Talleyrand, he might get it done. \nBut he is one of 100, in fact, one of 535. And it has not been done. \nAnd it is not going to be done, not without some mechanism in the \nConstitution to give us the incentives to do it.\n  Now, does this amendment guarantee we are going to go to a balanced \nbudget? I think over time it does, because I think the American people \nare going to know who is doing it to them because we will be standing \nup and voting, rather than playing games around here.\n  Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would simply like to respond briefly to \nmy friend from West Virginia--and he is my friend and I have great \nrespect for him.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mine, too.\n  Mr. SIMON. In what he has had to say.\n  Let me, in response to his last question to my colleague from Utah, \nsay my colleague from Utah and I do not agree on how we ought to \nbalance the budget. We have some strong philosophical differences, as \nSenator Byrd knows. We do agree, however, that we have to do it, and we \nneed the discipline of a constitutional amendment to force us to do it.\n  I would differ also with respect to my friend when he talks about the \nheavy tax burden. I am not suggesting that we are going to solve this \nprimarily through taxes. I do not think that is the case. I would add, \nof the 24 major industrial nations we are 24th in the percentage of our \nincome that goes for taxation. We do not have a value-added tax. Most \nof the countries in Western Europe have that. We have the lowest tax on \na gallon of gasoline of any country outside of Saudi Arabia; the lowest \ntaxes on a package of cigarettes, and you could go on and mention other \nthings. But, having said that, there is no question we are going to \nprimarily do this through restraining growth in spending.\n  And the Senator is right, I say to Senator Byrd, when he says we are \ngoing to have to make hard choices.\n  But it is very interesting--and we were just given at the Democratic \ncaucus today a poll by the Wirthlin group on the balanced budget \namendment--79 percent of the people favor a balanced budget amendment \nand 53 percent of them believe they are going to have to sacrifice in \norder to achieve it. They are willing to, the American public is \nwilling to.\n  I take the choice of sacrificing a little bit so my three \ngrandchildren can have a better future. And I do not have a difficult \ntime making that choice at all, and I do not think the American people \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague on his feet, and I am pleased to \nyield to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe I still have the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am sorry. I thought my colleague had yielded the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I am still retaining my right to the floor, but I am \nhappy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am trying to remember precisely how the Senator said it \nwhen he spoke of his children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I said what I am required to do, if we pass \nthis, is to sacrifice a little bit myself so they can have a better \nfuture.\n  The GAO says if we continue down the present path we are going to \nhave a gradual declining standard of living. But if we, by the end of \nthe century or 2001 in their original study, now it will be postponed \nto 2002, have a balanced budget by the year 2020, the average American \nwill have, in inflation adjusted terms, an increase in the standard of \nliving of 36 percent. That is a huge increase for those three \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may engage in this colloquy, \nwith the Senator from Utah retaining his right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois has \nmade a startling revelation. And I love him. I think he is Mr. Fair and \nSquare around here, and I believe he is Mr. Fair and Square. He always \nhas a smiling face and a shining countenance and that upbeat spirit \nabout him that is so infectious. And I am going to miss him.\n  Mr. SIMON. I can see how you got elected in West Virginia, Senator \nByrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, that goes back a long way, I say to the Senator.\n  I believe he said that, ``If this amendment is adopted, then I would \nbe willing to sacrifice so that my children and grandchildren can have \na better future.''\n  Is he also saying that if this amendment is not adopted, he is \nunwilling to sacrifice for his children and grandchildren?\n  I say, Mr. President, we need to sacrifice for our children and \ngrandchildren, whether or not this amendment is adopted. And we do not \nneed an additional bit of print in the Constitution to fortify us with \nthe courage and the discipline and the will to take a strong stand now \nin order to sacrifice for our country or our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, if I do not have the courage now to take a strong \nstand, if I am unwilling now to take a strong stand on behalf of my \nchildren and grandchildren and their children, there is no amount of \nink that can put into that Constitution that will give me any more \nbackbone, any more spine, any more courage, any more strength of will \nthan I already have. It just cannot be done. I say that with all due \nrespect to my friend.\n  He may wish to comment on my remarks.\n  I ask that the Senator from Utah yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am willing to sacrifice right now, and I know the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senator from Utah are, too. \nUnfortunately, we have 26 years in a row of history that, as a body, we \nhave rarely been willing to do it.\n  Oh, in 1993, you and I voted for what Senator Bob Kerrey called a \nmodest step toward reducing the deficit. I was pleased to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Modest enough. It did not get a single vote on the other \nside of the aisle in either House.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator is correct. Economists are virtually unanimous \nin saying that that was a good thing. It is to the credit of President \nClinton that we did that.\n  I think history clearly shows we need outside discipline. We can even \nsay it is a little more print in the paper of the Constitution. But as \nI said yesterday-- \n[[Page S2018]] and I think our Senator from Tennessee was presiding \nthen, too--I said all of us went right over there and we took but one \noath, to defend the Constitution. That has meaning for Senators. And I \nthink that is true for any Senator. I think we are going to live by \nthat.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the Senator adds those points, and if \nthe Senator from Utah is willing to yield, the distinguished Senator \nreferred to the oath. I have taken the oath 13 times in 48 years: In \nthe West Virginia House of Delegates, the West Virginia Senate, the \nUnited States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate. \nI know what it means.\n  Mr. President, we should be willing to bite the bullet now. We have \nnot been 26 years in the building of this colossal--these deficits to \nthe extent that they are triple-digit billion dollar deficits. For 182 \nyears we ran up something like $1 trillion debt.\n  Then when Mr. Reagan came into office--he was in office 8 years, Mr. \nBush 4 years--we more than tripled that debt. And as my grandson used \nto say, ``You know what,'' I helped Mr. Reagan to triple that debt. \nBecause I voted for his tax cut in 1981. And I have regretted it. I \nvoted for his massive military buildup. I urged upon him that he could \nnot balance the budget, mount such a massive defense buildup, and cut \ntaxes in 3 successive years, 5 percent the first year, 10 percent the \nnext year and 10 percent the third year. I urged upon him that he wait \nuntil after the first year or after the second year.\n  And as the minority leader at that time, I offered an amendment on \nthis floor to require that we not have 3 years of successive tax cuts \nall in one bill; that, instead, we have 2 years and then wait and see \nwhat was happening to the economy, the deficits and so on, before we \ninstitute another, the third tax cut. But President Reagan would not \nlisten. I voted with Mr. Reagan. I supported him on that tax cut \nbecause many West Virginians told me to give him a chance. I supported \nhim on the defense buildup.\n  As to those triple-digit billion-dollar deficits, we never had one \nbefore Mr. Reagan was in office. Never did we have one triple-digit \nbillion-dollar deficit. Never. They all started under his \nadministration. I know a lot of people blame Congress for the deficits, \nbut I will show sometime during the next few days that going back 45 \nyears the total accumulated appropriations over the period of 45 years \nunder the various Presidents, the accumulated appropriations are less \nthan the accumulated budget requests submitted by those Presidents to \nthe Congresses during that period of time. The figures will not lie. \nLiars can figure, but figures will not lie. The laws of mathematics do \nnot change, whether it is the old math or the new math.\n  I say to my friend, this talk about needing something in the \nConstitution to force Members to discipline Members, to force Members \nto take the positions to make the tough votes and the tough choices. \nSomething to force us. What are we, children? Mr. President, we will \ndodge that bullet when it comes because under this amendment, do you \nknow who will enforce this balanced budget amendment? Congress will, \naccording to this amendment language. Congress. Congress will enforce \nit. The same Congress which lacks the discipline now, to use the \nSenator's words, in essence.\n  I was thinking of Darwin and his theory of the survival of the \nfittest. I do not think that the men and women who come to this body in \n2002, 2003, or 2004 will have had sufficient additional time to benefit \nfrom Darwin's theory anymore than we, with our ancestors stretching \nback over thousands upon thousands of years, have already benefited. \nDiscipline cannot be put into the bloodstream of man by a needle. He \ncannot be inoculated with faith and discipline and courage, backbone \nand spine. It has to be inside him to begin with. I say that with the \ngreatest respect for my friend, the happy warrior, the happy warrior, \nfrom the great State of Illinois.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could take back my time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has the floor and \nwhen he is through I want to get the floor just to respond very \nbriefly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing the right to the floor, take that time to \ndo so.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me say that there is no absolute \nguarantee that this will work. I think what we can virtually guarantee \nis if we do not pass this, we are continuing down the same slippery \nslope and we are not going to get things done.\n  In 1981 I was in the House. I was not in the Senate. But in the House \nwe ended up with a bidding war between President Reagan and the \nDemocrats on a tax cut. I voted against both the Reagan tax cut and the \nDemocratic tax cut because the numbers just did not add up. We were \nsaying by 1984 we will have a balanced budget. Third grade arithmetic \ntold you that was not true.\n  Just a few other quick comments. One is the details of where we are \nheading. Concord Coalition put together a package. By the time this \ndebate is over we will have a rough idea. One way to do it, for \nexample, is to live within the limits that we have established right \nnow through 1998, and then make some policy decisions that would \ncombine the total of the Bush package, I think it was 1991, and the \nClinton package, 1993. Not that onerous. People are being told, ``This \nis going to hit every group.'' Senior citizens are being told it will \ncome out of your Social Security.\n  I had a man this morning, a hospital executive, tell me, We have been \ntold $500 billion of this is going to come out of hospitals. Every \ngroup is being told that. It just is not true.\n  Second, I say to my friend, who is, I think--and I am not one to \nexaggerate on the floor of the Senate, even though we all have a \npropensity to do that occasionally--I think it is correct to say that \nthere has been no Senator in the history of the Senate who has been as \nmuch of a historian as Robert Byrd. His sweeping knowledge of history \nis impressive. I have written a few books in the field of history, but \nI do not pretend to have his knowledge of history.\n  The only historian who would even come close would be Albert \nBeveridge who served Indiana around the turn of the century who did a \nthree volume biography of Abraham Lincoln. But he had nowhere near the \ncomprehensive knowledge of Senator Byrd.\n  But it was interesting to me this great historian did not get into \nthe economic history of nations, and that economic history is very \nclear. As nations pile up debt, they keep on piling up debt, and what \ndo they do eventually? They monetize the debt. They start the printing \npresses rolling. That is the history of nations, and we cannot avoid \nthat.\n  Now, my friend from West Virginia had all what is going to happen to \nthe various States. What is going to happen in those States if we do \nnot pass the balanced budget amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield, with the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Utah? Why do we not do it now? We need two-thirds vote in each \nbody to adopt this amendment. Why do we not just use a majority now to \ntake whatever actions are necessary to continue to bring that budget \ninto balance? It only takes a majority. Why wait 7 years? Darwin's \ntheory of natural selection will not make me any more courageous in 7 \nyears or 9 years or 90 years. I have only the courage that God gave me \nand the courage and the will and the determination and the faith that \nwere inculcated into me by the people who raised me and by the genes \nthat my father and mother and their ancestors gave me. That \nConstitution will not give me any more courage. Let us do it now. Why \nnot now? Why not start now?\n  Mr. SIMON. I say to my friend from West Virginia, if we had 51 Robert \nByrds in the U.S. Senate, we could do that. We do not. That is the \nsimple reality.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, I say to the Senator, you are flattering me now. We \nhave lots of men and women in this Senate who have the courage to do it \nnow. It is not just the Robert Byrds. We have enough men and women in \nthe Senate to do it now. Let us be honest with those people out there \nwho are watching through that electronic eye. We have just heard our \nfriend on the other side of the aisle say this constitutional amendment \ndoes not require a balanced budget. Let us start now.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could----\n  Mr. SIMON. I do have some other points, but I will make them on some \n[[Page S2019]] other occasion and I return the floor to my colleague \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank both sides. I think it has been an \ninteresting colloquy between my two colleagues. I agree with the \ndistinguished Senator, why do we not do it now? This is why we are \ngoing to get it done because we are going to put a mechanism in the \nConstitution to help us to do it, and that is what this requires.\n  Let me also say this--President Reagan, of course, cannot defend \nhimself at this particular point--but I do not think anybody should \nfail to note that when John F. Kennedy was President of the United \nStates back in 1962, the military budget was 49 percent of the total \nFederal budget. The highest it ever got under Reagan, as I recall, was \n26 or 27 percent of the total Federal budget, about half of what John \nF. Kennedy was willing to spend and the Congress was willing to spend \nfor the military at that time. Forty-nine percent.\n  How is it that when Reagan helped to increase military spending that \nbrought down the Iron Curtain and ended the cold war with only 26 \npercent of the budget, that it was he who caused this grand spending \nboom when we used to spend 49 percent because the national security \ninterests of this country were the single most important interests of \nthe Federal Government?\n  I will tell you why. Because John F. Kennedy cut taxes 10 percent and \nthe economy boomed, because more people were making more money, paying \nmore taxes, more businesses were created, more jobs were created, more \npeople were working. John F. Kennedy cut taxes, spent 49 percent of the \nFederal budget on the military, and we had a very low deficit at that \ntime.\n  He was succeeded by Lyndon Johnson who decided he was going to take \ncare of everybody, and he came up with what was called the Great \nSociety programs, and from those programs we have a proliferation of \nFederal Government control over all of our lives and a proliferation of \nspending where now 70 percent of this Federal budget is entitlement \nspending. That means it goes up and up and up automatically and nobody \nstops them.\n  In defense of President Reagan, and I do not mean to get too much \ninto this because I think people who really understand economics and \nunderstand the history realize that he was not the one who created \nthese huge deficits. Certainly tax cuts sometimes wrongfully given can, \nover the short term cause us to have less money in the budget. But over \nthe long term, they generally produce more jobs, more businesses, more \npeople employed, more people working, more people paying into the \nsystem, more revenues to the Federal Government.\n  By the way, the Reagan tax cuts created 9 years of economic \nexpansion, the longest peacetime economic expansion in the history of \nthe country, and it was the tax cut that did it. But what was not said \nis that in order to get his tax cut in 1982 and his tax cut of marginal \ntax rates in 1986, he had to agree to all kinds of entitlement \nexpenditures.\n  Today, entitlements are 70 percent of the budget. They were not that \nduring the time of President Kennedy; 50 percent of the budget was for \nthe military, and that is not an entitlement program. It is important, \nand the distinguished Senator from West Virginia made it clear that it \nwas important.\n  Constitutionally, it is Congress which must balance the budget. Even \nif President Reagan pushed some of the ideas enacted at that time and \npeople on the other side of the aisle love to blame him for it, it was \nCongress that passed these bills, according to the Constitution it is \nCongress that controls the purse strings. Congress cannot avoid that \nresponsibility. It was Congress that kept increasing spending. It was \nCongress that came up with more and more Federal programs.\n  Look, I used to be chairman of the Labor Committee. My ranking member \nwas none other than Senator Kennedy. When I became chairman of that \ncommittee, it was the most liberal committee in the Congress. There \nwere between 2,000 and 3,000 Federal programs created by that committee \nthat are currently in existence. Imagine that. And that is just one \ncommittee in Congress.\n  Constitutionally, it is our responsibility, not the President's, \nalthough I think he or she has a responsibility, too, to balance the \nbudget.\n  Reagan's tax cuts raised revenues during those years--raised $1 \ntrillion during the Reagan administration--$1 trillion in additional \ntax revenues. Under Reagan, 20 million new jobs were created. But \nCongress spent $1.4 trillion during that same time.\n  Had we stuck with the tax cuts and not had Congress dictate the \nincreased spending side of those tax bills, we would not have nearly \nthe problems we have today, although we still would have problems \nbecause of the entitlement programs.\n  This body is gutless when it comes to doing anything about \nentitlement programs, and with good cause, because unless you have \nPresidential leadership and congressional consensus to do something \nabout them, then in the next election, accusations will be made that \nthose who talked about doing something about entitlement programs are \ntrying to do away with them.\n  So it is going to take Presidential leadership and congressional \nleadership. And what we do with the balanced budget amendment is we get \na mechanism in place that encourages and creates the incentives for \nbalancing the budget rather than spending more and more and forces \nCongress make priority choices among competing programs in order to do \nso.\n  We have runaway spending in this country. I appreciate the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia saying why he thinks we should \nnot do it now. I believe he probably would act to balance the budget. \nBut he is one of a very few in the whole Congress who, if he would, \nwould actually do it without a balanced budget amendment. But if as he \nargues we can do it now, and we do not need the increased pressure of a \nconstitutional mandate, then why have we failed up until now? Then why \nhave we not balanced the budget for the last 26 years? Why have we not?\n  My friend from West Virginia has been one of the leaders in the \nSenate. He was both majority and minority leader. He had tremendous \npower during that time and still does without being the leader of the \nSenate. During those years, I know he worked hard to try to do it and \nhe could not with his own side of the floor. And I have to say it is \nnot just Democrats that have caused this; Republicans have, too, \nbecause the incentives are not there in the Constitution right now. \nJefferson saw the problem. But he never thought that we would reach the \nstate of morass that we are in today where nobody is willing to fight \nto resolve budgetary problems--or I should not say nobody. I should say \nwhere the majority are unwilling to do what is in the best interests of \nthis country.\n  We have a destructive welfare system. Everybody says we have to do \nsomething about it. Maybe we will this year. On the other hand, should \nwe not have to make priority choices there as well?\n  We have an antisavings Tax Code. It discourages savings. Maybe we \nwill come up with a Tax Code that will work, where people do not feel \nnearly as badly about paying their taxes as they do today with the \noppressive antisaving Tax Code that we have.\n  We have a Washington bureaucracy that is out of control, partly built \nbecause we have so many of these programs, not all of which are needed \nbut all of which are well intentioned, I will acknowledge that, but not \nall of which are needed and certainly not all of which rise to the same \ndignity as the important programs do. But they exist and get funding \nbecause we do not have to make priority choices among competing \nprograms.\n  People in this last election said the old ways are not working. The \nold ways are not working. This country is not working the way it \nshould. And for the first time in 40 years, they allowed the \nRepublicans the privilege of being in control of the House of \nRepresentatives, and they gave us the privilege once again to be at \nleast the majority in the Senate.\n  Now, we have no illusions about having complete control here. If you \nlook at ideology, a majority in the Senate are liberal, at least 51 of \nthe Senators \n     [[Page S2020]] are what you would call primarily liberal, who \n     do not want to cut anything; who do not want to do anything \n     to balance the budget, at least in the sense of spending \n     cuts. They will increase taxes. They will do that until the \n     American people scream, and they are screaming now.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. In the House of Representatives, it may be about the same. \nSo nobody has any illusions that just because the Republicans have \ntaken control, we can do whatever we want to do. We cannot. As a matter \nof fact, the American people did not mean this to be a mere Republican \nrevolution. They said, look, we are willing to try anything to get \nspending under control. And the polls do show that they believe \nRepublicans will do a better job of getting spending under control.\n  I believe one of the reasons why they believe that is a vast majority \nof Republicans in both bodies, almost every Republican in the House, \nalmost every Republican in the Senate, is willing to vote for this \nbalanced budget amendment and they knew it would be one of the first \nthings we would bring up.\n  But having said that, there were 72 courageous Democrats in the House \nof Representatives who voted for this amendment who are probably more \nmoderate to liberal than most Republicans who voted to pass the \nbalanced budget tax limitation constitutional amendment.\n  That amendment is what we are debating right now. For the first time \nin the history of the country, the House of Representatives has voted \nto put into the Constitution a fiscal mechanism that will help us to \nreach a balanced budget. And I have to say we need about 15 to 17 \ncourageous Democrats in the Senate or it will not pass by a two-thirds \nvote. All we need is, let us say, 17. That means 30 of them can vote \nagainst it, if they want to, and we can still pass it.\n  The fact is that is what we need. We just need a few Democrats to \nstand up here, like a few stood up in the House. They were the minority \nof the Democrats in the House. Let me tell you, those who do stand up \nare going to be heroes to me because there is tremendous pressure on \nthem to keep the old order, where we can keep spending and reelecting \nourselves, where we can tax and spend and reelect.\n  So whoever votes with us from the Democratic side of the aisle is \ngoing to be a hero to me, I have to tell you. And there are some real \nheroes, not the least of whom is the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. We do differ ideologically. He is liberal; I am conservative. \nBut he also acknowledges that something has to be done. I praise him \nfor it, and I admire him for it because it is not easy when so few on \nhis side are willing to do anything about this.\n  If this goes down to defeat, I do not think the American people are \never going to get over it because for the first time in history, the \nHouse of Representatives has voted for a balanced budget amendment. \nWhat a historic vote that was. Would it not be awful if the Senate, \nwhich was the first body to ever vote for a balanced budget tax \nlimitation amendment, the one we brought to the floor in 1982, when I \nwas chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, would it not be awful if \nthe Senate voted it down because we cannot find 17 Democrats to vote \nwith us? Would it not be awful? Would not people on the other side of \nthe floor feel terrible about that? I think they would at the polls, \nbecause I do not think the American people are going to forget it.\n  This is the most important constitutional issue, it seems to me, \naside from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that we passed a few \nyears ago overwhelmingly, on which this body is going to vote in the \nlifetime of the Members of this body. There are other extremely \nimportant constitutional issues that may rise to this dignity, but this \nis the most important of all of them because we are talking about the \nfuture of the country now. And when I see anybody coming to the floor \nand saying look at all these programs we are going to lose if we pass \nthe balanced budget amendment, I see an argument for more of the same--\nmore of the same of the last 26 years. If we will not do anything we \nwill face it in the future. Sometime we will have to get this under \ncontrol.\n  I know there is sincerity among some who make those arguments, but \nhistory does not back it up. History does not back it up and our \nexperience does not back it up. I have heard talk about our children's \nfuture. Let me tell you, nobody is more concerned about our children's \nfuture than those of us who have a lot of children and grandchildren. \nElaine and I have 6 children, and we will have our 15th grandchild here \nin another month or two. I have to tell you, we love each and every one \nof them, and I am worried that their future is going fast. We are not \ngiving them the future we had because we are spending their legacy \naway, and we are not willing to do anything about it.\n  And yet we keep getting these same old tired arguments against doing \nanything. My gosh, why do we not do it now? I have heard those same \narguments ever since I have been here.\n And I have no doubt of the sincerity of the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. But it is amazing to me, if you make the correlation of \nthose who say, ``Let us do it now, we do not need a balanced budget \namendment,'' why it is almost everybody who is going to vote against it \nwho says we do not need a constitutional directive to balance the \nbudget. And most of them have been here as long as I have, or at least \na pretty lengthy time in the Senate, and never once have we balanced \nthe budget.\n\n  I think the American people have our number. The American dream is \nfading for our children. We have to make the right decisions now to \nkeep it alive for them. We cannot keep accepting these same old \narguments for going on as we have in the past. How can it be said that \nevery State is going to have to increase its taxes because we pass a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment--as if the States do not each \nhave the ability to respond to a new fiscal environment in their own \nway. No, Congress is going to have to make priority choices among \ncompeting programs for the first time in the time I have served here, \n19 years. They are going to have to make the tough choices or they are \ngoing to have to stand up and vote not to. If they do, I think they are \ngoing to be thrown out of office in the next election, which is what \nshould happen to those of us who do not do what is right. That is the \nultimate and real enforcement, and it will work.\n  We have to cut the waste. We have to cut the fat, and there is \nplenty. Anybody who denies or doubts that we have waste and fat in this \nbudget just has not looked. They have not looked at the budget. They \nhave not looked at what the Federal Government has done.\n  Do not tell me we have to continue to pour everything through this \nbureaucracy when we get only 28 percent back out. Why do we not keep \nthat money at home and get 100 percent for the people, the poor, the \nsick and elderly, and those who have difficulties in our society? Why \nlaunder it through the Federal Government? We are not the all-seeing \neye, nor are we always right in our remedies. The Founding Fathers \nbelieved the Government closest to the people is better able to deal \nwith such problems. It is a true belief, because people lose touch \nwithin this beltway.\n  The same old order cannot continue. We have to do what is right for \nthis society. This balanced budget amendment will give us the \nincentives to do so. And I agree with the Senator from Illinois, we \ntake an oath to uphold that Constitution. I think most all of us take \nthat oath very seriously. If this becomes a part of the Constitution, \nand I believe it will, then I believe we will take it seriously and I \nbelieve we will make great inroads over the next 7 years to do what is \nright for this country.\n  It may be the only way to save this country from going into a total \ndepression sometime in the future when our money becomes worthless, and \nwhen Social Security becomes worthless, and when our children's \nprograms become worthless, and when all of these other programs we have \nbeen talking about become worthless as we continued to spend this \ncountry blind. If our Government or economy is destroyed by our current \nprofligacy, we will not have any--any--of the programs we have been \ntalking about, and which the opponents of the balanced budget amendment \nsay will be cut if we balance the budget.\n   [[Page S2021]] As you know, I say to my friend here today, I admire \nmy friend from West Virginia. I admire the way he feels. I admire the \nway he gives extraordinary time to the Senate and why he is willing to \nstand out here and take the guff of Senators. He is willing to stand \nout here and fight for what he believes in.\n  He is a quintessential Senator. I believe that. But he is wrong. He \nis wrong to think we can continue to go the way we are going and still \nsolve the problems of this country. As sincere as people are, we can be \nsincerely wrong.\n  Even Paul held the coats of the people who killed Stephen, the first \nChristian martyr, thinking he was right. He was sincerely wrong and he \nhad to admit it later when he was blinded on the way to Damascus.\n  And the voice said: ``Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?'' And he \njust stopped. And the minute Paul knew with whom he was talking he \nsaid, ``Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?'' And from that minute on \nhe admitted he was wrong and went to do the job.\n  We in Congress have to admit we have been wrong, spending this \ncountry into bankruptcy and this balanced budget amendment is one of \nthe first steps we should take to right that wrong.\n  The unfunded mandates legislation is one of the other steps to our \nredemption. We have to quit loading up the State and local governments \nwith ridiculous unfunded mandates that take away their rights of self-\ndetermination and so often actually do not even work. I think the \nunfunded mandates legislation we recently approved will work. Although \nI agree with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, it only \ntakes 51 percent, a majority vote to change it. But I think we are \ngoing to be loath to change it now that we have put it in place.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Tennessee is here. I know he \nwants to speak to this matter. There is a lot more I would like to say \nbut I will let it go at this. I just hope everybody in this body \nrecognizes what an important, significant, and historic vote this is \ngoing to be. I hope we vote down any and all attempts to change it \nbecause this is the amendment. This is our last, best chance. This is \nthe chance to put some fiscal discipline that works into the \nConstitution, that will help us to do the job that we have not done \nbefore because we have not had a constitutional mandate to do it. It is \na bipartisan, Democrat and Republican consensus amendment, the best we \ncan do. It is not perfect but it is the most perfect thing we can do \nand I hope everybody realizes it. Most important, I hope our folks out \nthere throughout this country realize that they have a role to play \nconstitutionally. That role is to write and call and get with your \nSenators and get them to vote for this. We all know who needs to vote \nfor it.\n  With that I yield the floor for now and will speak more later.\n house joint resolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, as my constituents know, I do not give \nspeeches on every issue addressed by the U.S. Senate. However, I felt \nthat on a matter as significant to the American people as an amendment \nto United States Constitution, I had to share my thoughts. In no way is \nmy speech delivered to stall these proceedings. I wish to address the \nSenate because I am genuinely distressed about several serious \ndeficiencies in the balanced budget amendment measure now before the \nU.S. Senate, not the least of which is the fact that the American \npublic, ourselves included, does not have a full and fair understanding \nof how this balanced budget amendment will truly impact our lives.\n  While the proponents tell us that they will balance the budget, while \ncutting taxes, increasing defense spending and protecting Social \nSecurity, we are also told that to meet all these goals, the Congress \nwill have to cut spending by $1.5 trillion before the year 2002. In \naddition, estimates by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that if \nSocial Security and defense spending are not cut, all other programs \nmust be cut across the board by 30 percent. I believe the people of \nAmerica should be told in advance where these cuts will occur.\n  The new leadership of the U.S. Senate is determined to pass this \nmeasure almost as expeditiously as the House of Representatives. With \nonly 2 days of consideration on the House floor on House Joint \nResolution 1, debate was, at best, limited. On a matter of this \nsignificance, the least we can do is not only fully acquaint ourselves \nwith the matter before us and its effects, but also provide the same \ninformation to the citizens of this Nation so they may know its impact \non their lives. This should not be part of a contest to see who can \npass a bill faster.\n  The proponents of this measure seem to wish to move with undue haste, \nwithout responsibility for the consequences of their actions, only to \nlet the American people and the States unknowingly deal with the \nunpleasant realities at a later date. Our constituents have a right to \nknow and understand the real impact of this balanced budget amendment.\n  The concept of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is \nnothing new to this body. In 1980, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrejected the proposed constitutional amendment by a vote of 9 to 8. In \n1982, the U.S. Senate actually passed a balanced budget amendment. That \nmeasure, Senate Joint Resolution 58, would have only allowed deficit \nspending or an increase in the Nation's debt ceiling upon a three-\nfifths vote of the Congress. Though passed by the Senate, Senate Joint \nResolution 58 died in the House of Representatives.\n  Many of us in the U.S. Senate consider the balanced budget amendment \nbefore us with deep concern because underlying the measure is an \nimplication or suggestion that we who are elected by our people are \nincapable of doing our work. I believe even a cursory study and \nanalysis of the past 2 years will clearly assure the citizens of our \nNation that we are capable of and are, in fact, doing our job.\n  Our work together with the Clinton administration has produced \nsignificant accomplishments over the last 2 years that no one can \ndispute. Over 5.6 million new jobs have been created. The unemployment \nrate has dropped from 7.3 percent in 1992 to 5.4 percent as of December \n1994, the lowest rate in over 4 years. Inflation has dropped to 2.7 \npercent, the lowest since 1986. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct passed by the Congress in 1993, the Federal deficit has been \nreduced by $87 billion between 1992 and 1994. This is the first time \nthe deficit has dropped 2 years in a row in over 20 years, and it is \nthe largest 2-year drop in history. The deficit is projected to fall \nanother $27 billion in 1995. Many of us, together with eminent \neconomists, are convinced that the path we have laid will further \ndecrease our deficit and improve our economy.\n  The United States Constitution is a document of permanency. If sets \nforth the basic principles, ideals and philosophy of this country and \nour society. It is not a document which should be tinkered with \nlightly. The Constitution of this great Nation was signed on September \n17, 1787. Delaware was the first State to ratify the document on \nOctober 7, 1787. Other States ratified the Constitution during the \ncourse of 1788, and the Constitution took effect on September 13, 1788. \nThere are currently 26 amendments to the Constitution. Since the 1st \nCongress in 1789, 10,736 Constitutional amendments have been proposed \nin the Congress. We have been rightfully very reluctant to pass \nConstitutional amendments.\n  Measures of this magnitude and import must be approached with great \ncare and consideration. It took the U.S. Congress somewhere on the \norder of 30 years to pass Medicare legislation. Medicare was first \ndebated in Congress in the 1930's with the social reforms of the New \nDeal. Medicare was not considered seriously again until the mid 1950's. \nIn 1960 Senator John F. Kennedy featured Medicare in his Presidential \ncampaign. However, Medicare was not enacted by the Congress until 1965. \nCongressional debate to end the Vietnam conflict began in the early \n1960's, but the Congress did not set a date certain for the end of the \nwar until 1973--the same year the War Powers Act was passed. The Family \nand Medical Leave Act was first introduced in the 99th Congress, vetoed \nby President Bush in both the 101st and 102d Congresses, and finally \nsigned into law by President Clinton in the opening days of the 103d \nCongress. The Supreme Court's decision in Brown versus Board of \nEducation of Topeka,\n ordering the racial \n[[Page S2022]] desegregation of our Nation's schools, was rendered on \nMay 31, 1955. However, not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did the \nCongress give the Attorney General the power to initiate civil actions \nto achieve desegregation. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was debated in \nthe Senate for 83 days.\n  Each of these measures was fully debated in both Houses of the \nCongress, and they were not even amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. I submit that a proposed constitutional amendment \ndemands a significantly higher level of scrutiny and debate wherein the \nAmerican people are fully informed of all of the amendment's \nimplications.\n  Every household in our Nation tries its best to balance its \nindividual family budget. However, in contemporary times this task is \nmuch more difficult than that faced by my grandparents. Now we have an \ninnovation known as the credit care that allows us to buy now and pay \nlater. As of November 1994, our citizens' revolving loan debt was \n$334.4 billion.\n  Living with debt is part of the economy of every country. Such debt \nis generally categorized into the types of accounts: operating expenses \nand capital improvements. It is good fiscal policy for a country to \nwork to keep operating expenses current. Similarly, the American family \nshould try to stay current in its everyday expenses. On the other hand, \nvery few Americans would be included to purchase a home with cash. That \nhome is acquired with credit in the form of a mortgage loan. This is \nnot so different from a government obtaining financing to fund capital \nimprovements. Presently, the total amount of our Nation's home mortgage \ndebt is $3.3 trillion. The supporters of this balanced budget amendment \nproposes to consider both operating expenses and capital improvements \nas one account, lumped together as debt. Economists will tell you that \nthis is not sound fiscal policy.\n  It is a relatively simple matter when balancing the family budget to \nbe fully cognizant of what must be cut and what operational costs are \nessential and cannot be curtailed. Unlike this household budget \nbalancing, the balanced budget amendment currently before the Senate \nintentionally and almost deliberately does not inform the American \npublic of what is going to be done to achieve the goal of a balanced \nFederal budget. The American people have a right to know this \ninformation.\n  Merely telling our constituents that we will increase defense \nspending, lower taxes, not touch Social Security, and hope that the \neconomy is going to improve is simply not sufficient. In July of 1981, \nsimilar words were uttered by President Ronald Reagan, and the Congress \nadopted ``Reaganomics,'' also known as supply side economics. When this \nprocess began in July 1981, the Federal budget deficit amounted to $79 \nbillion. When Ronald Reagan left office in 1988, the Federal deficit \nhad increased to $155 billion. Under the Republican administration's \nbudget policies, the upward trend continued through George Bush's \nadministration with the deficit topping out at $290 billion in 1992. \nProponents of this balanced budget amendment refuse to acknowledge that \nthe problems we address today began in July 1981.\n  I believe that the American people have the right to know exactly how \nthe Congress plans to put this balanced budget amendment to work. For \nexample, health care costs currently amount to 14 percent of Federal \nspending. Every study indicates that by 1988, this figure will increase \ndramatically such that 24 percent of Federal spending will be on health \ncare. One-half of that amount will be spent on Medicare alone. I would \nthink that the people of this country would like to know now whether \nthe balanced budget amendment will result in cuts to Medicare. Will \nMedicaid funding face reductions, and will research programs for the \ntreatment of breast cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and mental illness be \nreduced or eliminated? How will highway funds, Aid to Families With \nDependent Children, job training and veterans' benefits, and other \ngrants to States be impacted? Further, if States felt that these \nprograms were essential, I would think that our constituents would want \nto know just how much it would cost them as State taxpayers to continue \nthese programs.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the provision in House Joint \nResolution 1 which provides that the balanced budget requirement may be \nwaived if there is a declaration of war, or the United States is \nengaged in military conflict which threatens the national security of \nour country.\n  Would the United States' humanitarian mission in Somalia come within \nthis provision? What about United States peacekeeping efforts in \nBosnia? What about Haiti, Desert Storm, Vietnam and Korea? Some would \nargue that the Korean war was a police action, not the result of a \ndeclaration of war, therefore, not a war.\n  Further, how will we deal with the financial impact of natural \ndisasters over which we have no control--Hurricanes Andrew, Iniki and \nOmar, floods in the Midwest and California, and the earthquakes in \nCalifornia, to name a few.\n  The American people deserve to know the answers to these questions.\n  At the request of the National Governors' Association, the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury recently prepared a report on the likely \neffects on the States of a balanced budget amendment alone, as well as \naccompanied by the tax reductions proposed by the Republican Contract \nWith America. As proposed by the proponents of the balanced budget \namendment, the Treasury Department assumed that there would be no cuts \nto defense or\n Social Security, not tax increases, and that deficit reduction would \nbe achieved by the year 2002.\n\n  According to the Treasury Department, even if phased in gradually \nbetween now and the year 2002, deficit reduction cuts will be severe in \n2002. A balanced budget amendment will require reducing Federal grants \nto States, for programs such as Medicaid and highway funds, by a total \nof $71.3 billion in fiscal year 2002. Other Federal programs that \ndirectly benefit State residents, such as Medicare and housing \nassistance, would have to be cut by $176.5 billion in fiscal year 2002. \nHowever, these figures grow significantly if Republican-sponsored tax \nreductions in the Contract With America are taken into account. Cuts \ntotalling $97.8 billion in grants and $242 billion in other programs \nthat directly benefit State residents would be required in fiscal year \n2002 under a balanced budget amendment combined with the proposed \nContract With America tax reductions.\n  For the benefit of my constituents, I would like to highlight the \nimpact on the State of Hawaii based upon an analysis prepared by the \nTreasury Department. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nTreasury Department's analysis on the impact of the balanced budget \namendment and Contract with America tax reductions be included in the \nCongressionall Record following my remarks.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INOUYE. As the Treasury Department's analysis indicates, a \nbalanced budget amendment alone would reduce annual Federal grants to \nHawaii for Medicaid, highways, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, \neducation, job training, environmental protection, housing and other \nprograms by $328 million. Combined with the proposed tax cuts in the \nContract With America, this figure rises to $450 million in lost \nFederal grants annually. Hawaii would also lose another $1 billion \nannually in other Federal spending for Medicare, housing assistance, \nstudent loans, veterans' benefits and other programs. The Treasury \nDepartment's analysis further shows that Hawaii State taxes would have \nto be increased by over 9 percent to make up for lost Federal funding \nand to continue these programs.\n  The American public and our constituents have a right to know about \nthe impact of the proposal before us on their lives. Without a \nprovision setting forth the nature and amounts of budget cuts, the \nbalanced budget amendment measure before us would be grossly unfair to \nour States and our taxpayers.\n  Why are the Republican who are the authors of this balanced budget \namendment afraid to let the people know? Don't they trust their fellow \nAmericans? The logical and appropriate way to make decisions is to know \nall the facts. Our constituents--the American taxpayers--and our State \nlegislatures should be entrusted with and have the benefit of the facts \nbefore this balanced \nbudget amendment is considered for ratification.\n  The Senate is unique because it is where ideas and concerns can be \nfreely and fully expressed. I hope that every Member of this body will \nexpress themselves freely. I hope that all of us will participate \nopenly in this debate.\n  As this joint resolution stands today, I will most certainly oppose \nit and do everything in my power to defeat it.\n                               Exhibit 1.\n\nThe Impact of a Balanced Budget Amendment and the Contract With America \n                       on the State of Hawaii\\1\\\n\n       I.

January 12, 1995.                                                                                              \n\nMr. THOMPSON. Madam President, first of all I compliment the Senator \nfrom Utah for his leadership in this regard. It has been a great \npleasure for me over these last few days, and just recently as I \npresided, to listen to him articulate the problem, articulate the \nhistory leading to the problem, articulate the solution that is needed. \nI think, as usual, he hits the nail on the head.\n  It was a great honor for me to sit here and listen to the debate that \nhas gone on this afternoon with the Senator from Illinois, proving that \nthis is indeed a bipartisan effort. We are all concerned about it. The \nSenator from West Virginia, who is indeed an institution within an \ninstitution, who swore me in less than 60 days ago, and whom I respect \ngreatly and whose views I respect greatly--this is what to me the U.S. \nSenate ought to be about. Senators on the floor of the Senate, debating \nthe great issues that affect this country. I wish more of our \ncolleagues could have been here. I hope they are watching in their \noffices on television, to listen to these great Senators debate this \ngreat issue.\n  Because I agree with the Senator from Utah that this is, if not \n``the,'' certainly one of the most important votes and decisions that \nwill be made by the Senators in this body during their careers. I think \nwe have to focus, from time to time during this debate, on exactly what \nwe are about. I think it is nothing less than deciding whether or not \nwe are going to take the necessary steps to protect the next generation \nfrom lower pay, from a lower standard of living, and ultimate \nbankruptcy of this country, or whether or not we are going to bow to \nthose who keep demanding we do not have to cut back, insisting we do \nnot, on current consumption, and are willing to let the next generation \nmake the tough choices instead of ourselves.\n  As I listened to the debate and listened to the comments of those who \noppose this amendment, I hear that there are questions concerning what \nis the role of the Court? What is the role of the President going to \nbe? Who is going to be cut? We debate whether or not it was this \nPresident's fault or that President's fault. We debate whether or not \nit is the institution of the Presidency or the institution of the \nCongress--whose fault is it? Where does the blame lie? How are we going \nto resolve the difference between those who advocate lower taxes and \nthose who advocate lower spending? How is all that going to be worked \nout?\n  Madam President, I think that is the debate that has been going on in \nthis body, I suppose, for 200 years. That is the old debate. \nUnfortunately we still keep getting the old result, and that is a $5 \ntrillion debt that we are approaching in this country, spending \nourselves into oblivion and bankrupting the next generation.\n  Everybody is for a balanced budget. I have not heard anyone speak yet \nwho was not for the concept of a balanced budget. I have not heard \nanyone speak yet who has not fought the good fight over the years to \nbalance the budget and to show fiscal restraint and to show fiscal \nresponsibility. I am not sure where the opposition really is. Everybody \nI have heard is for a balanced budget and has fought for it all these \nyears. There must be some people lurking around here that we have not \nheard from yet because certainly we have not made any progress on it in \nthe last two decades.\n  That is the debate of the past. Whose fault is it, why are we here, \nare we going to raise taxes, are we going to cut spending, what \ncombination of all of that--that is what we have been debating in the \npast and that is what we will have to debate in the future. But times \nare different.\n  Madam President, I listened to the Senator from West Virginia talk \nabout his career of 48 years in politics. It is a distinguished career \nin politics. I can never hope to achieve what he has learned in the \ntime that he has been in government, both in the State of West Virginia \nand in the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate. I have much of a contrast \nwith that.\n   [[Page S2025]] I have been in politics for about a little less than \n60 days, so I have great disadvantage in terms of his background and \nhis knowledge. But I also come with one advantage, because I feel just \nhaving spent so much time with the people of my State that I can relate \nto a certain extent what is on their mind and what they feel about \ncertain things.\n  I suspect it is not limited to the State of Tennessee. I think \nnothing less than a revolution is going on in this country and it is \ntime this body picked up on it.\n  We have 6-year terms here. We are not supposed to bend with every \nwind that blows, and that is good. But I think those who have not been \nout there among the people, talked to them, listened to them, and had \nto be judged by them recently are not fully aware that just within the \nlast few years people's thinking has changed in this country. I think \npeople today in the United States of America have decided that our \ngeneration is not going to be the generation that sees the United \nStates of America go from the greatest country in the world to a \nsecond-rate power. I think that the people of this country have decided \njust recently that they are not going to stand for the proposition that \nours is the last generation that can expect to do as well or better \nthan their parents' generation, which is what a lot of people are \nsaying now.\n  I believe people feel a cynicism toward their Government, an \nalienation from their Government, a dissatisfaction with the U.S. \nCongress. That has never been before in this country. Perhaps some of \nit is unjustified. I submit to you that much of it is very much \njustified.\n  As we debate these issues, and as we try to decide whose fault it \nwas, and this bill that was passed, who voted for it, how many people \non this side of the aisle and all of that, as we debate that, as we see \nthe debt increase, as we see the deficit increase, as we are taxing \nthose unborn out there who do not have votes, as we see all of that, we \nsee a public opinion poll occasionally that shows that people in this \ncountry have a lower regard for the U.S. Congress than almost any \ninstitution in America. Seventy percent of the people in a recent poll \nindicated that they believe the U.S. Congress is more interested in \nperpetuating itself and the individual Members in office than it is in \ndoing the right thing. People are seeing that and they are demanding a \nchange. They are demanding that we turn away from this old debate, who \nshot John, whose fault it is, how we are going to work out the details, \nand make one fundamental commitment to ourselves and to the future \ngenerations. And that is that we are going to change the way we do \nbusiness in this country, and we are not going to hand over a second-\nrate power to this next generation, which is surely what we are doing \nas sure as I am standing here today.\n  Why do they feel that way? Why do they feel that way? Are people \nwhipping them into a frenzy? Are some clever politicians convincing \nthem of things that are not really true? Are they overly impressed with \nattack ads on TV? What is the reason for that?\n  I think it is more fundamental for that. I think the people out in \nthe country and having to work for a living are the leading indicators. \nI think they are picking up on something, and they have something they \nunderstand much more so than a lot of people around here understand. \nThey see and understand that we have gone from a country with one of \nthe highest savings rate in the industrialized world to actually the \nlowest savings rate. We must have savings for investment.\n  They see that we now have one of the lowest investment rates of any \nof the industrialized countries. They understand that you have to have \ninvestment to have growth. But with one of the lowest investment rates, \nour growth rate is slowing down. People talk about recent years, recent \nmonths. We are so short-term oriented in this country. We cannot see \nthe forest for the trees.\n  The fact of the matter is we have had a good growth rate recently. \nBut when you compare it with other points in our history when we have \ncome out of recessions, we are growing at a much slower rate coming out \nof a recession than ever before. The indicators are all over the place. \nThey see the astronomical amount of money that we are having to borrow \nfrom foreign investors and our dependency on foreign investors. They \npick up the paper and see what is going on with our neighbors south of \nthe border and the trouble that they got into when the foreign \ninvestors decided that all of a sudden maybe it was not such a good \ndeal after all.\n  Many economists predict a credit crunch in this world in the not-too-\ndistant future. In 1993, we sent $41 billion in interest payments \noverseas. People talk about foreign aid. That is the largest foreign \naid program we have in this country. That is larger than all the \nforeign aid programs put together plus the operation of our embassies; \n$41 billion we have sent out in interest payments because of the size \nof our debt.\n  The reason for that? The debt keeps climbing, $4.8 trillion. The \ndeficit is hovering around before long $300 billion, some say $400 \nbillion before long. Although we have made a little progress in the \nlast few years, one could argue, and everyone acknowledges, that in \n1998 and thereafter it is going to go off the charts. Everybody knows \nthat. We have seen charts in this body that show us going along. And \nalong about that time, it is almost straight up.\n  But we act like we have all this time and that the problem is not on \nus. But yet, instead of facing up to it, instead of realizing that, \nyes, we will have to put a straitjacket on ourselves because we have \nnot been behaving the way we have to, we get scare tactics, we get \ncharts about who is going to be hurt, and widows and children are going \nto be left in the street, and Social Security is going to be in danger, \nand all of these other things.\n  We are urged to look to the short term. ``Don't worry about down the \nroad. Let that situation take care of itself,'' while all the time we \nturn from the world's biggest creditor to the world's biggest debtor. \nWe turn from a country that sometimes borrowed overseas for investment \npurposes to a country that now is borrowing larger and larger sums for \npurposes of consumption. All the time, while we are going from a \ncountry that has always had rates of investment and productivity that \nled the world to one that is among the lowest in the world now; from a \ncountry that used to invest in its children to a country that now is \nliving off of its children and grandchildren and children yet to be \nborn.\n  So the American people see that. The American dream is darkening for \nmany people. You hear young people. You ask them whether or not they \nexpect to do as well or better than their parents. For the first time \nin the history of this country their answer is no. They understand that \nfamily income has been stagnant for 20 years in this country. What a \nlot of people do not understand is that for younger households income \nhas actually fallen since 1973. For people who are starting families, \nworking hard for a living, they understand that the middle class is \nactually shrinking.\n  We are falling into a second-rate power before our very eyes. They \nunderstand that. They see all of that. They also see what will happen \nif we do not make some incremental adjustments now. That is what it is \nall about. Nobody is talking about slashing programs and making massive \ncuts. For the most part, the conversation you hear is about economists \nhaving to make some incremental differences, having to do with slowing \ndown the rate of increase, those sorts of things.\n  Yet the U.S. Congress, as of yet, has not even been willing to do \nthat. We hear about all the dire consequences to all these programs, \nand individuals will have to cut back, and States will have to cut \nback. There will be some things that actually we might have to give up.\n And we will have to give up the political power that goes along with \nit, with the ability to dole out these things and buy the votes that we \nare used to buying in this country with the pork that we are used to \ndoling out. Those times have to change.\n\n  Those times have to change. The deficit in this country, and the \ninterest we are paying on the deficit, as the Senator from Utah pointed \nout, is the second highest expenditure in this Nation. This year it may \npass defense; it may become the greatest expenditure \n[[Page S2026]] we have in the entire budget. It is sapping our savings \nwhich, in turn, is lowering our investment which, in turn, is affecting \nour growth. If we are going to continue down that road, growth is going \nto slow, we will go into recession, the economy will become more \nstagnant, foreigners will own more and more of our productive \ncapacities--we pay them more and more--there will be lower paying jobs, \na lower standard of living, and fewer younger people supporting a \ngrowing elderly population.\n  When we talk about these dire consequences and about the path that \nthis Nation is on, we are experiencing the good news today, because the \ndemographics are working in our favor. We have a very large working \npopulation--the baby boomers. We have more two-income earner families \nthan ever before. But in about 2010, those demographics are going to \nchange. As the baby boomers start to retire, we are going to have fewer \nand fewer people supporting more and more people in this country. That \nis right around the corner.\n  If we do not start making some incremental adjustments now, we are \ngoing to have a situation in this country where these young working \npeople are going to be paying 70 percent of their income in taxes. They \nare going to be driven right through the floor in terms of their living \nconditions and in terms of their wages, and taxes are going to go \nthrough the roof. If you read anything any person who has written \nrecently on the subject--any person who is now out of Government--and \nwe hear talk about the Concord coalition, a bipartisan group, and about \nMr. Peterson, a former Secretary of the Treasury, who wrote a recent \nbook about it. These are not debatable issues, I do not think. It is \nclear that that is going to be the situation. What is that young \nworking group of people on whom we, hopefully, all will be depending--\nand if we are alive, we will be--going to do?\n  I predict that they are not going to sit still for that. They are not \ngoing to sit still for 70 percent in taxes. They are not going to sit \nidly by while they see all these dire things happening. The chances \nare, I think, if we do nothing now and we let that happen, these very \nprograms that the opponents of the balanced budget amendment want to \nprotect so greatly are going to be slashed, thrown on the floor, \nstomped, decimated, and we will go further than anyone would ever dream \nof going today in terms of cutting and doing away with the programs \nthat all of us claim to want to protect today.\n  Some people talk in terms of generational warfare. It will be the \nyoung folks against the old folks. Is that what we are headed toward? \nAre we not better than that, when we have the solution before us? Or at \nleast an opportunity to put ourselves into a position to do something \nabout it, because obviously we cannot under current circumstances.\n  The Entitlement Commission people ask why do we not do something \nabout it. The Entitlement Commission came out with a report last \nAugust, a bipartisan group, including Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, \nSenator Danforth from Missouri, two very thoughtful Members of this \nbody, and they issued some rather startling reports. The one I remember \nis that in the year 2012, I guess, or thereabouts, we are going to run \nout of money, that a handful of programs and the interest on the debt \nin this country are going to take all of our tax revenues. We will not \nhave money for national defense, infrastructure, schools, education, or \nanything else in this country. That is in 2012.\n  What has been the result? We hear that all we need is the will to do \nthe right thing and everyone purports to have it. Everyone says that \nthey are in support of a balanced budget, the implication being if we \nwill just put this amendment aside that they are fighting so hard, this \ntime maybe we can do something about it.\n  I was doing a little reading on the history of that. We have not been \nlacking in lip service. The Balanced Budget Act of 1921 required the \nPresident to recommend a balanced budget. The Revenue Act of 1964 said \nit was the sense of the Congress that the budget had to be balanced, \nand soon. The Revenue Act of 1978 stated that it was a matter of \nnational policy to balance the budget of this Nation. The Humphrey-\nHawkins Act of 1978 prioritized a Federal balanced budget. The Byrd \namendment--Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia--in 1978, was an amendment \npassed that basically said that in fiscal year 1981 outlays cannot \nexceed receipts. That was the law passed. What happened in 1981? We had \na $79 billion deficit. My research has not taken me back far enough to \nfind out what happened to that. Apparently, it was ignored and I think \nafter a while it got embarrassing, so they took it off the books. But \nwe had a law that basically said the budget had to be balanced, for a \nlittle while anyway.\n  The Budget Act of 1974 is the foundation for the budgeting process \ntoday, and it requires annual budget resolutions. People said, ``We \nhave it right this time. People will be afraid to vote for these large \ndeficits when they have to come up with budget resolutions.'' The next \nyear the deficit ballooned and, with few exceptions, it has ballooned \never since.\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, in 1985, mandated annual reductions in \ndeficits, and it actually had an enforcement mechanism--sequestration. \nThat lasted a little while until the shoe got a little tight and \neverybody apparently decided to take the shoe off. They revised the \ntargets. They revised them again, and ultimately they became \nirrelevant.\n  The 1990 budget deal, which I heard talked about a minute ago, is \nused as an example of our ability to come to terms with this deficit \nproblem. From what I read at the time, this great bipartisan \ncompromise, of course, involved increasing taxes, as it usually does, \nand the deficit increased. That was the budget deal that was supposed \nto get the job done. It had no affect as far as decreasing the deficit \nwas concerned. Just the opposite. In 1993 came the latest budget deal. \nThey are praising the President for that deal, which as I read is the \nlargest tax increase in the history of the country, with major cuts in \nthe military and promised cuts for the future, which we may or may not \nget.\n  Putting that aside for a minute, because even before the \nadministration's own estimates, with all the wonderful things we are \ndoing, it adds over $1 trillion to the debt over the next 5 years. So \nthis is being touted as a solution. This is being touted as an example \nof how good we can do. It adds $1 trillion to the debt over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Why is it so difficult? Well, it is because we factionalize in this \ncountry so much. Everybody has their own special interest and everybody \nhas people they have hired to come up here and descend on us. That is, \nof course, a large part of what all this detailing is about and, of \ncourse, everybody wants some kind of detail. There are more proposals \nto balance the budget floating around this town than you can count. \nCBO, I noticed, had a proposal they wrote to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee with ideas on how to balance the budget. The \nConcord coalition has one. Mr. Peterson came out with one in his book.\n  What, really, I think, is desired by some folks is the ability to put \nsomething on the table so special interests can come in and put the \npressure on to defeat the balanced budget amendment. So you have all \nthe individuals who have been used to the gravy train, the pork barrel, \nand they do not want to give it up. The folks that are affected most \nare the kids at home, the little grandkids, and generations yet to be \nborn, and in that kind of a battle, who do you think is going to win? \nWho has won in the past? It is going to be tough enough with a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Other nations have not really done much better than we have. Is there \nany hope to think that we can easily turn this thing around without \ndrastic remedies, if you want to call it that? I think it is very \nmodest. I wish it was tough.\n  I agree with some of the opponents to this amendment that, you know, \nthere will be efforts to try to get around it and in it, through it, \nunder it, and all of that. But I think it really has a chance; it \nreally has an opportunity. And it might be our last clear chance to do \nsomething really meaningful for the next generation. But how tough it \nis, how tough it is to turn around.\n  The Senator from Utah is leading this fight for us to turn this \ngigantic force that is working against us, this \n[[Page S2027]] gigantic force that is working for more and more \nspending; putting off until tomorrow; let us consume today; let us not \nworry about it; get the votes today; hand out the pork today.\n  Read Kennedy's ``Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' and Kevin \nPhillips recently came out with a book, ``The Arrogant Capital.'' I do \nnot know how in the world he came up with a name like that but that was \nthe title of his book, ``The Arrogant Capital.''\n  They talk in these books about the history of the Nation and how the \nSpanish declined in the 16th century and how the Dutch went to great \nheights and declined in the 17th century and how the British went to \ngreat heights and declined in the 19th century. And they really sort of \nasked the question: Do we feel as though we in this country are immune \nto the laws of nature and the laws of gravity? They were unable to roll \nback the strong trends that were in their countries, pushing them to \ngreater deficits, greater debts, higher taxes, slowing economy, a \ndeclining manufacturing industry, all the things that we are beginning \nto see in this country. So the battle is not an easy one.\n  You know, as we talk among ourselves, and we hear it regardless of \nwhat the people want, people talk about majority rule and all. Look at \nany poll, answer your phone calls, read your mail. I do not think there \nis any question but the American people have decided: Enough is enough. \nWe have to do things differently. We voted for a change. We have been \nwanting change for some time. Maybe we thought we were trying to get it \n2 years ago in the last Presidential election.\n  A fellow from Texas that hardly anybody knew went from nowhere and \njust within a few short months he got into a position where, some \npeople said, under a slightly different set of circumstances, he could \nhave gotten the nomination and been President, from nowhere, because he \nwas talking about changing the way we do business in this country.\n  All that is going on out there. And yet we need a two-thirds vote in \nthis body.\n  And I understand there are even some people who voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment last time who are now saying that they may \nvote against it this time. Last time, they were pretty sure it would \nnot pass and maybe this time they are afraid that it might pass. So it \nis going to be difficult.\n  I, again, commend the Senator from Utah, who is leading this fight \nand articulates this case so well. I think it is the most important \nvote we will have in a long, long time as far as this U.S. Senate is \nconcerned.\n  I only urge those within the sound of my voice to remain focused on \nwhat this is about. The patient--and maybe we are the patient--has been \nacting a little crazy over the last several years, and we have not been \ndoing the right thing, and the thing we know that we are going to have \nto do to get better. It sure would be good to cure the patient. But we \nhave been taking treatment and medicine for a long time, and it is not \ndoing us any good.\n  Maybe the time has come that we are going to have to impose a \nstraitjacket on ourselves. It is not perfect. But until we show some \ninclination, absent getting hit over the head with a 2 by 4, to do the \nobvious and right thing that we ultimately have to do to protect this \nnext generation, this is the way to go. We will worry about the details \nin terms of the implementing legislation, and we can have the debates \nthat we have already started here today.\n  But I think it is vitally important that we get about the business of \npassing this amendment and make a statement that we are not so selfish \nthat we are going to sit idly by and debate these issues forever, using \nthe moneys and the assets and the resources in the very country that is \nthe birthright of the next generation; but we are going to take a step \nforward, say no to the vested interests, say no to those who want to \ncontinue to consume not just what they are consuming now but more and \nmore and more, and say to everyone that we are all going to have to \nmake some incremental change.\n  Is there any more basic commitment that a human being has than the \none that he has to his children? If we had our child standing next to \nus here, there is nothing that we would not do. And yet, we are so \ndispersed in our attention and we are so diverted in so many different \nways, we have not been able to focus on what we are doing. This debate \nwill focus on what we are doing.\n  I commend the Senator from Utah and other colleagues in this great \nfight.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from New York be given the floor after I make \nvery brief remarks about the great remarks of my colleague from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to make two announcements and \nthen will recognize the Senator from New York, following the remarks of \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee for his very, very welcome and important remarks \non this issue.\n  I think this new group of Senators is as good a group as I have ever \nseen come into the U.S. Senate. We feel particularly privileged to have \nfour of them on the Judiciary Committee, not the least of whom is the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  In his own down-home Tennessean sort of way, he has laid out why we \nhave to pass this balanced budget amendment. I personally just want to \nexpress my appreciation and my high regard for him. I believe that the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee is going to make a whale of a \ndifference here in the Senate, and already is making a whale of a \ndifference on the Judiciary Committee, as I am sure he is on other \ncommittees. So I personally thank him for his kind remarks.\n  If people have been noticing, these new Senators have been coming \nhere and speaking on this amendment because they got the message. They \nknow that is one of the reasons they are here. I personally appreciate \ntheir efforts in this matter.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S2006-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         APPOINTMENTS BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of our \nnew colleague, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. I think he has \nspelled out very cogently why the American people voted for change. \nThey are tired of Big Brother Government saying, \n[[Page S2028]] ``We know what's best for you. We're going to give it to \nyou, whether you like it or not. We have programs that are good for \nyou, whether you can pay for them or not.''\n  The people want a balanced budget amendment, and they are right. This \nis no time to start playing politics as usual. This is an important \nissue.\n  I will tell you how important it is. If we continue to do business as \nwe have in the past, we will become just like our neighbor to the \nsouth.\n  Who will we go to for the bailouts? Who? What are we talking about? \nWe are not talking about cutting spending. Oh, no, we are talking about \ndecreasing the rate of spending. We are still going to spend \ntrillions--something like $13 trillion in the next 7 years. We are \ntalking about maybe cutting that down to $12 trillion. If we can do \nthat, we have a balanced budget.\n  What do we have here? The opposition, the Democrats, are simply and \npurely stalling. They are looking for a way for escape clauses. Let me \ntell Members, there are many of our colleagues who voted on the other \nside for the balanced budget amendment. What are they doing now? Why, \nthey are scampering for the hills. The Senator from Tennessee was \nabsolutely right. They voted for the balanced budget amendment to \nprotect their political hide in years gone by so they could go back and \nsay to their people, ``Oh, I voted for the balanced budget amendment.'' \nThey knew we could not get two-thirds.\n  And here we are. Here we are, poised to do something that the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly want. And what are they doing? Ducking, \nshimmying, telling us, ``How can you get there? Spell it out over the \nnext 7 years.'' They cannot tell us what they are going to do next \nmonth, let alone 7 years down the line.\n  What are the interest rates going to be 7 years down the line? Keep \nspending this way, it will be 20-plus percent, we will not have any \neconomy. The Senator is right. Know what Social Security will be worth? \nKnow what inflation will take place? Incredible. What are we going to \ndo then? It is about time we did the business of the people. Stop the \npussyfooting.\n  The American people know what they want. Those Members who were sent \nhere to do the business of the people should keep our feet to the fire. \nI know it will be tough. But doing the right thing sometimes does \nrequire some courage. The fact is that we should stick with the \nprinciples that the American people are demanding. They want Members to \nbalance the budget. They want Members to cut spending, cut taxes. It is \nright for America. We can do it.\n  I have to tell Senators I am not going to look the other way. I will \nbe very candid. If our colleagues begin this business of attempting to \nfind these escape clauses, we will call it to the attention of the \nAmerican people. We have an obligation to keep their feet to the fire, \nto do the business of the people.\n  Mr. President, in that connection, I have to say I think that the \nPresident of the United States looked for a way to get around the voice \nof the people. The voice of the people is the Congress. And in \nproposing his new agreement to help our neighbors to the south, he \ncircumvented the Congress. Now, I hope that that plan works. But I have \ngrave, grave doubts. I have grave doubts that we will have the ability \nto see to it that those loan guarantees are not just withered away, and \nthat we do not see the American taxpayers picking up $20 billion-plus.\n  I can name places I see loan guarantees and we know they will get \npaid back, and they do help. Maybe Orange County. I remember loan \nguarantees for New York. Much more difficult terms then those we have \nmade available to our brethren in the south--Mexico. Guarantees. That \nmeans we are paid out over a period of 4 years. Not within an 18-month \nperiod of time.\n  I did not know if the IMF and the World Bank will do the kind of job \nor whether they are in a position to see that Mexico makes the kind of \nreforms necessary, or whether they will just continue to print paper.\n  I wonder, is it the business of this country to see to it that those \nwho invested were getting 20- and 30-percent returns in Mexico, that we \nwill hold them harmless and they will get every single dollar and get \nback 20 percent? Is that the business of this country? If you make an \ninvestment and there is a high risk and you get 20-percent return, \npeople say you are a genius. But if it goes sour and you go down, do we \nreally expect Uncle Sam, the American taxpayers, Uncle Sam to bail you \nout and say, ``We hold you harmless.''\n  What kind of economic stabilization program is that? I wonder why it \nis that we did not say to the Mexican Government, as those noteholders \ncome due, ``We will help you in renegotiating the payments and the \nterms.'' Why should people get dollar for dollar, plus 20 percent? I \ndid not know you did that in restructuring. Certainly that is not what \nthe capital system is about.\n  I have to tell Members, I think that all the doom and gloom \npredictions and the fact that there would be huge immigration, masses \ncoming across the border, well, that is our Government's responsibility \nto see that we stop that kind of thing.\n  You do not threaten the American people every time there is a crisis \nand say, ``My gosh, unless we do this, put up $20 billion, $40 billion \nwe will have a massive migration to this country.'' Is that what we are \ncoming to? Just raise that specter of fear? And we all succumb?\n  I hope this plan works. I have grave doubts. I predict if we look at \nthe history, we saw economic devaluations every time there was an \nelection. I would suggest this administration knew of this crisis, and \nknew of it quite some time ago. Maybe back last November. And they hid \nit from the American people. They did not step in and insist that \nconditions be met at that point in time. Now they come and say the sky \nis falling in. Well, that is OK but I do not think it is right that the \nAmerican taxpayer has to step in.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you as the Senator charged with the \nresponsibility of seeing to it that we are not wasteful, as it relates \nto taxpayer dollars, and being on the Banking Committee we will hold \nhearings and carefully monitor the execution of this agreement or the \nimplementation, to see to it that we do the best we can to see that \nthere are real economic reforms, and we are not taking hardworking \ntaxpayers' money and just shoveling it down there. Then in 3 or 4 years \nfrom now throw up our hands and say, ``Oh my gosh, we did the best we \ncould do. Maybe to protect our investment we have to invest another \n$20, $30, or $40 million.''\n  Look at the record and that is what it demonstrates. In 1982 the \nbanks were holding most of the paper and took a pretty terrific loss. \nIt seems to me that 12 years later, the only difference is, the \nAmerican people may be poised that they can get a bigger hit. That is \nunfortunate. Thank you.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. I appreciate his remarks, especially those on the balanced budget \namendment. He certainly makes a difference in this body, and will make \na difference once we pass that amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me assure the American people that the balanced \nbudget amendment is neither snake oil nor a tonic. It is a necessary \nfirst step to a healthier economic lifestyle. It is as sensible as \nanyone who has been a binge deciding, finally, to go on a diet. This \namendment puts a bloated, overgrown Federal Government, and out of \ncontrol Federal bureaucrats, on a diet. Now, as our colleague from \nIdaho, who is certainly helping me on this amendment and is one of the \nleaders on this amendment, Senator Craig has said, if someone decides \nto go on diet to lose 100 pounds over 2 years, we do not ask that \nperson to name every meal he or she intends to eat over those 2 years. \nTo ask for a budget over the next 7 years is equally a diversion.\n  Indeed, just imagine if some of our colleagues had been sitting in \nthe Constitutional Convention of 1787, in Philadelphia. Just imagine \nwhen the following clause in article I, section 9 came before the \nConvention: ``No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in \nConsequence of Appropriations made by law * * *.'' Oh no, these \ncolleagues would have said, tell us how much the appropriations will be \nover the next 7 years or we cannot adopt this provision and this \nConstitution. \n[[Page S2029]] What about the clause in article I, section 8, giving \nCongress the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce? Oh no, \nsome of our colleagues would have said in Philadelphia in 1787, if they \nfelt the same as some of our colleagues here, we cannot give Congress \nthe power to regulate commerce until we know the foreign tariffs and \ninterstate regulations Congress will enact over the next 7 years. If \nthe spirit of these colleagues of ours had prevailed then, perhaps \ngoods from New Jersey would still be taxed by New York.\n  This is the Constitution we are addressing here, not a budget \ndocument.\n  What is important here is this: What is going to happen to our \ncountry if we do not enact this balanced budget amendment?\n  These monster deficits force the Federal Government to engage in \nmassive borrowing. Interest rates are kept high and are driven higher. \nHome buyers face higher mortgage rates, making it more difficult for \nhardworking Americans to get their piece of the American dream. Home \nbuilders cannot build homes, workers do not have jobs, revenues are not \npaid to the Federal Government. The greater the difficulty in buying a \nhome, the greater the problems in the home building industry. \nEmployment will drop in that industry and in related businesses from \nrealtors to title searchers.\n  The cost of buying consumer goods goes up as a result of these \nmonster deficits and the Government borrowing it compels. Let us just \ntake the automobile industry as another example. As the cost of credit \ngoes up, automobile sales naturally are adversely affected. Also, \nworkers get laid off. Auto sales and service workers at your local auto \ndealer get laid off. The industries which supply the automobile \nmanufacturers all have to lay off people. Every consumer industry is \nadversely affected when the cost of credit goes up.\n  What about the impact of monster deficits on small business? Listen \nto a part of a statement submitted to the Judiciary Committee by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, which strongly supports \nthis amendment, I might add:\n\n       As deficits increase, the cost of capital increases. Large \n     deficits absorb a significant portion of the available \n     capital. As a result, private enterprises are crowded out of \n     the pool of available credit for financing. Unfortunately, \n     this crowding out is not borne evenly across businesses of \n     all sizes. It is more probable that small businesses bear the \n     brunt of this financial displacement since they have fewer \n     financing alternatives available to them relative to larger \n     firms. When small businesses cannot obtain capital to improve \n     facilities, purchase equipment, and expand their operations, \n     fewer jobs are created and less revenue is sent to the \n     Treasury.\n\n  What a statement by the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses.\n  Opponents of this amendment ask us about tax increases. If we do not \npass this amendment and put the Federal Government on a fiscal diet, \ntaxes are clearly going to go up to pay the ever-increasing interest on \nthe ever-growing national debt. I do not know any American who really \nwants that to happen, to just throw more money down the drain on the \nnational debt's interest. Golly, when are we going to get it under \ncontrol?\n  Here is what the National Taxpayers Union says:\n\n       A child born today faces a huge bill by the time he or she \n     is old enough to vote at age 18. Paying interest on the \n     national debt accumulated just in this child's first 18 years \n     of life will cost that child's family over $103,000 in extra \n     taxes on average over his or her lifetime.\n\n  This assumes an annual deficit of $285 billion for this child's first \n18 years and the National Taxpayers Union notes that the Congressional \nBudget Office projects that the deficit will average $285 billion over \nthe next 11 years. So our children and our grandchildren will pay and \npay and pay unless we pass this amendment.\n  The American people want change. The amendment is part of that \nchange. We cannot keep going the same old way around here. The old \norder, it seems to me, has to give on this issue. And if we do not get \nthe votes on this issue, then we have to rise up and get rid of the old \norder. It is just that simple. Not because we dislike them or not \nbecause they are not nice people or not because we do not like our own \nSenators when they are at home; we have to get rid of them, we have to \nget people here who mean business on this.\n  If we do not pass this balanced budget amendment this time, we may \nnever have a chance to do it again. It may be too late. But if we do \npass it, then everybody here knows the game is over, they know the \nStates are going to ratify this amendment, and they know that we are \ngoing to have to get to work over the next 7 years to get that trend \nline down to a balanced budget. It is that simple.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has told us how much a \nbalanced budget will hurt the States and the American people and \npublic. I do not think any of us here have claimed it will be easy to \nbalance the budget or that there will be no pain involved. We are not \npainting nirvana here. We are saying there is going to be pain, but \npain with gain ultimately.\n  For the first time in 19 years--really, the first time in recent \nhistory--Congress will be forced to make priority choices among \ncompeting programs, and they will have to choose those that are the \nmost important programs, those that do the most good, and maybe let \nthose that are marginal and some that are not as good go, just as you \ndo when you do your budget, just as the States do when they do theirs. \nWe all know it is going to be difficult to cut back on spending. As the \nFederal Government goes on a diet, the States and our American citizens \nare smart enough to know that they are going to have to tighten their \nbelts, as well. It is about time. It is about time that we all just \ncome to that conclusion because that is where we are, and there is no \nother way around it.\n  This diet involves more than just cutting our spending practices. It \nmeans a lifestyle change from the spending binges of the past. It means \nchanging the old order. It means changing the old ways. It means moving \ninto the 21st century with new ways. These new Senators are making a \ndifference. I notice one of them sits in the chair right now, from \nPennsylvania. He got elected in part because he was willing to stand up \non this issue, and he is going to get reelected again because he is \nvoting for it. Those who do not are going to be the ones who have the \ntroubles.\n  We must all evaluate our current programs and spending levels to \ndetermine their effectiveness. This includes our State programs, as \nwell. If we did not launder all the money through the Federal \nGovernment, there would be a lot more money for the States, only it \nwould not be laundered and there would not be just 28 percent come to \nthe States out of the laundering. They would have 100 percent, and they \nwould not have to increase taxes to get there.\n  The numbers given to us by my colleague from West Virginia regarding \nthe grants given to States assume that each and every program will be \ncontinued in its current form. I doubt that this is going to be true. I \ndo not see how anybody cannot doubt that is going to be true. We are \nnot going to keep all these same programs in their current form. We are \ngoing to have to change some of them. We are going to have to delete \nsome of them. They are going to be the lesser programs, the ones that \ndo not count as much as others. Some States may be happy to end some of \nthese programs we force on them. But each of the States will respond in \nits own way to meet the priorities of its own citizens.\n  As the ability of Congress to overspend disappears, we will be forced \nto evaluate where the money is going. This means that we should put the \nmoney into the most effective programs and stop funding the wasteful \nprograms that just are not working.\n  We will have to examine our priorities and adjust our spending \naccordingly. We have seen many proposals to balance the budget without \ncutting Social Security, Medicare, or other vital programs. While I do \nnot know of one that is the ultimate solution, they do show us that \nwith a lot of cooperation and work, we can find a roadmap to balance \nthe budget.\n  One example, for instance, would hold the growth of Federal \nGovernment spending, currently at 5.4 percent per year and going up, to \n3.1 percent a year. This would balance the budget by the year 2002. If \nwe exclude Social Security and constrain the spending growth to just 2 \npercent, the budget would still be balanced--and that is excluding \nSocial Security.\n   [[Page S2030]] This is without eliminating a single program. There \nare ways of doing it. We just do not have the will to do it nor the \nneed to do it because we do not have the constitutional requirement or \nmandate to do it. If we put this in the Constitution, I do not know of \na Senator in this body who would not change his or her legislating \nstyle, who would not change his or her attitude about spending, who \nwould not try to live up to the mandate of the Constitution. We swear \nto do so, and I believe everyone here will.\n  I realize that it is not as simple as I just explained with regard to \nthe 2-percent increase in the budget each of the next 7 years--we can \nreach a balanced budget without really cutting the programs--but we \nwill have to examine the spending patterns of the Federal Government. \nWe will have to eliminate some well-intentioned programs that are not \nworking or not working well, and reform other programs that are not \nworking as well as they could.\n  The important point, however, is that we can get there, but we will \nnot get there unless we put this mechanism into the Constitution.\n  It is not painless, and we will all feel the pinch with the reduced \nspending that will be necessary to balance the budget. But if we do not \nbalance the budget, it will cause each and every American taxpayer even \nmore pain. If we continue to increase the debt, inflation will \nskyrocket and the dollars used by every American citizen will be worth \nless, especially when we will be forced to monetize the debt. This will \nhurt even more than tightening our belts and making the spending cuts \nnecessary to balance the budget. If we do balance the budget now, we \nwill all share the benefit. It will not be too much for any single \nindividual. We will all have to share.\n  More importantly, however, we will all feel the benefits of lower \ninflation, a more valuable dollar, and the security of knowing that \nexcept in times of war or other hostilities, or in times of severe \ndepression, we will maintain a balanced budget, which is what the \nFounding Fathers really wanted, and what they really assumed would be \nthe rule under the Constitution.\n  This amendment will help us to do a better job. This will do away \nwith this old attitude that if we just tax and spend, we can get \nelected. The system will change to where we can get elected if we live \nwithin our means, conserve the Federal Government's money, the people's \nmoney, if you will, work with the States, and quit intruding into \neverybody's life every day as the Federal bureaucracy does now.\n  This country is in trouble. We are fighting with all we have to try \nto solve the problems of this country, and this particular amendment \ncan do it. In all honesty, our spending in this country is at runaway \nproportions. We are destroying our country. We are destroying the \nfuture of our young people. For the first time in history--I repeat it \none more time--our kids do not have the promise of a better future that \nwe had. And I really, really resent that.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. I suppose we could survive \nanything because of the resilience of the American people. But we could \nsurvive better if we do what is right. This country, if it is righteous \nand it does what is right and it lives within its means and if Congress \nhas the incentive to live within its means, will always be the greatest \ncountry in the world. But if we do not do right and we keep spending \nlike we are spending and we keep interest against the national debt \nrising like it is rising, compounding every year, this country will \nslip; it will fall; this whole hemisphere will be affected; the whole \nworld will be affected; and our dollar will fall in value to the point \nwhere those who are on fixed incomes, including our seniors on Social \nSecurity, will be the most hurt.\n  This is important to our country's future. This is the single most \nimportant vote that we will be casting when we vote up or down on this \namendment. I am quoting Senator Kennedy and Senator Biden when I say \nthat. But I agree with them. This is the most important vote most of us \nwill ever make. In order to get there we have to vote down all the \nkiller amendments that will make it more difficult to pass it again in \nthe House--and that is the purpose of them--and will make it more \ndifficult to pass it here. We are going to have to stand up and vote.\n  Now, I believe that we will have 67 Senators who believe enough in \nthis country to vote for a balanced budget amendment. The only chance \nwe have is this bipartisan consensus, Democrat- Republican amendment, \nand acknowledge that it was no small achievement for the House of \nRepresentatives to pass this through for the first time in history. We \nhave done it before in the Senate, but we have also failed before. This \ntime we do not intend to fail. If we win, it is going to be because the \nAmerican people got involved. So I hope everybody out there listening \nto this really inundates this Senate with the demand that we pass the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate appears to be drawing fairly \nclose to the end of a week in which Members have spoken in relatively \ngeneral terms about the desirability or lack of desirability of a \nconstitutional amendment to nudge this Nation along the road toward a \nbalanced budget. Soon we will be dealing with specific amendments to \nthis proposed constitutional amendment and I wish to speak for just a \nmoment both in general terms and in specific terms.\n  In general terms, we face the proposition that divides this body, I \nbelieve at this point, simply into two camps. Earlier this week, I had \nthought there were three different and distinct attitudes, but I have \nheard only two. There are those who, like myself, believe that the \ncountry is in a serious crisis, that the status quo is unsatisfactory, \nand that the situation, the set of rules under which we have operated--\nnot just for years but for generations--will not and cannot serve to \nlead this country along the road to fiscal sanity and a balanced budget \nand that, therefore, drastic action in the form of a constitutional \namendment is necessary. I believe that expresses the views of a \nsignificant majority of the Members of this body--I hope of two-thirds \nof the Members of this body.\n  Those who oppose this constitutional amendment, however, have either \nbrought up rather narrow technical objections to it or have stated \nalmost without exception their devotion to the idea of a balanced \nbudget but their views that to change the Constitution in order to \nencourage it is a bad idea. I believe they are wrong. I believe those \nwho feel that we should have a balanced budget but that we can reach \nthat goal without a profound change in the system under which both the \nCongress and the President of the United States operate have a \ntremendously difficult burden of proof. Because, of course, the rules \nthat they want to continue in effect have been the rules during the \nentire time in which this multitrillion-dollar debt has been built up.\n  How is it that they feel that suddenly, without any change in the \nsystem under which we operate, we will nevertheless reach a goal which \nhas eluded us for such an extended period of time? That, it seems to \nme, should be the central focus of this debate by the one group which \nstands for the status quo, mostly on the liberal side of the spectrum, \nwhich nevertheless gives lip service to a balanced budget, but which \nhas given us not the slightest hint as to the road to be traveled in \norder to reach that end.\n  If I understand it correctly, beginning tomorrow or certainly \nsometime during the course of the next week, we will be faced, by \nadding to the Constitution of the United States detailed provisions \npursuant to which those who feel the change in the Constitution is \nnecessary will be required to outline, in absolute, binding detail in \nthe laws of the United States, precisely the road by which we will \nreach that goal by the year 2002, ignoring the fact that there will be \nthree new elections for Congress between now and that year in which \ndifferent Members will be elected, during which time crises in our \ninternational affairs may or may not arise, \n[[Page S2031]] crises in our own domestic and economic affairs may or \nmay not arise, with new Members with new knowledge who may wish an \nentirely different course of action than any we could possibly outline \nhere.\n  Nevertheless, those who believe in the status quo will be asking us \nto bind ourselves to a precise, legally binding, detailed blueprint of \nthe way in which this goal will be reached.\n  Mr. President, it is my position that it is they, not we, who should \nprovide us with that detailed blueprint.\n  We believe that dramatic change is necessary. We look at the history \nof the last decade or decades, and say the system is broke. We wish to \nfix it. The way in which we wish to fix it is to strongly, in the \nConstitution of the United States, encourage a balanced budget by \nrequiring a significant supermajority which can unbalance one, which is \nstill to be possible under emergency circumstances when a bipartisan \nmajority feels that it would be necessary. We do not have, and we \nshould not have, a detailed blueprint about how to reach that goal \nbecause, if this proposal becomes a part of the Constitution, all will \nbe a part of the solution, those who favor it and those who oppose it, \nincluding the President and future Presidents of the United States. The \nentire challenge will seem quite different to us and to the Nation at \nthat point. And we will learn. I think we will learn that it may be a \nlittle bit easier than we had thought because the commitment to do so \nin and of itself will, I think, lower interest rates, for example, here \nin the United States.\n  It will be my position, and I think the position of many others here, \nthat the group of Members of this body and the people in this country \nwho believe the status quo is good enough, who do not want change, who \ndo not believe change is necessary, but who nevertheless, as they have \nalmost without exception, given lip service to a balanced budget, it is \nthey who are under the duty of telling us exactly how they will reach \nthat goal without a change in the Constitution, without a change in the \nrules in which we operate in this Senate.\n  Mark my words, Mr. President. Next week, as we begin to cast votes on \nthese various amendments to the amendment, one fact should remain \nbefore all of the American people. We are either for or against this \nchange. We are either for or against a new way of doing business. We \nare either for or against the status quo. And those who try to hide or \nobfuscate that issue through changes, through technical objections, \nthrough demands for detailed blueprints, essentially are saying the \nstatus quo is just fine.\n  Those who hold to the goal of this proposed constitutional amendment \nin this form, the form in which it passed the House of Representatives, \nare truly those who are devoted to a new and different way of doing \nbusiness, a way of doing business in which we no longer spend whatever \nwe like and pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren.\n  That is the issue we began to debate this week. It will be the issue \nin every vote we take until finally, as I hope we will, we pass this \njoint resolution and send it to the people of the 50 States for their \nratification.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, as I struggle to get over my disbelief that we are \nback at this, I rise once again to express my views of a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The basic reasons I oppose this amendment are the same ones that led \nme to vote against it on the two previous occasions--since I joined the \nSenate--that it has been before this body.\n  Congress does not need the U.S. Constitution to perform its \nresponsibility for the Federal budget. We were elected to make the \ndecisions about where to spend the hard-earned tax dollars of \nAmericans, and where not to spend those dollars. We were elected to \nmake the decisions required to adapt to the country's needs and to keep \nus militarily and economically strong. We do not need to add another \npage to the Constitution to do our job.\n  And some of us have worked very hard in the recent years to, in fact, \ndo the job of digging out from the exploding deficits of the 1980's, \nreducing the deficit, and changing the priorities of the Federal budget \nin order to cut waste and increase investment in America's future. I \nhave cast many votes in the recent years for actual cuts, for detailed \nchanges in policy, and for specific budget plans--all the time, \nwatching many colleagues vote the other way because somehow those \nspecific ideas just weren't quite palatable or perfect enough for him.\n  It is no accident that the Federal deficit will drop this year for \nthe third year in a row, for the first time in 50 years. The deficit \nfinally started to shrink because instead of waiting to get the \nConstitution to tell us to cut spending and require some fiscal \ndiscipline, we did it ourselves.\n  I want to see the Federal budget balanced, too. But I refuse to strap \nthe Federal budget into a speeding train, having no idea who and what \nin my State of West Virginia that train will crush. I got elected to \nhelp steer that train, to help set its speed, and to adjust its route--\nso we can change course when we need to deal with less than minor \nmatters like recessions, natural disasters, military crises, and other \ndire needs or situations.\n  As a former Governor of West Virginia, I am shocked every time I hear \nproponents of the constitutional amendment say ``this is just doing \nwhat States have to do.'' That is completely and utterly wrong, and it \nis insulting and misleading to the American people. Every Governor and \nevery State government has tools, outside of its operating budgets,\n to borrow and to invest. Through bonds and other methods, States can \nbuild and repair roads, improve schools, and lay the ground for the \nneeds of their people. Under this constitutional amendment for a \nFederal balanced budget, that would not be possible. This proposal is \nnothing less than a straitjacket that just might suffocate the \nprosperity and economic growth that determines whether there are jobs \nand opportunity for Americans.\n\n  This is where economics is not just about textbooks or abstract \ntheories. To eliminate the Government's ability to stimulate the \neconomy or to intercede in a crisis is to create a recipe for disaster. \nWhether economic growth were strong or weak would be ignored in the \nname of a balanced budget. Recessions would be more frequent, longer, \nand tougher to pull out of. Large spending cuts or tax hikes would be \nrequired in times of slow growth, just when the opposite is called for \nbecause cutting Government spending or raising taxes slows the economy \neven more. Passing a balanced budget amendment would exaggerate rather \nthan mitigate America's shifting economic fortunes.\n  This year, I feel even more strongly that the constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment is a bad idea whose time has not come. That is because \nthere is another script that many of this amendment's proponents are \nworking from this year. It is called a plan to generate tax cuts that \nare expected to cost between $400 and $700 billion over the same 7 \nyears that this amendment would require a balanced budget. These are \ntax cuts that go far beyond relief for hard-working Americans and the \nmiddle class. You will find it in something called the contract for \nAmerica, and it is a script that wants to stage the revival of tax cuts \nfor the wealthy and corporations--this time with the hope it will not \npull the rug out from the rest of Americans like it did before.\n  Well, Broadway should stick to bringing back old scripts, not Capitol \nHill. In representing West Virginia, I don't want to see any revivals \nof past nightmares.\n  When I was Governor, and watched Congress promise to balance the \nbudget while cutting taxes, I saw what happened in living color. Our \nplants that shut down and threw working families of West Virginia into \nforeclosures and bankruptcies. Our kids who dropped out of college \nbecause tuition money had to go to their families' mortgage \n[[Page S2032]] payments and medical expenses. Our senior citizens who \nkept thermostats at 58 degrees because they could not afford heating \noil.\n  So when I say I want to see the hidden details of this balanced \nbudget amendment, it is not for political reasons or\n academic curiosity. It is because of the contract I have with West \nVirginia. It is because now I am here, not in the State House, to cast \nmy vote and say show us just how you are going to get this done.\n  For those who want to put the Federal budget on this speeding train, \nwhere's your map? Who gets thrown off the train, and who gets to stay \non? Will it be the programs and services that feed children, care for \nveterans, pay our rural hospitals, and keep our water clean and safe? \nWill the highways now being finished in my State--while other States \ngot theirs paid for before us--end up being roads to nowhere because \nthe money will run out? Will our seniors find out that Medicare cannot \nkeep its promise just when they need health care?\n  West Virginia has the right-to-know what the script will be this \ntime. If it is to be a reprise of the 1980s, we are not buying tickets. \nWe saw the unemployment rates or some of our counties soar over 50 \npercent. We lost $1.7 billion in aid--the largest per-capita in the \nNation--almost $1,000 per person. We watched our plants close, we \nwatched our hospitals shut services, we watched our schools work with \nfewer resources, and we were forced into a recession that the State is \nonly now starting to pull out of. So West Virginia will not be trampled \nagain.\n  I understand the lure, the appeal, the aroma of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. Write into the most sacred document of \nthis Nation, one of the most venerable documents in the world, that we, \nthe Congress, will require that expenditures made by the Federal \nGovernment do not exceed its revenues.\n  But this is the classic case of putting the cart before the horse. In \nthe real world, this promise means coming up with a total of $1 \ntrillion in actual budget cuts over 7 years--years that are going to \nfly by very quickly. If those tax cuts for a lot of non-middle-class \nAmericans get thrown onto the equation, we are talking about $1.4 \ntrillion in spending cuts. Then, if Social Security is excluded, \ndefense is given special protection, and there are few other \nuntouchables, what exactly does $1.4 trillion in budget cuts mean to \nthe people of West Virginia--and to the people of the other States?\n  Just when West Virginia is getting up from the beating we took over a \ndecade ago, we face this. Just as our industries and workers are \nstanding up to the challenges of the new economy, determined to make \nit, we face this.\n  This amendment, with those added tax cuts, threatens to\n   pull $2.7 billion away from West Virginia. That means much less for \neducation, job training, housing, health care, student loans, veterans \nservices, you name it. That means less to feed schoolchildren, support \nour police, invest in our university research.\n\n  Even some proponents of the balanced budget amendment are realizing \nthat, this time--as a new car called $400-billion-plus of tax cuts is \nhitched onto the speeding train--this time, we all better know what the \nroute consists of.\n  For example, it is not possible to achieve $1.4 trillion in cuts \nwithout squeezing unprecedented amounts of money out of Medicare, \nMedicaid, and veterans health care and benefits. It is just not \npossible. The Senate Budget Committee staff have even acknowledged that \n$644 billion will have to come somehow from the so-called entitlement \nprograms--except for Social Security--over the next 7 years to hurl the \nbudget into balance. Maybe the nightmares will not happen. Maybe \nseniors will not find benefits cut off. Maybe the veterans hospitals \ncan stay open. Maybe we will not just give up on immunizing poor \nchildren. But maybe not. We could be sending people over cliffs with \nthis train.\n  Again, that's why I add my voice to the right-to-know idea. The \nproponents of this amendment have an obligation to think through what \ncourse they will take. Will it be a collision course for our economy, \nfinally growing again, facing intense competition from other nations \nwhile working families can't seem to get their incomes up? Or maybe \nthere's a map I haven't seen yet--one that accelerates the deficit \nreduction that I also want, but keeps the country and my State on an \neven course.\n  Mr. President, the tools for deficit reduction are already in hand. \nCutting wasteful and frivolous spending, creating a climate for \nproductivity with accessible credit and sound trade policies, and \nkeeping workers on the job. That's just common-sense deficit reduction.\n  I will not change that stand until those who support this amendment \ncan detail all the spending cuts and tax increases necessary to reach \nthe promised land. Show my people the plan. Show Americans the \nspecifics, so we can also debate how they will affect our economy. Show \nthis Nation's hard-pressed families how they will send their kids to \ncollege when student loans disappear. Show American industry and \nworkers how we will keep up with our competitors when we just give up \non research that plants the seeds for the next wave of technology. Show \nGovernors, State legislators, mayors how the greatest unfunded mandate \nof all time--this balanced budget\n amendment--will help them pick up the pieces. What happens when States \nand communities do not get the funds to fight crime, train teachers, \npromote their exports, or repair their bridges?\n\n  We watched some of this show already, and it was a huge flop. In the \n1980's, we watched arbitrage kings and junk-bond peddlers make fortunes \nwhile factories padlocked their gates and cast workers into the cold. \nWe saw a nation divided into winners and losers as budget efforts took \nfrom those who could give least and asked little, if anything, from \nthose who had the most. The middle-class worked harder just to keep up, \nthe poor got poorer with less chance to get ahead, and the rich rode \nfirst class as they profited.\n  In the recent years, and I do not just mean the past 2 years under a \nDemocratic President, I thought Congress was figuring out that it was \ntime to take a different approach. No more games, no more empty \npromises. If we deserve to be here, we have to make real choices and \nhonest decisions. When enough of us started doing that, then and only \nthen did the Federal deficit start to shrink. The job is far from done, \nand it is not getting any easier. But by working out a balance between \nwhat must be done to invest in our people and use their hard-earned tax \ndollars more wisely, we have a course that I see as far less reckless \nand dangerous than strapping this amendment onto the U.S. Constitution.\n  The balanced budget amendment is a quick-fix for a problem that has \ngrown because of quick-fixes. West Virginia does not deserve any \nrepeats of a cruel and unfair past. So spell it all out for us--every \nspending cut and every tax--and show us where the money to balance the \nbudget this quickly, with constraints that not a single State \ngovernment is under, will come from. Until you can, do not ask West \nVirginia to sign on. We know the old saying, ``Fool me once, shame on \nyou. Fool me twice, shame on me.'' And we will not get fooled again.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in the last few minutes here before we \npack up and call it a day, I wanted to respond to some of the comments \nthat the Senator from West Virginia just made while I was presiding. He \nmade some comments that were familiar in tone, that I had been hearing \nthroughout the day and throughout the week by so many Members who have \nrisen in opposition to the balanced budget amendment.\n  I keep hearing this familiar refrain, ``I am for a balanced budget--\nbut.'' ``I really believe in a balanced budget-- \n[[Page S2033]] however.'' ``We need to get to a balanced budget but \nthis constitutional amendment just is not the way to do it.'' ``You \nneed to tell us how you are going to get there. But I want to get \nthere, too, but I do not need to tell you but you need to tell us, \nbecause you are for a balanced budget amendment.'' Or, you are for a \nbalanced budget amendment but you are not for this amendment, because \nthis amendment says that we are going to have a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  Then when are you for a balanced budget amendment? If not in the year \n2002, are you for a budget balanced budget in 2003? 2004? 2005? Pick a \nnumber. Tell us when you think we should have a balanced budget, and \nthen you tell us how you will get us there. But do not stand and say \nthat you are for a balanced budget in the abstract, but it would be too \npainful and too hurtful to your State or to the individuals that you \nknow who will suffer under this, to get there. You are either for a \nbalanced budget and for the commitment to get there, or you are just \ntalking. And we have been doing a lot of talking here in the Senate and \nthe House for a lot of years about how we are going to get to a \nbalanced budget.\n  Now, the Senator from West Virginia said that he took pride in the \nvote he cast 2 years ago, 1993, that put us on course. We are on \ncourse, he said. We are on course. I do not know if he has seen some of \nthe deficit projections by the Congressional Budget Office. We are not \non course to a balanced budget. We are not even close to being on \ncourse to a balanced budget. This budget is going to hang around where \nit is right now for the next couple of years, and then just goes way up \nagain around the turn of the century, doubling from where it is today. \nWe are not on course for a balanced budget.\n  We must do something just to keep the deficits where they are now. We \nwill have to pull back Government, or, as some would propose, increase \ntaxes, just to hold where we are as far as annual deficits. So we are \nnot on course. We are way off course.\n  Now, I come from southwestern Pennsylvania, which is the border of \nWest Virginia. I actually lived the first 7 years of my life in West \nVirginia. I am very familiar with West Virginia. And I am very familiar \nwith the pain that a lot of the people in West Virginia and \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania and around the Pittsburgh area where I am \nfrom, suffered during the early 1980's. And I represented a \ncongressional district before I came here where in the late 1970's \nthere were over 110,000 steelworkers working in my district. When I was \nsworn into office in the early 1990's, there were less than 15,000 \nsteelworkers remaining.\n  Now, I know what economic devastation is, but I can tell Senators, \nthe people in that district, the people in West Virginia, are not \nconcerned about the next Government program we will create to put them \nback to work or to train them. What they want are good, private sector \njobs. And that is what responsible fiscal policy will get this country. \nSound fiscal policy will stabilize this economy and create jobs into \nthe future.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to respond further to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and others on that side of the aisle. I see it is \ntime to wrap things up, so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania. I cannot say what it means to me to see \nthese new Senators on the floor coming down here and standing for the \nbalanced budget amendment. All 11 of them do. It is an amazing \ntransition, an amazing change. As somebody who has been fighting for \nthis for the last 18, 19 years, I have to say, these folks, like the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, are making a difference. And \nthey will make a difference, coupled with heroic Democrats who are \nwilling to fight side by side with us because--whether liberal or \nconservative--they feel that it is now the time to make this change. We \nhave to do it.\n  So I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. \nI have great respect for him. He deserves it. He is a great addition to \nthis U.S. Senate. I hope he will keep fighting side by side us on this \nand other matters.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S2027-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:55 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 101.

A bill to provide means of limiting the exposure of children \nto violent programming on television, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              THE CHILDREN'S MEDIA PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Children's \nMedia Protection Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, last Tuesday, the President in his State of the Union \nAddress, asked Americans to take responsibility for their lives, to \nkeep families together, and to keep communities from falling apart. As \npart of that challenge, the President expressed his continuing concern \nover media violence and challenged the media industry by saying,\n\n       You do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your \n     work and to understand the damage that comes from the \n     incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible \n     conduct that permeates our media.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree, and so do the experts. Let me quote the \nGuggenheim Foundation from the study of ``Violence in Society.'' They \nsaid, ``The scientific debate is over. A recent summary of 200 studies \npublished through 1990 offers convincing evidence that the observation \nof violence as seen in standard, every day television entertainment, \ndoes affect the aggressive behavior of the viewer.''\n  Mr. President, while the scientific debate is over, the public policy \ndebate continues into its fifth decade.\n  Let me just turn to a chart which shows that violence in our society \nis far above that of any other industrialized nation. This chart is \ntitled ``Crime Across the Globe, Murders Per 100,000 in 1990.'' The \nUnited States, 9.4; Canada, 5.5; Denmark, 5.2; France, 4.6; Australia, \n4.5; Germany, 4.2; Belgium, 2.8, and on it goes down to Japan at 1.2.\n  Mr. President, we have a problem in this country. No one is \nsuggesting that violence in the media is the sole cause; certainly, it \nis not. But to deny that it plays a part is to deny what all of us \ninstinctively understand. We learn by watching what others do, and many \nchildren in our society are spending 6 hours a day watching television. \nWhat do they see? One thing they see is endless acts of mindless, \ngratuitous violence. Mr. President, it has an affect and it is a bad \naffect. It teaches children that one way to deal with problems is to \nengage in acts of violence. And in many cases it teaches them that \nthere are no consequences, there is no pain. People are blown away and \nit does not make a difference.\n  We know better. We know it does make a difference, and we know this \nis not what we should be teaching our children. Because of a lack of \naction on this issue, I formed the Citizens Task Force on TV Violence, \ncomprised of 28 national organizations representing medical \nprofessions, parents, educators, law enforcement, and churches. We \nformed that group in June 1993.\n  In December of that year, the Attorney General, Janet Reno, asked us \nfor a set of recommendations. We submitted seven recommendations to the \nAttorney General. Those recommendations called for the adoption of a \ntough entertainment-media violence code, support for technology that \nwould permit parents to more effectively monitor children's viewing of \ntelevision. We recommended strengthening the Children's Television Act \nof 1990, scheduling hearings by the FCC on television violence, \nconvening a White House Conference on Violence, curbing viewing of \nviolent television programming in prisons, and the continuation of \ntelevision industry discussions as authorized under the Television \nProgram Improvement Act of 1990.\n  Shortly after these recommendations were submitted, the American \nMedical Association's house of delegates called for the adoption of a \ntelevision violence code. They had a rating system for films, video, \nand audio entertainment. Following the outcry last year over the \nviolent content of television and cable programming, the major TV \nnetworks and cable initiated voluntary assessments of violent content \nin their program. These assessments began with the 1994-95 television \nviewing season. Additionally, the major television networks agreed to \ndisplay viewer warnings on some television programming containing \nviolent content. They deserve credit for these steps.\n  There is progress on other fronts, as well. Even the leaders of the \nentertainment industry have come to believe that violence in the media \nis a problem. In a survey of entertainment industry leaders in U.S. \nNews & World Report on May 9, 1994, nearly 9 out of 10 media \nentertainment industry leaders said that violence in entertainment \ncontributes to the level of violence plaguing the Nation.\n  Mr. President, even though there has been a recognition, even though \nthere has been a public discussion about media violence and the \ncontribution it makes to violence in our society, nothing is happening. \nThe media mayhem continues.\n  I cite the alarming report of the Center for Media and Public Affairs \nthat was done in August of last year. The center, working with the \nGuggenheim Foundation, reported that television is considerably more \nviolent in 1994 than it was 2 years previous.\n  Mr. President, I direct your attention to the chart that we have \nprepared that shows what has happened to the daily violence on \ntelevision, a comparison between 1992 and 1994. This shows the \nincidents of violence per hour that are going out over the media.\n  Networks in 1992 had 25 violent acts per hour on average. In 1994, \nthat had increased to 43 acts of violence per hour. Cable was even more \negregious. Cable had 55 acts of violence per hour in 1992. That \nescalated to 75 acts of violence per hour on average in 1994. Only \nPublic Broadcasting had modest levels of violence and was stable in the \nacts of violence portrayed between the years of 1992 and 1994.\n  Mr. President, although there has been a lot of talk about doing \nsomething about violence in the media, there has been precious little \naction.\n  I believe the American people do not want their children and families \nexposed to the extraordinary violence that is occurring in the \nentertainment media on a daily basis.\n  Now, we here in the Senate do not watch a lot of television because \nwe wind up being here most of our time or in our States going from town \nto town. And so opportunities for watching television are somewhat \nlimited. I would just ask my colleagues to turn on the television, \nwatch what is happening, and ask yourselves: Can it possibly be the \ncase that we can have children watching 6 hours of television a day and \nseeing endless repetitive mindless acts of violence and it has no \neffect on them? It cannot be. It has to be having an effect on them. \nAnd virtually every study that has been done says it is having an \neffect on them.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that the violence in our society is not \njust because of media violence. Certainly, that is not the case. There \nare many contributors. But the time has come for us to reduce the \nviolence in the entertainment media. The trend to glamorize violence \nmust stop.\n  I am pleased by the voluntary efforts the media has undertaken. But \nlet us face it. The job is not getting done. I do not believe that \nvoluntary initiatives are sufficient to reduce media violence. \n[[Page S2036]] For that reason, I am introducing legislation today that \nincorporates the principal recommendations of the Citizens Task Force. \nThe legislation includes means to empower parents to help them make \nchoices. It provides for new television sets being required to contain \na V-chip that would permit parents to block television programming with \nviolent content. The cost of the V-chip is now down to about $5 per \ntelevision set--$5 --to give the parents an ability, to empower parents \nto help make choices for their children. That makes sense.\n  Second, the legislation contains a violent programming rating \nprovision. This provision requires the FCC to prescribe, in \nconsultation with the broadcasters and cable operators, private \ninterest groups and concerned citizens rules for rating the level of \nviolence in television programming. These ratings would apply to the V-\nchip technology.\n  Third, the legislation contains a children's safe harbor provision \nwhich requires the FCC to initiate a rule that prohibits commercial \ntelevision, cable operators, and public telecommunications entities \nfrom broadcasting television programs that contain gratuitous violence \nbetween the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. at night.\n  Mr. President, if there is one thing we have heard all across this \ncountry it is that there ought to be a safe harbor, there ought to be a \nperiod within which kids are watching television that parents can have \nsome assurance they are not being exposed to this mindless gratuitous \nviolence.\n  Finally, the bill contains the Children's TV Act compliance provision \nwhich requires the FCC, when granting or renewing TV licenses, to \nassure the applicant is in compliance with the Children's Television \nAct of 1990.\n  These provisions are consistent with the FCC's current examination of \ntelevision violence in children's television programs and the \nimplementation of the Childrens' Television Act of 1990.\n  Mr. President I have supported voluntary efforts in the past and I \ncontinue to support and commend these efforts. But it is absolutely \nclear--absolutely clear--that those efforts are not sufficient to \nachieve the result that I think the vast majority of Americans would \nlike to see achieved.\n  The President challenged us last Tuesday to understand the impact \nthat this constant stream of mindless violence is having on our \nfamilies and children. I applaud the President, and I hope he will \ncontinue to draw public attention to the corrosive effect that violence \nin the entertainment media is having on our families and on our \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I welcome cosponsors to my legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to carefully examine the issue of media violence as it \nrelates to violence in our society.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill, the recommendations \nsubmitted to Attorney General Janet Reno by the Citizens Task Force on \nTV Violence, the names of the national organizations in the task force \nthat endorse the recommendations, and the press release announcing the \naction by the American Medical Association's house of delegates, its \narticle, entitled ``A Kinder, Gentler Hollywood,'' in the May 1994 \nissue of the U.S. News & World Report, the findings of the study by the \nCenter for Media and Public Affairs, along with the press release \nannouncing the study, and the report of the study of the findings of \n200 studies of violence, along with the endorsements of task force \nmembers that supported this initiative, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to specifically draw the attention \nof my colleagues to the letter of support for this legislation from the \nAmerican Medical Association--I was pleased to have the president of \nthe American Medical Association at the press conference this morning \nannouncing this legislation--the support from the National Association \nof Secondary School Principals; the support of the National Coalition \non Television Violence; the support of school principals who recognize \nthat the epidemic of violence on the streets of America is spilling \nover into the schools of America and their belief that media violence \nis contributing to that violence; the support from the National \nAssociation for the Education of Young Children; the strong statement \nof support from the National PTA; the support of The Future Wave, which \nis made up of producers and writers themselves who recognize that \ntelevision violence, media violence, is contributing to violence in our \nsociety; and the support of the National Alliance for Nonviolent \nProgramming. All of these groups have specifically endorsed, now, the \nlegislation that I am introducing today.\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n                                 S. 332\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Childrens' Media Protection \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On average, a child in the United States is exposed to \n     27 hours of television each week, and some children are \n     exposed to as much as 11 hours of television each day.\n       (2) The average American child watches 8,000 murders and \n     100,000 acts of other violence on television by the time the \n     child completes elementary school.\n       (3) By the age of 18 years, the average American teenager \n     has watched 200,000 acts of violence on television, including \n     40,000 murders.\n       (4) The Times Mirror Center reports that a recent poll of \n     Americans indicates that 72 percent of the American people \n     believe that there is too much violence on television, and, \n     according to a survey by U.S. News and World Report dated May \n     1994, 91 percent of American voters believe that mayhem in \n     the media contributes to violence in real life.\n       (5) On several occasions since 1975, The Journal of the \n     American Medical Association has alerted the medical \n     community to the adverse effects of televised violence on \n     child development, including an increase in the level of \n     aggressive behavior and violent behavior among children who \n     view it.\n       (6) The National Commission on Children recommended in 1991 \n     that producers of television programs exercise greater \n     restraint in the content of programming for children.\n       (7) A report of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, \n     dated May 1993, indicates that there is an irrefutable \n     connection between the amount of violence depicted in the \n     television programs watched by children and increased \n     aggressive behavior among children.\n       (8) It is in the National interest that parents be \n     empowered with the technology to block the viewing of \n     television programs whose content is overly violent or \n     objectionable for other reasons.\n       (9) Technology currently exists to permit the manufacture \n     of television receivers that are capable of permitting \n     parents to block television programs having violent or \n     otherwise objectionable content.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEVISION VIOLENCE RATING CODE.\n\n       Section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     303) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) Prescribe, in consultation with television \n     broadcasters, cable operators, appropriate public interest \n     groups, and interested individuals from the private sector, \n     rules for rating the level of violence in television \n     programming, including rules for the transmission by \n     television broadcast systems and cable systems of signals \n     containing specifications for blocking violent \n     programming.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The study counted 2,605 violent scenes in a \n     single day across 10 broadcast and cable channels in 1994, up \n     from 1,846 violent scenes in 1992. But violence shown in toy \n     commercials dropped by 85% from 1992 to 1994.\n       These results come from a unique study of ``a day-in-the-\n     life of television.'' Researchers tabulated all scenes of \n     violence during 18 continuous hours of programming on each of \n     10 broadcast and cable channels during the first Thursday in \n     April of both 1992 and 1994. The researchers monitored the \n     following channels from 6 a.m. to midnight: the ABC, CBS, \n     NBC, and FOX broadcast networks, PBS, and Paramount-owned \n     independent station WDCA; and cable channels HBO, MTV, WTBS, \n     and USA.\n\n\n                             Major findings\n\n       The number of violent scenes increased from 1,846 in 1992 \n     to 2,605 in 1994, a rise of 41%. The average hourly rate \n     increased from 10 to almost 15 scenes of violence per \n     channel.\n       Life threatening violence (such as assaults with deadly \n     weapons) increased even more rapidly than overall violence, \n     rising 67% from 751 to 1,252 scenes. Incidents involving gun \n     play rose 45%, from 362 to 526.\n       The greatest sources of violence on television is not any \n     one type of programming, but the ``promos'' for upcoming \n     shows and movies--695 violent scenes, up 69% from 1992.\n       Unlike TV programs and promos, violence in toy commercials \n     dropped sharply. In about the same amount of children's \n     programming, toy ads showed only 28 violent scenes in 1994, \n     down from 188 in 1992--a drop of 85%.\n       Because the study covers a single day, the results cannot \n     necessarily be generalized across the entire television \n     season. But the increase in violence is too pervasive to \n     attribute it to any unusual aspect of this particular day's \n     programming. Violence was up on the broadcast and cable \n     channels alike in fiction and non-fiction formats, adult and \n     children's fare, and in promos as well as programs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n[From the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, New York, NY, May 3, 1993]\n\n   H.F. Guggenheim Foundation Urges Vigilance Against Media Violence\n\n\n  calls for monitoring of tv networks' compliance with guidelines to \n                   limit violent content of programs\n\n       New York.--The nation's only private foundation devoted \n     exclusively to the study of violence and aggression called \n     today for new vigilance against violence in television \n     programs and motion pictures. In issuing a report entitled \n     ``The Problem of Media Violence and Children's Behavior,'' \n     the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation urged parents, \n     children's advocates, Congress, and the entertainment \n     industry itself to monitor the industry's compliance with new \n     self-imposed guidelines designed to limit violent content in \n     television programs.\n       ``A substantial body of scientific research now documents \n     the damaging effects of exposure to violent media content. \n     Many leading scientists are convinced that media violence \n     promotes real violence,'' said foundation president James M. \n     Hester. ``The entertainment industry plays an important role \n     in the epidemic of youth violence sweeping the nation. \n     Parents, children's advocacy groups, and Congress should hold \n     the networks to their promise to curb violence on \n     television.''\n       The foundation called on the entertainment industry to \n     adhere to a 15-point set of standards issued by the three \n     major television networks in December 1992. ABC, CBS, and NBC \n     developed the guidelines in response to a law passed by \n     Congress that protected the networks from prosecution on \n     [[Page S2038]] antitrust grounds if they coordinated efforts \n     to regulate the amount of violence in their programming. The \n     exemption expires at the end of this year.\n       ``The public is anxious about the problem of media \n     violence, but they don't know what's being done to address \n     it,'' Hester said. ``This report supplies up-to-date \n     information, including an important statement by Professor \n     Leonard Eron of the University of Michigan. We hope it will \n     encourage vigilance in monitoring how well the TV networks \n     live up to their own guidelines. They have made a social \n     contract with the public, and they should be held accountable \n     to it.''\n       The foundation report also points out that the motion-\n     picture industry and cable television networks have yet to \n     issue similar standards limiting violence.\n       ``The initiative of the television networks is a step in \n     the right direction, but the remainder of the industry has \n     yet to respond to the warnings of scientists and the protests \n     of concerned citizens,'' Hester said. ``Media violence \n     obviously remains a very serious national problem.''\n       The Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation supports research in \n     a broad range of disciplines in order to illuminate the \n     causes and consequences of human violence.

These provisions of \n     the bill can educate and involve citizens at the grassroots, \n     and therefore the National Alliance for Non-violent \n     Programming lends its endorsement of the intent of these two \n     provisions.

This is Congress doing our market \n     research for us. We join with other forward thinking people \n     in the Hollywood creative community in welcoming this \n     challenge to generate more creative product, freed from \n     marketplace demands for violence.\n       Future WAVE is an organization of writers and producers \n     Working for Alternatives to Violence through Entertainment. \n     With Board members such as Edward James Olmos, Martin Sheen, \n     Dennis Weaver, and with producer Robert Watts (Indiana Jones \n     movies, Alive, etc.) we are working within the Hollywood \n     creative community to answer MPA Chairman Jack Valenti's \n     call: ``How can we in the film/TV industry . . . be so \n     creatively resourceful that we are able to attract and excite \n     audiences and at the same time try to pacify those scenes \n     which lay claim to gratuitous violence?''\n       We are pleased to see that Congress is going beyond giving \n     a standing ovation to reducing TV violence and actually \n     beginning to do something about it--without censorship.\n       We believe it is very important that the rules for rating \n     the level of violence not be simply a bean count of violent \n     acts. For under such standards a movie like Gandhi or a drama \n     on the life of Martin Luther King might be listed as very \n     violent. [Similarly, each of the films in the attached RAVE \n     award proposal contain acts of violence but have a powerful \n     nonviolent message].\n       What parents need is the power to control programming which \n     glamorizes or trivializes violence. We need more shows which \n     depict nonviolent heroes facing down violence with more \n     creative means than counter-violence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Arthur Kanegis,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the National PTA, Feb. 2, 1995]\n\nNational PTA Supports Passage of the Children's Media Protection Act of \n                                  1995\n\n (By Catherine A. Belter, National PTA Vice-President for Legislative \n                               Activity)\n\n       Washington, DC.--The National PTA joins the many other \n     education, civic, health, child development and child \n     advocacy organizations to speak in favor of the passage of \n     the Children's Media Protection Act of 1995. I am here today \n     as one of a procession of many National PTA representatives \n     who as far back as the 1970's have petitioned Congress and \n     the regulatory agencies about the need to provide more \n     quality television programming for children and youth.\n       I am also here today, not as a legal expert, medical \n     practitioner or law enforcement officer, but as a parent and \n     a long standing child advocate who shares with other parents \n     and citizens the frustration of years of attempting to \n     influence children's television programming while not wishing \n     to cross the fine lines of our First Amendment freedoms.\n       The National PTA has testified in the past that this kind \n     of TV violence legislation would be a last resort if \n     voluntary self-regulation and the TV Violence Act produced \n     little results. We know that Senator Conrad and many in the \n     Congress have taken the same stance. In my comments before \n     the FCC last June, I reported an abysmally low compliance \n     rate of the broadcasters with the Children's Television Act, \n     and an almost total failure by the industry to take advantage \n     of the anti-trust exemption provided by the Children's \n     Television Violence Act to produce industry-wide standards \n     and guidelines in an effort to reduce violent TV programming.\n       At the same time that the industry is ignoring the \n     Children's Television Act, many parents do make an effort to \n     monitor their children's television viewing. The National PTA \n     certainly recognizes that responsibility for children's \n     viewing also falls on the shoulders of the adult family \n     members. To that end, the National PTA has recently launched \n     the Family and Community Critical Viewing Project in \n     association with the National Cable Television Association \n     (NCTA) and Cable in the Classroom. This cooperative effort is \n     designed to provide parents and teachers throughout the \n     country with information and skills\n      to help families make better choices in the television \n     programs they watch, and to improve the way they watch \n     these programs. The workshops are based on a model created \n     in association with the Harvard media expert Dr. Renee \n     Hobbs. The National PTA is offering media literacy \n     workshops to PTAs around the country. In addition, the \n     National PTA has also been in the forefront in supporting \n     such non-commercial and educational programs as Arts and \n     Entertainment, Cable in the Classroom, Discovery and CNN \n     Classroom News.\n       But for some children TV acts as the remote babysitter and \n     as a surrogate parent, and these children may not be \n     fortunate enough to have parents who closely monitor their TV \n     watching. With television in 96 percent of all American \n     households, this medium does affect the attitudes, the \n     informal education and the behavior of our children. The \n     networks and many other cable producers have resisted \n     voluntary self-regulation to improve programs for children \n     and have not gotten the message that parents are concerned \n     and want a reduction in violent television and an increase in \n     quality, educational and entertaining family programs.\n       According to a 1993 UCLA study by its Department of \n     Communications, TV stations provided an average of 3.4 hours \n     per week (less than one-half hour per day) of regularly \n     scheduled standard length programming for children. That \n     figure is little more than what was broadcast for children in \n     the late 70's. In addition, an assessment by one of our local \n     units, the South Florida Preschool PTA, revealed that less \n     than 1 percent of the broadcast hours on the four local \n     network stations were devoted to educational and \n     informational children's programming. Yet, in a 1990 study, \n     the Annenberg School of Communication found that non-\n     educational programming targeted at children increased. \n     Programming such as the current fare of Saturday morning \n     cartoons, X-Men, the Simpsons and Beavis and Butthead is far \n     from educational and contains some form of violence.\n       The statistics related to a child's exposure to TV violence \n     are indeed alarming. For instance, a November 1991 study by \n     the Annenberg School of Communication showed that the average \n     number of violent acts in one hour of children's television \n     broadcasting was more than 30. This is even more than on \n     prime-time TV which had only 4 acts of violence per hour. A \n     1993 American Psychological Association study showed that the \n     typical child will watch 8,000 murders and more than 100,000 \n     acts of violence before finishing elementary school. By the \n     age of 18, the same teenager will have witnessed 200,000 acts \n     of violence, including 40,000 murders.\n       After 20 years of asking the broadcasters and the industry \n     to respond to parents and children through self-regulation \n     and reduce violence, we believe that it is time for the\n      next step: the passage of the Children's Media Protection \n     Act of 1995 which contains many of the provisions \n     advocated by the National PTA in testimony before the \n     Senate Commerce Committee on October 28, 1993. The bill \n     provides a multi-faceted and comprehensive approach to \n     curbing television violence including the following:\n       1. The requirement that television sets are equipped so \n     that parents have the opportunity to block programming with \n     violent content;\n       [[Page S2039]] 2. In the future, the opportunity for \n     parents to block any television program that they find \n     objectionable for any reason:\n       3. The development of violence rating standards which \n     reflect the input of a broad based group of citizens, \n     including parents;\n       4. Creation of a ``safe harbor'' during the course of each \n     day that prohibits programming containing gratuitous violence \n     during the times that children are most likely to watch \n     television. This is a provision that Attorney General Janet \n     Reno has opined as constitutional;\n       5. Assurance that the FCC will carry out its \n     responsibilities pursuant to the Children's Television Act. \n     Parents want safe schools and safe communities. In fact, \n     working toward violence-free schools and communities is a \n     major program priority for the national PTA. The National PTA \n     certainly recognizes that there are a number of causes \n     related to violence in our society besides violent TV \n     programming. However, the fact still remains that television \n     is more violent than ever before and offers fewer \n     opportunities for education and family viewing. The \n     television industry must assume its share of the \n     responsibility for the violent behavior of children. The \n     Children's Media Protection Act is a health issue, an \n     educational issue and a family values issue. Reduction of TV \n     violence is one of the issues that received a strong \n     bipartisan reaction from both U.S. Senators and U.S. \n     Representatives during President Clinton's State of the Union \n     Address. The National PTA applauds Senator Kent Conrad for \n     introducing this legislation, and requests the immediate \n     passage of this legislation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the NAEYC News, Washington, DC, Feb. 6, 1995]\n\nChildren's Media Protection Act: A responsible Step to support Families \n           and Decrease Children's Exposure to Media Violence\n\n       The National Association for the Education of Young \n     Children (NAEYC) strongly supports Senator Kent Conrad's \n     introduction to the Children's Media Protection Act of 1995. \n     This measure takes several critical steps to reduce \n     children's exposure to media violence and its negative impact \n     on children's development and aggressive behavior. The \n     measure also empowers parents to take advantage of technology \n     that gives them greater control over the television \n     programming available to their children.\n       Of all of the sources and manifestations of violence in \n     children's lives, media violence is perhaps the most easily \n     corrected. This legislation takes steps--long overdue--to \n     decrease the amount and severity of violent acts observed by \n     children through television and to give parents additional \n     control in selecting the programs available to their \n     children.\n       NAEYC believes that each component of the legislation is \n     equally important. The requirement that television sets be \n     equipped with technology that allows parents to block \n     objectionable programming, along with the violence rating \n     code, will provide valuable tools that allow parents greater \n     power in controlling the nature of television programs to \n     which their children are exposed. The children's hour \n     provision to prohibit gratuitous violence on commercial and \n     public television between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 \n     p.m. also takes an important step in decreasing children's \n     viewing of media violence. Finally, stronger enforcement of \n     the Children's Television Act should promote additional \n     choices of television viewing appropriate to children's \n     development and interests.\n       The National Association for the Education of Young \n     Children (NAEYC) is the nation's oldest and largest \n     organization of early childhood professionals and others \n     working to improve the quality of early childhood education \n     services available to young children, birth through age 8, \n     and their families.

Sava, NAESP's \n     executive director. ``The family room television is a more \n     persuasive and pervasive educator than all the teachers in \n     America's classrooms. There's no question that the overdose \n     of media violence American children receive is linked to \n     their increasingly violent behavior,'' he said. ``But more \n     troubling for parents and educators is the fact that the \n     violence children see, hear, and are entertained by makes \n     them insensitive to real violence.''\n       NAESP, which represents 26,000 elementary and middle school \n     principals nationwide, has long been on record in support of \n     strengthening and enforcing guidelines for the Children's \n     Television Act that would improve programming for children \n     and give parents peace of mind. NAESP has repeatedly asked \n     the FCC and Congress to employ a clearer definition of \n     educational programming and require that stations air at \n     least one hour of 30-minute educational shows every day \n     between 7:00 a.m., and 10:00 p.m., when children are \n     watching.\n       NAESP further urges Congress to protect children from media \n     violence by:\n       Developing a violence code, which gives rules for rating \n     the level of violence in television programming;\n       Allowing violent programs to air only between 10:00 and \n     6:00 a.m.; and\n       Requiring manufacturers to install devices on TVs that can \n     be used to block programming.\n       ``Educators want families to have better control over their \n     children's TV viewing.

Conrad's Children's Television Bill\n\n       Washington DC.--The National Coalition on Television \n     Violence (NCTV) supports of Senator Kent Conrad's bill to \n     control the amount of television violence witnessed by \n     children. The Children's Media Protection Act of 1995, \n     introduced by Sen. Conrad (D. ND.) provides a combination of \n     real tools that parents can use to effectively supervise \n     their children's viewing habits and enforcement mechanisms to \n     hold broadcasters accountable for their compliance (or lack \n     of compliance) to existing rules.\n       The industry has consistently used a defensive strategy of \n     tossing the problem back into the laps of parents by claiming \n     a conflict with First Amendment Rights and criticizing \n     parental responsibility. Parents have long been frustrated by \n     their inability to cope with the overwhelming, ever present \n     nature of television.\n       This bill requires broadcasters to provide the public with \n     the information they need to identify objectionable \n     programming, along with the technological tools they need to \n     effectively block it from coming into their homes.\n       The provisions of bill state that:\n       A rating system will be developed to identify programming \n     detrimental to children;\n       Computer technology (which is currently available) that can \n     be used to selectively screen out unwanted programming will \n     be required to be built into new televisions sets; and\n       Broadcaster's license renewal will be contingent on their \n     compliance with the provisions set forth it the Children's \n     Television Act of 1990.\n       Implementation of the Children Television Act of 1990 \n     provides for ``truth in packaging'' for television programs \n     and a ``safe harbor'' of television air time free from \n     gratuitous violence. As any parent knows, even when \n     exercising extreme vigilance over children's viewing, a child \n     appropriate program is often subject to the insertion of \n     promotional messages for just the sort of programs or movies \n     that the parent is trying to avoid. These one minute (or \n     less) interruptions also frequently use the most violent \n     clips from the programs as their promotional message!\n       More than 40 years of research has demonstrated the \n     negative effects of television on children, particularly the \n     links between media violence and aggressive behavior. NCTV \n     commends Sen. Conrad for his willingness to counter the trend \n     of ``feel good legislation with no teeth'' to propose \n     legislation that calls for true accountability from the \n     broadcast media in a genuine move to improve the lives of \n     America's children.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         NASSP, The National Association of Secondary School \n           Principals\n                                     Reston, VA, February 2, 1995.\n     Hon Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The National Association of Secondary \n     School Principals (NASSP) and its 42,000 members commend you \n     for your efforts to protect our children and youth from \n     exposure to violence in television and the media. We join you \n     in seeking passage of the Children's Media Protection act of \n     1995.\n       Our nation is experiencing an unrivaled period of juvenile \n     violent crime perpetrated by youths from all races, social \n     classes, and lifestyles. Without question, the entertainment \n     industry plays a role in fostering this anti-social behavior \n     by promoting instant gratification, glorifying casual sex, \n     and encouraging the use of profanity, nudity, violence, \n     killing, and racial and sexual stereotyping.\n       A national effort to monitor and ultimately decrease \n     violence in television and the entertainment media is vitally \n     important to the well-being and subsequent development of \n     youngsters. Therefore, NASSP joins you in recommending that:\n       Manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, install \n     technology on all television sets to permit parents to block \n     television programming with violent or objectionable program \n     content;\n       The Federal Communication Commission (FCC), in consultation \n     with television broadcasters, cable operators, private \n     interest groups, and concerned citizens, prescribe \n     [[Page S2040]] rules for rating the level of violence in \n     television programming;\n       The FCC grant and renew television operating licenses only \n     after ensuring the applicant is in compliance with the \n     standards for children's programming established under the \n     Children's Television Act of 1990; and\n       Programming containing gratuitous violence be prohibited \n     between the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n       NASSP strongly urges Congress to halt the increasingly \n     senseless portrayals of violence in the entertainment media \n     by supporting this crucial movement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. Timothy J.

Each year, an estimated 50,000 deaths are \n     attributable to violence in the form of homicide and suicide. \n     The United States ranks first among industrialized nations in \n     silent death rates.\n       ``We are a people living in fear. Which of us has not been \n     haunted by dark thoughts we try to ignore: Will my 9-year-old \n     be safe today in her classroom? Could my father be the victim \n     of a drive-by shooting as he walks the dog? Will I be the \n     next car-jacking victim? My sister a victim of domestic \n     violence? No one can disagree: violence in America is out of \n     control.\n       ``Certainly, the root causes of violence are varied and \n     debatable. But over the past two decades, a growing body of \n     scientific evidence has documented the relationship between \n     the mass media and violent behavior. Report after report \n     brings us to the same conclusion: programming shown by the \n     mass media contributes significantly to the aggressive \n     behavior and to the aggression-related attitudes of children, \n     adolescents, and adults.\n       ``It is estimated that by the time children leave \n     elementary school, they have viewed 8,000 killings and more \n     than 100,000 other violent acts. Children learn behavior by \n     example. They have an instinctive desire to imitate actions \n     they observe, without always possessing the intellect or \n     maturity to determine if the actions are appropriate. This \n     principle certainly applies to TV violence. Children's \n     exposure to violence in the mass media can have lifelong \n     consequences.\n       ``We must take strong action now to curb TV violence if we \n     are to have any chance of halting the violent behavior our \n     children learn through watching television.

Compliance \n     with such a rule would be a factor taken into \n     [[Page S2041]] account when the FCC considers renewal of \n     licenses in the case of broadcast TV, and would be enforced \n     by fines in the case of cable TV.\n       Finally, in the event that the television industry refuses \n     to cooperate in the development of such a Code, then we \n     believe that the FCC (in collaboration with Congress) should \n     design and implement appropriate regulations that will \n     withstand judicial scrutiny to protect children under the age \n     of 12 from the demonstrated harm of TV violence.\n\n\n                        2. parental involvement\n\n       We support steps which would work to empower parents to \n     more effectively monitor and control what their young \n     children view on television. These recommendations include--\n       Mechanical/electronic devices installed in television sets \n     or cable boxes that would enable parents to block out \n     television programming (cable or broadcast) that contains \n     ``V''\n      rating. We believe such a device would be more effective \n     than present lockout devices (devices that can lock out a \n     particular channel or program) which presupposes parental \n     participation in the selection of programming, which is \n     not the case in so many of our nation's homes.\n       Viewer warnings. Audio and visual warnings of programming \n     containing gratuitous dramatized violence between 6:00 a.m. \n     and 10 p.m. would be telecast before the program and at each \n     commercial break until 10:00 p.m. Superimposed warnings would \n     be displayed continuously during programming containing \n     gratuitous violence.\n       Violence Rating System. We support the development (by The \n     Action Task Group referred to above) and implementation of a \n     rating system that would classify programs on the basis of \n     their violent content and that such ratings be made available \n     to parents through TV guides, listings, etc. We suggest that \n     such ratings would, in the first instance, be assigned by the \n     programmers themselves, and that only in the event of a \n     breach of their good faith responsibility to assign proper \n     ratings, would the FCC become involved.\n\n\n                            3. fcc hearings\n\n       We support and urge that the FCC hold hearings on the issue \n     of television violence, most particularly on proposed \n     voluntary and regulatory solutions to some, in several forums \n     around the country. From these hearings the FCC would hone a \n     definition of ``television violence'' as well as gather the \n     necessary data to support the Code and the basis of any \n     regulations that become part of the Code.\n\n\n                      4. children's television act\n\n       We support and urge that the FCC continue with the \n     initiative to strengthen and enforce the FCC's rules \n     promulgated in implementing the Children's Television Act, in \n     order that beneficial programming for children be increased \n     to provide a real alternative to television violence. We also \n     urge that such programming include materials to educate and \n     inform children about the effects of violence and media \n     violence in particular. In addition, we recommend public \n     service announcements to educate viewers about the effects of \n     violence generally, and media violence in particular.\n\n\n          5. viewing violent television programming in prisons\n\n       We suggest that one step that could be taken immediately on \n     the issue of television violence and its adverse effect on \n     our society would be to end the availability of violent TV \n     programs in prisons.\n\n\n                 6. white house conference on violence\n\n       We strongly support the initiative of convening a White \n     House Conference on Violence that would focus on the causes \n     of our epidemic of violence, including media violence. At the \n     session on media violence, there would be included, in \n     addition to the representatives of the television, cable and \n     motion picture industries, the approximately 100 major \n     advertisers on television. We believe that a well-designed \n     initiative of consciousness-raising specifically aimed at \n     these advertisers would be effective in reducing gratuitous \n     violence on television.\n\n\n           7. continuation of television industry discussion\n\n       Since many of the above recommendations and initiatives \n     require the joint cooperation and collaboration of the TV \n     industry, we support the extension of the current antitrust \n     exemption as provided under the Television Program \n     Improvement Act--Public Law 101-650, to permit the \n     continuation of television industry discussions.\n                                 ______\n\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Lott):\n\n  S. 333. A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to institute certain \nprocedures in the performance of risk assessments in connection with \nenvironmental restoration activities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me acknowledge my colleague, \nSenator Lott, who has spoken on the necessity of the legislation which \nwe are introducing today, the Department of Energy Risk Management Act \nof 1995.\n  I am very pleased to rise today to introduce the Department of Energy \nRisk Management Act of 1995 for myself, Senator Johnston, and Senator \nLott. Congress needs to require agencies to use sound science, risk \nassessment, and cost-benefit analysis in the regulatory decision-making \nprocess.\n  So often, as you know, Mr. President, decisions are made on the basis \nof emotion. The group that speaks the loudest, has the most numbers, or \nmakes the most outlandish statements influences the decision, instead \nof decisions being made on sound science. If we cannot depend on \nscientists who spend a portion of their lives becoming experts on a \nparticular subject, we certainly cannot depend on the short span of \nattention that we have as politicians as we attempt to evaluate the \nmerits of some very difficult and sophisticated subjects.\n  One of the difficulties, of course, is to get the scientific \ncommunity to step forward and put their reputation on the line behind, \nif you will, their recommendations. So often, we find a situation where \nthe scientists say, ``Well, if I had another appropriation, I could \nstudy that a little bit more and probably give you a little more \ndefinitive answer.'' Decisions have to be made every day. You and I, \nMr. President, have to vote up and down. We cannot vote maybe. We have \nto make some decisions. With the regulatory process that has run amuck \nin this country today these decisions are not being made competently \nand are not being made on the basis of the best information available. \nWe cannot seem to get the scientific community to bear the \nresponsibility for their advice to those of us who have to vote yes or \nno.\n  What are we really talking about? This is not a complicated concept. \nThis is risk analysis, cost benefit, and every time you pick up a can \nof soup or you go buy some crackers it tells you if you have fat soup, \nskinny soup, or crackers with sodium in them. But with risk assessment \nand cost-benefit\n analysis in the application of a permit by the Environmental \nProtection Agency and various other agencies, you do not know what the \ncost is. You do not know what the benefit is. You do not know what the \nrisk is.\n\n  So this legislation would simply mandate that the public have \nawareness when the administrative agencies come down with their \nevaluation of the permitting process as to what the risk is and what \nthe cost is. It is perfectly reasonable. Yet there is a tremendous \nconcern out there among America's environmental community that somehow \nthis will dismantle our environmental laws. What an outlandish \ngeneralization.\n  So I think, Mr. President, we need to require the agencies to use \nsound science, risk assessment, and cost-benefit analysis in the \nregulatory decisionmaking process. This legislation applies to \nenvironmental restoration activities conducted by the Department of \nEnergy [DOE]. Although the scope of this bill applies to DOE cleanups, \nwe hope to have the risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis debate \ncover all agencies' activities. We are coordinating our legislative \neffort with other legislative efforts.\n  In the last Congress Senator Johnston offered an amendment to the EPA \nCabinet level bill in the spring of 1993. At the same time the Johnston \namendment was adopted, I offered an amendment requiring cost-benefit \nanalysis that was agreed to by the Senate. I have continued to look for \nways to improve and refine our regulatory decisionmaking process. \nSenator Lott also introduced legislation last Congress that is \nincorporated into our bill. Since the last Congress, the momentum for \nrisk assessment/cost-benefit analysis has only intensified and the \nNovember elections have brought about renewed interest in advancing \nrisk assessment/cost-benefit analysis legislation.\n  I hope the agencies out there got the message of what the last \nelection suggested, that the process was out of balance, and it needed \ncorrecting.\n  On January 17, I hosted, along with Senator Lott, Representative \nCrapo, and Representative Karen Thurmond, the first meeting of a \nbipartisan, bicameral Regulatory Reform Caucus now made up of 35 \nRepresentatives and some 12 Senators. The caucus wants a proactive \nstrategy to require agencies to use sound science, risk assessment, and \ncost-benefit analysis in the regulatory decisionmaking process.\n  [[Page S2042]] At that meeting we heard from two excellent speakers. \nJohn Stossel of ABC News spoke persuasively about how the public's \nperception of environmental and health risks affects our overregulation \nof those risks. Mr. Stossel showed a chart that broke down how much \ngiven risks shorten the average life. It is interesting to note that we \nspend billions of dollars regulating toxic waste sites and there are \nlots of news stories about places, like Love Canal. But, even based on \nthe most extreme estimates provided by environmental organizations \ntoxic wastes are calculated to shorten the average life by just 4 days. \nOther risks shorten the average life span by years, yet we do not \nregulate them.\n  Dr. John Graham, Director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, \ngave an objective view of how government overregulates our lives and \nbusinesses. I was particularly impressed with Dr. Graham's point that \nover 80 percent of Americans favor better risk analysis in \nenvironmental policy. And, as Dr. Graham has indicated, risk and cost-\nbenefit analysis is the key to sound environmental policy of the \nfuture. In fact, I think it is fair to say that incorporation of sound \nscience, detailed and well communicated assessments, cost-benefit \nanalysis, and the prioritizing of our limited resources is the \nenvironmental policy of the future. It is a commonsense policy that is \nhere to stay.\n  American businesses spend more than $150 billion annually just to \ncomply with environmental laws--costs that increasingly strain U.S. \ncompetitiveness. Risk-based regulations rely on worst-case scenarios \nand ignore the best science, producing elaborate, expensive regulation \nof unimportant problems.\n  Imagine, Mr. President, if we relied on a worst-case scenario. We \nwould not walk outside. We would not be in this building. Worst case \nmeans the worst possible case, whether it be flood, earthquake, you \nname it.\n  So risk-based scenarios really are scenarios that ignore best science \ncontrary to the real world. As a result, the Federal Government is \nforcing the expenditure of billions of dollars by local government and \nindustry on these excessively hypothetical and exaggerated perceptions \nof risks.\n  The intent of the policy of incorporating risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit analysis into the decisionmaking process is to ensure better, \nmore cost-effective regulations and decisions over the long term. \nAgain, it is the smart way to make sure we get the most value for our \nlimited Government resources, especially in a time where the American \npublic is unequivocally demanding a smaller Federal bureaucracy and \nless Government control of their lives.\n  A couple of examples, Mr. President, to liven up the morning. I am \ntold that a Kansas City bank was ordered by Federal regulators to put a \nbraille keypad on drive-through ATM, automatic teller machines.\n  A little food for thought. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in \nanother case, required California farmers to dispose of millions of \npounds of otherwise good peaches and nectarines simply because they \nwere smaller than Federal standards permitted. Fruit that could have \nbeen given away to the needy had to be left to rot.\n  In Boise, ID, a plumbing contractor was penalized by OSHA because \nproper safety precautions were not taken by the employees, who \nsuccessfully rescued a suffocating construction worker from a collapsed \ntrench. The $7,785 fine was rescinded due to public outrage. Can you \nimagine that?\n  A self-employed truck mechanic in Morrisville, PA, was fined $2,200 \nand sentenced to 3 years in jail for hauling away 7,000 old tires and \nrusting cars and placing clean fill on his own occasionally wet \nproperty without a Federal permit, because it was classified as a \n``wetlands.'' The EPA argued the property was wetlands because of a \nstream--dry for most of the year--was partially trapped by the \ndiscarded junk and created several pools of water.\n  I could go on and on with those horror stories, Mr. President, but I \nknow you are familiar with them as well.\n  Finally, the legislation Senator Lott, Senator Johnston, and I have \nput together on risk assessment/cost-benefit would accomplish several \nimportant goals.\n  First, the legislation establishes clear principles to be followed by \nthe Department of Energy. It does not set up a new bureaucracy, but it \nrequires specifics when it performs risk assessments, and they include \nthe consideration and discussion of data that may or may not \nspecifically point to a health risk; precise guidelines for the use of \nassumptions to bridge some of the data gaps; and most importantly, \nassessments that are objective and unbiased.\n  Second, the bill establishes principles for risk characterization \nthat will allow for better understanding and communication, so the \npublic can read what the risk is, like\n they can read the risk if they want fat soup or skinny crackers, \nbecause it is on there. DOE must issue a final regulation implementing \nthe risk assessment and risk characterization principles. DOE must \ndevelop a plan to review and revise early risk assessments, which shall \ninclude a process by which members of the public may petition the DOE \nfor review of particular risk assessments.\n\n  In addition to establishing a risk assessment procedural framework, \nthe bill would also require the Department to apply the results of \nthose assessments in significant ways that will ensure safer, more \nefficient and more cost-effective cleanup. Any plan, assessment, or \nrecord of decision to conduct an environmental restoration activity \nmust go through a cost-benefit analysis. The Secretary is going to have \nto certify that the analysis is based upon the best reasonable \ninformation; the analysis is objective and unbiased; the environmental \nrestoration activity significantly reduces the targeted risk; no \nalternative environmental restoration activity is more cost-effective; \nand the environmental restoration activity is likely to reduce benefits \nthat justify its cost. The Department must prioritize resources to \naddress the most serious and most cost-effective risks first.\n  We intend to expand the scope of this legislation to apply to \nregulations and all agencies, to provide for an independent and \nexternal peer review process.\n  I do not want to complicate this with a lot of words. We are simply \nasking for a process that the public can understand and it is almost \nlike truth-in-lending, which has never been applicable to the \nregulatory process. That is what we propose in this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time to have printed in the Record \nsome of the risk comparisons that help to illustrate the importance of \nhaving comparative risks available to the public, and an article \nentitled ``Unloading Excess Regulations,'' by Murray Weidenbaum, which \nappeared in the Journal of Commerce on January 27, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          WHY WE HAVE TO CHOOSE WHICH RISKS ARE WORTH REDUCING          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Cost per death  \n                      Activity                             averted      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES                                    \n                                                                        \nDiphtheria immunization (Gambia)...................                  $87\nMalaria prevention (Africa)........................                  440\nMeasles immunization (Ivory Coast).................                  850\nImproved health care...............................                1,930\nImproved water sanitation..........................                4,030\nDietary supplements................................                5,300\n                                                                        \n          UNITED STATES, NON-ENVIRONMENTAL                              \n                                                                        \nImproved traffic signs.............................               31,000\nCervical cancer screening..........................               50,000\nImproved lighting..................................               80,000\nUpgrade guard rails................................              101,000\nMobile intensive care units........................              120,000\nBreakaway sign supports............................              125,000\nLung cancer screening..............................              140,000\nBreast cancer screening............................              160,000\n                                                                        \n      UNITED STATES, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS                          \n                                                                        \nAsbestos ban.......................................          110,700,000\nBenzene NESHAP (revised waste operations)..........          168,200,000\n1,2 dichloropropane drinking water standard........          653,000,000\nHazardous waste land disposal ban (1st 3rd)........        4,190,400,000\nMunicipal landfill standards (1988 proposed).......       19,107,000,000\nFormaldehyde occupational exposure limit #2........       86,201,800,000\nAtrazine/alachlor drinking water standard..........       92,069,700,000\nHazardous waste listing for wood-preserving                             \n chemicals.........................................    5,700,000,000,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSources: Bernard L.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nwith Senator Gorton, Senator Bryan, and others to repeal the commercial \naviation fuel tax, and I am proud that this is the first piece of \nlegislation I am introducing as a U.S. Senator. As I traveled \nthroughout all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties this past year, it was \nclear that the threat to jobs and industry from this upcoming tax \nrequired immediate attention. In keeping with my promise to \nPennsylvanians, I am confident that this will remove an obstacle to the \nrecovery of an industry critical to Pennsylvania's economy.\n  This tax, which will take effect on October 1, 1995, will force the \ntroubled airline industry to assume another massive financial burden. \nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 imposed a new 4.3 cents \nper gallon tax on commercial aviation fuel. At the time, the airline \nindustry was experiencing deep financial difficulties, so the act \ngranted a 2-year waiver on the imposition of this tax. Clearly, the \nindustry has yet to recover, and a tax costing $527 million annually \nwill have a devastating effect on service providers, airline \nmanufacturers, and other related employers. More layoffs, increased \nticket prices, and greater deterioration of consumer confidence in our \nNation's airlines is not the goal of a responsible Congress.\n  Historically, the airline industry has been assessed excise and cargo \ntaxes in lieu of a fuel tax. These alternate taxes amount to $5.4 \nbillion annually. In addition, since 1990, the industry has lost $12.8 \nbillion, nearly 120,000 employees have lost their jobs, and tens of \nthousands of airline manufacturing employees have been laid off. For a \ntroubled industry which pays more than its fair share of taxes, I \nbelieve it is our responsibility to repeal this excessive and \npotentially destructive tax.\n  Last Autumn, 59 Senators and 4 future Senators, myself included, \nwrote to President Clinton seeking relief from this tax. This Congress, \nI am proud to report a groundswell of support amongst Republicans and \nDemocrats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. I hope \nthis support continues unabated as we proceed to final passage of a \nrepeal which is needed and in the best interests of our Nation's \nairline laborers, service employees, and the industry as a whole.\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSantorum, Senator Bryan, and others in introducing a bill to repeal the \nfuel tax on commercial aviation. The effect of this bill will be simply \nto disallow the 4.3 cents per gallon fuel tax from going into effect on \nOctober 1, 1995. Two years ago, Congress correctly recognized that the \nairlines had undergone tremendous financial difficulties and that \nimposing another new tax upon this beleaguered industry made no sense--\nthis remains true today.\n  The airline industry has lost approximately $12 billion in the last 4 \nyears. The industry is aggressively trying to turn this picture around \nand is just now beginning to show some signs of success. In the last \nseveral years, the industry has had to resort to massive layoffs, wage \nand benefit concessions, route reductions, and substantial cuts in \ncapital spending. Six of the largest airlines have caneled or deferred \norders for 647 aircraft totaling $38 billion. Tens of thousands of \nairline and aircraft manufacturing employees have lost their jobs. \nBoeing's employment alone has dropped by 43,000 in the last 5 years due \nto a substantial decline in both the commercial and the defense \nbusiness. Three major air carriers--United, Northwest, and TWA--have \ntransferred substantial amounts of ownership to company employees in \nexchange for wage and benefit concessions.\n  In order to meet stage 3 aircraft noise requirements, it is estimated \nthat the industry will spend $7 to $8 billion a year during the \nremainder of this decade. The industry cannot afford to add an \nadditional $527 million a year in new taxes--this on top of the many \ntaxes it is already paying. Most people, I believe, would be shocked to \nlearn that the industry pays over $5.4 billion annually in excise taxes \nand fees, the equivalent to a 45.82 cents per gallon fuel tax.\n  Last year I was proud to serve on the National Airline Commission. In \nour report, we discussed the proposed fuel tax and other burdensome \ntaxes placed upon the industry. It was our collective conclusion that, \n``there are several tax provisions that impede the ability of the \nindustry to return to financial \n[[Page S2071]] health. We believe those provisions violate reasonable \nprinciples of common sense and good public policy.'' I hope the \nCongress will join with us in rejecting burdensome new taxes on this \nimportant industry and will support the enactment of this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S2070-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2071-S2072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     PUERTO RICO'S COLONIAL DILEMMA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, representing Puerto Rico in the \nHouse of Representatives is Carlos Romero-Barcelo, the former Governor \nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n  I have worked with him through the years and have come to have great \nrespect for him.\n  One of his passions is that Puerto Rican citizens not be second-class \ncitizens but have all the rights that the rest of us, as Americans, \nhave.\n  I share that passion with him.\n  The blatant inconsistency of the way we treat people in Puerto Rico \nshould be on the consciences of those of us who serve in the House and \nthe Senate.\n  Recently, Representative Romero-Barcelo sent a ``Dear Colleague'' to \nthe Members of the House and enclosed an item of his that was published \nin the Washington Times about Puerto Rico.\n  I ask to insert that at the end of these remarks and urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House to listen to his powerful \nmessage.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 1995.\n     Re Puerto Rico's colonial dilemma.\n\n       Dear Colleague: On December 15, 1994, I wrote a column--a \n     copy is provided on the reverse side--published in the \n     Washington Times in which I discussed Puerto Rico's colonial \n     dilemma and the unequal treatment of U.S. citizens in Puerto \n     Rico.\n       For the past 97 years, Puerto Rico has been and still is a \n     territory, or a colony, of the United States. The Island is \n     home to 3.7 million American citizens who are disenfranchised \n     and deprived of participating in the democratic process of \n     the Nation. This disenfranchisement has been justified by a \n     policy, created and maintained by Congress, which frees \n     residents of Puerto Rico from paying Federal personal and \n     corporate income taxes. Puerto Rico's residents do, however, \n     pay most all other Federal taxes and user fees. In addition, \n     this exemption from Federal income taxes has justified the \n     exclusion of the island's residents in critical Federal \n     programs such as Supplement Security Income [SSI].\n       Moreover, through section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, \n     the Federal Government has exempted subsidiaries of multi-\n     national corporations in Puerto Rico from Federal corporate \n     taxes. Section 936 has resulted in a socio-economic policy \n     for Puerto Rico that is exactly opposite of the socio-\n     economic policy of the rest of the Nation. While wealthy \n     corporations in Puerto Rico are given billions of dollars in \n     annual tax credits, the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and \n     children at risk are denied the same safety net and economic \n     opportunities that their follow citizens receive in the 50 \n     States and the District of Columbia.\n       Like the District, Puerto Rico has no voting representation \n     in Congress, yet its residents are also denied the right to \n     vote in the Presidential elections. This is significant \n     because the President is our top elected official and the one \n     who makes daily policy decisions that affect all citizens, \n     including those in Puerto Rico.\n       We preach the virtues of democracy throughout the world. \n     Nevertheless, the United States still maintains the largest \n     colony in the world--Puerto Rico--home to 3.7 million \n     disenfranchised American citizens that are excluded from the \n     democratic process of their Nation.\n       American citizens in Puerto Rico should not be denied full \n     participation in our great democratic experience. Residents \n     of the island should share in equality with their fellow \n     citizens in the 50 States, not only in the rights and \n     benefits protected by the U.S. Constitution but in the \n     responsibilities and duties as well.\n       I urge you to read my column which sheds more light on \n     Puerto Rico's colonial dilemma and the unequal and unfair \n     treatment which our people receive as a result of the \n     existing colonial relationship.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carlos Romero-Barcelo.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Dec. 15, 1994]\n\n                The Case for Puerto Rico's Voting Rights\n\n                       (By Carlos Romero-Barcelo)\n       Regarding your Dec. 6 editorial ``Taxation, representation \n     and the District'': As Puerto Rico's only elected \n     representative to Congress, I am, keenly aware of the \n     limitations faced by the five delegates in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Since the early 1970s we have been able to vote in the \n     House committees on which we serve. This important authority \n     was secured by the Puerto Rican delegate of the time, Jorge \n     Luis Cordova-Diaz. In 1993, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton \n     did indeed actively seek and obtain the right to vote in the \n     Committee of the Whole for herself and the other four \n     delegates. Although this was merely symbolic, we nevertheless \n     welcomed the opportunity for added participation in House \n     proceedings.\n       With respect to the distinction you make between the \n     District's representative and the other delegates on the \n     basis of federal taxation in our respective districts, I \n     differ with your analysis, at least in the case of Puerto \n     Rico.\n       First, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory since 1898, is home to \n     3.7 million American citizens, who are disenfranchised and \n     deprived of participating in the democratic process of their \n     nation. Federal personal income taxes are not levied on \n     residents of the island, not because we don't want to pay \n     them, but because Congress has maintained this policy since \n     income taxes were first imputed in order to justify our \n     disenfranchisement. Nevertheless, most other federal taxes \n     and user fees are indeed applicable in Puerto Rico (e.g., \n     Social Security taxes, unemployment taxes, Medicare taxes, \n     customs duties, certain excise taxes and even income taxes on \n     income derived outside of Puerto Rico). In fact, the U.S. \n     Treasury collected from Puerto Rico $2.5 billion during 1993 \n     (source Advanced Draft, IRS Commissioner's Report, 1993).\n       The congressional policy of not extending federal income \n     taxes to the island has also been used as an excuse for not \n     granting equal treatment in federal programs to U.S. citizens \n     in Puerto Rico. For example, the Supplemental Security Income \n     (SSI) program is not applicable to otherwise eligible U.S. \n     citizens in Puerto Rico. Other critical programs such as \n     Chapter I education funds, Medicaid, Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children and the Nutritional Assistance program are\n      severely capped. Medicaid is capped at approximately 10 \n     percent of what we would get if we were treated on an \n     equal basis.\n       Moreover, Congress and successive administrations have put \n     in effect a tax and economic policy that has a ``reverse \n     Robin Hood effect.'' The federal government, for instance, \n     has opted to exempt subsidiaries of U.S. corporations in \n     Puerto Rico from federal corporate taxes through Section 936 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code. The 936 tax credit has cost \n     U.S. taxpayers $50 billion in the past two decades. According \n     to the latest estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, \n     Section 936 will cost the federal government $19.7 billion in \n     the next five years. Congress has maintained, through Section \n     936, a tax policy that results in a socioeconomic policy for \n     Puerto Rico that is exactly the opposite of the socioeconomic \n     policy for the nation. While wealthy multinational \n     corporations are given billions of dollars in annual tax \n     credits (corporate welfare), hundreds of thousands of poor \n     families the disabled, the elderly, and children are denied \n     the same safety net and financial and economic support that \n     their fellow citizens receive in the 50 states and the \n     District of Columbia.\n       The public and the national media have the false impression \n     that citizens in Puerto Rico do not pay any income taxes. \n     Nothing could be further from the truth. People in Puerto \n     Rico have indeed a very high local tax burden. Personal \n     income taxes in Puerto Rico are generally higher than \n     anywhere else in the United States, including jurisdictions \n     where people pay local/state and federal income taxes.\n       Thus, it is the middle class, the working poor, the \n     indigent, the elderly and the children who suffer the \n     detrimental consequences of a federal taxation policy that \n     makes no sense in Puerto Rico, we do not set the rules; \n     Congress does I must reiterate that, just as in the case of \n     the District, Congress has absolute power over the affairs of \n     Puerto Rico. And just like the District, we have our version \n     of ``home rule,'' inappropriately referred to as \n     ``commonwealth.'' Make no mistake about it, Puerto Rico was \n     and continues to be, de facto and de jure, a territory or \n     colony of the United States.\n       Second, although residents of the District, like their \n     counterparts in\n      Puerto Rico, have no voting representation in Congress, at \n     least they are able to vote in presidential elections. \n     This is significant because the president is our top \n     elected official and the one who makes the daily policy \n     decisions that affect all citizens, including the ones in \n     Puerto Rico. All U.S. citizens, including those abroad, \n     are able to vote for the president, except those who make \n     Puerto Rico and the other territories their home. People \n     in Puerto Rico have no input in the election of the \n     nation's commander in chief, notwithstanding the fact that \n     they are subject to all federal laws and policies.\n       Thousands of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico have paid the \n     ultimate price and have died defending our shared democratic \n     values. In our armed forces, more Puerto Ricans have died in \n     armed conflicts during this century than citizens of any \n     other state (on a per capita basis).\n       As mayor and governor, I have denounced federal tax policy \n     toward Puerto Rico that benefits most those who are wealthy \n     and penalizes the poor, the elderly, the children and the \n     working class. I urge federal policy-makers to take steps to \n     extend full and equal economic benefits and responsibilities \n     to Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans and all U.S. taxpayers will \n     benefit from uniform and sensible application of our fiscal \n     laws and our socioeconomic policies.\n        [[Page S2072]] Finally, I have always maintained that we \n     want to share in equality with our fellow citizens in the 50 \n     states, not only in the rights and benefits but in the \n     responsibilities and duties as well. At least in the District \n     of Columbia citizens are partially enfranchised with \n     political power. Not so the 3.7 million U.S. citizens of \n     Puerto Rico. Political power is the ultimate form of \n     liberation.\n       It is ironic indeed that the virtues of democracy are being \n     highlighted during the Summit of the Americans while our \n     nation denies 3.7 million citizens the right to participate \n     in the democratic process. During the 1990s, the U.N. decade \n     of decolonization, the United States must face the \n     implications and repercussions of maintaining a colonial \n     relationship with its territories.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S2071-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2072-S2074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       REMARKS OF OSBORN ELLIOTT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on January 12 the chairman of the \nCitizens Committee for New York City, Osborn Elliott, gave a thought-\nprovoking speech on the role of journalism in public life. Mr. Elliott \nis the former dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism, and \nhis remarks, which were made at the Key West Literary Seminar, deserve \nthe attention of the Senate. Accordingly, I ask that the speech be \nincluded in the Record.\n\n                   Time for the Press to Get Involved\n\n            (John Hersey Memorial Lecture by Osborn Elliott)\n\n       I'd like to tell you this evening about a love affair that \n     is on the rocks.\n       The romance began a long time ago. It started as a \n     schoolboy's infatuation, went roiling lustily through the \n     pubescent years, and ultimately flowered into a deep and \n     sustaining passion. There were ups and downs along the way, \n     just as there are in any relationship. But the bonds grew \n     stronger as the decades passed.\n       Now the affair is on the rocks, and I'm going to tell you \n     why.\n       My romance with journalism began sixty years ago, when I \n     was a little boy. On my way home from school one day, I \n     stopped in at Mr. Rappaport's stationery store at 62nd Street \n     and Third Avenue, to buy a Christmas card. In the back of his \n     shop Mr. Rappaport kept an ancient press surrounded by wooden \n     cases of type. He invited me to watch as he plucked letters \n     from a font, handset his type, then put the great, hissing, \n     clanking press into motion. Somehow, amid the aromatic chaos \n     of printer's ink and noise, pristine sheets of stationery \n     came flying out of that old machine.\n       To be young at Mr. Rappaport's was very heaven. It was the \n     beginning of the affair.\n       Before you could say Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, I had acquired \n     a toy typewriter, and was banging out my own newspaper, The \n     Weekly Eagle, shamelessly plagiarizing Lindbergh kidnaping \n     stories from the New York Daily News. I made three carbon \n     copies of my paper so that circulation (at a nickel a copy) \n     could extend beyond my parents to my brother and the woman \n     who took care of me when my mother and father were at work. \n     The weekly Eagle lasted three weeks, and its circulation \n     never exceeded a total of four (unaudited).\n       After that came the thrill of working on my school \n     magazine, and savoring that magical moment when copies would \n     arrive from the printer, tightly wrapped in brown paper \n     bundles. I would rip open the neat packages and wonder at how \n     my henscratches had been miraculously converted into \n     beautiful columns of type, marching down the page.\n       Later, in the Navy, it fell my lot to edit my ship's paper \n     and to deliver the nightly news over the public-address \n     system. And it was while I was still in the Navy, in the \n     winter of 1945, that I had my first brush with big-time \n     journalism. I was home on leave from Admiral Halsey's fleet \n     in the Pacific and my parents had invited Charles Merz, \n     editorial page editor of The New York Times, to dinner one \n     night. Before we went in\n      to eat, Charlie Merz picked up the phone and called the \n     Times.\n       ``Anything new from Halsey?'' he inquired as I listened, \n     goggle-eyed. Later that evening, Merz took us on a tour of \n     the Times, through the newsroom and down to the typesetting \n     room where the gangly linotype machines hissed and clanked, \n     much like Mr. Rappaport's press. Then to the composing room, \n     where pages were laid out and the type was locked up. And \n     finally, to the pressroom, where everyone seemed to be \n     nervously eyeing a large clock on the wall. As the sweep \n     secondhand made its way around the face of the clock, Charlie \n     Merz stepped up to the press. At 11 p.m. on the dot he raised \n     his arm and he flicked an impressive red switch labeled \n     START.\n       Slowly, the huge press began to turn, then faster and \n     faster and soon the place was roaring rhythmically as bundles \n     of the next day's Times came thumping onto the loading dock \n     below.\n       From that moment on, I was hooked--and for the better part \n     of half a century my romance with journalism paid huge \n     rewards. Struggling to learn the basics as a young business \n     reporter, I came to realize that even the most esoteric topic \n     can be of interest once you get to know something about it--\n     even the workings of the non-ferrous metals market, my very \n     first beat for the New York Journal of Commerce.\n       Journalism gave me the most amazing access to people and \n     events. I had interviews with half a dozen presidents, \n     audiences with two Popes and the emperor of Japan. I traveled \n     through Africa, Europe, Asia and Russia--and spent the most \n     interesting week in my life living, and learning, in the \n     black ghettos of America.\n       I was nattered at by Nasser, charmed by Giscard, irritated \n     by Indira, jollied up by JFK, lambasted by LBJ and nit-picked \n     by Nixon. I fell in love (unrequited) with the likes of \n     Sills, Bacall and Ullman. I called Leonard ``Lenny,'' Lauren \n     ``Betty,'' Henry ``Henry'' and Teddy ``Ted.''\n       Who wouldn't be seduced by all that? My romance flourished.\n       But for all the fun and games, there was seriousness of \n     purpose that underlay most of the journalism that was \n     practiced in those years--a belief that what we journalists \n     did was important, that journalism could play a constructive \n     role in exposing, confronting and thus helping to solve the \n     great problems of the day.\n       Sometimes our work was agonizing, as when we wrestled week \n     in and week out with the contradictions of Vietnam, trying to \n     reconcile the conflicting reports we were getting from \n     Washington and from the field. Sometimes our work was \n     exhilarating, as when we produced a special issue of Newsweek \n     on Black America, complete with recommendations on how the \n     nation might begin to ease its racial dilemma. And sometimes \n     our work was ineffably sad, as when we deployed our forces to \n     cover the assassination of first one Kennedy and then \n     another, and the killing of Martin Luther King.\n       I tell you all this not because my experience was unique, \n     but because it was so typical. As great issues unfolded, we \n     journalists did our best to understand and explain them to \n     our readers, listeners and viewers. We did not much question \n     the motives of public figures--except when there was a clear \n     attempt to mislead, as in the Watergate disaster. We did not \n     dwell obsessively on process, preferring instead to deal in \n     substance. We did not poke through the garbage of people in \n     the public eye.\n       I think we played a central role, and a positive one, in \n     helping a democratic system thrash its way through trauma \n     after trauma and toward something approaching consensus.\n       Thus did my romance with journalism ripen and mature.\n       It's hard to pinpoint exactly when the relationship began \n     to crumble, but\n      crumble it did. It's even harder to explain why. So many \n     factors were at work.\n       For one thing, I changed careers and moved into public \n     service as a deputy mayor of New York City, and for the first \n     time I had a view of journalism from the other side of the \n     editor's desk. While I personally was treated well by the \n     press, I found my old trade to be quixotic, unfocused, \n     inaccurate and too often the prisoner of preconceptions. The \n     assumption, for example, that anyone working for city \n     government was, ipso facto, an incompetent drone--while I was \n     learning that great numbers of city workers were actually \n     dedicated and hard-working folk.\n       I also became aware of a failure of will within my old \n     trade.\n       Strangely enough, no sooner had the power of journalism \n     reached its zenith than editors began to back off from the \n     fray. Having helped to topple one president--Nixon--and \n     having derided another--Ford--and having snickered at a \n     third--Carter--as he succumbed to a killer rabbit and other \n     forces of evil, journalists found themselves uncomfortably \n     close to the center of things and more and more being blamed \n     when the business of the Nation seemed to be going wrong. So \n     when yet another president--Reagan--took office with \n     popularity ratings in the high seventies and eighties, some \n     kind of unspoken decision was made to lay off.\n       I think journalism has a lot to account for as a result of \n     this failure of will. By allowing a kind of social \n     Darwinism--a.k.a. Reaganism--to go mostly unchallenged on the \n     one hand, and by failing on the other hand to adequately \n     expose the inane contradictions of supply-side theories, \n     a.k.a. Reaganomics, I believe journalism deserves some of the \n     blame for ills that now afflict us. I think journalism is \n     also in part responsible for a default of the national spirit \n     that recently has allowed a meanness to spread through the \n     land.\n       What caused journalism to abdicate its responsibility in \n     the eighties? Was it a function of exhaustion? Of fear? Of \n     simple distraction? Probably a measure of each.\n       After the turmoil of the Sixties, the strains of Vietnam, \n     the shock of assassinations, the tensions of the Cold War and \n     the treacheries of Watergate, who wouldn't be tired?\n       And as readership began to shrink, and advertising dollars \n     disappeared, who wouldn't be afraid to challenge the most \n     popular President in memory?\n       Certainly there were distractions aplenty, as well. A kind \n     of Gresham's law--or was it Murdoch's?--saw bad journalism \n     chasing out the good in the scramble for ratings and \n     readership. On the morning news, a new breed of elbow-in-the-\n     ribs performers took over the airwaves. In the afternoon and \n     evening, the Rush Limbaughs and Bob Grants and other big \n     mouths of the far right took over talk radio.\n       Meanwhile, in America's videocracy the talk shows stooped \n     to conquer the ratings as Maury and Montel and Sally Jessie \n     and Phil and Geraldo engaged in mortal combat over who could \n     produce the most shock or \n     [[Page S2073]] schlock. Last Sunday night, ``CNN Presents'' \n     devoted an hour to deploring what is called ``The Media \n     Circus'' and its obsession with the O.J. Simpson trial in \n     particular. At the end of the hour, Judy Woodruff announced \n     the topic for next Sunday's ``CNN Presents.'' You guessed it, \n     O.J. Simpson.\n       Meanwhile, other Sabbath fare is offered weekly by Morton \n     and Sam and Eleanor and others of God's little wiseacres as \n     they yell their opinions at one another. The jeering \n     jabberers of journalism, my most unfavorite vice president \n     might have called them.\n       All these trivial pursuits left their tracks on mainstream \n     journalism, as well. Newspapers and magazines began to \n     gibletize their contents, in imitation of U.S.A. Today. There \n     were weeks when the assorted short subjects that fill the \n     opening sections of Time magazine ran on so endlessly that \n     few stayed around for the feature. And more and more the \n     pressure grew to produce stories with an attitude, an edge, a \n     spin, a barb. After all, by the time a piece appeared in \n     print, hadn't everyone already seen it on television?\n       So zap it up, guys!\n       A small but telling case in point appeared not long ago on \n     the front page of the New York Times, a story about President \n     Clinton's visit to Oxford. The president, reported the Times, \n     ``returned today for a sentimental journey to the university \n     where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted, and didn't get a \n     degree.''\n       Zap!\n       Having withdrawn from the field in the eighties, it \n     appeared that journalists were returning to the fray in the \n     nineties--with a vengeance, and with a chip on the shoulder. \n     In the cynical new journalism that resulted, it seemed there \n     was an unkind cut for almost anyone in public office, and \n     little sense that any public policy was much worth pursuing. \n     A recent New Yorker piece by Adam Gopnik used these terms, \n     among others, to describe the new curled-lip school of \n     journalism: malicious, self-righteous, mean, shameless, \n     sanctimonious, belligerent, aggressive, disingenuous, nasty.\n       We're not all that way, thank goodness. In her eloquent \n     farewell column in the Times, Anna Quindlen said that twenty \n     years in the news business had left her not more cynical but \n     more idealistic--and anyone who knows Anna knows that to be \n     the case. Hear these final words she wrote: ``Those who shun \n     the prevailing winds of cynicism and anomie can truly fly.''\n       Someone has said that, ``One of the best ways of \n     understanding journalism is having it done to you.'' Well, \n     I've had it done to me a bit, and the only thing worse than \n     having it done to you is not having it done to you.\n       In the process of organizing the ``Save Our Cities'' March \n     on Washington in 1992, I spent months trying to whomp up \n     media interest in the event. As I described how mayors in \n     cities from coast to coast were organizing for the march, \n     reporters and editors would look at me as if I was out of my \n     mind. One day Mayor David Dinkins held a press conference on \n     the steps of City Hall calling on New Yorkers to go to \n     Washington and protest against the urban policies of their \n     national government--Republican White House and Democratic \n     congress alike.\n       To make sure he would get coverage, the mayor specified \n     that this call to action would be his only press event that \n     day. Hundreds of people showed up--leaders from labor, \n     business, government, the churches, the neighborhoods of New \n     York. Now, I would have thought that the very fact that the \n     mayor was calling on New Yorkers to march against their \n     national government might quality as news. But not a line \n     appeared in any newspaper, and not a second on the air.\n       In the event, 250,000 people joined that march on \n     Washington--apparently too good to be true. The New York \n     Times printed an absurdly low-ball crowd estimate of 30,000 \n     provided by a highly biased source--the National Park \n     Service, a branch of the very government against which those \n     quarter of million people were protesting! By accepting that \n     low crowd estimate the Times almost forced itself to put a \n     negative spin on the story.\n       In this age of journalism with a sneer, not only are events \n     too often covered in\n      this negative way. Many good stories get no attention at \n     all. As chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York \n     City, I see it all the time.\n       I think of a conference of 1,500 school kids who spent a \n     whole Saturday discussing how to improve New York City's \n     schools. Hardly a line of coverage.\n       I think of the 1,000 neighborhood leaders who gathered on \n     another Saturday, a beautiful spring day, to swap advice on \n     how to fight crime and drugs and make their neighborhoods \n     safer and more beautiful. Not a line in print, not a second \n     on the air.\n       I think of a town meeting that gathered 300 leaders from \n     every segment of New York, to discuss the city's problems. \n     Not a peep from the press.\n       As an officer of Columbia University for the last fifteen \n     years, I think of the recent inauguration of a new president \n     of Barnard College, a stirring event attended by scores of \n     academic leaders from around the country and abroad.\n       Total silence from the news media.\n       It seems to me that journalism, my old love, just may have \n     become part of the problem.\n       Journalists like to say that if you are being attacked from \n     all sides you must be doing something right. It has also been \n     suggested that if you are being attacked from all sides it's \n     possible that you are doing everything wrong.\n       I hasten to add that this is not the case at all. For even \n     in this age of cynicism and trivialization some excellent \n     journalism is being done. We still see moving pieces, \n     particularly in our newspapers, about homelessness and \n     violence and teenage crime, all well reported and \n     thoughtfully analytical.\n       A notable case in point was the New York Times's recent \n     pieces on teenage violence, which ended with a thorough \n     exploration of possible solutions. But the editor in me cries \n     out: how can anyone be expected to keep track of a series \n     that began last May and ran sporadically to December? Beats \n     me.\n       It's in the area of problem-solving that I think journalism \n     ought to start changing its ways. Too often, even worthy \n     series concerning social problems leave out the final part--\n     the part that offers up solutions. Says Davis Merritt, editor \n     of the Wichita Eagle: ``If we continue to insist that \n     engaging actively in the search for solutions isn't part of \n     our job, we will soon, in fact, have no job.''\n       Merritt and his newspaper are at the forefront of an \n     experimental movement that aims to engage citizens in public \n     affairs. The Wichita Eagle and its editor have concluded that \n     people are disenchanted with their institutions, and \n     frustrated that their voices are not being heard. With public \n     life apparently not working very well, Merritt and his \n     Wichita colleagues have decided that the press now has the \n     positive duty to ``intervene in public life in the interest \n     of strengthening civic culture.''\n       How to do it?\n       In the case of The Wichita Eagle, the editors redesigned \n     their political coverage in the last election to establish \n     which issues were of real concern to citizens, and then \n     forced the candidates to address those concerns--rather than \n     just reporting on the tactical maneuvers of candidates or the \n     machinations of political insiders. In 1992, the Eagle also \n     launched its ``People Project: Solving It Ourselves''--an \n     effort to engage both readers and the paper itself in \n     identifying community problems and exploring ways to solve \n     them.\n       Every single day, for ten weeks in a row, The Eagle opened \n     up its pages to a consideration of problems that were \n     important to the community--with emphasis on\n      seeking solutions from the citizenry. The response was \n     electric. One measurable result was that in the fall of \n     1992 volunteerism in Wichita's schools increased by 32 \n     percent.\n       Similar exercises in ``public journalism'' have been \n     undertaken by papers in dozens of cities around the country--\n     from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Dayton, Ohio to Bremerton, \n     Washington. Here are a few examples:\n       The Detroit Free Press published a major series on violence \n     done to children. It then launched its ``Children First'' \n     campaign, which focused on this problem and also managed to \n     raise half a million dollars to benefit local kids. The \n     Detroit Free Press continues with ongoing coverage assisted \n     by a panel of young people.\n       The Charlotte Observer determined that violence and \n     discipline were the public's chief concerns about local \n     public schools and developed a five-week series on those \n     topics.\n       The Akron Beacon-Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for its five-\n     part project, ``A Question of Race.'' The newspaper convened \n     focus groups; it analyzed the continuing social and economic \n     disparities between blacks and whites; it invited local \n     organizations to establish projects addressing race \n     relations; it hired experts to coordinate the resulting \n     plans. In the end, 22,000 Akronites responded to a newspaper \n     coupon that invited them to join the fight against racism.\n       You will observe that such media capitals as New York, \n     Washington, Philadelphia and Los Angeles are notable by their \n     absence in this little sampling of public journalism in its \n     experimental stages.\n       The reason is simple. Getting involved in things, as public \n     journalism demands, is anathema to many journalists who grew \n     up--as I did--in the belief that journalism and its \n     practitioners must operate as a breed apart. In the words of \n     Professor Jay Rosen of New York University, a godfather of \n     the concept of public journalism: ``Traditionally journalists \n     worry about getting the separations right: the separations \n     between themselves and the political community; between news \n     and editorial; between facts and values; between information \n     and their beliefs.'' Professor Rosen then makes this radical \n     point: ``The challenge . . . is how to get the connections \n     right, because the connections are what's faltering.''\n       To many journalists, this concept of connecting, and \n     getting involved, is an act of heresy--so wedded are they to \n     the idea of detachment and uninvolvement and even an \n     unconcern about the consequences of what they write or \n     report. This chilly remove is what Fred Friendly calls the \n     Werner von Braun theory of journalistic responsibility: ``I \n     just shoot the rockets up into the air; where they come down \n     is not my concern.''\n       Many journalists insist that detachment gives them \n     credibility--but the sad fact is that they enjoy very little \n     credibility as it is, ranking way down there is public trust \n     with the used-car salesmen. A recent Times-Mirror poll found \n     that 71 per cent of the American people think that \n     journalism, instead of helping solve the nation's problems, \n     gets in the way of finding solutions.\n        [[Page S2074]] Time, I think, for us journalists to change \n     our ways--not by becoming advocates of particular policies \n     but by helping the public gain confidence in its own ability \n     to reach consensus and solve problems. It's time for \n     journalism to abandon cynicism, to uncurl its lip and to \n     become a fair-minded participant and catalyst in America's \n     decision-making process. It's time for journalism to help \n     public life work better.\n       Here's one way.\n       When municipal elections take place next Fall, a project \n     called City Vote will simultaneously hold presidential \n     primaries in fifteen or twenty cities. The object is to force \n     the candidates to address urban issues at the very beginning \n     of the presidential campaign. It's an ideal opportunity for \n     journalists in Boston, Houston, Spokane, Minneapolis, St. \n     Paul, Baltimore and other participating cities to facilities \n     the discussion, and to force candidates to address the issues \n     that matter to the voters. A fine opportunity for publishers \n     and editors to sponsor public forums, to open their pages to \n     debate to nudge the public dialogue along.\n       The kind of involvement I am thinking about has to do with \n     exploration and inspiration. It calls to mind a favorite \n     prose poem.\n       As I recite this little piece by Christopher Logue, think \n     of it as a conversation between the new journalist and his \n     public. It's an exchange that suggests how, by getting \n     involved ourselves, we might begin to inspire others to get \n     involved. It also suggests how my long romance with \n     journalism might ultimately be restored.\n\n     Come to the edge.\n     It is too high . . . \n     Come to the edge!\n     We will fall . . . \n     COME TO THE EDGE!!!\n      . . . and they came\n      . . . and he pushed\n      . . . and they flew.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/02/senate-section/article/S2072-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
