LLOYD JOHN OGILVIE\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is my great honor to welcome the Senate's new Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd \nOgilvie. It is my feeling that the Senate is going to be richly blessed \nby the presence of Dr. Ogilvie. Reverend Ogilvie is undertaking a \ndifficult task, because he is succeeding our good friend, Richard \nHalverson. Reverend Halverson not only leaves a spiritual legacy behind \nhim, but he also leaves some very difficult shoes to fill. Richard \nHalverson offered this body an example of humility, gentleness, and \npersonal integrity. He will be missed, not only by the Senators, but \nalso by the staff, support workers, pages, and the various workers who \nexperienced his ministry.\n  In the committee's search of hundreds of extremely qualified \napplicants, Dr. Ogilvie stood out because of his emphasis on nurturing \nothers through personal relationships. I am pleased to hear of his \ndetermination to keep the office of Chaplain nonpolitical, \nnonsectarian, and nonpartisan. He has indicated that his role as \nChaplain is to act as an intercessor for the Senators, serving as a \ntrusted prayer partner and a faithful counselor. In his opening \nprayers, he is committed to praying to God, not preaching to the \nSenators. I believe this is the correct approach to the chaplaincy. The \nlast thing we need in the Senate is another bully pulpit, instructing \nus as to the proper political decision or action. Dr. Ogilvie will \nminister through friendships and relationships with Members. His \nemphasis will be encouragement, not persuasion.\n  When I mentioned all these qualified applicants, let me suggest one \nfurther fact. Dr. Ogilvie did not apply for the office of Chaplain. He \nwas sought out for the office.\n  I am so excited that Dr. Ogilvie will be joining us in this capacity. \nI would like to take some time to reflect on his many accomplishments. \nI will highlight some of his greater accomplishments and then enter his \nresume into the Record. If I were to highlight all of his life work, I \nam afraid my colleagues would accuse me of filibustering. Dr. Ogilvie \nis leaving his congregation at First Presbyterian Church in Hollywood, \nCA, where he has ministered since 1972. In his capacity as pastor of \nFirst Presbyterian in Hollywood, he sought to encourage leaders in \nentertainment, business, and the community in the Los Angeles area.\n  Through personal interaction and small group settings, Dr. Ogilvie \nattempted to help men and women find mutual support to face their \nproblems and to follow their callings in their vocations by encouraging \nthe individuals around them. One of the keys to Dr. Ogilvie's ministry \nhas been listening. By listening closely to the concerns of those \naround him, he can respond by tailoring his ministry to directly \nrespond to those concerns. I think this will be an invaluable tool in \nhis ministries in the Senate. The Senate is a \n[[Page S3824]] dynamic body thus requiring an individual that can \ncarefully listen and respond to the many concerns that we confront each \nday.\n  Dr. Ogilvie is an accomplished author of approximately 50 books, and \nhe is a contributing author in many current religious magazines and \nperiodicals. He is leaving his nationally syndicated weekly television \nshow, ``Let God Love You,'' which has been on the air for 17 years. He \nis also ending his daily radio program of 10 years. Both of these \nprograms are financed by Lloyd Ogilvie Ministries, a independent, \nnonprofit organization from which Ogilvie draws no salary or \ncompensation.\n  It is my belief that Dr. Ogilvie will be successful because of his \ncalling as a pastor to be available, approachable, and attentive. As he \nseeks to be influential in the spiritual lives of the Senators, I trust \nthat he will always strive to be a faithful friend and confidant. And I \nknow and am persuaded that he will be.\n  I look forward to his work, and I encourage all my distinguished \ncolleagues to take the opportunity to get to know him.\n  Of course, like all of us, he brings to this new ministry his \ndevoted, wonderful, accomplished wife, Mary Jane, as they have worked \ntogether on the Lord's ministry all of these years. He has a beautiful \nfamily who support him and each of whom is contributing to our society.\n  So, Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that a \nbiographical sketch, with background, education, degrees, awards, and \npastorates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                Biographical Sketch--Lloyd John Ogilvie\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, September 2, 1930.\n       Married to Mary Jane Jenkins Ogilvie.\n       Children: Heather, Scott, Andrew.\n\n\n                               education\n\n       Public schools of Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n       Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois.\n       Garrett Theological Seminary, Northwestern University, \n     Evanston, Illinois.\n       New College, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n\n                                degrees\n\n       Bachelor of Arts (Lake Forest College).\n       Master of Theology (Garrett Theological Seminary).\n       Doctor of Divinity (Whitworth College).\n       Doctor of Humane Letters (University of Redlands).\n       Doctor of Humanities (Moravian College and Seminary).\n       Doctor of Laws (Eastern College).\n\n\n                         awards (partial list)\n\n       Distinguished Service Citation, Lake Forest College.\n       Preacher of the Year, Religion in Media.\n       Angel Award, Religion in Media.\n       1982, 1986--Silver Angel Award (to Television Ministry).\n       Gold Medallion Book Award, 1985, ``Making Stress Work For \n     You''.

This emphasis was continued in his ministry to \n     leaders and their families in the steel industry when he \n     served as Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of \n     Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He has pursued this calling during \n     the past twenty-two years as Pastor of the historic First \n     Presbyterian Church of Hollywood where he seeks to enable \n     leaders in the entertainment community as well as business \n     and community leaders in the greater Los Angeles basin.\n       In addition to his responsibilities as Pastor of the \n     Hollywood Church, Dr. Ogilvie is a media communicator, author \n     and frequent speaker throughout the nation.\n       Dr. Ogilvie believes that listening is the key to effective \n     communication of the Gospel. His contemporary expositions of \n     the Bible are in direct response to the most urgent questions \n     and deepest needs of people in his congregation and \n     throughout the nation. Through being attentive in \n     conversations, extensive correspondence, and personal surveys \n     of his national radio and television audiences, he seeks to \n     feel the pulse of what people are thinking and feeling today. \n     His messages, books, and the leadership of his congregation \n     in Hollywood arise out of the ministry of listening to \n     people's hopes and hurts and then to God for His answers in \n     the Bible.\n\n\n                              local church\n\n       As Pastor of his large congregation in the communications \n     capitol, Dr. Ogilvie has developed the church's program in \n     four major thursts--as a workshipping congregation, a healing \n     community, an equipping center for the ministry of the laity, \n     and a deployment agency for evangelism and mission. His \n     guiding conviction is that all Christians are called into \n     ministry and that the role of the local church is to equip \n     them to be a bold, articulate apostolate of hope in the \n     structures of society. This equipping program is carried out \n     in in-depth study of the Scriptures, small group meetings \n     throughout the Los Angeles basin, and retreats and \n     conferences. Dr. Ogilvie consistently monitors the \n     effectiveness of the ministry with these questions: What kind \n     of people are we called to deploy in the world? What kind of \n     church sets free that kind of people? What kind of church \n     officers enables that kind of church?; and, What kind of \n     pastoral leadership inspires that quality of vision?\n       Lloyd Ogilvie's strategy of leadership is to work with and \n     through the lay Elders to shape the goals and program of the \n     church. Along with a team of four pastors and ten\n      program staff people, Dr. Ogilvie seeks to lead the church \n     as a laboratory of experimentation with new forms of \n     church life and innovative methods of meeting the needs of \n     the members so that they can be contagious communicators \n     of their faith and courageous witnesses in social issues.\n       Located at the center of population spread of the greater \n     Los Angles community, the urban Hollywood church ministers to \n     its immediate community and to members who live throughout \n     the metropolitan and suburban areas. The vital program for \n     members is coupled with a diversified outreach to meet the \n     social needs of the community.\n\n\n                             Media Ministry\n\n       Lloyd Ogilvie's nationally syndicated radio and television \n     ministry is called ``Let God Love You.'' The weekly \n     television program is celebrating its seventeenth anniversary \n     and the daily radio program is going into its tenth year. \n     This media ministry is guided by a strong national Board of \n     Directors of the Lloyd Ogilvie Ministries, an independent, \n     non-profit organization. In 1982, the Directors adopted ``Ten \n     Commitments'' for the development of the ministry and its \n     financial accountability.\n       Dr. Ogilvie brings to this media ministry the same \n     commitment to listening he expresses as pastor of his church. \n     His messages on the ``Let God Love You'' programs are his \n     part of an ongoing dialogue with his listeners and viewers. \n     On very program he encourages them to write him about what's \n     on their minds and hearts. His voluminous correspondence with \n     people and a special yearly inventory of their deepest \n     concerns provide the focus of his personal sharing of grace. \n     The central purpose is to help people turn life's struggles \n     into stepping stones by linking their problems to the \n     promises and power of God.\n       Beginning sixteen years age with one television station in \n     Los Angeles, the ``Let God Love You'' program is now seen \n     throughout the nation on independent stations and cable \n     networks. The media ministry is supported exclusively by \n     viewer and listener contributions and all gifts are used only \n     for costs of producing and airing the programs.

Under the previous order, there will now be a \nperiod for morning business not to extend beyond 30 minutes with \nSenators permitted to speak therein.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last week during the debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment, there was more than a little debate about \nthe use of Social Security funds in calculating our annual Federal \ndeficit. The fact is that much of the discussion was misleading, and \nsome of it was just not true. But in all our discussions of the issue, \nfew explain the truth of what this Government is doing more succinctly \nthan columnist Charles Krauthammer did in his op-ed page in the \nWashington Post last Friday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that column, entitled \n``Social Security `Trust Fund' Whopper,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 1995]\n\n                 Social Security ``Trust Fund'' Whopper\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Last week, Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan management to \n     (1) kill the balanced budget amendment, (2) deal Republicans \n     their first big defeat since November and (3) make Democrats \n     the heroes of Social Security. A hat trick. How did they do \n     it? By demanding that any balanced budget amendment ``take \n     Social Security off the table''--i.e., not count the current \n     Social Security surplus in calculating the deficit--and thus \n     stop ``looting'' the Social Security trust fund.\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I don't mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington and a judgment \n     call anyway. I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare even in Washington and not a \n     judgment call at all. Consider:\n       In 1994 Smith runs up a credit card bill of $100,000. \n     Worried about his retirement, however, he puts his $25,000 \n     salary into a retirement account.\n       Come Dec. 31, Smith has two choices: (a) He can borrow \n     $75,000 from the bank and ``loot'' his retirement account to \n     pay off the rest--which Conrad-Dorgan say is unconscionable. \n     Or (b) he can borrow the full $100,000 to pay off his credit \n     card bill and keep the $25,000 retirement account \n     sacrosanct--which Conrad-Dorgan say is just swell and \n     maintains a sacred trust and staves off the wolves and would \n     have let them vote for the balanced budget amendment if only \n     those senior-bashing Republicans had just done it their way.\n       But a child can see that courses (a) and (b) are identical. \n     Either way, Smith is net $75,000 in debt. The trust money in \n     (b) is a fiction: It consists of 25,000 additionally borrowed \n     dollars. His retirement is exactly as insecure one way or the \n     other. Either way, if he wants to pay himself a pension when \n     he retires, he is going to have to borrow the money.\n       According to Conrad-Dorgan, however, unless he declared his \n     debt to be $100,000 rather than $75,000, he has looted his \n     retirement account. But it matters not a whit what Smith \n     declares his debt to be. It is not his declaration that is \n     looting his retirement. It is his borrowing (and \n     overspending).\n       Similarly for the federal government. In fiscal 1994, \n     President Clinton crowed that he had reduced the federal \n     deficit to $200 billion. In fact, what Conrad calls the \n     ``operating budget'' was about $250 billion in deficit, but \n     the Treasury counted the year's roughly $50 billion Social \n     Security surplus to make its books read $200 billion. \n     According to Conrad-Dorgan logic, President Clinton \n     ``looted'' the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $50 \n     billion.\n       Did he? Of course not. If Clinton had declared the deficit \n     to be $250 billion and not ``borrowed'' $50 billion Social \n     Security surplus--which is nothing more than the federal \n     government moving money from its left pocket to its right--\n     would that have made an iota of difference to the status of \n     our debt or of Social Security?\n       Whether or not you figure Social Security in calculating \n     the federal deficit is merely an accounting device. \n     Government cannot stash the Social Security surplus in a \n     sock. As long as the federal deficit exceeds the Social \n     Security surplus--that is, for the foreseeable forever--we \n     are increasing our net debt and making it harder to pay out \n     Social Security (and everything else government does) in the \n     future.\n       Why? Because the Social Security trust fund--like Smith's \n     retirement account--is a fiction. The Social Security system \n     is pay-as-you-go. The benefits going to old folks today do \n     not come out of a huge vault stuffed with dollar bills on \n     some South Pacific island. Current retirees get paid from the \n     payroll taxes of current workers.\n       With so many boomers working today, pay-as-you-go produces \n     a cash surplus. That cash does not go into a Pacific island \n     vault either. In a government that runs a deficit, it cannot \n     be saved at all--any more than Smith can really ``save'' his \n     $25,000 when he is running a $100,000 deficit. The surplus \n     necessarily is used to help pay for current government \n     operations.\n       And pay-as-you-go will be true around the year 2015, when \n     we boomers begin to retire. The chances of our Social \n     Security benefits \n     [[Page S3826]] being paid out then will depend on the \n     productivity of the economy at the time, which in turn will \n     depend heavily on the drag on the economy exerted by the next \n     net that we will have accumulated by then.\n       The best guarantee, in other words, that there will be \n     Social Security benefits available then is to reduce the \n     deficit now. Yet by killing the balanced budget amendment, \n     Conrad-Dorgan destroyed the very mechanism that would force \n     that to happen. The one real effect, therefore, that Conrad-\n     Dorgan will have on Social Security is to jeopardize the \n     government's capacity to keep paying it.\n       Having done that, Conrad-Dorgan are now posing as the \n     saviors of Social Security from Republican looters. A neat \n     trick. A complete fraud.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this distinguished columnist, who has a \nknack for exposing attempts at political deception and making difficult \nthings simple, points out the deceit in the arguments that we heard on \nthe floor last week.\n  I encourage all who participated in the balanced budget amendment \ndebate to read this column. I am asking that it be made part of the \nRecord so everyone will have an opportunity to do that. Because, if \nnothing else, Mr. Krauthammer's essay brushes aside the political \nrhetoric and emphasizes that, no matter how you add it up, where you \nput the numbers, or, as he says, which pocket you put it in, an \nobligation of the Federal Government remains just that--an obligation \nof the Federal Government. And we or our children and grandchildren \nhave to pay it.\n  Mr. President, it just seems to this Senator that the balanced budget \namendment should have been adopted. I repeat for those who are worried \nabout the Social Security trust fund or, more precisely, where will the \nmoney be, where will it come from to pay Social Security recipients 20, \n25, 30 years from now, I submit that the best thing we could have done \nwas to get the unified budget of the United States in balance in 7 \nyears. Because I believe that would have more to do with what Social \nSecurity of the future needs than anything else.\n  Simply put, as Mr. Krauthammer later in his article alludes to, the \nbest thing for Social Security in the future is a vibrant, growing \nAmerican economy with low inflation. If we can have that for periods of \n4 or 5 years at a time, with mild downturns, then I believe we will be \nin a position as a nation to take care of our seniors.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, if we cannot do that, we will not be in a \nposition to take care of them no matter what rhetoric is offered on the \nfloor that seemed to say, in the 7-year balanced budget that was before \nus, even though we would have to cut or reduce Government about $1.2 \ntrillion, essentially those who argued against it, at least from the \nSocial Security standpoint, were saying that is not enough; you have to \ndo more. And frankly, we have never come close to even that. I would \nhave thought that would have been a fantastic effort on behalf of \nsenior Social Security citizens and on behalf of a prospering American \neconomy.\n  I hope everyone will get a chance to read this very basic approach \nthat this excellent columnist talks to us about with reference to the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3825-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3826-S3827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RESPONDING TO THE PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I come to the floor during this morning \nbusiness to talk about several things, to sort of reflect a little bit \non the 2 months that we have been here, a little over 2 months.\n  First of all, of course, it is a great honor to be a part of this \nbody and to represent the State of Wyoming in the U.S. Senate.\n  We have to observe that we have dealt with a limited number of items \nwhile we have been here. Many of us are filled with some kinds of mixed \nemotions, recognizing and respecting the deliberative nature of the \nSenate and, at the same time, having some frustration with the slowness \nof the deliberations and the lack of movement on some of the issues \nthat we consider to be very important.\n  As an American, of course, I believe that we want our institutions to \nbe thoughtful and to fully explore issues, but also in a timely way to \ndecide and to move on. That is what deliberation is all about.\n  There is, I believe, an agenda in this country. Everyone can read the \npast election as they choose, but it seems pretty certain that a number \nof things were on the minds of American voters. One of them is that \nmost people believe we have too much government, that it costs too \nmuch, that we need to have in our lives less government, less cost, and \nless regulation. Of course, you can talk about the details of how do \nyou do that, but, nevertheless, it is an agenda.\n  These were issues that were defined in the last election and they are \nissues that need to be dealt with by this Congress and by this Senate. \nOne of the measures of good government, I believe, is the \nresponsiveness that its institutions have to the people as they vote.\n  We have, as a result of the election, I think, the best opportunity \nthat has been before us for 40 years to take a look at some of the \nthings we do. Over the last number of years, about all the \nopportunities available were to add to programs that we had, put more \nmoney in programs that we had. Now we have a chance and we have a \nCongress that is willing to think through programs again and see if, in \nfact, they are delivering as they were designed to deliver.\n  In order to make this a useful discussion, of course, there has to be \na stipulation that those who are interested in looking to change are \njust as caring and just as concerned about people as those who are \nopposed to change. And I think that is a fair and honest stipulation.\n  The question is what we are doing in seeing if there is a better way \nto provide services for the needy. Is there a better way to determine \nwho those services should go to? Is there a more efficient way of \ndelivering those services? That I think is what the change is about.\n  We need to have this institution to be the kind of institution that \nwill take a look at these things and then move forward and decide.\n  We really do not need a rapid response team that is opposed to \nchange. And the controversy--many of the issues are not between \nRepublicans and Democrats--the controversy lies between those who would \nlike to see some things done differently and those who basically do not \nwant change.\n  There is a legitimate difference of view. There is a legitimate \nargument between those who think more government, more spending is \nbetter for the country, and those like myself, who do not agree, who \nthink that, indeed, we can do it with less government, turning more \nresponsibility to people, turning more of an opportunity for families \nto spend their own money, stimulating the economy.\n  We are now, today and in the next couple of days, debating the \nKassebaum amendment with respect to replacement of strikers, an issue \nthat we went through in the House and in the Senate last year in great \ndetail. So I rise in strong support of that amendment. I think it is \nthe will of the Congress. We have been through that. We have been \nthrough some 60 years of experience. Frankly, it has worked pretty well \nand there has been very little deviation from that in terms of hiring \nreplacements.\n  Someone on the floor the other day said, ``Is this the agenda of the \nnew majority, to make it tougher for working people, to make it tougher \nfor single mothers to have jobs?'' Of course not. That is an absurd \nidea.\n  I think the idea of the new majority is to find a balance between \nlabor and management, to find a way in which there is an environment \nwhere business can grow and jobs can be created, where the Federal \nGovernment is not an advocate for either of the parties in these kinds \nof controversies. I think that is what the Kassebaum amendment is all \nabout.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the time. It is difficult to know \nhow we should proceed. But there is a great deal before the Senate. We \nhave a great many things to decide. In fact, we \n[[Page S3827]] should be deciding them. That is what votes are about. \nOnce they have been totally explored, we look forward to making a \ndecision and not to obstruct a decision.\n  I look forward very much to the continuing efforts on the part of \nthis body to respond to voters, responding to the people in this \ncountry in making decisions on major items, in the first opportunity in \nmany years we have had to explore finding ways to do things in a better \nway.\n  I think the war on poverty is a good example. It has been going on \nfor what--30 years? Twenty years? The fact of the matter is we are less \nwell off now than we were then in terms of the things that the war on \npoverty was designed to resolve. It makes it pretty clear, if you want \ndifferent results, you have to start doing things differently. you \ncannot expect different results by continuing to do the same thing.\n  So I look forward to the continued discussion. I look forward to \ndealing with the issues that the House has dealt with. However the \nmajority here decides to deal with them is fine; I just suggest we come \nto grips with them, that we move forward, that we do not lose the \nmomentum of an election, that we do not lose the interest and the \ninterest of the American people in taking a look at questions like a \nbalanced budget amendment, like line-item veto, like term limits, like \naccountability. All of those are issues that really deserve our best \nattention and final decision.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the birth of \none of baseball's two newest members, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The \nTampa Bay community was awarded a franchise last Thursday and will \ncommence play in 1998. This is a very important and welcome, celebrated \nevent for our State and particularly for the 2 million citizens of the \nTampa Bay area who have been waiting a long, long time for baseball to \ncome in the summer.\n  For many years, the Tampa Bay area has been home to spring training \nbaseball, and for many years there has been the hope and expectation \nthat baseball would not terminate as the teams left to begin the \nregular season. That expectation will now be soon realized. This comes \nafter many years of effort. The quest for a major league team began in \n1977 with the formation of the Pinellas Sports Authority, an \norganization that has had as its goal to bring a major league franchise \nto the Tampa Bay area.\n  Since that time, there have been efforts to secure seven different \nfranchises. In each case, there was the hope and the expectation that \nthe franchise would be relocated to the Tampa Bay area, and then for a \nvariety of reasons that hope was crushed.\n  The latest attempt occurred several years ago when an actual contract \nwas signed for the relocation of the San Francisco Giants to Tampa Bay, \nand this contract was subsequently canceled by action of the other \nmajor league teams.\n  During the course of this activity, working with the various series \nof major league baseball commissioners, the city determined that it was \nin its interest and would advance its potential as a major league \nfranchise by proceeding to construct a state of the art domed stadium, \nwhich has now been completed, which is utilized for other sports \nactivities and which stands ready with modifications and final \nrefinements to be the home to the new Tampa Bay Devil Rays professional \nteam.\n  In achieving this success, there were many people who were active. I \nwould like to particularly express my appreciation to the managing \ngeneral partner of the new team, Mr. Vince Naimoli, who, over a period \nof setbacks and frustrations, remained constant in his commitment to \nbring major league baseball to Tampa Bay. There have been many \nofficials with the Saint Petersburg city government who have been \nactive in helping to realize this objective.\n  I should like to recognize Saint Petersburg City Administrator Rick \nDodge, who, from the very beginning, has played a crucial role in \nhelping to move toward the completion of the stadium and maintaining a \nhigh level of community support behind the effort to receive a major \nleague franchise. He is illustrative of dozens of others--elected \nofficials, city administration officials, and the citizens of Pinellas \nCounty--who have worked so hard to bring this to a successful \nrealization.\n  Madam President, we are proud of the recognition of this awarded \nfranchise to the important position which the State of Florida plays in \nmajor league professional athletics. With this award, our State will \nnow have nine major league franchises in baseball, football, \nbasketball, and hockey, second only to California in the number of \nprofessional major league teams playing in the State. This is \nappropriate to the size and rapid growth of our State and its \ndemonstrated support for professional sports.\n  Madam President, I thank the major league baseball ownership for \nawarding this franchise to Tampa Bay. They have demonstrated wisdom in \ndoing so because I am confident that this will quickly become one of \nthe strongest franchises in major league baseball. There is a certain \ndegree of optimism in accepting a major league franchise in the context \nof the current labor-management status, but I am confident well before \n1998 we will be playing major league baseball again in America and look \nforward to the day when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays open their first \nseason.\n  Madam President, thank you for affording me this opportunity to make \nthese remarks on behalf of the citizens of our State and the event that \nwe have long looked forward to celebrating.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3827-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to comment on the Record \nmade earlier this morning by my distinguished colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, the chairman of our Budget Committee. Let me \nsay at the outset that I have the highest regard for Senator Domenici. \nHe is very conscientious, very hard-working, and very honest in his \nbeliefs and his work in the Senate. So in rising I do not intend to \nreflect on him, but rather to reflect on Charles Krauthammer's recent \narticle concerning Social Security that the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico included in the Record.\n  So there will not be any trouble referring to it, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article of Charles Krauthammer entitled ``Social \nSecurity `Trust Fund' Whopper'' of last Friday, March 10 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 1995]\n\n                 Social Security ``Trust Fund'' Whopper\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Last week, Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan managed to \n     (1) kill the balanced budget amendment, (2) deal Republicans \n     their first big defeat since November and (3) make Democrats \n     the heroes of Social Security. A hat trick. How did they do \n     it? By demanding that any balanced budget amendment ``take \n     Social Security off the table''-- \n     [[Page S3828]] i.e., not count the current Social Security \n     surplus in calculating the deficit--and thus stop ``looting'' \n     the Social Security trust fund.\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I don't mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington and a judgment \n     call anyway. I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare even in Washington and not a \n     judgment call at all. Consider:\n       In 1994 Smith runs up a credit card bill of $100,000. \n     Worried about his retirement, however, he puts his $25,000 \n     salary into a retirement account.\n       Come Dec. 31, Smith has two choices: (a) He can borrow \n     $75,000 from the bank and ``loot'' his retirement account to \n     pay off the rest--which Conrad-Dorgan say is unconscionable. \n     Or (b) He can borrow the full $100,000 to pay off his credit \n     card bill and keep the $25,000 retirement account \n     sacrosanct--which Conrad--Dorgan say is just swell and \n     maintains a sacred trust and staves off the wolves and would \n     have let them vote for the balanced budget amendment if only \n     those senior-bashing Republicans had just done it their way.\n       But a child can see that courses (a) and (b) are identical. \n     Either way, Smith is net $75,000 in debt. The trust money in \n     (b) is a fiction: It consists of 25,000 additionally borrowed \n     dollars. His retirement is exactly as insecure one way or the \n     other. Either way, if he wants to pay himself a pension when \n     he retires, he is going to have to borrow the money.\n       According to Conrad-Dorgan, however, unless he declares his \n     debt to be $100,000 rather than $75,000, he has looted his \n     retirement account. But it matters not a whit what Smith \n     declares his debt to be. It is not his declaration that is \n     looting his retirement. It is his borrowing (and \n     overspending).\n       Similarly for the federal government. In fiscal 1994, \n     President Clinton crowed that he had reduced the federal \n     deficit to $200 billion. In fact, what Conrad calls the \n     ``operating budget'' was about $250 billion in deficit, but \n     the treasury counted the year's roughly $50 billion Social \n     Security surplus to make its books read $200 billion. \n     According to Conrad-Dorgan logic, President Clinton \n     ``looted'' the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $50 \n     billion.\n       Did he? Of course not. If Clinton had declared the deficit \n     to be $250 billion and not ``borrowed'' $50 billion Social \n     Security surplus--which is nothing more than the federal \n     government moving money from its left pocket to its right--\n     would that have made an iota of difference to the status of \n     our debt or of Social Security?\n       Whether or not you figure Social Security in calculating \n     the federal deficit is merely an accounting device. \n     Government cannot stash the Social Security surplus in a \n     sock. As long as the federal deficit exceeds the Social \n     Security surplus--that is, for the foreseeable forever--we \n     are increasing our net debt and making it harder to pay out \n     Social Security (and everything else government does) in the \n     future.\n       Why? Because the Social Security trust fund--like Smith's \n     retirement account--is a fiction. The Social Security system \n     is pay-as-you-go. The benefits going to old folks today do \n     not come out of a huge vault stuffed with dollar bills on \n     some South Pacific island. Current retirees get paid from the \n     payroll taxes of current workers.\n       With so many boomers working today, pay-as-you-go produces \n     a cash surplus. That cash does not go into a Pacific island \n     vault either. In a government that runs a deficit, it cannot \n     be saved at all--any more than Smith can really ``save'' his \n     $25,000 when he is running a $100,000 deficit. The surplus \n     necessarily is used to help pay for current government \n     operations.\n       And pay-as-you-go will be true around the year 2015, when \n     we boomers begin to retire. The chances of our Social \n     Security benefits being paid out then will depend on the \n     productivity of the economy at the time, which in turn will \n     depend heavily on the drag on the economy exerted by the net \n     debt that we will have accumulated by then.\n       The best guarantee, in other words, that there will be \n     Social Security benefits available then is to reduce the \n     deficit now. Yet by killing the balanced budget amendment, \n     Conrad-Dorgan destroyed the very mechanism that would force \n     that to happen. The one real effect, therefore, that Conrad-\n     Dorgan will have on Social Security is to jeopardize the \n     government's capacity to keep paying it.\n       Having done that, Conrad-Dorgan are now posing as the \n     saviors of Social Security from Republicans looters. A neat \n     trick. A complete fraud.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, it really disturbed me when I saw our \ntwo distinguished Senators from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Conrad, described as being tricky, or outright fraudulent.\n  It's getting difficult to serve in the Senate. You have the Speaker \nof the House calling some Senators ``liars.'' You have some of our \ncolleagues parading in front of the Capitol with a poster containing \nthe pictures of some Senators and a headline at the top saying, \n``Wanted for flip-flopping.''\n  But if we want to get past the grandstanding and get to the truth of \nthe matter, what we were trying to do was to keep our word by \nprotecting Social Security. The American people should know that the \nreal flip-floppers are those who voted in 1990 to protect Social \nSecurity but were willing to sacrifice it under the language of Section \n7 in House Joint Resolution 1.\n  Charles Krauthammer's Social Security article is, to use his own \nlanguage, the single most fraudulent article that our friend, Mr. \nKrauthammer, has written because he equates an individual with a \n$100,000 debt with the Government having a $100,000 debt. He claims \nthat an individual borrowing $25,000 from a retirement account and \nborrowing the remaining $75,000 from the bank is in the same position \nas the Government borrowing its $25,000 from the Social Security \naccount and the remaining $75,000 from the markets. But here's the \ndifference. In borrowing $25,000 from his retirement, the individual is \ntruly at zero because he has borrowed his own money. In the \nGovernment's case, the budget is not balanced because the $25,000 has \nbeen borrowed from future retirees.\n  Madam President, the Social Security surpluses were planned in 1983 \nwith a special FICA tax to bring in funds in excess of the immediate \nneed. We were not just trying to balance the Social Security budget. \nThere was an affirmative intent that more moneys than were necessary \nwould be collected so that we could build up surpluses and provide for \nthe baby boomers that will retire early in the next century. The idea \nof the Greenspan Commission was that a sufficient Social Security \nreserve or trust be built up so that there would not be a call on \ngeneral revenues. Of course, what has been happening, Madam President, \nis that administrations, Congresses, and columnists have all engaged in \nthe deceptive reporting by using the Social Security surpluses to \ndiminish the size of the deficit. This charade does not eliminate the \ndeficit, it merely moves the deficit from the Federal Government over \nto the Social Security fund.\n  Of course, this trick does not eliminate the deficit. Already, $464 \nbillion has been moved--by the year 2000 the Government will owe Social \nSecurity $1 trillion. As a result, the baby boomers, who are presently \nbeing taxed to pay for the Social Security of persons who have reached \n72 years of age, like this particular Senator, will have to be taxed \nagain to receive their benefits.\n  In addition, Mr. Krauthammer's claims that the Social Security system \nis a pay-as-you-go program. But as the record will show, that is not \nthe case. In fact, Senator Patrick Moynihan and I were the ones who \noffered an amendment to put Social Security on a pay-as-you-go basis, \nbut that effort was defeated.\n  Moreover, in 1990 the distinguished former Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator John Heinz, and I, were successful in passing legislation \nforbidding the use of Social Security trust funds to mask the size of \nthe deficit. It remains on the books as section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act. Thus, I might point out that what Mr. Krauthammer \ncalls a fiction and a fraud is actually a law that was signed by \nPresident George Bush on November 5, 1990.\n  Mr. Krauthammer knows full well the Congress would never have voted \nthe tax increases for Social Security in 1983 if these revenues were to \nbe used to spend on foreign aid, welfare, or the deficit. He disregards \nthe representation by the sponsors of the balanced budget amendment \nthat Social Security trust funds will be protected. He disregards the \nformal resolution by Senator Dole, the majority leader, requiring that \nthe Budget Committee demonstrate how the budget can be balanced without \nusing Social Security funds. He disregards the formal statutory law \nthat requires this, and he fails to mention that the two Senators he \nchastises joined with three others in a formal letter of commitment to \nvote for the balanced budget amendment if the protection for Social \nSecurity were included.\n  To quote Mr. Krauthammer, ``A neat trick. A complete fraud.'' That is \nthe trick and that is the fraud that has ensued here within the \nNational Government.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at this point an article entitled, ``Stop Playing Games With \nSocial Security'' \n[[Page S3829]] that appeared in the Columbia, SC, ``The State'' as of \nyesterday, March 12, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Stop Playing Games With Social Security\n\n                      (By Senator Fritz Hollings)\n\n       ``Nobody, Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, \n     moderate, is even thinking about using Social Security to \n     balance the budget.''--Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``Face the \n     Nation,'' Feb. 2\n       In the recent weeks of floor debate and television \n     interviews, many senators repeatedly pledged not to use \n     Social Security funds to balance the budget.\n       They even passed an amendment by Senate Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole to instruct the Budget Committee to develop a budget \n     that didn't use Social Security funds but would conform with \n     the constitutional balanced-budget amendment.\n       In the meantime, while Dole was struggling to pick up one \n     vote to pass the amendment, five Democrats vowed they were \n     ready, willing and able to vote for Social Security. In fact, \n     the night before the vote, the five sent Dole a letter of \n     commitment to vote for the amendment if Social Security were \n     protected.\n       On March 2, the constitutional amendment failed by one \n     vote. And over that weekend on ``Face the Nation'' Dole again \n     reaffirmed his intent on Social Security when he said, ``We \n     are going to protect Social Security.''\n       If he remains that committed, why did he refuse to put his \n     word on the line in black and white on March 2 and pass a \n     constitutional amendment by at least 70 votes? Because he \n     knew that accepting the five Democratic votes would have cost \n     him an equal number of votes of Republicans determined to \n     spend Social Security surpluses on the deficit.\n       Dole didn't want to expose his Republican troops or expose \n     the truth. While Republican rhetoric pledged to protect \n     Social Security, Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Budget \n     Committee, and other Republicans were telling Dole that the \n     budget could not be balanced without using Social Security \n     surplus funds.\n       All of this word-battling--of saying one thing in public \n     and trying to work around it in private--has led Americans to \n     believe that there is a free lunch, that all we have to do to \n     eliminate the deficit is to cut spending. The vote on Social \n     Security exposes this myth.\n       Republican senators have no real intent on eliminating the \n     deficit; they just want to move it from the federal \n     government to Social Security.\n       Currently, Section 13.301 of the Budget Enforcement Act \n     prohibits the use of Social Security funds for the deficit. \n     But part of the balanced-budget amendment would repeal \n     current law.\n       Even with all the promises tendered to correct Social \n     Security with future legislation, any civics student knows \n     you can't amend the Constitution with legislation. That's why \n     the five Democrats--me included--insisted on including Social \n     Security protection in the wording of the constitutional \n     amendment.\n       Dole's stonewalling against our five votes on the \n     constitutional amendment reveals another harsh truth: $1.8 \n     trillion in spending cuts is necessary to balance the budget \n     in seven years. But many senators reveal their intent to use \n     Social Security surpluses when they state that only $1.2 \n     trillion is necessary.\n       Let's face realities: There won't be enough cuts in \n     entitlements. A jobs program for welfare reform will cost. \n     Savings here are questionable.\n       You can and should save some on health reform, but slowing \n     the growth of health costs from 10 percent to 5 percent still \n     means increased costs. Social Security won't be cut, and any \n     savings by increasing the age of retirement would be \n     allocated to the trust fund, not the deficit.\n       Both the GOP's ``Contract with America'' and President \n     Clinton have called for increases in defense spending. \n     Results: No savings.\n       Therefore, savings must come from spending freezes and cuts \n     in the domestic discretionary budget.\n       Coupling these cuts and freezes with a closing of tax \n     loopholes still isn't enough to meet the target of a balanced \n     budget in seven years. That's why Domenici has determined \n     that Social Security funds will have to be used.\n       But using Social Security won't eliminate the deficit. It \n     simply would increase the amount we owe Social Security. \n     Already we owe $470 billion to the trust fund. If we keep \n     raiding it, the government will owe Social Security more than \n     $1 trillion by 2002.\n       Harsh realities. But there's a fifth and even harsher \n     reality. All of the spending cuts in the world aren't \n     politically attainable now. Domenici knows it's hard to get \n     votes for enough cuts. To his credit, he tried in 1986 with a \n     long list of cuts by President Reagan and the Grace \n     Commission. But he got only 14 votes in the Senate.\n       Rep. Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican, also tried a \n     list of $1 trillion in cuts just a year ago in the House. He \n     got only 73 votes of 435.\n       In addition, the problem of balancing the budget with \n     spending reductions is exacerbated by the ``Contract With \n     America's'' call for a $500 billion tax cut.\n       The reality today is that a combination of cuts, freezes, \n     loophole closings and tax increases must be cobbled together \n     to put us on a glide path to balancing the budget. Now is the \n     time to stop the finger-pointing, the blaming of the other \n     guy. Now is the time to stop dancing around the fire of \n     changes in the process.\n       It's a pure sham to think that a constitutional balanced-\n     budget amendment will give Congress discipline.\n       If you put a gun to the head of Congress, it will get more \n     creative. The proof is in the pudding that's being cooked all \n     over town.\n       Some tout abolishing departments, like Commerce and \n     Education. But their functions would continue somewhere. \n     Others say send everything back to the states. But that way, \n     the states would pick up deficits instead of the federal \n     government.\n       Of course we know some want to use $636 billion in Social \n     Security funds. And there's talk of picking up $150 billion \n     by recomputing the Consumer Price Index and another $150 \n     billion of re-estimating the growth of Medicare and Medicaid.\n       There are even those who want one-time savings, like \n     selling the electric power grid or switching to the capital \n     budget system.\n       In other words, there are people throughout town who are \n     figuring out ways to make the federal budget appear balanced \n     with hardly any cuts. With a balanced-budget amendment, they \n     would be able to play this game for seven years.\n       Time out!\n       The gamesmanship, the charade, must stop. If this nonsense \n     goes on for seven years, the United States will be down the \n     tubes.\n       For all the talk about eliminating the deficit, the debt \n     snowballs. Why? Because we add $1 billion a day to the debt \n     by borrowing to pay interest.\n       In January and throughout February, I offered 110 spending \n     cuts or eliminations from domestic discretionary spending. \n     This was worth $37 billion in the first year and put deficit \n     reduction on the glide path toward a balanced budget by 2002.\n       But even if these politically impossible cuts were agreed \n     upon, the interest cost on the debt is growing at more than \n     $40 billion a year.\n       The United States is in a downward budget spiral and we are \n     meeting ourselves coming around the corner. Like the Queen in \n     ``Alice in Wonderful'' told Alice: ``It takes all the running \n     you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get \n     somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as \n     that!''\n       Let's get past all the shenanigans. Let's include Social \n     Security protection in the balanced-budget amendment. Then we \n     could pass the amendment and get down to the hard work of \n     balancing the budget.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this article brings right into true \nfocus exactly what is going on.\n  If, as Mr. Krauthammer says in this particular article, it was just \n``a fiction'', then why not just include this exception in the language \nof the constitutional amendment?\n  The distinguished leaders of the legislation willingly accepted an \nexception for borrowed funds. The distinguished leaders of the balanced \nbudget amendment willingly accepted the provision dealing judicial \nenforcement in order to pick up the one vote of the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Why, Madam President, did they not accept five votes when all they \nhad to do was put in black and white what they were publicly saying? \nThere are five Senators who are ready, willing, and able to vote for a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget if they include a \nprovision protecting Social Security funds.\n  The real flip-floppers are those who have abandoned their position \ntaken in 1990 that Social Security funds should not be used in deficit \ncalculations. It is very difficult to get that message out, but we will \nkeep hammering. The distinguished majority leader says that he will \ncontinue to bring this up. I look forward to that debate and can \nlikewise promise that this Senator will continue to push for language \nthat excludes Social Security from deficit calculations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3827-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3829-S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       EULOGY TO GLEN P. WOODARD\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Glen P. Woodard, the former vice president \nand director of community affairs for Winn-Dixie Food Stores, died on \nJanuary 25, 1995, after an extended illness. As Winn-Dixie's community \naffairs director, Glen was widely known by food industry leaders and \npoliticians for his handling of legislative and regulatory activities \nat both the State and national levels.\n  He moved to Florida at a young age, attending high school there and \ncollege at the University of Florida. He served in the U.S. Air Force \n306 Bomb Group during World War II. Prior to joining \n[[Page S3830]] Winn-Dixie in 1957, he was executive secretary of the \nFlorida Petroleum Industries for 11 years. In 1981, he was named \nGroceryman of the Year by the Retail Grocers Association of Florida.\n  At his funeral on January 28, Robert O. Aders, former president of \nthe Food Marketing Institute, gave a warm and moving eulogy to his good \nfriend, Glen Woodard. It captures Glen's sharp wit, down-home \npersonality, and wonderful good-natured philosophy. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of this excellent tribute be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Eulogy to Glen Woodard\n\n                          (By Robert O. Aders)\n\n       Glen, it is an honor to be invited to eulogize you. It is \n     not the first time that I or others have praised you in \n     public but it is the first time you won't have the last word. \n     I speak on behalf of myself and Tabitha and your other close \n     friends in the industry that you have served so well for so \n     many years--on behalf of your many associates in FMI and \n     other groups in Washington and the State capitols with whom \n     you have worked to improve food system and the supermarket \n     industry--to improve the quality of government--and to \n     improve the relationships between industry and government--in \n     order to better serve the public. We have enjoyed \n     considerable success in all these things and you have truly \n     left your mark. You have made a difference. And today we \n     celebrate your life.\n       We all lead our lives on many levels--our home, our church, \n     our country, daily work, recreation. So did Glen Woodard. I \n     would like to say a few words on behalf of those who knew him \n     mostly in his Washington life, that part of his Winn-Dixie \n     career where some of us in this room were his extended \n     family. Glen was born in Washington, D.C.--says so in the \n     Jacksonville newspaper so it must be true. But Glen always \n     denied that. He didn't want to be a Washington insider. \n     Instead Glen told a Supermarket News reporter who asked where \n     he was born:\n       ``Born in North Georgia in 1917, RFD 1, Clermont. Go out \n     from Gainesville, turn left at Quillens store, going toward \n     the Wahoo Church, and then past there up toward Dahlonega. We \n     lived there till the Grand Jury met--then moved to Florida.''\n       My friendship with Glen goes back a long way. We both \n     joined the supermarket industry 38 years ago. In 1957 Glen \n     joined Winn-Dixie and I joined Kroger--he as a lobbyist, I as \n     a lawyer.\n       These were the good old days of smaller government but it \n     was growing and soon Kroger decided to form a government \n     relations department. I was chosen to do it. We were going to \n     lobby and all I knew about that was what you had to go \n     through when you check into a hotel. Then\n      I got lucky. The American Retail Federation was holding a \n     regional conference in Springfield, Illinois, and the \n     already-famous Glen Woodard was the featured speaker on \n     ``lobbying.'' Glen spoke on the nitty-gritty of working \n     with government--the day-to-day task of dealing with small \n     problems so they don't get big--the same way we all deal \n     with our family and business problems. He spoke on the \n     day-to-day things that government does, wittingly or \n     unwittingly, that impose a great burden on business. While \n     business is focusing on the big issues we tend to ignore \n     the minor day-to-day interferences that cost us money and \n     slow us down. The title of his speech was repeated at just \n     the right time throughout his presentation, in that \n     patented stentorian voice. It was ``While you are watching \n     out for the eagles you are being pecked to death by the \n     ducks.'' And that was my introduction to the famous Glen \n     Woodard vocabulary and the beginning of a long \n     professional relationship as well as a personal \n     friendship.\n       To Glen, a Congressman or a Senator was always addressed as \n     ``my spiritual advisor.'' Glen Woodard's world was not \n     populated by lawyers, accountants and ordinary citizens but \n     by ``skin 'em and cheat 'ems,'' ``shiny britches,'' and \n     ``snuff dippers.'' These people don't merely get excited they \n     have ``rollin' of the eyes'' and ``jerkin' of the navel.'' \n     Colorful he was. But Glen needed that light-hearted \n     perspective to survive, for Glen was in the middle of what is \n     now called ``that mess in Washington'' from Presidents \n     Eisenhower to Clinton. Working his contacts, talking to \n     representatives and senators, walking his beat--those endless \n     marble corridors of power--doing as he put it ``the work of \n     the Lord.'' And, indeed, his work affected the law of the \n     land.\n       And, indeed, that work was made a lot more fun for all of \n     us by Glen's marvelous sense of humor and his wonderful \n     delivery. I remember a meeting a few years ago with a top \n     official in the Treasury Department. We had been stymied for \n     years trying to change a ridiculous IRS regulation because of \n     the stubbornness of one particular bureaucrat. One day Glen \n     broke the logjam as follows: ``Jerry, I had occasion to pay \n     you a high compliment when I was with the Chairman of the \n     Ways and Means Committee last week. I said you were just \n     great with numbers. In fact, you're the biggest 2-timin'. 4-\n     flushin', SOB I've ever known.'' He got the point and the \n     rule was changed.\n       With all his blunt talk and tough wit, he was a kind and \n     generous man. In fact, my wife described him when she first \n     met him as courtly and gallant. That was at a luncheon at the \n     Grand Old Opry years ago. My mother was also present and Glen \n     was with his beloved Miss Ann. My mother was so charmed that \n     for the rest of her life she always asked me ``How is that \n     wonderful gentleman from Winn-Dixie that you introduced me to \n     in Nashville.'' Of course, Tab got to know the total Glen \n     over the ensuing years at the many private dinners the three \n     of us enjoyed when Glen was in Washington and had a free \n     evening.\n       Those of us who worked at the Food Marketing Institute \n     during Glen Woodard's career knew the many facets of this \n     fine man. Always with us when we needed him, he was a brother \n     to me and he was Uncle Glen to the young people on the staff.\n       Those young people he mentored over the years--young people \n     now mature--carry the principles and values that he lived and \n     taught. Here are some of them:\n       Integrity--stick to your principles.\n       Strength and toughness--take a position and stand on it.\n       Work ethic--It may not be fun at first. If you work hard \n     enough you'll enjoy it.\n       Responsibility--Take it. Most people duck it.\n       Generosity--Take the blame; share the credit.\n       Reliability--Say what you'll do and then do it.\n       Fairness--It isn't winning if you cheat.\n       And finally, Grace under pressure.\n       On behalf of those young people, Glen, I say you brought a \n     great deal of nobility to our day-to-day lives and you made \n     us feel worthwhile.\n       A few years ago we tricked Glen into coming to a \n     testimonial dinner on his behalf. He thought it was for \n     someone else. The dinner menu was designed especially to \n     Glen's taste. He always said he was sick of over-cooked beef, \n     rubber chicken and livers wrapped in burnt bacon. So we had a \n     Glen Woodard menu prepared at one of the fanciest private \n     clubs in Washington--The F Street Club. Their kitchen staff \n     will never forget it. We had country ham,\n      redeye gravy and biscuits with collard greens. We had cat \n     fish, hush puppies and cole slaw. All the condiments were \n     served in their original containers--ketchup in the \n     bottle, mustard in the jar, and alongside each table in a \n     silver ice bucket we had Glen's cheap rose' wine in a \n     screw-top bottle.\n       The FMI staff had prepared a special plaque for this man \n     who already had a wall covered with plaques, but this was \n     different and it expressed how the staff felt about him. It \n     went this way: ``FMI to Glen P. Woodard, the Best There Is.''\n       For nearly 30 years you have served your company and our \n     industry in the area of public affairs with unparalleled \n     skill and devotion. Currently chairman of the FMI Government \n     Relations Committee, recent Chairman of the FMI Fall \n     Conference, untiring laborer in the vineyards of government \n     on behalf of the American food system, you have accomplished \n     mightily for our industry.\n       We salute your dedication, your knowledge, your wit and \n     your style. And we treasure your friendship. You are, indeed, \n     The Best There Is. And we love you. Washington, D.C., October \n     22, 1985.\n       And that still goes Glen, old buddy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3829-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the impression will not go away: The \nenormous Federal debt greatly resembles the well-known energizer bunny \nwe see, and see, and see on television. The Federal debt keeps going \nand going and going--always at the expense, of course, of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  A lot of politicians talk a good game--when they are back home--about \nbringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But so \nmany of these same politicians regularly voted in support of bloated \nspending bills during the 103d Congress--which may have been one factor \nin the new configuration of U.S. Senators for the 104th Congress.\n  There is a rather distressing fact as the 104th Congress moves along: \nAs of\n Friday, March 10, 1995, the Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at \nexactly $4,847,327,170.23 or $18,400.54 per person.\n\n  Mr. President, my hope is that the 104th Congress can bring under \ncontrol the outrageous spending that created this outrageous debt.

RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last Friday marked the official last day of \nduty for our Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Richard C. Halverson. I want \nto take just a moment to pay tribute to his service to the Senate as an \ninstitution and a word of thanks for his ministry to Senators as \nindividuals.\n  [[Page S3831]] Dr. Halverson came to us in 1981 after an already \ndistinguished pastorate at Bethesda's Fourth Presbyterian Church. \nThere, as here, he tried to build a strong community--a community that \nsupported each other and strengthened each other's faith.\n  Dr. Halverson was not a spiritual leader as much as he was a \nspiritual coalition builder. He knew that the needs of Senators were so \nunique that any chaplain had to do more than pray for us once a day. He \nknew that cultivating faith and goodwill required more than the skills \nof a single professional clergyman. That Reverend Halverson led us to \nappreciate and seek out the spiritual strengths in each other was \nperhaps his greatest achievement as chaplain.\n  To those who view the Senate on C-SPAN or even from the inside \nvantage point of the press galleries, the office of Senate Chaplain may \nappear to be superfluous. But, Dr. Halverson's gentle outreach to all \nSenators--of both parties and of all religious denominations--made the \nchaplaincy a living example of exactly the kind of men and women we all \nstrive to be: kind, forgiving, honorable, and joyful. I believe that \nmost Americans support the idea that these qualities ought to exist \nsomewhere in the hustle and bustle of what goes on under this great \nCapitol dome.\n  I, for one, will miss hearing his cheerful ``God bless you'' when \npassing him in the corridors. There is not a one of us here who would \nnot admit to feeling better upon hearing that; sometimes it changed the \nperspective of the entire day.\n  His ministry here has been well-served and now his retirement is \nwell-deserved. I wish to join all Senators in wishing Dr. Halverson a \nrewarding and happy retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3830-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   TIME FOR COMMON COURTESY: WELCOME TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT TO OUR SHORES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am happy to participate in calling the \nSenate's attention to a travesty in the modern conduct of U.S. foreign \nrelations. The question all Americans should confront is, how and when \ndid the United States reach the point in United States-Taiwanese \nrelations that United States foreign policy could possibly forbid a \nvisit to the United States by the highest-ranking, democratically \nelected citizen of Taiwan?\n  Though I seldom disagree with Ronald Reagan--I did strongly disagree \non a few occasions and one of those was when President Reagan's \nadvisors made a bad decision--one which so jeopardized our relations \nwith Taiwan by cuddling up to the brutal dictators in Beijing.\n  Since that time, the United States has been forced to hide behind a \ndiplomatic screen to demonstrate our commitment and loyalty to the \nTaiwanese people.\n  Mr. President, at the time President Reagan's advisers cast their lot \nwith the Red Chinese Government, Congress was promised that the United \nStates would nonetheless continue to ``preserve and promote extensive, \nclose and friendly * * * relations'' with the people on Taiwan. But one \nadministration after another failed to live up to that promise.\n  How in the world could any one consider it close and friendly to \nrequire the President of Taiwan to sit in his plane on a runway in \nHonolulu while it was refueled? I find it hard to imagine that United \nStates relations with Red China would have come to a standstill because \na weekend visit to the United States by Taiwan's President Lee was \nallowed.\n  The President's China policy is in poor shape at this point--even \nmembers of Mr. Clinton's team recognize that. So, how can anyone really \npretend that allowing President Lee to travel to his alma mater--or to \nvacation in North Carolina--would send our already precarious relations \nwith Red China plummeting over the edge?\n  Last time I checked the mainland Chinese were obviously and \nunderstandably enjoying their relations with the United States a great \ndeal. We would be enjoying them, too, if only American taxpayers could \nbe benefiting to the tune of $30 billion every year as a result of \nUnited States trading with Red China.\n  Time and again, the U.S. Congress has urged the administration to \ngrant President Lee a visa. We have even amended United States \nimmigration law so that it now specifically mentions the President of \nTaiwan. Congress has passed resolution after resolution encouraging the \nPresident to allow President Lee into the United States for a visit. \nAll to no avail.\n  Now's the time, Mr. President, We encourage you to allow President \nLee to visit the United States when he so chooses. Bear in mind that \nsome of us in Congress will never cease our support for one of \nAmerica's greatest allies, the oldest democracy in the Asian region--\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Massachusetts withhold \nso that we can go back to the pending business?\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, during the course of our discussion \nlast week about the action of the President of the United States in \nissuing the Executive order on the permanent replacement of striking \nworkers, there were a number of issues that were raised. One was the \nquestion of whether the President had the authority and the power to \nissue the Executive order; a second was whether there was a sound \npublic policy rationale to do so. I would like to take a few moments of \nthe Senate's time this afternoon to address those issues specifically, \nand then to make some additional general comments.\n  Madam President, I understand that earlier in the course of the \nSenate session there may have been a statement by the majority leader \nas to how we were going to proceed on the Kassebaum amendment. We \ninitially had the cloture vote called for at 5:30 this afternoon but \nnow that vote will occur on Wednesday at a time to be worked out by the \nleaders. I believe that I am correct. That is my understanding as how \nwe are going to proceed. I was inquiring of staff whether that had \nactually been announced in the Senate for the benefit of the \nmembership. Could I make that inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent was obtained to postpone the vote on \nthe Kassebaum amendment to Wednesday, March 15 at 10:30 a.m..\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, when we debated the issue of permanent striker \nreplacement last year and again on the floor last week, our opponents \nargued that the use of permanent replacements is too infrequent to \njustify a legislative response. But the tens of thousands of workers \naround the country who have lost their jobs for exercising their legal \nright to strike bear witness to the need for action. Study after study \nhas shown that the permanent replacement of strikers has exploded, and \nthat the use--or threat of use--of permanent replacement is now a \nroutine practice in collective bargaining negotiations. I \n[[Page S3832]] took a few moments when we were meeting last Friday with \ncharts to demonstrate the rather dramatic increase in the utilization \nof permanent strike replacements in recent years.\n  In a survey of employer bargaining objectives conducted by the Bureau \nof National Affairs earlier this year, an incredible 82 percent of the \nemployers surveyed said that if their employees went on strike, they \nwould attempt to replace them, or would consider doing so. And of those \nemployers, more than one in four said the replacements would be \npermanent.\n  The historical evidence also leaves no doubt that this has become a \nserious problem, and that it is getting worse. Let me just review for a \nmoment the results of a study by Teresa Anderson-Little of the \neconomics department at Notre Dame University.\n  By searching through electronic data bases, published legal articles, \nand National Labor Relations Board case reports, Ms. Anderson-Little \nwas able to identify 632 strikes involving the use of permanent \nreplacements which occurred between 1935 and 1991--the largest data \nbase of any of the studies that have been conducted to date. Her \nresearch confirms that the use of permanent replacements was extremely \nrare in the first 40 years following passage of the National Labor \nRelations Act, and that the increase has been dramatic in recent years.\n  From 1935 through 1973, there were on average only six strikes per \nyear in which employers hired permanent replacements. But beginning in \n1974 and continuing through 1980, the average number of strikes per \nyear involving permanent replacements nearly triples. And from 1981--\nthe year President Reagan permanently replaced the striking PATCO \nworkers--through 1991, the average rose to 24 strikes per year--4 times \nthe average prior to the mid-1970's.\n  Our opponents like to claim that the ability of employers to \npermanently replace workers helps to promote more cooperative labor-\nmanagement relations, and prevent disruptions to the economy caused by \nstrikes. But Ms. Anderson-Little's study also confirmed that the use of \npermanent replacements significantly prolongs strikes and prevents \ndisputes from being settled.\n  While the average duration of all strikes in the United States has \nhistorically ranged from 2\\1/2\\ to 4 weeks, strikes involving permanent \nreplacements have consistently lasted an average of 7 times long as \nstrikes where permanent replacements were not hired.\n  Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics stopped keeping comprehensive \ndata on strike duration in the 1980's, Ms. Anderson-Little's findings \ninvolved strikes only through the end of the 1970's. However, studies \ninvolving more limited samplings of strikes during the 1980's and \n1990's affirm the impact of striker replacements on strike duration.\n  Using a GAO-compiled data base of strikes that occurred in 1985 and \n1989, Professors Cynthia Gramm and Jonathan Schnell of the University \nof Alabama found that the mean duration of a permanent replacement \nstrike was three times as long as the mean duration of strikes where \npermanent replacements were not used.\n  A survey of strikes involving members of the Steelworkers Union from \n1990 to the present found that where temporary replacements were used, \nthe average duration of an economic strike was 121.9 days, but when the \nemployer hired permanent replacements, average strike duration \nlengthened to 284.1 days.\n  Why is that strikes involving permanent replacements last so long? \nThe answer is that once permanent replacements are hired, the union and \nthe employer are immediately placed at opposite extremes on the issue \nof reinstatement of strikers, which becomes the sole topic of \nbargaining. Since it is an irreconcilable issue, the strike continues \nuntil either the union or the employer concedes.\n  The union finds it impossible to give in, since accepting the \nemployer's position means by definition that the employees have been \nreplaced and can't have their old jobs back. The employer, for its \npart, has little incentive to capitulate once it has hired and made \ncommitments to new, permanent workers.\n  Studies like the Gramm-Schnell study have consistently found that \nemployers now hire permanent replacements in 20 percent of all strikes, \nand threaten to hire replacements in another 15 percent of strikes.\n  The notion that we can sit back and let this practice continue \nbecause workers are permanently replaced in only 1 out of 5 strikes is \nboth heartless and absurd. Every single worker who is permanently \nreplaced is one too many.\n  Lest no one doubt that there are real, flesh-and-blood workers behind \nthese statistics. When we debated this issue last year, we were \npresented with a list of individual names of more than 19,000 strikers \nwho were permanently replaced in strikes that occurred in the eighties \nand early nineties. Those are names from just a limited sample of \nstrikes that occurred during that period. And since last year, the \nnumbers have kept growing.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, at least 450 workers have been \npermanently replaced just since 1988, including workers at ADT Security \nSystems, Brockway Smith, Kraft S.S. Pierce, and Olson Manufacturing.\n  To these workers and their families, this is not some minor issue \nthat is undeserving of congressional attention--this is about their \njobs, their livelihood, their families' future.\n  Lori Pavao, a former nurses' aid at a nursing home in Fall River who \nwas permanently replaced when she and other nurses' aides and members \nof the dietary and housekeeping staff went on strike on 1989, recently \ndescribed her feelings about what happened to her:\n\n       I worked there for 8\\1/2\\ years. A lot of patients were \n     like family to me. I felt lost for awhile. I didn't want to \n     start all over somewhere else.\n       You always hear about people going out on strike and people \n     going back. I just never dreamed that it would be over that \n     way. I thought I was going to retire from the place.\n\n  Although opponents of the President's Executive order make much of \nthat fact that permanently replaced strikers do have the right to be \nplaced on a preferential hire list to be considered for future openings \nif the permanent replacements leave, the fact is that very few workers \nactually do over return to work with their previous employer.\n  And many never recover, financially or emotionally, from the \ndevastating experience of being thrown out of their jobs for exercising \nwhat is supposed to be a legally protected right.\n  Banning the permanent replacement of striking workers has \noverwhelming support not just from labor, but also form religious \ngroups, civil rights groups and women's groups. They understand that \nthis issue is not about some abstract power struggle between big \nbusiness and big labor. This is about real people who are being \ndeprived of the only leverage they have to counteract the enormous \npower that employers have to dictate terms and conditions on the job.\n  This is about workers like the women at Diamond Walnut, who gave \ndecades of their lives to that company, who agreed to 30 percent \npaycuts in their meager wages to help their company survive when it was \nin trouble, and who then were thrown out on the street when the company \nwas back making record profits because of their sacrifice.\n  This is about the workers at Burns Packaging in Kentucky--45 percent \nblack and 40 percent female--who were making $4.70 an hour when they \ndecided to form a Union. What they asked for was a 5 percent increase, \nto just $4.95 an hour, and a grievance and arbitration procedure for \nresolving complaints about unfair treatment. But when they struck after \n6 months of fruitless negotiations at the bargaining table, they were \nimmediately permanently replaced.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The President's Executive order will not change the law \nregarding permanent replacements. But by banning the practice of \npermanent replacements on Federal contracts, it will help to prevent \nthe terrible injustice to working people that is caused by the current \nsystem.\n  In the end, what is at stake here is the standard of living for \nworking men and women. The country has experienced a 20-year decline in \nreal wages. \n[[Page S3833]] Hourly compensation has fallen compared to other major \nindustrial nations.\n  Since the early 1980's, we stand virtually and ominously alone in the \nindustrial world as a Nation where the disparity in income between the \nrich and the poor grew wider. That is not a healthy trend for any \ncountry, and certainly not for ours, which is based on the principle of \nfair opportunity for all.\n  The facts are disturbing. The ratio in earnings between the top 10 \npercent of wage earners and the bottom 10 percent is wider in the \nUnited States than in any other industrial country. The bottom third of \nAmerican workers earn less in terms of purchasing power than their \ncounterparts in other countries.\n  American workers are actually working harder than workers in other \nindustrial nations. The U.S. workers now labor 200 hours more a year \nthan workers in Europe. While vacation and leisure time have increased \nover the past 20 years for Europeans, they have declined for most \nAmericans.\n  Yet, according to the Congressional Budget Office, between 1977 and \n1989, the after-tax income of the top 1 percent of families rose by \nmore than 100 percent, while that of the bottom 20 percent fell nearly \n10 percent.\n  Here we are seeing an extraordinary phenomenon, which is really \nunique in terms of the whole American experience in this centry. For \ndecades, all of us moved along together, as we increased productivity \nand output, and as we adopted new technology and new skills, as we saw \ncorporate profits increase, the standard of living for working families \nalso increased, so that each generation was better off than the past \ngeneration. That is generally what most Americans experienced, it is no \nlonger true for the current generation.\n  We are seeing that working families are working longer and harder, \nand with less to show for it in terms of their real incomes. The only \nfactor that has really enabled families to maintain a stable income \nover the last 15 years is the enormous infusion of second family \nearners--workers' wives, for the most part--into the labor market. It \nis only by having their spouses come into the work force and augmenting \nand supplementing the family's income that working families have been \nable to offset the effects of declining real wages.\n  Now what we are seeing, even with all these women who are wives and \nmothers in the work force, is that families have effectively stagnated \nand real purchasing power, is in decline.\n  That is what is happening. And there is no further adjustment that \nworking families can really make to deal with that problem. Most \nfamilies already have everyone in the family is able to work out there \nworking. So they can't put another family member to work to make up for \nthe fact that in real terms, their wages are declining.\n  Too many of those other members of the family who are trying to go \nout and find work to help supplement the family's income jobs are \nfinding that the only jobs available are minimum wage jobs, and that is \nanother issue which we must address. The real purchasing power and the \nminimum wage continue to decline. So the ability of those other members \nof the family to contribute to the income of the family is reduced. \nThis whole issue presents to the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives the question of whether we are going to truly honor and \nreward work in our society.\n  Are we going to say to people that are prepared to work 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, that you will earn a living wage and have a \nfuture? Or are we going to say that you can be treated like wornout and \nantiquated machinery and put on the junk heap while we hire other \nyounger people that will work for a good deal less in terms of their \nbenefits, because younger people are healthier and they do not have the \nhealth-care costs and needs that older workers do.\n  The phenomenon we are seeing, Mr. President, is that while the after-\ntax income of the top 1 percent of the families rose more than 100 \npercent, that of the bottom 20 percent fell nearly 10 percent. Who are \nthose 20 percent who are seeing their real earnings decline? They are \nthe workers who are out there every single day, playing by the rules, \ndoing their bit and participating. And they are the workers who, if \nthey have the nerve to try to gain another 5, 10, 15 cents an hour in \nwages, are being permanently replaced by their employers. They are the \nones who are taking it on the neck.\n  The President of the United States says that if those companies are \ngoing to go ahead and dismiss those workers and hire permanent \nreplacements for them, we are not going to give them an additional leg \nup by entering into contracts with them that allow them to make profits \nwith taxpayers dollars; we are just not going to do that.\n  And now we have an amendment on the defense appropriations bill which \nseeks to block the President from implementing that policy, an \namendment which is effectively a legislative initiative on an \nappropriations bill, which is not appropriate, and which is tying up \nthe Senate and preventing us from doing our basic work in terms of \ndealing with defense appropriations. Our Republican colleagues have \ninsisted on offering and pressing this amendment. So we are here \nresponding to their arguments.\n  Mr. President, another phenomenon that is happening out there in the \nreal world for workers is that health care for the American workers is \nbecoming increasingly expensive.\n  Union workers who went without pay increases in order to obtain good \nhealth care have seen their health benefits cut back. They have been \nasked to pay greater percentages of health costs. Since 1980, the share \nof workers under 65 with employer-paid health care has dropped from 63 \nto 56 percent. The percent of workers covered by employer-provided \npension plans is also rapidly decreasing.\n  What we are seeing is that the coverage of workers by employers for \ntheir health care costs is on a downward slide. And those pensions that \nwere out there to give workers some degree of additional security so \nthey would be able to live their golden years in peace and dignity are \nalso being cut back. But by God, if you complain about those cutbacks \nthat are taking place every single day across America, off you go--\nyou're permanently replaced, put on the junk heap. And that is what is \nhappening.\n   We have a President who is saying, to the extent that he has the \nauthority and the power, he is going to say ``no'' to the use of \npermanent strike replacements on Federal contracts. That makes a good \ndeal of sense.\n  This President's action on permanent replacements offers us a chance \nto take a stand against all of these disturbing trends: ending the \npractice of permanently replacing workers on Federal contracts will not \nsolve all of the problems of working Americans, but it can help turn \nthe tide, and by affirming this country's commitment to collective \nbargaining, we are reaffirming our commitment to a fair balance between \nlabor and management.\n  We will be standing up for the original historic intent of the labor \nlaws, which have done so much for the country in the past half century. \nThe President's Executive order closes the loophole that undermines \ngood relations between business and labor, and I urge the Senate to \nsupport it and reject the amendment.\n  Mr. President, many of our Republican colleagues have said that they \nare troubled by the President's action in signing the Executive order. \nThey complain that it takes away the rights of Congress.\n  But this is not what they are really concerned about. Not one of \nthem, not even the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], the Senator \nfrom Texas [Mr. Gramm], nor the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], \nnot a single Republican Senator stood up to complain 3 years ago when \nPresident Bush signed an Executive order on project labor agreements \nthat changed the national labor law and prohibited Federal contractors \nfrom doing something the National Labor Relations Act allowed them to \ndo.\n  On October 23, 1992, President Bush signed Executive Order No. 12818, \nwhich prohibited contractors on federally funded construction projects \nfrom entering into otherwise lawful prehire labor agreements. The \nExecutive order prohibited contractors from requiring their \nsubcontractors be bound by their labor agreement, even though section \n8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act explicitly permits such \nagreement. President Bush, unlike President Clinton, overrode an \nexplicit congressional \n[[Page S3834]] statement about national labor policy passed by both \nHouses of Congress and signed into law by the President.\n  Did any Republican complain? No, not a one. Why not? Could it be they \nhave no real concern about the President overriding congressional labor \npolicy as long as the President's actions are anti-union and are \ndesigned to thwart collective bargaining and diminish the power of \nworking Americans? Isn't their only real problem with President \nClinton's Executive order a partisan political problem--that they will \nsupport an activist Republican President but lash out at a Democrat? \nCertainly, there is no consistency of principle amongst our Republican \nfriends who are attacking the President now.\n  Every Republican who voted for S. 55 is opposing the Executive order \nnow. They are putting partisanship above principle.\n  President Clinton's Executive order does not conflict with an \nexplicit congressional statement of labor policy. There is nothing in \nthe National Labor Relations Act that specifically authorizes the use \nof permanent replacements for strikers. Yet there is a provision in \nsection 8 of the National Labor Relations Act that makes project labor \nagreements legal. So why are the Republicans who were not concerned \nwhen President Bush issued his Executive order on project labor \nagreements now so concerned about President Clinton's order on \npermanent striker replacements?\n  The Republicans are deeply troubled by this order. We heard a great \ndeal about that. We are deeply troubled by the action of President \nClinton. We are deeply troubled by the implication of this Executive \norder. We are deeply troubled by what this is going to mean in terms of \nlabor relations. We are deeply troubled that somehow we are interfering \nin the balance between workers and management. We are all deeply \ntroubled.\n  Well, none of them was deeply troubled at the time when a Republican \nPresident issued an Executive order which was in conflict with the \nNational Labor Relations Act. No, none of them were deeply troubled at \nthat time. A Senator who truly finds President Clinton's action \ntroubling would have been far more troubled by President Bush's much \nmore direct challenge to congressional authority.\n  No, the problem is not the President's authority. Congress gave the \nPresident clear authority to control the practices of Federal \ncontractors in the Federal Property Administrative Services Act, 40 \nU.S.C 471. As the Justice Department's legal analysis points out, that \nauthority is broad-ranging.\n  As that legal analysis states:\n\n       We have no doubt, for example, that section 486(a) grants \n     the President authority to issue a directive that prohibits \n     executive agencies from entering into a contract with \n     contractors who use a particular machine that the President \n     has deemed less reliable than others that are available. \n     Contractors that use the less reliable machines are less \n     likely to deliver quality goods or produce their goods in a \n     timely manner.\n       We see no distinction between this hypothetical order in \n     which the President prohibits procuring from contractors that \n     use machines that he deems unreliable and one that the \n     President actually issued which would bar procurement from \n     contractors that use labor relations techniques that the \n     President deemed to be generally unreliable, especially when \n     the Secretary of Labor or the contracting agency's head each \n     confirm the validity of generalization in each specific case.\n\n  Mr. President, this issue is related as well to the debate that we \nhave had in the past, and I am sure will have again in the course of \nthis Congress, about the Davis-Bacon law which was initiated by \nRepublicans and has been the law of the land for more than 60 years. \nAttempts will be made to repeal it.\n  The Republicans say, ``Look, instead of requiring federal contractors \nto pay prevailing wages, we can actually save the Federal Government \nsome money by letting those wages slide down, slide down, slide down, \nso that the contracting can be done at less cost to the taxpayer.''\n  Well, that argument has a sort of superficial logic to it, but as \nformer Secretary of Labor John Dunlop has commented--and Professor \nDunlop is not a Democrat but a Republican, and one of the foremost \nlabor economists in the country--as former Secretary Dunlop has argued, \nit is a very shortsighted way of viewing what is really going to be in \nthe public's interest, in the taxpayers' interest, over the long run.\n  You cannot assume, Professor Dunlop points out, that overall project \ncosts are going to be lower just because the dollars you are paying in \nwages to the workers are lower. What you have to look at is the overall \nissue of productivity and quality and the ability to deliver a good \nproduct on time. That ought to be obvious to all of us. And John \nDunlop's basic posture and position is that it is delusional to believe \nthat just by finding people that are going to work for a lesser cost \nthan the prevailing wage, that somehow you are going to be able to save \nmillions or hundreds of millions of dollars, some even estimate it as \nhigh as billions of dollars, in terms of taxpayers' funds. What is \ngoing to happen is you are going to get inferior products not delivered \non time and of poor quality. And someone is going to have to make that \nup, and it is going to be the taxpayer who is going to pay a good deal \nmore.\n  We are talking about the same concept, Mr. President, here in terms \nof the President's Executive order on the use of permanent replacements \nby Federal contractors. All we are saying is that, with regard to the \nPresident's Executive order, he does not want to use the contracting \nauthority of the Federal Government to enter into contracts with \ncontractors that are going to have permanent striker replacements.\n  Why? Because those permanent replacements are unlikely to have the \nskills, the background, the experience, the techniques, the knowledge \nand the know-how to deliver good products on time which they would be \ncharged to do. And rather than taking that chance, in terms of \nprotecting the taxpayers' interest in it, he is not going to \nparticipate in that.\n  I think that is sound common sense and is a sound action in terms of \nprotecting the financial interests of the United States. And it is a \nsound social policy in terms of trying to give some respect to those \nindividuals who are working hard, playing by the rules, who believe \nthat under the National Labor Relations Act it is still the law that \nyou cannot fire someone who strikes and that therefore it makes no \nsense to say that a striker can be permanently replaced.\n  It makes absolutely no common sense to say that you cannot fire \nstrikers but you can permanently replace them. And the workers of this \ncountry are fortunate to have a President who understands that the use \nof permanent replacments is at odds with what the basic principles of \nthe National Labor Relations Act and with the system of collective \nbargaining that has served this country well over many decades.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will not hear any more manufactured \noutrage about the President's Executive order. The President has \nfollowed precedents established by President Bush. He is fully within \nthe authority granted him by Congress to control the Federal \nprocurement process. The real issue for his critics is his support for \nworking Americans and labor organizations, and not the process he has \nused to accomplish it.\n  Now, Mr. President, over the course of the debate in these past days, \nwe have heard various arguments that preventing employers from \npermanently replacing strikers would encourage strikes and upset the \nbalance in labor-management relations by somehow ensuring that unions \nwould always win a strike situation, the President's Executive order. I \nthought it would be worthwhile just to take a few moments to review \nthese arguments and also to respond to them so that the Senate record \nwould reflect my view of the answers to these questions.\n  One of the first questions is, would a ban on permanent replacements \ninevitably lead to more strikes? No, Mr. President, I do not believe \nthat it would. Even without the threat of permanent replacement, a \nstrike has always been a serious matter for workers and their families. \nWorkers do not lightly choose to forgo their wages, walk the picket \nlines for days, weeks, or months; deplete or exhaust their life savings \nand become dependent upon \n[[Page S3835]] the charity of others. Workers are especially reluctant \nto take on these sacrifices because it is never certain that a strike \nwill accomplish their goal.\n  Apart from the economic disincentives, a strike imposes a great \nemotional strain on families, friendships, and on the fabric of local \ncommunity life. A strike is a last resort that no one undertakes \nlightly. It is wrong to suggest that workers will walk out on their \njobs simply because they cannot be permanently replaced.\n   Workers do not enter into strikes out of any desire or expectation \nthat they will cause permanent hardship to the employer. Workers expect \nto return after the strike. They have every interest in the long-term \nprosperity of their employer.\n  If anything, the use of permanent replacements is what produces \nlonger, more bitter strikes, by transforming the dispute from a dispute \nabout wages and benefits into a battle over the future of every \nstriker's job. These are the hardest disputes to settle, and last the \nlongest time.\n  Many strikes today occur precisely because the employer has the \npossibility of permanently replacing the work force. The employer has \nlittle incentive to engage in meaningful bargaining with the union when \nthe alternative is either that the union surrenders to the employer's \ndemands, or there is a strike that enables the employer to replace the \nwork force, break the union, and escape the necessity of bargaining \naltogether.\n  Maybe strikes would be avoided if the employers did not have the \ntemptation of permanently replacing their work force. That, Mr. \nPresident, really says it. If the employer understands that he has the \noption to replace all the workers, he has very little interest in \ntrying to resolve the dispute. But if the employer has an interest in \ntrying to resolve the dispute then it is logical to assume that the \ndisruption would be held to a minimal amount of time.\n  You cannot read or hear the real-life stories of individuals that \nhave been permanently replaced without being struck by the fact that \ninvariably those workers talk about how they wanted to continue working \nfor their employer--how they had every hope and intention of remaining \nwith that employer as long as they were able to work. That is a common \nexpression, a common view, a common opinion that runs through the \nstories of the vast majority of those workers.\n  Next, would prohibiting the permanent replacement of strikers \nguarantee that unions will win every strike? This is a concern raised \nby those who argue that somehow we are changing the rules in such a way \nas to upset the whole balance between the workers and the employers and \nguarantee that one side rather than the other would always win.\n  The fact is that employers win many strikes in which no permanent \nreplacements are hired or threatened to be hired. A prohibition on \npermanent replacements would certainly not ensure that the union always \nprevailed in an economic strike.\n  Employers have many ways to maintain production and revenues during a \nstrike. They can hire temporary replacements. They can use nonstriking \nemployees, managers, and supervisors to do the work; they can hire \nsubcontractors to do the work; and they can rely on stockpiled \ninventory. All of those techniques have been used in the past with \nconsiderable success by employers. Through these and other means, \nemployers avoid the hiring of permanent replacements in the majority of \nstrikes today. Prohibition on the use of permanent replacements leaves \nin place many significant limitations of what workers may do during a \nstrike. Unions would remain unable to engage in secondary boycotts and \nwould continue to be subject to stringent picket line restrictions.\n  Will a ban on permanent replacements unfairly deprive employers of a \nlegitimate self-help option? No, because the hiring of permanent \nreplacements should not be viewed as a legitimate form of employer \nself-help.\n   The National Labor Relations Act calls for controlled conflict \nbetween labor and management. There are principles of fairness that \nlimit each side's right to engaging in self-help activity. Thus, unions \nare not permitted to engage in secondary boycotts or picket line \nviolence during a strike, even though each of these activities makes it \neasier for unions to win a strike. Similarly, the hiring of permanent \nreplacements must be viewed as so fundamentally unjust it undermines \nthe basic concept of controlled labor-management conflict.\n  The fact of the matter is that it is not the law of the jungle out \nthere. There are effective restraints in the law already on the tactics \nwhich can be used by parties to a labor dispute, and those restraints \nare respected. But the use of permanent replacements alters and changes \nthis in a very significant way.\n  Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of the Diocese of New York, \ntestified eloquently on this moral dimension of the permanent \nreplacement issue. He said:\n\n       It is useless to speak glowingly in either legal or moral \n     terms about the right to bargain and to strike as a last \n     resort, or even the right to unionize, if either party--\n     management or labor --bargains in bad faith, or in the case \n     of management, with the foreknowledge of being able to \n     permanently replace workers who strike on the primary basis \n     of the strike itself. In my judgment, this can make a charade \n     of collective bargaining and a mockery of the right to \n     strike.\n\n  It could not be said any clearer than Cardinal O'Connor said it in \nthat comment. So compelling, so sensible, so simple in its logic and \nrationale.\n  What is the practice of our foreign competitors with respect to the \nlawfulness of hiring permanent replacements? Often we hear the argument \nthat if we prohibit employers from permanently replacing strikers we \nare going to be disadvantaged in our ability to compete effectively in \ntrade around the world.\n  It is interesting to me to hear this argument invoked so frequently, \nwhen the fact is that every other industrial country provides much more \ngenerous benefits to its workers than we do. Our opponents say we \ncannot have comprehensive health insurance for all Americans because it \nis going to make it difficult for us to compete internationally, but \nall of the other industrial countries of the world have it. They said \nwe could not have family and medical leave because we would not be able \nto compete effectively. But workers in other countries have family and \nmedical leave. In fact, virtually all of them have paid family and \nmedical family leave, except for the United States.\n  Our opponents says we cannot have an effective day care program \nbecause we will not be able to compete, when every other industrial \ncountry of the world has a comprehensive child care system as a matter \nof national policy. Whatever political parties are in power in the \ndemocratic industrial nations, none of the political leaders, none of \nthe political parties is for emasculating programs that reach out to \nthe most vulnerable in society. Contrast that to what is happening now \nin the Contract With America where the Republicans are cutting out \nschool lunch programs, cutting back on day care programs, cutting back \non the WIC Program, cutting back on student aid programs and teacher \nsupport programs, cutting back on housing programs for the homeless.\n  I do not know how many saw that enormously moving story by one of the \nnetworks over the weekend called ``The Feminization of Homelessness,'' \nabout the growing number of women and children in our society affected \nby homelessness and the explosion of in those numbers that is taking \nplace all across this country.\n  Maybe we do not have the existing programs right, and certainly we do \nnot in all circumstances. But we ought to try to find ways of \nimproving, strengthening, and making them more effective--making them \nwork rather than effectively abandoning them.\n  No, we cannot say the benefits we provide to working families are \ndisadvantaging us internationally in our ability to compete. The fact \nof the matter is, the United States lags behind the rest of the world, \nincluding our major competitors, when it comes to the basic democratic \nrights of workers. Our No. 1 trading partner, Canada, does not even \nauthorize permanent replacements for strikers, even though Canada \nadopted the NLRA as a model for its labor laws. Canadian law has \nregularly rejected the Mackay rule as inconsistent with free collective \nbargaining. United States firms operating in Canada are as profitable \nwithout the Mackay rule--which is the rule that \n[[Page S3836]] permits the permanent replacement of strikers--as \nAmerican firms operating under the Mackay rule in the United States.\n  Other major economic competitors--Japan, France, Germany--\ncategorically prohibit the dismissal of striking workers. Employers in \nthese nations recognize the importance of investing in human resources \nand have no desire to rid themselves of the skilled and loyal work \nforces that they have assembled. The employers here who use permanent \nreplacements are harming themselves and their country.\n  Most of the industrial democracies with which we compete--just about \nevery one of them--has a very extensive, continuing training program to \nupgrade the skills of all of their workers. That is true in France, \nGermany, and all of the Western European countries.\n  Ask them how they do it? Are they not concerned that if they train, \ninvest and use some of their profits to train and upgrade their work \nforce that those workers may leave and go to another place? They say, \n``Well, the other companies are doing the same thing.'' And that is why \nwe have seen in the United States, with the exception of some of the \ntop companies, really less than 10 percent of companies who have real \ntraining programs. And most of that training does not go to the workers \non the front line, but to the supervisors and the managers. We do not \nhave a consistent ongoing upgrading and training system for American \nworkers.\n  Other major economic competitors, as I mentioned, categorically \nprohibit the dismissal of striking workers. Even in the nations of \nEastern Europe, which we applaud for their emerging democratic \nunionism, workers who strike do not lose their jobs.\n  What happened to the machinists at Eastern Air Lines did not happen \nto the shipyard workers at Gdansk and what happened to the coal miners \nat Massie Coal Co. did not happen to the coal miners in Eastern Europe. \nIf we are prepared to extol the virtues of the trade union abroad, we \nshould be willing to restore a level playing field for collective \nbargaining at home.\n  Mr. President, I see some of our other colleagues on the floor who \nwant to speak. At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Massachusetts for being understanding \nof the necessary absence of the Senator from Utah. He very much wanted \nto be a part of the debate and the vote and his absence is one of the \nreasons that the cloture vote has been postponed until Wednesday. I \nalso appreciate the understanding of the Democratic leader.\n  There has been a desire from all of you to move ahead. The defense \nsupplemental legislation is an important measure, but it seems to me \nthat we are having a good debate.\n  Mr. President, I would like to explain what this debate is about. \nThis debate is not about the Contract With America. It is not about all \nof the other issues that have been raised, including school lunches and \nchild care. Those are important issues to be debated at another time. \nThe issue before us at this particular moment is an Executive order \nthat President Clinton has issued that says large contractors doing \nbusiness with the Federal Government should be prohibited from hiring \npermanent replacement workers.\n  There are people with strong views on both sides of the striker \nreplacement issue. I feel that we have debated this issue thoroughly \nduring the past Congress and again in this Congress, and we will be \ndebating it further, I am sure, in years ahead.\n  What troubles me is that the President, through this Executive order, \nis able to change major labor law. The Senator from Massachusetts \nmentioned in his opening comments today that Presidents in the past--\nPresident Bush and President Reagan--issued Executive orders and \nnothing was said. Let me just, once again, go through those three \nExecutive orders and why I believe they are very different from the \nExecutive order that we are debating today, and the amendment which \nwould say that no moneys could be used to implement that Executive \norder.\n  President Reagan issued an Executive order that replaced striking air \ntraffic controllers with permanent replacement workers because the air \ntraffic controllers had been striking illegally. There was never any \nquestion about hiring permanent replacement workers at that time. \nDuring the years following that Executive order there were several \nmeasures debated on the Senate floor about rehiring those striking air \ntraffic controllers which did not pass.\n  President Bush issued one Executive order which required the posting \nin the workplace of all of the rights of employees. This was, by law, \nsomething that should have been done and was not in any way changing \nthe law of the land.\n  The second Executive order issued by President Bush concerned prehire \ncontracts, and that I think is a bit unclear. One of the major \ndifferences between that Executive order and this one is the fact that \nthe prehire contract had never been debated in this Chamber. On the \nother hand the use of permanent striker replacement workers has been an \nissue debated in both the House and Senate at great length.\n  While one may question whether President Bush by Executive order \ncould put into place the rule that prehire contracts could not be \nentered into, it had never been debated by Congress. If we were to have \nchanged it, then Congress, logically, should have been the place to \nmake a change. But the prehire contracts Executive order was never \nchallenged by either the Congress or the Supreme Court.\n  So I think the difference is very clear. This Executive order is \nbeing challenged in Congress and is going to be challenged in the \ncourts. It is by its very nature a troubling effort by the executive \nbranch to, by executive fiat, change what has been the law of the land, \nand a major part of labor law, for some 60 years. This Executive order \nis troubling because, on the one hand, labor's right to strike has been \nupheld, but on the other hand management's right to hire permanent \nreplacement workers, just as much a part of existing labor law, is \nbeing attacked.\n  I would like to quote a paragraph from the lead Washington Post \neditorial this morning. It says:\n\n       The law is contradictory. The National Labor Relations Act \n     says strikers can't be fired; the Supreme Court has \n     nonetheless ruled that they can be permanently replaced. The \n     contradiction may be healthy. By leaving labor and management \n     both at risk, the law gives each an incentive to agree. For \n     most of modern labor history, management in fact has made \n     little use of the replacement power and labor hasn't much \n     protested it.\n\n  Perhaps this is where we are today, trying to ponder this \ncontradiction. We can ask ourselves if, in revisiting the National \nLabor Relations Act we need to address it in some different ways to \nmeet the changing labor markets. The current balance has worked well. \nOn the other hand, I am sympathetic to those who say management should \nnot immediately hire permanent replacement workers because, if that is \nthe case, the employees have lost some leverage which they would have \nwith the right to strike.\n  On the other hand, if the employees take advantage of a company such \nas Diamond Walnut, which has been debated here before, and strike right \nat the beginning of the season in which all of the crop must be \nharvested, is it not a calculated strike to force management to its \nknees? Is there not some means to balance these competing interests \nwithout causing a problem?\n  I am absolutely certain, Mr. President, that the President has made a \nserious mistake by issuing the Executive order and changing so \nfundamentally labor law that has on the whole worked well. Initiating \nan Executive order that will countermand legislative language is a \nslippery slope that can then work to any President's advantage. I think \nit calls into question the separation of powers between the executive \nand legislative branches.\n  While it is the right of the President to issue an Executive order, \nwhen it overturns the law of the land, I think we have to approach it \ncarefully. The Senator from Massachusetts said that there are those who \nargue it would lead to more strikes. I am not sure that it necessarily \nwould. But I think what it would do would certainly lead to far \n[[Page S3837]] greater uncertainty in the marketplace. I think it would \nlead to far greater uncertainty in relations between management and \nlabor. I think prohibiting permanent replacements would pose enormous \ndifficulties on both sides and certainly increase the potential for \nlonger strikes, because what would be the incentive for those on strike \nto go back to work?\n  It seems to me that we simply must uphold a balanced approach, and \nneither side should be able to unbalance the relationship. Yes, we have \nto be just as cautious of management in taking that opportunity as we \nwould with labor. But the mechanism is already in place for collective \nbargaining to work--which is the heart of the matter--and for both \nsides to be able to bargain in good faith. I believe this is what we in \nthe legislative branch owe both labor and management when they go to \nthe bargaining table. It is up to them, both labor and management, to \naccomplish that.\n  I really believe that regardless of the merits of this issue and \nwhere people stand on either side, we should think carefully about the \nissue before us and the implication that by Executive order a major \nprinciple of labor law can be turned on its head. This, it seems to me, \nis what each and every one of my colleagues should consider as we \napproach a cloture vote on Wednesday.\n  I think that the merits of permanently replacing striking workers \ncould be debated at another time. We debated it last year. We will be \ndebating it again. But it is the Executive order that we have to deal \nwith at this particular time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the explanation of the \nSenator from Kansas about the issuing of the Executive order and the \nauthority for issuing the Executive order of President Bush on the \nprehire issue. But I do take issue with it.\n  The Senator states that the difference between that Executive order \nand the Executive order on striker replacements issued by President \nClinton is that the issue of striker replacements has been debated by \nthe Congress but the issue of prehire agreements has not. The fact is \nthat Congress did specifically consider and debate the issue of whether \nprehire agreements should be lawful at the time that section 8(f) and \nsection 8(e) were added to the National Labor Relations Act in 1959. \nThis issue was debated at some length in the Senate as well as in the \nHouse of Representatives, and Congress affirmatively determined that \nprehire agreements and project labor agreements should be legal in the \nconstruction industry. President Bush acted contrary to that decision \nby Congress when he issued the Executive order in 1992 prohibiting any \ncontracting with employers who entered into prehire agreements and \nproject labor agreements.\n  So the Members of Congress understood in 1959 what they were \napproving, what the public policy implications were, and they accepted \nthe particular provisions permitting prehire agreements and project \nlabor agreements--sections 8(e) and 8(f), which I put into the Record \nlast year. And then, in spite of that, without any debate and any kind \nof discussion, we have an Executive order by President Bush to \neffectively undermine that. And this was after the Supreme Court had \nunanimously affirmed, in a 9-to-0 decision in the Boston Harbor case, \nthat such agreements were perfectly lawful and authorized by Congress \nin the public sector as well as in the private sector.\n  That is very different from what we are talking about in terms of \nstriker replacement. We have in the National Labor Relations Act \nrecognition that you cannot be fired for striking, and yet we have \ndictum--a footnote, effectively--in the Mackay case, which was never \nreally made use of, picked up really in the period of the 1980's after \nthe PATCO strike and used to inaugurate the widespread replacement of \nstriking workers with permanent replacements.\n  We are talking about the history of the development of this whole \nprogram. That is really what has happened. Then we had a debate on \nthis. There is no question we had the debate on it. It passed with the \nsupport of Republicans and Democrats alike over in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was a majority of the Members of the U.S. Senate \nwho voted to eliminate the permanent replacements. But we had a \nfilibuster and we were prohibited from acting.\n  I understand that is the way the rules go. So the Senator is quite \ncorrect in saying we had a debate but we did not get final action on \nit. That is true. But the overwhelming majority of the House of \nRepresentatives, and in a bipartisan way, wanted to repeal permanent \nstriker replacements. The majority of Republicans and Democrats wanted \nto repeal striker replacements.\n  The Executive order is not banning the use of permanent striker \nreplacements. All it is saying is we as the Federal Government are not \ngoing to do additional business with you to make you more profitable if \nyou are going to go ahead and hire permanent striker replacements, as \nfar as Federal contracting goes.\n  The reasons for that are, as I mentioned earlier, when you circumvent \nthe quality, the training, the skills of workers who, for example, \nmight be the GE workers up in Lynn, MA, who make the F-15 engines, the \nF-16 engines, the F-18 engines, the attack fighter engines--really \namong the best-skilled workers in the world, and who constantly are \nimproving and strengthening their skills--those are men and women who \nhave worked there 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 years in that plant. They are \ntop of the line. To say, look, if they have a dispute up there and you \nare going to replace one of those workers working on those engines with \nsome permanent striker replacement who does not have that kind of \nexperience that the Federal Government expects--in terms of our defense \nexpenditures and contracting I think the President is well advised to \nassure that every dollar that is going to be expended is going to be \nexpended wisely, that the item will be of good quality.\n  The President's Executive order does not change or alter the right to \nhire permanent striker replacements. Those companies can still go out \nand still have the authority and the power to have them. All we are \nsaying is we are not going to give them an additional benefit, like we \ngave to the Diamond Walnut Co., which was getting increased \nproductivity and profitability and refused to bargain with its workers \nwho were making barely above the minimum wage. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  Who are we talking about making a dollar? We are talking about $6-an-\nhour or $7-an-hour Americans, who were prepared to work for $6 or $7 an \nhour. I wish we could get as worked up about the people we are really \naffecting as we are about this Executive order. These are people \nworking for $6 or $7 an hour and we are somehow trying to diminish them \nto favor companies who want to pay them $5 an hour or throw them out, \nand give those companies the Federal contracts, like the agricultural \ncontract which Diamond Walnut got which helped them to sell the \nproducts overseas. They made millions, tens of millions of dollars on \nthat contract.\n  You have both sound public policy reasons for this, in terms of \nmaking sure we are going to have good quality and a good product for \nour Federal investment, and I think you have a sound social policy with \nregard to preventing exploitation of the workers.\n  The people we are talking about are barely above the minimum wage. We \nhave been on this now Thursday, Friday, and today. We have not been \ntalking about consultants making $25, $30, $35 an hour who are really \nripping off the system. All the examples we have been using are people \nmaking $6, $7, $7.50 an hour. They are striking for another nickel, \nanother dime, and bango--they are replaced. Those are the people we are \ntalking about.\n  Why are we spending the time here trying to shortchange this kind of \nworker in our society? Why are we spending all day Thursday, all day \nFriday, today, and the time of the Senate, to do so? I think we have \nbetter things to do with our time.\n  I might take just a few moments of the Senate's time to include a \nmore detailed history of the President's authority for issuing this \nExecutive order.\n  Mr. President, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has \nserved both Republican Presidents and \n[[Page S3838]] Democratic Presidents as the chief guardian of the \nconstitutional separation of powers. It is recognized by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle as the authoritative voice on the scope of a \nPresident's powers.\n  On Friday, the Office of Legal Counsel made public a memorandum \nexpressing its opinion that President Clinton was acting well within \nhis executive authority when he issued this Executive order. I have \nentered the Office of Legal Counsel's memorandum into the Record. And I \nunderstand that the Justice Department has provided copies of the \nmemorandum to each Senator's office.\n  This memorandum is important not simply because it offers the \nthoroughly researched and persuasive opinion of the leading \ninstitutional expert on the scope of the President's powers that this \nExecutive order is an appropriate exercise of Presidential authority. \nIt is important because several Members of this body have stated--\nwithout citing a single case or statute, without making a single legal \nargument, and without explaining their views--that they think this \nExecutive order is unconstitutional.\n  The Constitution deserves more than that. The President deserves more \nthan that. And the working families whose lives will be improved by \nthis Executive order deserve more than that.\n  I have reviewed the Office of Legal Counsel's memorandum supporting \nthis Executive order. I find it persuasive. For those who have not yet \nhad the opportunity to review this important document, permit me to \nbriefly lay out the analysis set forth in the memorandum that must lead \nany reasoned observer to conclude that this Executive order is both \nconstitutional and appropriate to the President's authority.\n  The leading case on the comparative powers of the executive branch \nand the legislative branch is Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. versus \nSawyer, also known as the steel seizure case.\n  This case is something that everyone in this body who is a lawyer \nremembers studying from law school. It still stands as an enormously \nimportant, defining case in terms of executive authority.\n  In late 1951, the Nation's steel production was threatened by a labor \ndispute. President Truman sought to resolve the dispute by seizing most \nof the Nation's steel mills. He justified his action by claiming that \nsteel was an indispensable component of the materials necessary to \nprosecute the Korean war. In his view, any steel strike threatened the \nnational defense.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in the steel seizure case began with the \npremise that--\n\n       The President's power, if any, to issue an order must stem \n     either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution \n     itself.\n\n  Justice Jackson's concurrence explained further that there are three \nzones of Presidential authority:\n  First, the President's authority is strongest when he acts with an \nexpress or implied authorization from Congress.\n  Second, the President's authority is less clear when he acts in the \nabsence of a congressional grant or denial of authority.\n  Finally, the President's authority is at its lowest ebb when he takes \nmeasures incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress.\n  In the steel seizure case, the Supreme Court concluded that the \nPresident did not have the inherent authority under the Constitution to \nseize steel mills to resolve labor disputes, even in his role as \nCommander in Chief. Further, Congress, when it enacted the Taft-Hartley \nAct, expressly rejected seizure of corporate facilities as a remedy for \nlabor disputes. Accordingly, without constitutional authorization and \nacting directly contrary to Congress' will, President Truman's \nauthority was at its lowest ebb. The seizure of the steel mills, the \nSupreme Court concluded, was unconstitutional.\n  Unlike President Truman, President Clinton did not have to rely on \ninherent constitutional authority to issue this Executive order which \nprohibits Federal contractors from permanently replacing lawful \nstrikers. As the Office of Legal Counsel's memorandum makes clear, \nPresident Clinton has the authority to issue this Executive order \nbecause Congress gave him the authority.\n  That is point 2 under the steel strike case.\n  What was the second paragraph in Justice Jackson's opinion? Did the \nCongress give authority which was utilized by the President to issue an \nExecutive order? Clearly, that is so in this case.\n  The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act was enacted ``to \nprovide for the Government an economical and efficient system for \nprocurement and supply.'' This act specifically and expressly grants \nthe President the authority to manage the Federal procurement system to \nguarantee efficiency and economy. Permit me to quote directly from \nsection 486(a) of the procurement law:\n\n       The President may prescribe such policies and directives, \n     not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as he shall \n     deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of said act.\n\n  In sum, it is not simply the President's right--it is his \nresponsibility--to do whatever is necessary to promote economical and \nefficient procurement.\n  Every court to consider the question has concluded that section \n486(a)--the section I have just read--grants the President a broad \nscope of authority. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, interpreting section 486(a), emphasized that:\n\n       ``Economy'' and ``efficiency'' are not narrow terms: They \n     encompass those factors like price, quality, suitability, and \n     availability of goods or services that are involved in\n      all acquisition decisions.\n\n  President Clinton understood these boundaries when he issued this \nExecutive order. The preamble to the Executive order makes abundantly \nclear that the state of a Federal contractor's labor-management \nrelations directly affects the cost, quality, and timely availability \nof the goods and services paid for by the taxpayers. Specifically, the \nExecutive order finds that ``Strikes involving permanent replacement \nworkers are longer in duration than other strikes.''\n  That is in the Executive order, and last Friday I took a short period \nof time on the Senate floor to review what has been happening with \nregard to strikes since 1935, what happened in the MacKay case, and how \nthe annual number of strikes has increased, and increased dramatically \nin terms of both the numbers and also the length of those strikes.\n  The Executive order continues:\n\n       In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a \n     limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, \n     thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the \n     strike.\n       By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the \n     accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of \n     its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely \n     affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal \n     Government, which rely on that employer to provide high \n     quality and reliable goods or services.\n  That is the end of the quote of the Executive order.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel is plainly correct when it stated in its \nmemorandum:\n\n       We believe that these findings state the necessary \n     reasonable relation between the procedures instituted by the \n     order and achievement of the goal of economy and efficiency.\n\n  Mr. President, compare the detailed findings in this Executive order \nwith Executive Order No. 12800, issued by President Bush to require \nFederal contractors to post a notice that workers are not required to \njoin unions. The only finding in that Executive order is a conclusory \nstatement that President Bush's order would ``promote harmonious \nrelations in the workplace for purposes of ensuring the economical and \nefficient administration and completion of Government contracts.''\n  That is all there is, Mr. President. And I cannot recall any \nRepublican Senator taking to the floor after the Executive order was \nissued to complain that President Bush had usurped Congress' authority, \nhad attempted an end run around Congress.\n  Some of the corporate lobbyists and lawyers that have complained \nabout President Clinton's Executive order might attempt to argue that \nCongress has spoken on the question of\n permanent replacements. In the words of the steel seizure case, they \nare attempting to show that President Clinton's Executive order is an \nact directly contrary to Congress' express or implied will.\n  [[Page S3839]] The fact is that the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly passed legislation that would have prohibited all \nemployers--not just Federal contractors--from using permanent \nreplacement workers. This body never got the chance to vote on the \nstriker replacement legislation. A majority of Senators were ready to \nenact a bill that prohibited all employers from using permanent \nreplacements. But a handful of Senators from the other side of the \naisle filibustered that legislation. They never permitted it to come to \na vote. Mr. President, that happened not once, but twice. If Congress \nhas expressed any view on this subject, it has expressed overwhelming \nsupport for the President's ban on the use of permanent replacements.\n  Mr. President, this Executive order is a lawful and necessary \nexercise of the authority delegated to the President by Congress to \neffectuate the purposes of our Government's procurement laws. It is \nconsistent with past Presidential practice and legal precedent. This \nExecutive order is an appropriate exercise of the President's Executive \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, we have over these last few days spelled out in \ncareful detail the legal justification and rationale for the issuing of \nthe Executive order. We have analyzed the impact of the Executive order \nand reviewed what has been happening in terms of labor-management \nrelations over the period of the last 10 or 15 years. We have drawn \nconclusions based upon those strikes and what is happening in the real \nworld in terms of labor-management relations, about how the public's \ninterest would be served by this action.\n  I believe it is sound and wise public policy. I hope that the Senate \nwill uphold it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne).

Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts for his eloquent and passionate leadership \non this issue. Let me also commend many of my other colleagues: the \nSenator from Iowa, the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from \nIllinois, and a number of others who have participated over the last \nseveral days in this debate.\n  No one should misunderstand what this debate is all about. Obviously, \nif Senators have heard any of the speeches made by the colleagues whom \nI have just mentioned, there can be no misunderstanding. Quite simply, \nit is about fairness. That is the issue.\n  It is fairness for American working families, in a very important set \nof circumstances: the workplace. It is fairness in reaffirming their \nright to strike, fairness in restoring a fundamental balance between \nworkers and management, and fairness in halting the practice of \nrequiring striking workers to pay taxes for salaries of workers who \nreplace them.\n  That is really what this issue is all about. The President \nunderstands that. He understands he is on solid ground in issuing the \nExecutive order as he did a couple of weeks ago. The order is quite \nsimple. It says to do business for more than $100,000 with the Federal \nGovernment, you cannot hire replacement workers in the case of a \nstrike. That is all it says. A person simply cannot do what the law of \nthe last 60 years has said could not be done.\n  This President is doing exactly what President Bush did in 1992. \nPresident Bush required unionized contractors to notify employees of \ntheir right to refuse to pay union dues. He was not challenged by \nRepublicans when he issued that particular Executive order. President \nClinton is doing also what President Carter did in 1978, when he issued \nan Executive order that directly affected the lives and livelihood of \nthousands of working families by limiting what Federal contractors \ncould agree to in collective bargaining.\n  In fact, this President is doing exactly what President Roosevelt, \nPresident Truman, Presidents Nixon, Johnson, Carter, and Bush have all \ndone in the past. In this case, he has shown Presidential leadership in \nprotecting the rights and the spirit of the law for all working \nfamilies.\n  The President is well within his rights, in my view, for at least \nthree good reasons. First, as I indicated, there is ample precedent in \nvirtually every past administration for the past 60 years. Second, he \nis supported by the American people. More than 60 percent of the \nAmerican people, according to recent polls, have shown that they oppose \nthe use of permanent replacement workers in the event of a lawful \nstrike.\n  The American people understand the question of fairness. They \nappreciate the need for worker-management balance. The American people \nsupport actions and laws to guarantee that balance, which is really \nwhat the Executive order was designed to do.\n  And third, this action taken by the President is consistent with the \nNational Labor Relations Act itself, signed into law, as I said, by \nPresident Roosevelt about 60 years ago. In fact, this year, we will \ncelebrate the 60th anniversary of the National Labor Relations Act, an \nact that fundamentally appreciates the balance in the workplace, that \nunderstands the need for the right to strike, that underscores the \nimportance of providing opportunities for workers and management to \nwork out their differences.\n  That was the law that recognized the need for American workers to \nform organizations to bring the balance back into the workplace. It has \nbeen a balance that, frankly, has worked well for 45 years, a balance \nthat has brought about better wages, a balance that has brought about \nbetter working conditions, better retirement security, better \nproductivity.\n  But it is a balance that was destroyed by the actions taken by \nPresident Reagan during the PATCO strike of 1981, when the President of \nthe United States hired permanent replacement workers. His action sent \na green light to every business in the country. Virtually all of the \nwork of 45 years under the National Labor Relations Act was lost with \nthat action, and for 15 years now, Democrats in Congress, and others, \nhave attempted to pass the Workplace Fairness Act to restore the \nbalance that we had for those 45 years, an act which very simply puts \ninto law what we believe was there all along: a prohibition of the \nhiring of permanent replacement workers during a strike; a restoration \nof the balance that we had in labor-management relations up until 1981.\n  It is important to note that a majority of Congress has supported the \nWorkplace Fairness Act. There have been more than 50 votes for it on \nthose occasions when the legislation was brought before this body, and \nwere it not for a minority that kept it from being passed, it would, in \nfact, be law.\n  So whether it is law or whether it is an Executive order, this \nclarification is long overdue and extremely important to all working \nfamilies. The right to organize, the right to bargain collectively is \nessential to American workers. As history has shown, the right to \nstrike is the right to be taken seriously. The right to strike is the \nonly leverage workers have when bargaining with management.\n  [[Page S3840]] As economically painful as it may be for workers and \ntheir families, resorting to a strike is sometimes the only way to \nresolve a labor dispute. But when employers are free to replace \nstriking workers, that leverage disappears and the imbalance destroys \nany hope of meaningful conflict resolution.\n  We have seen it in the precipitous drop in the number of strikes over \nthe past 20 years. There are nearly half the strikes in the early \n1990's that there were in the 1970's, and the number of union members \nhas also declined.\n  The attack on this Executive order is part of a well-orchestrated \neffort to dramatically reduce the Federal role in workers' security. \nThis effort ranges from calls for the elimination of the Federal \nminimum wage law, to proposals to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, to \nefforts to minimize the regulation of workplace safety. These efforts \nare orchestrated to continue the rollback of the progress we have made \nfor decades under the auspices of the National Labor Relations Act and \nother important labor legislation. As the rollback continues, while \nunions are threatened, the American worker and working families have \nseen their incomes and the level of job benefits plummet. In constant \ndollars, wages have now declined by more than 10 percent in 10 years. \nWages have actually gone down by more than a dollar an hour since the \n1970's. Moreover, far fewer workers have health insurance benefits or \nretirement benefits than they did back then.\n  Without the right to strike, workers continually lose the right to \nnegotiate. Without the right to negotiate, they lose the right to \nbenefits, benefits on which they and their families depend.\n  By taking this action, the President is simply saying, ``If you're \ngoing to bid for Federal tax dollars on a Federal contract, all we ask \nis that you live up to the intent of the National Labor Relations Act. \nIf there is a strike, we want you, the company, to resolve it in a \nresponsible way. We want you to renounce the practice of hiring \npermanent replacements.''\n  Working families are counting on us to support the President. This is \na very important vote for them and for the future of labor law in this \ncountry. A vote against cloture is a vote for working Americans at \ntheir time of greatest need. It should also be a clear sign of our \ndesire to reverse the long downward slope of economic security for all \nworking families. There is much which must be done, including the \npassage of meaningful health reform during this Congress. Hopefully, we \ncan do that and many other things to restore the kind of security and \nconfidence that working families must have if they are to look to the \nfuture with any more optimism than they can right now.\n  But this is the place to begin, on this vote, on this important \nissue, to send the kind of clear message: that we understand the \nimportance of balance, that we understand the importance of fostering \nmeaningful negotiations between workers and their employers, that we \nunderstand the right to strike, that we understand the importance of a \nlaw that has now been on the books for 60 years, and that we restore \nthe kind of equality in the workplace that workers now say is even more \nimportant than it was back in 1935.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we can defeat this cloture motion and \nsend the kind of message that I know Republicans and Democrats want to \nbe able to send to working families. And that is: we appreciate your \nplight, we appreciate your need for security, we appreciate your need \nfor more confidence in the future than you have right now.\n  I hope that all Senators will understand that message and support us \nin our effort to defeat cloture on Wednesday morning.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first would like to commend our friend \nand colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, for another outstanding \nstatement on a cause that he has led for many years, and I hope, I say \nto the Senator from Arkansas, that we are close to the time when your \nlong walk will reach its destination. I agree with the comments that \nyou have made today as to the fairness and the rationale of moving \nforward as the Supreme Court has now allowed us to do to sanction \nStates to impose this sales tax on mail order businesses.\n  But, Mr. President, I suggest that there is another reason why this \nis an imperative at this point in time. We are soon to consider a \nseries of proposals that will have the effect of devolving back to the \nStates, returning to the States significant responsibility for some of \nthe most complex domestic programs that we have in our Nation, \nprograms, in some cases, in which the States have had current \ninvolvement, such as the Medicaid Program, some programs in which the \nFederal Government has in the past played a priority role, such as \nwelfare, and others that are mixed.\n  If we are prepared to say that the States are able to provide the \nadministrative machinery to carry out these complex domestic programs, \nI find it hard to say that the States should not be entrusted with the \nauthority to make a judgment as to whether it is in the interest of \ntheir citizens to tax products that come in by mail order in a parity \nmeans with products that are purchased within the State itself, and \nthat is essentially what the issue is with the legislation proposed by \nthe Senator from Arkansas. We are not imposing the tax, we are \nauthorizing the 50 individual States to make a judgment as to whether \nthey believe it is in the interest of their citizens for those States \nto impose the tax.\n  I am also concerned, Mr. President, about what we are about to do to \nStates, and I come out of a background as a very strong believer in the \nState Government sensitivity to their people, to their capability to \noperate programs effectively and efficiently and to their innovative \ncapabilities. But the States also are not alchemists, they do not have \nthe ability to take stones and rub them and convert them into golden \ncoins.\n  We are going to be sending substantial responsibilities back to the \nStates with substantially less dollars than we had felt it was \nnecessary to operate those if they were still under Federal obligation. \nAs an example, in my State of Florida, the calculations are that if we \nsend back Medicaid, the program that provides financing for indigent \nAmericans, to the States, that over the next 5 years, the State of \nFlorida will receive approximately $3.5 billion less than the \nindividual recipients of those funds would have received had we stayed \nwith the current Federal program--$3.5 billion less.\n  The State of Florida this year, from both Federal and State sources, \nwill spend approximately $5 billion on Medicaid. So we are talking \nabout very substantial percentage reductions in funds available.\n  Why is it going to cost the State of Florida so much? In part it is \nbecause the formula that has been suggested is one that essentially \nsays we take the status quo, we freeze it for 5 years and allow \nessentially a cost-of-living adjustment. In my State, we are a growth \nState which is adding a substantial population every year. For the last \n15 years, we have grown at a rate in excess of 300,000 persons a year. \nMany of those 300,000 are in the high-target populations for Medicaid. \nIn my State, about half of Medicaid expenditures goes for the elderly, \nprimarily for long-term care.\n  So if we are going to say for the next 5 years we are going to freeze \nthe program at a cost-of-living factor and not take into account growth \nin population, not take into account growth in those populations that \nare heaviest users of these programs, we are going \n[[Page S3841]] to be imposing very serious financial obligations on the \nStates.\n  I think that as we enter into this debate on turning responsibility \nback to the States, we have an obligation to also ask the question, \nwhat are we going to do to assure that the States have the fiscal \ncapacity to accept those responsibilities that we are imposing?\n  I believe the Senator from Arkansas has certainly pointed to what \nought to be at the head of the line as we begin to ask that question of \nfiscal responsibility. Here is the program for which there is no \nrationale as to why the Federal Government should deny the States the \nauthority to impose this tax. There is every reason in terms of tax \nfairness that they should, in fact, treat mail order sales in parity \nwith sales from the local Main Street store, and the States are going \nto need the revenue this will provide.\n  In my State of Florida, the estimate is that in 1974 had the sales \ntax been applied on mail order sales to the same extent it was on Main \nStreet sales it would have produced $168.9 million. That will not close \nall the gap that our States are going to be faced with as they are \nasked to take on these new responsibilities, but it will be a worthy \nbeginning.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe for all of the reasons that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas has cited with such force and eloquence, as well as the \ntime in history in which we find ourselves, in which we are about to \nask the States to do more, that we should also have a concern about how \nour brethren in the Federal system are going to have the capacity to \naccept those responsibilities.\n  We say that it is not our purpose to have a dramatic fraying of the \nsafety net. The safety net in my State for hundreds of thousands of \nolder Americans who are in need of long-term care and who have spent \nall of their life savings as their health condition deteriorated, I do \nnot think we as a nation want to turn those people out of the kind of \ninstitutions that they need in order for their well-being.\n  We are asking the States now to pick up a much larger share of the \ncost of providing for those Americans. This is a beginning of a \ndemonstration of the Federal Government's commitment to see that there \nare adequate resources available at the State level to meet the \nadditional responsibilities that we are proposing to impose.\n  So, in closing, I want to thank my friend from Arkansas for his \nleadership in this effort. I hope his leadership will be rewarded by \nsuccessful passage of this legislation and passage in 1995. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my very \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, a former Governor, as was I, who \nfully understands the problem the States are going to have with \nunfunded mandates, but also for his very perceptive comments about the \nlegislation.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me make just a couple of observations. I see \nthe Senator from Michigan awaits recognition, so I will not be long. \nBut the Senator from Florida has just told you about some of the budget \nconstraints on them because of the Medicaid Program, but there are a \nwhole host of others.\n  This bill has the potential for $169 million a year for the State of \nFlorida. That is not beanbag either. And I promise you the Governor of \nFlorida favors this legislation. I promise you the Governor of \nvirtually every State in this Nation favors this legislation. As I \nsaid, every mayor, every county executive favors it. But the point that \nmust not be lost sight of is we are not imposing anything. We are \nsimply saying to the States, if you choose to do this, it is your \nprerogative. If you do not, that is also your prerogative. But we are \nalso saying that if you do not have a sales tax in your State, you \ncannot charge it.\n  There are five States in this country that have no sales tax. This \nbill would not apply to them. They would not be able to charge this \nbecause they do not have a tax that they tax their own citizens with, \nand therefore they could not tax citizens of other States.\n  How many times have you heard in this body that the reason for the \nbig revolution on November 8 was people are tired of being told what to \ndo. They want somebody to listen to them. They want to have some \ndiscretion over their own lives and what they want to do.\n  Now, here is a classic case of doing precisely that. We are saying to \nthe States we are going to enable you to help yourself if you choose. \nBut that is your discretion, not ours. So how can anybody quarrel with \nthat? If you vote for this and you do not personally approve of it, go \ntell your Governor I voted for it to give you the discretion. But if \nyou do not want to do it, that is OK with me.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3840-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3841-S3842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          TAX CUTS IN MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate John Engler, \nGovernor of my State of Michigan, for signing into law last week his \n12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th tax cuts since taking office.\n  Governor Engler has increased the personal exemption in our State to \nat least $2,400, saving Michigan taxpayers $69 million on their income \ntaxes in fiscal year 1995. The exemption also will be indexed for \ninflation starting in 1998.\n  He has created a new refundable income tax credit for college tuition \nthat will help individuals and families struggling to get an education.\n  He has reduced the single business tax by removing unemployment and \nworkers' compensation funds and Social Security payments from the tax \nbase.\n  He has begun phasing out Michigan's intangibles tax, raising the \nfiling threshold and providing for its total repeal, effective January \n1, 1998.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of these tax cuts will benefit individuals, \nwith 30 percent benefiting the State's job creators. Taken together \nwith the other 11 tax cuts he already has implemented, these cuts will \nsave Michigan taxpayers $1.2 billion this year alone.\n  We here in Congress would do well to look at Governor Engler's \nperformance in setting out our program of fiscal reform from the \nNation. When he took over as Governor in 1991, John Engler inherited a \n$1.8 billion deficit. That means that in 1991 Michigan was running a \ndeficit that equaled 10 percent of its total State spending--almost as \nlarge a deficit in proportion to total spending as the one run here in \nWashington.\n  Governor Engler had a tough choice to make. He could maintain \nMichigan's current spending levels and increase taxes, or cut spending \nand hold the line on taxes. But he decided to choose neither course of \naction, instead boldly cutting both spending and taxes.\n  And the results have been remarkable. Through aggressive use of his \nline-item veto he brought about an 11-percent cut in real, after-\ninflation spending. In addition, he made Michigan our Nation's top \nState in creating manufacturing jobs, more than 40,000 in the last year \nalone, second in the Nation in personal income growth, and a leader in \nlowering unemployment rates. All this while increasing State funding to \neducate Michigan's children.\n  Mr. President, Michigan can serve as an example to the Nation of how \naggressive budget and tax cutting can go together to spur economic \ngrowth and better the lives of our citizens.\n  We too can get our spending under control, without cutting essential \nprograms; we need only the courage to put in place and utilized the \ntools Governor Engler and the Michigan State Legislature used to bring \ntheir State back from the brink of economic disaster.\n  Michigan's constitution required a balanced budget; it also provides \nthe Governor with a line-item veto. Both of these tools were essential \nto Governor Engler's efforts to bring spending under control.\n  We have the power to do for America what Governor Engler and his \npartners in the State legislature have done for Michigan, if we are \nwilling to enact a line-item veto and add a balanced budget amendment \nto our Constitution. These tools will help us order our priorities and \ndiscipline our spending.\n  Most important, we must recognize that by taxing the American people \n[[Page S3842]] less we can help our economy and our budget more. This \nweek the House Ways and Means Committee will report a tax reduction \nbill that creates a $500-per-child tax credit for families and cuts the \ncapital gains tax in half. In all likelihood, the House will approve \nthese important tax reductions.\n  Some of our colleagues here in the Senate have suggested that we \nabandon tax cuts--and focus exclusively on reducing the budget deficit. \nHaving lost the vote on the balanced budget amendment, I can understand \ntheir desire to put spending cuts first in order to produce a balanced \nbudget plan.\n  But as Governor Engler has demonstrated, cutting spending and taxes \nis the best way to reduce the deficit and encourage economic growth. We \nmust have confidence that the American people, if allowed to keep their \nown money and spend it as they choose, will fuel the engine that runs \nour economy, producing more jobs, greater prosperity, and a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I also suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to allow States \nto regulate the disposal of municipal solid waste generated outside of \nthe State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n             interstate shipments of municipal solid waste\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould give States and local governments the power to regulate and, if \nthey choose, reject interstate shipments of municipal solid waste.\n  This is a problem Congress has grappled with now for years and it \nonly grows more and more serious. An estimated 18 million tons of \nmunicipal solid waste travels across State lines each year. Landfills \nare filling up around the country and communities are searching for new \nplaces to send their trash.\n  Where are they searching? Mr. President, they are searching in rural \nareas like my home State of North Dakota and, no doubt, they are \nlooking in the State of the distinguished occupant of the chair, the \nState of Idaho.\n  Mr. President, rural States like ours, where pollution has not \nspoiled the land, where small communities may be willing to take large \namounts of money from a waste company in exchange for landfill space, \nare the places they are looking. Whether they want this imported waste \nor not, States are almost powerless to stop the flow of garbage across \ntheir borders.\n  Mr. President, I can remember very well being involved in a debate on \nthis matter a number of years ago, and the trash merchants had their \nlobbyists lining the Halls. I have never seen so many people off the \nChamber of the Senate. The trash merchants want to ship this stuff \nsomeplace, and they are looking for States that are willing to take it.\n  Mr. President, States ought to have an ability to say ``no.'' Waste \nis already coming to my State of North Dakota. We take industrial waste \nfrom General Motors plants from all around the country. We take \nmunicipal solid waste incinerator ash from Minnesota. A waste company \ncontinues its efforts to open a superdump in my State that would take \ngarbage from Minneapolis-St. Paul. This one landfill, Mr. President, \nwould receive almost twice as much garbage as is produced in my entire \nState. This situation is not unique. It is happening all over the \ncountry.\n  States should be able to do something about it. They should be able \nto \n[[Page S3843]] regulate how much solid waste comes into the State so \nthey can implement effective waste disposal policy. The Federal \nGovernment requires the States to manage and oversee solid waste \ndisposal programs. States are required to issue permits, monitor \nexisting sites, and enforce landfill regulation. Why, then, should \nStates not also be able to regulate how much waste comes in from out of \nState? It only makes sense that they have this power.\n  Mr. President, imported waste not only takes up precious landfill \nspace, but it also puts a strain on services of the importing State \nwithout properly compensating that State. Waste trucks from out of \nState wear down the roads of the importing State, but the exporting \ncommunity pays nothing. Similarly, States must spend money to run their \nsolid waste program, but they get no additional payments for accepting \nout-of-State wastes. In other words, exporting communities are passing \ntheir waste problems, and the costs associated with them, on to \nimporting States. This is not fair, and it should be changed.\n  The bill I am introducing today takes strong steps to address the \nproblems of interstate waste. First, it gives States the authority to \nregulate interstate waste. If a State wants to reject new solid waste \nshipments, my bill would allow that.\n  Second, it requires that affected local governments formally approve \nof any waste import. This gives the communities the ability to veto \nproposed shipments of out-of-State wastes. Why should not those \ncommunities that are affected by waste shipments have the ability to \nsay no?\n  Third, it provides the opportunity for the area surrounding the host \ncommunity to be involved in the decision to accept out-of-State wastes. \nA decision on siting a solid waste landfill, especially one that will \ntake large amounts of imported waste, must be a collective one, and a \nsmall community alone should not be able to make a decision that will \naffect a much larger surrounding area.\n  Finally, my bill requires that waste companies publicly release all \nof the relevant information about their proposed landfill before a \ncommunity makes a decision on it. This information should include \nestimated environmental impacts and mitigation, economic impacts, \nplanned expansion, financial disclosure, and records of past violations \nby the owner and operator of the disposal site. Waste companies hold up \nthe promise of jobs and economic incentives, but they do not want to \nreveal the potential risks involved in their plan. In many cases, they \nmay not even reveal their overall plans until it is too late to stop \nthem. One practice I have seen involves having a local developer \npurchase the site and get a permit to dispose of modest amounts of \nsolid waste. A big waste company then buys out the local party and \naggressively expands the site's permit. The local community does not \nhave a chance. This is not fair and cannot be allowed to continue. \nCommunities must be able to make informed choices.\n  Mr. President, how often have we seen it, where one of these trash \nmerchants comes into a State and they spend lots of money up front, \ntalking about the opportunities, talking about the jobs, talking about \nthe good things, but failing to reveal the real plan, failing to tell \nhow big the operation is really going to be? They fail to tell of past \nviolations. We have seen companies go into States that are bad \noperators, that have a bad record, that have a bad reputation, but they \ndo not reveal that. They do not talk about that before the community \nhas a chance to vote.\n  Mr. President, many of us believe that a local community ought to \nhave a choice and it ought to be an informed choice. They ought to know \nthe record, they ought to know the plan before they make a final \ndecision.\n  We have been working on the interstate waste problem in the Senate \nfor many years now. During the years we have been debating this issue, \nthe problem has not gone away. It has simply gotten bigger. The trash \nis still moving, and States and communities are almost powerless to \nstop it. It is time to enact interstate waste legislation into law.\n  Congress came very close to passing an interstate waste bill in 1994. \nI hope we can build on the work that has been done and take quick \naction in 1995.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Chafee, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Coats, and others to move this matter forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 542\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the deadline under the Federal Power Act \napplicable to the construction of a hydroelectric project in Oregon, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n          eugene water & electric board ferc license extension\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nallow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant the Eugene \nWater & Electric District, in Lane County, OR, an extension of its \nhydro project construction completion deadline.\n  The subject of this license is a 21 megawatt hydroelectric project at \nthe Blue River Dam, an existing Corps of Engineers flood control \nproject. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted the license \nfor the project in November 1989. The deadline for completion is \nOctober 31, 1995. Construction has begun and EWEB has invested $4.5 \nmillion to date.\n  The Eugene Water & Electric Board, also known as EWEB, has asked for \nan extension to the construction completion deadline because its \nability to complete construction has been, and will continue for some \ntime to be, impeded by the ongoing fish mitigation efforts of the Corps \nof Engineers. These efforts are focused on minimizing temperature \nvariations in the McKenzie River caused by both the Blue River and \nCougar Dams. The corps' work will entail drawing down reservoirs to \nvery low levels.\n  I support this temperature control work being done by the corps. \nHowever, until the corps completes these fish mitigation improvements \non Blue River Dam, the hydroelectric project currently licensed and \nbeing pursued by EWEB will be untenable. The corps is expected to first \nconstruct temperature control improvements at nearby Cougar Dam. This \nproject is not expected to be completed until 2001. At that time, the \ncorps will begin work on similar improvements at Blue River Dam, which \nit expects to finish by 2005.\n  The legislation I am introduction today is designed to accommodate \nboth the beneficial fish mitigation efforts being pursued by the corps \nand the ongoing hydroelectric project being pursued by EWEB. My \nlegislation directs FERC, at the request of EWEB, to extend the time \nfor completion of construction to the later of October 31, 2002, or a \ndate 1 year after the corps completes construction of temperature \ncontrol structures on the Blue River Dam. The legislation also requires \nEWEB to file a construction completion progress report with FERC each \nyear until construction is completed.\n  I look forward to working with members of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to ensure that this proposal receives \nprompt and thorough attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR BLUE RIVER PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Extension.--Notwithstanding the time period specified \n     in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that \n     would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission project numbered 3109, the Commission shall, at \n     the request of the licensee for the project, extend the time \n     for completion of the construction of the project to the \n     later of--\n       (1) October 31, 2002; or\n       [[Page S3845]] (2) the date that is 1 year after the date \n     on which the Army Corps of Engineers completes construction \n     of water temperature control structures at the Blue River \n     Dam.\n       (b) Reports.--The licensee for the project described in \n     subsection (a) shall file with the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, on October 31 of each year until construction of \n     the project is completed, a report on progress toward \n     completion of the project and of water temperature control \n     structures at the Blue River Dam.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Eugene Water & Electric Board,\n\n                                    Eugene, OR, February 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The Eugene Water & Electric Board \n     requests your help in seeking Congressional action which will \n     allow us to extend, by eleven years, the construction \n     completion deadline required by FERC on our Blue River \n     hydroelectric project. The Blue River Dam is one of two \n     facilities on the McKenzie River for which you have \n     introduced legislation to facilitate and clarify financing \n     for temperature control work by the Corps of Engineers. Due \n     to the Corps' construction schedule and recent changes in BPA \n     financing we are unable to meet the construction deadline of \n     October, 1995 as required in our FERC license. For us to \n     complete this project we will need additional time to \n     coordinate our construction schedule with that of the Corps.\n       This is not a standard extension request and it is unlike \n     other legislation to extend construction deadlines for \n     hydroelectric projects. Timing problems, financial and \n     environmental considerations necessitate a longer extension \n     than those which have been granted to other licensees. Also, \n     unlike other licensees, EWEB has already started construction \n     on the project and seeks only an extension of the completion \n     deadline.\n\n\n                          The Proposed Project\n\n       For over a decade EWEB has been pursuing development of a \n     hydroelectric project at the existing Corps of Engineer's \n     flood control dam at Blue River. The project would generate \n     21 Mw, enough to provide power for 2000 homes annually. Our \n     license for the project was granted in November, 1989. The \n     deadline for completion is October 31, 1995. Construction \n     began with the fabrication of the turbine and other \n     associated equipment. Our investment to date is $4.5 million \n     and the license has a duration of 50 years. The attached \n     Briefing Document of January 26th describes the project in \n     detail.\n\n\n                   Federal Actions Beyond Our Control\n\n       The existing Corps flood control dams at Cougar and Blue \n     River Reservoir will be modified to alter temperature \n     variations (caused by the dams) which severely threaten \n     salmon fry. This will be accomplished by installing multi-\n     level release port towers. Construction is scheduled first a \n     Cougar Reservoir as this is the larger project and it has a \n     greater impact on fish mortality. After completion of the \n     Cougar project in 2001\n      the Corps will begin work on Blue River with a scheduled \n     completion date of 2005. Each year, over this four year \n     construction period, the Corps will have to draw down the \n     reservoir to very low levels. Generation from EWEB's power \n     plant would be substantially reduced as would the revenue \n     and operational benefits during the early years of the \n     project's operation. Also, EWEB's design for the \n     hydroelectric facility may have to be modified based on \n     the Corps design and operating plan.\n       Our Blue River project was also accepted as a billing \n     credit project by BPA. Billing credits is a financial benefit \n     awarded by BPA in response to the Northwest Regional Power \n     Act to help utilities overcome the negative short-term \n     economics associated with developing new resources during the \n     early life of the project. Due to market changes and BPA's \n     growing financial problems negotiations on our billing \n     credit's contract was cancelled.\n       The timing and sequence of the Corps projects along with \n     the loss of billing credits will make the project untenable.\n\n\n                         environmental benefits\n\n       A settlement agreement, approved by FERC and incorporated \n     into the license, was reached between EWEB, the Oregon \n     Department of Fish and Wildlife, the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. The \n     original fish mitigation plans for Blue River called for a \n     fish screen and bypass facility. The agencies determined that \n     only a fish barrier was needed at Blue River and the McKenzie \n     River could be better served by investing screen and bypass \n     costs into improving salmon habitat. As a result, EWEB will \n     contribute $2,200,000 to a trust fund for fish enhancement \n     rather than building a screen and bypass facility. \n     (Settlement Agreement attached).\n       In addition, the project itself will benefit fish simply \n     through its construction. Currently, water released from the \n     reservoir passes through an outlet tunnel many feet below the \n     reservoir's surface. This results in rapid water \n     depressurization causing a fish mortality rate of 60%. We \n     would pressurize the tunnel by installing outlet gates \n     downstream. The transition from pressurized to depressurized \n     water will be slowed enough to reduce fish mortality by more \n     than half resulting in an overall survival rate exceeding \n     70%.\n\n\n                         consultation with FERC\n\n       Before approaching your office with this extension request \n     we spoke with Fred Springer, Director, Office of Hydropower \n     Licensing and Mark Robinson, Director, Division of Project \n     Compliance and Administration at FERC. They were clear that \n     although the Commission has the authority to extend \n     completion dates, an extension of an 11 year duration is \n     unusual. Extensions are usually granted when the applicant \n     can show diligence or continuous progress toward project \n     completion. We would be\n      unable to make that showing, especially while the Corps work \n     is underway. Additionally, 11 years is a lengthy extension \n     compared to other extension requests which have been \n     granted by either legislative or administrative means. In \n     terms of financial factors, extensions may be granted when \n     the licensee needs more time to secure a power sales \n     contract or another means of financing. FERC acknowledges \n     the revenue losses we would incur by completing a project \n     we could only operate part time is a serious concern. \n     However, this too is an uncommon situation which falls \n     outside the generally accepted rationale for granting \n     construction extensions. According to FERC staff, these \n     circumstances are so unusual, that the Commission would be \n     hard pressed to give us a favorable ruling. FERC would \n     need a legislative directive to grant us the extension we \n     request.\n       Consistent with the Regional Act, EWEB has aggressively \n     pursued conservation and renewable resources. As you consider \n     helping us with the Blue River project we ask you to note \n     that we have three others, all renewable resource projects, \n     with existing agreements or contracts with BPA. EWEB recently \n     learned that all three projects are at risk of being \n     abandoned by BPA due to continuing budget constraints. We \n     have made substantial investments in two of them. Regional \n     funding from BPA for conservation will also likely end \n     requiring EWEB to sustain local conservation investments \n     alone. Additionally, we are facing yet to be determined rate \n     impacts from BPA's reinvention. The combination of all these \n     actions at BPA and the Corps shifts significant obligations \n     to EWEB and its ratepayers. The increased financial \n     obligation for conservation and renewable resource \n     development makes it economically imprudent to proceed with \n     the Blue River Project under the current schedule even though \n     it may be one of the few resource options remaining at this \n     time.\n       We thank you for your serious consideration of our request.\n                                                Randy L. Berggren.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 545. A bill to authorize collection of certain State and local \ntaxes with respect to the sale, delivery, and use of tangible personal \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                consumer and main street protection act\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I come today to introduce a bill dealing \nwith the mail-order catalog business. This issue has become almost an \nobsession with me over the past 2 years, and one of the reasons for \nthat obsession is that, before I became Governor of Arkansas, I was a \nhardware, furniture, and appliance dealer, practicing law in a small \ntown, raising cattle, doing anything to put bread on the table. And the \nbiggest competitor I had was the Sears, Roebuck catalog. Sears, Roebuck \nwas tough competition for me because they were big, had a much bigger \nvariety of goods, and were reasonably cheap by comparative standards.\n  But while Sears, Roebuck was tough competition, it was also fair \ncompetition. They bore the same burdens of doing business that I did. \nOne of those burdens was collecting sales taxes. Because Sears, Roebuck \nhad stores in every State in the Nation, they had to collect sales \ntaxes on everything they sold through their catalog operation, just \nlike I had to collect sales taxes on everything I sold in my hardware \nstore. The reason Sears, Roebuck had to collect those taxes was that, \nunder the law, if you have a physical presence in any State, you must \ncollect sales tax on goods shipped into that State, even if the goods \nare sold through a catalog.\n  Over the past few years, however, an entirely new situation has been \ndeveloping in the competition between Main Street retailers and catalog \noperations. And that situation is not one of fair competition. What has \nbeen developing is that the catalog operations often limit their \nphysical operations to one State, or a few States, and refuse to \ncollect the taxes that are due on goods shipped into other States. This \nis increasingly significant because catalog sales are $100 billion a \nyear. Fingerhut, one of the biggest mail-order houses in America, has \nannual sales in excess of $1 billion a year. They sent out 476 million \ncatalogs in 1993 alone. Mr. President, bear in mind that Fingerhut is \nonly one of several very large mail order operations. Lands' End, L.L. \n[[Page S3846]] Bean, some of the big ones, have similar sales figures. \nIn all, there are around 7,500 mail-order houses in this country, and \nthey are growing like mad.\n  I daresay that on an average day, I get somewhere between 4 and 10 \ncatalogs in my mail chute every night. If you live in my home State of \nArkansas and order something from L.L. Bean or Lands' End, the company \ncollects no sales tax. That does not mean there is no sales tax in my \nState, because there is. But do you know who has the responsibility for \nremitting the tax to the State revenue department, Mr. President? The \nconsumer. If you buy a $10,000 fur coat from a mail-order house, you \nare personally responsible for remitting the $500 tax on that purchase \nto the State revenue department. And it is not just mail-order houses \nthat play this game. Sometimes, if you buy it in New York City, they \nwill say, ``You have a southern accent; are you not from New York?'' \n``No, I am not; I am from Arkansas.'' ``Would you like for us to mail \nthis to your home and save you $500?'' Of course, the consumer is going \nto say, ``Yes, I would like that.'' The company will then mail it to \nyour home and not charge you one red cent of sales tax. But what the \nunsuspecting consumer does not know is that he or she does owe tax on \nthat purchase, and that he or she is personally responsible for paying \nit to the State.\n  My State imposes its sales tax on all goods, regardless of whether \nthey are purchased in State or out of State. The 44 other States which \nhave sales taxes also apply those taxes to both in-State and out-of-\nState purchases. Technically, the tax on out-of-State goods is called a \nuse tax, while the tax on in-State goods is called a sales tax. But for \nall intents and purposes, the use tax is identical to the sales tax. \nBut because out-of-State companies usually refuse to collect the \napplicable use tax, the consumer does not even know there is a tax when \npurchasing merchandise via mail order.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the great State of Idaho. Idaho has a \nsales tax, and Idaho applies that sales tax to goods shipped into the \nState, just like it does to goods sold by Idaho department stores. So \nif Idaho's sales tax is 4 or 5 percent, the person who buys a $10,000 \nfur coat via mail order would be liable for $400 or $500 in sales \ntaxes.\n  Some people say, ``There is already a tax on mail-order sales. It is \nthe use tax. What are you trying to do?''\n  What I am trying to do is make sure that mail-order companies do not \nblind-side their customers. Consumers buy from mail-order companies \nthinking their sales are tax free, and then they learn otherwise after \nthe fact. Last year in Florida, 19,000 people got notices in the mail \nthat goods they bought from direct marketers were not tax free, as the \ncompany had lead them to believe. The furniture they bought in North \nCarolina or the merchandise they bought from Lands' End or L.L. Bean, \nthey owed a tax on it. Admittedly, not every mail-order customer gets \ncaught. Sometimes the State finds out about the purchase, and sometimes \nthey do not. But when they do, the consumer has to pay.\n  This is not a new tax. Of course, it is not. Think about it for a \nsecond. Why would any State have a tax structure that required Main \nStreet merchants to collect sales tax and allowed out-of-State \ncompanies to ship the same merchandise into the State and collect \nnothing? No State would ever do that, and no State does it.\n  Oh, how everybody's heart bleeds around here for the poor, small \ntown, Main Street businessman. But when it comes to catalog operations, \nwe give them a huge advantage, 5 to 8 percent or more, and nobody wants \nto stand up for the Main Street businessman.\n  Recently the argument was made by one of the Senators from Maine that \nMaine does not have the problem I am describing because they have \nsomething that says on the State income tax return in Maine, ``List all \nyour catalog purchases from last year.''\n  Now, who knows what all they bought from catalogs last year? There \nare a lot of people who order something every other day from a mail-\norder house, and of course they do not take the time to keep a record \nof every purchase. People just do not keep up with it.\n  Do you know what Maine collected last year on that? You guessed it. \nNot much. Only around $1 million of the total $13 million they should \nhave collected on out-of-State mail order purchases. But Maine is fat \nand happy because L.L. Bean is located there and L.L. Bean \ndoes around $1 billion a year in sales and they pay sales tax on every \ndime of merchandise sold to customers living in the State of Maine. It \nis those other 49 States that do not get anything.\n  The direct marketing industry says, ``Oh, this is such a burden, \nSenator. You have got a city tax, you have got a county tax, you have \ngot a State tax. Do you expect me to keep up with all of that?''\n  No, I do not. And this legislation would allow mail-order companies \nthe option of collecting a single blended rate for each State where \nthey do business. Then the mail-order companies would simply send a \nquarterly payment to the State revenue department and let them \ndistribute it to the local jurisdictions that have a sales tax.\n  Do you want to hear a true anecdote? One of the finest Republican \nSenators to come to the U.S. Senate since I have been here is Senator \nBob Bennett from the great State of Utah. Senator Bennett founded a \nmail-order company years ago. In a Small Business Committee hearing \nlast year on this legislation, he said, ``The people in the company \nwith me sat around the table with me and we debated this issue. Shall \nwe or shall we not collect sales tax on our sales made to other \nStates?'' He said the decision was almost unanimous, ``Yes, let's be \ngood citizens and let's collect a sales tax.''\n  Anybody who wants to make the argument about what a terrible burden \nthis is on these mail-order houses, talk to Bob Bennett. He says, ``We \npunch a computer button at the end of the month, and that is it. It is \nno problem whatever to collect this sales tax. We do it and we do \nmillions in business a year.'' So much for the burden. Another argument \nthey make is, ``But, Senator, we do not require fire protection, law \nenforcement, all those things that your sales taxes go for.''\n  That is true. But I will tell you what burden you do impose on other \nStates. You contribute almost 4 million tons of waste to the landfills \nof this country annually. Talk to any mayor: ``Mayor, what is the \nbiggest problem you have?'' ``Trying to find enough landfill to take \ncare of our garbage.'' And here is a contributor of around 4 million \ntons a year that mayors have to find some method of disposing of. And \nthe mail-order houses do not contribute one penny, except companies \nlike Bob Bennett's.\n  ``Well, we don't want to have to do this every month.'' Fine. My bill \nsays you only have to remit every 3 months.\n  Now, if that ``ain't'' a deal. I wish I had had that kind of \nopportunity when I was in business. If I did not pay my sales tax by \nthe 20th of each succeeding month, I did not get a 2-percent discount.\n  Mr. President, I have gone even further than that. In order to take \ncare of some of these smaller mail-order houses, we have exempted in \nthis bill, in the interest of being for small, fledgling businesses--\nand, I must say, $3 million a year is not exactly my idea of small--we \nsay, ``If you do less than $3 million a year of business, you do not \nhave to mess with this bill.'' Of the 7,500 catalog companies in the \nUnited States, not very many of them do more than $3 million of \nbusiness a year. Only 825 of the 7,500 mail-order houses in this \ncountry that would be covered by this bill.\n  Mr. President, there is another element of unfairness besides the \ncompetitive advantage that these mail-order houses get. Some of them do \nadvertising that is very offensive to me and I think it would be to any \nSenator.\n  Here are a couple of charts. I do not know the name of this company. \nBut here is what their ad says. ``Nobody beats our deal.'' ``No sales \ntax added outside of North Carolina.''\n  Now, technically, that is correct. They do not add any sales tax. The \npoor consumer who buys that yacht, or whatever, is subject to a tax, \nbut he is misled by this ad into believing that he will never have to \npay any sales tax.\n  Here it is, ``No sales tax added.'' Now, it is true they do not add \nit, but if a State you live in happens to catch you buying that, they \ncan assess a sales tax against you.\n  [[Page S3847]] I have some letters that I will put in the Record in a \nmoment, Mr. President, from people from all over the country who have \ngotten the sad news that they thought they were buying $10,000 worth of \nfurniture tax free.\n And the clerk that sold them assured them, ``We will ship this from \nNorth Carolina to Florida, and you will not have to pay sales tax on \nit.''\n\n  But think about this. Wallcovering, Inc.--I blocked out the address \nof this company--here is their advertising: ``Discount wallcovering, \nthe phone way.'' Now, all these mail order houses have their 1-800 \nnumber listed on every page of their catalog. ``The phone way, save 33 \nto 66 percent.''\n  And what do you think? No sales tax outside of Pennsylvania. That is \nnot the worst of it. A lot of them have advertised ``No sales tax.'' \nThey do not say, ``No sales tax added,'' as they do here. They just say \n``No sales tax.'' A person getting ready to order wall covering, I \npromise, would assume that there is no sales tax.\n  But that is not the worst of this firm. Listen to this: ``Stop in \nyour neighborhood, write down the pattern number, and then call us.'' \nUse that poor stiff down on Main Street. Go into his store and shop. \nGet the model number, get the cover number, whatever, and then call our \n800 number and save the sales tax.\n  I have never introduced a piece of legislation in this body, Mr. \nPresident, that I thought was more meritorious than this. When I \noffered this amendment on the unfunded mandates bill these mail order \nhouses started sending telegrams to every single person they had ever \nsold 10 cents worth to and said ``Write your Senator. Tell them you \ndon't want any more taxes. Tell them Senator Bumpers' proposal will \ncost them an arm and a leg.'' And a lot of people bought into that \nbusiness about it being a new tax, and scared to death they will get a \n30-second spot running against them the next time they run, being a \ntaxer and a spender.\n  Ask the little shopkeeper in your hometown on Main Street what he \nthinks about it. Ask your Governor or your mayor how he or she feels \nabout it.\n  We had a music dealer in North Little Rock testify. This music dealer \nsaid, ``People come into our shop all the time, get model numbers off \nour musical instruments so they can order from a mail order house. They \nget it from a mail order house, it does not work, and then they bring \nit in here for repair, and they think we ought to repair it free \nbecause we sell that same product.''\n  Now, Mr. President, if the Presiding Officer will pardon this odious \ncomparison, it is just like mining law reform. It may not happen this \nyear, may not even happen next year, but this is going to happen.\n  Do Senators know who collects taxes in every single State? The Boy \nScouts. When ordering Scout uniforms out of their catalog, order it \nfrom Florida, they collect the tax and send it to the State of Florida. \nIf the Boy Scouts can do it, surely the Lands' End and L.L. Bean and \nall the others can do it.\n  I am not going to bore Members with a bunch of catalogs. I keep a \ncouple hundred in the office just for amusement. I am not going to bore \nMembers with them, but that argument about how complex it is, it would \ntake a Philadelphia lawyer to decipher the instructions on some of \nthese mail order houses. Some of them do business in 25 States. If you \nlive in this State, this State and this State, add 5 percent for sales \ntax; if you live in this State, add 4 percent sales tax, plus sales tax \non the shipping charges; if you live in this State, allow 3 days for \ndelivery; if you live in this State allow 2 days for delivery. And they \ntalk about this being complicated.\n  Mr. President, the reason I say this is an idea whose time has come, \nand it will pass ultimately, is because this business is growing a lot \nfaster than the retail business in your hometown.\n  So I always want to say to these people who say this is too \nburdensome, it is a new tax. All of those arguments we will hear when \nwe debate this, they are the most specious arguments I have ever heard. \nI want to say to those people, what if everybody in the country decides \nto start ordering from mail order houses? Who will educate our \nchildren? Who will provide for fire protection and law enforcement and \nthe landfills? If they continue to grow as fast as they are growing \nright now, compared to Main Street merchants, that is where we are \nheaded.\n  The Senator from Maine--do not misunderstand me--I am not quarreling \nwith the Senator from Maine. They have L.L. Bean in their State doing \nalmost $1 million a year. I understand we all protect our own local \ninterests, but you want to say to a lot of those people, ``You are \ngetting your sales tax from the biggest mail order house in the \ncountry, but nobody else is.''\n  Is it fair for people to get this sudden notice when they thought \nthey bought merchandise with no sales tax? Is it fair for them to \nsuddenly get a notice from the State Revenue Department because their \nnext door neighbor squealed on them for buying that oriental rug out of \nNew York? It is patently unfair to the purchaser to suddenly find out \nthat he owes a big tax bill that he was told by the mail order house \nthat he would not have to pay.\n  So far as the burden is concerned, I want Senators to listen to this. \nThese are not my words. These are Fingerhut's words, last quarter of \n1993, Fingerhut in their annual report to their stockholders:\n\n       To the extent that any States are successful in requiring \n     use tax collection the cost of the company's business, doing \n     business, could be increased although it does not believe any \n     increase would be material.\n  Lands' End, probably the first quarterly report of 1994,\n\n       Although collecting use taxes would likely influence the \n     buying decisions of some customers, the company believes \n     there would be no material adverse affects on financial \n     results.\n  They are two of the biggest ones in the United States saying, ``We do \nnot think the imposition of the collection of these sales taxes will \naffect our profits.''\n  Finally, why are we doing this now? Because until 1992, we could not. \nIn 1967 the Supreme Court said in the famous case of Bellas Hess, a big \nmail order catalog house, the Supreme Court said the States may not \nimpose a tax on mail order catalog houses because it would constitute \nan undue burden on commerce, interstate commerce, as prohibited by the \nConstitution, and would also be a violation of the due process clause \nof the 14th amendment. That was in 1967. Nobody can do anything because \nthe Supreme Court said they could not.\n  In 1992 in the case of Quill versus North Dakota, the Supreme Court \nreversed half of that and said, ``We no longer believe that the \nimposition of a tax by the States on mail order houses is a violation \nof due process.'' Since the determination as to what burdens interstate \ncommerce can be determined by Congress, it is now up to Congress to \npass a law, if they choose, that allows the States to impose this tax \non this roughly 825 mail order houses.\n  So in 1992, the Supreme Court said, ``Congress, it's up to you. If \nyou want to help the States and the States want to impose this sales \ntax collection burden on the mail order houses, like they do on that \npoor Main Street merchant, Congress is going to have to pass a law \nenabling them to do it.''\n  So it has only been since that 1992 Supreme Court decision that we \nhave had the authority to allow the States to do this.\n  Mr. President, if we cannot pass this, I hope I do not hear anymore \nwhining, groaning, moaning, and gnashing of teeth about unfunded \nmandates on the States when you refuse to help the States collect a \nlegitimate tax to deal with unfunded mandates and a whole host of other \nproblems.\n  And if this bill does not pass, I hope I do not hear any moaning \nabout the poor small business people in this country, how we ought to \ndo something for the small business people. Everybody is always willing \nto do something for small business people as long as it does not affect \nbig business people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Ray Jones, \nowner of Long Beach Yacht Sales, Long Beach, CA; a letter from Mamie R. \nWillis, Portland, TN, the sad recipient of a pretty good sized order \nonly to find out that she owed the sales tax; White Furniture Co. in my \nown home State from Debbie White, who talks about how competitively \nunfair it is for her to have to charge sales tax on furniture sold all \nover town and people ordering furniture from mail order \n[[Page S3848]] houses and paying no sales tax; and finally a letter \nfrom an ordinary citizen, John Dix, who bought a house full of \nfurniture in North Carolina, almost $10,000 worth, and suddenly was \nslapped with a tax bill of $700 that he and his wife never dreamed even \nexisted. If you want to stop all of that, fine.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                       Long Beach Yacht Sales,\n\n                                 Long Beach, CA, January 18, 1994.\n     Attention: Mr. Stan Fendley, Tax Council\n     Hon. Senator Bumpers,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Thank you, in advance, for your sponsorship of legislation \n     regarding the collection of interstate sales tax. This week \n     we lost a $240,000 deal as a result of a sales tax issue. \n     They buyer bought a boat in Oregon to avoid our local and \n     state sales tax. The vessel will be kept out of state for the \n     required period of time and will be subsequently brought into \n     California after the waiting period has elapsed. Based on our \n     local tax rate of 8.25% the resulting tax would have been \n     $19,800.\n       Not only did we (and the State) lose this deal, but we also \n     lost the time and expenses involved in upselling the customer \n     to a more expensive boat (from $140,000 to $240,000), sea \n     trialing the boat and providing extensive consultation \n     regarding the product. The customer thanked us but basically \n     said for $19,800 he would have to make an economic choice to \n     buy elsewhere. We did not have the margin to discount the \n     product further to even attempt to compete.\n       In todays economic environment it is tough enough to \n     succeed but without some form of a fair interstate sales tax \n     collection program we, as a responsible and law abiding \n     dealership, can not compete fairly against some of our out of \n     state competitors that are not required to collect sales tax \n     or tax at a significantly lower rate.\n       Again, thank you for sponsoring this important piece of \n     legislation. Hopefully this will create a fair arena in which \n     we can compete. As always, please feel free to contact me \n     with any questions or comments that you may have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Ray Jones,\n     Owner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Portland, TN, September 8, 1994.\n     Senator Dale Bumpers,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: When I moved from Nashville to a \n     small town a number of years ago, I discovered the \n     convenience of mail-order buying. I buy several hundred \n     dollars worth of merchandise per year. I am 75 years old and \n     can no longer drive to the city to shop. I know there are \n     probably thousands in my situation.\n       Several months ago I heard on our local news that people \n     purchasing goods from mail order catalogs must pay State \n     sales and use tax on these items. That was news to me. I, and \n     I know many others, have always thought that merchandise \n     purchased outside our state was not subject to sales tax \n     unless such a vendor had a store within our state.\n       Since I have always tried to be a law-abiding citizen, I \n     added up from my records all purchases made in recent years, \n     figured the sales tax, and mailed a check to the State \n     Department of Revenue. But what about those many people who \n     still do not know they are liable for these taxes? This \n     situation makes it unfair to those who are paying.\n       I once ordered many Christmas gifts from catalogs. Now I am \n     inclined to send money to my out-of-town relatives, avoiding \n     the hassle of tax-record keeping.\n       I believe it is the duty of mail order companies to collect \n     sales taxes due, just as other stores and grocers do. Modern-\n     day computers certainly make it easy for them.\n       I understand you are working on legislation to correct this \n     situation. I hope you will succeed.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Mamie R. Willis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          White Furniture Co.,\n\n                                                 January 19, 1994.\n     Senator Dale Bumpers,\n     Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: I want to make you aware of an unfair \n     tax situation that has been occurring for years in the \n     furniture business. For quite some time we tried to ignore \n     this, but when you see or hear the results every day of the \n     week you have to finally stop and take notice.\n       My family has a small retail furniture business in \n     Arkansas. We have paid taxes in the same small town for \n     years. Now we have customers who are being educated by \n     advertisers to shop their local retail stores for model \n     numbers and prices--then call North Carolina and order and \n     avoid paying our state sales taxes.\n       I have personally lost individual sales in my area for \n     fifteen to twenty thousand dollars. We have found that the \n     larger sales are the ones that people do out of state because \n     of the high percentage of tax.\n       I'm not crying about the prices; I would just like to have \n     a level playing field. We service our clients with free \n     delivery; we furnish the showrooms where they can touch and \n     feel the merchandise; we finance the merchandise locally, and \n     we employ Arkansas people to sell and deliver the furniture.\n       Last year NBC did a travel segment and, on over 200 \n     stations across our country, showed people how to take their \n     vacations in North Carolina, shop while they are there and \n     save enough in sales tax to pay for their vacation. Then CBS \n     did a week long special on ``Good Morning America,'' devoting \n     one day to furniture, one to cars, and another to clothes, \n     etc.\n       I don't know about the other 49 states, but I do know that \n     our state could use the revenue from those lost sales taxes \n     for our schools, roads, and local government.\n       I will be proud to support you in any effort you can make \n     to help our state collect these unpaid taxes.\n           Thank you.\n     Debbie White.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              Hilton Head, SC, September 12, 1994.\n     Hon. Dale Bumpers,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: While on a trip to North Carolina a \n     few years ago, my wife and I visited a furniture store to \n     look for items for our winter home in Hilton Head, South \n     Carolina. As you are no doubt aware, North Carolina is the \n     furniture center of America. People come from all over \n     America to buy furniture in North Carolina, drawn by word of \n     mouth and various means of advertising.\n       As we shopped at one store in High Point, my wife and I \n     found a number of furniture pieces that we were interested in \n     buying. While considering the purchase, we were told by the \n     sales staff that if this furniture were delivered to our home \n     in South Carolina, no sales tax would be collected. This \n     represented a savings of several hundred dollars, and became \n     one factor in our decision to make the purchase. \n     Subsequently, we concluded the purchase agreement, and the \n     furniture was delivered to our home in South Carolina a short \n     time later.\n       Approximately four years after making that purchase, we \n     were surprised to receive a letter from the South Carolina \n     Department of Revenue informing us that the furniture we had \n     purchased in North Carolina was subject to South Carolina's \n     use tax. (South Carolina had learned about the purchase when \n     North Carolina audited the furniture company and shared the \n     audit information with South Carolina.) In addition to the 5 \n     percent tax, we owed interest and penalties because we had \n     failed to pay the tax promptly. On our furniture of some \n     $10,000, the total we owed for tax, interest and penalties \n     was approximately $700.\n       As you can imagine, we were shocked and upset at this news. \n     We had no idea that we owed tax on this purchase. Like most \n     consumers, we were accustomed to having sales taxes collected \n     at the time of purchase, and it seemed odd to expect the \n     customer to know when, where and how much tax to pay. And \n     because the furniture salesman had told us that no tax would \n     be ``collected,'' we assumed that no tax existed.\n       I am not complaining about the tax itself. I certainly do \n     not enjoy paying taxes, but had we known about this tax at \n     the time of purchase, it wouldn't have been so bad. In that \n     case, we could have considered the tax as part of the cost of \n     the transaction and then made an\n      informed decision about whether to make the purchase or not. \n     Indeed, it's quite possible that we would still have \n     bought the furniture. But we were blindsided. We were led \n     to believe that there was no tax, then told four years \n     later that there was a tax. That simply is not fair.\n       The worst part of this situation is that we were expected \n     to pay interest and penalties. As I told the South Carolina \n     Department of Revenue, I felt that this was particularly \n     unreasonable since we didn't even know we owed the tax--and \n     they didn't know we owed the taxes for four years. In the \n     end, I won half the battle: they agreed to waive the \n     penalties, but we still had to pay the interest.\n       I understand that the State of South Carolina cannot \n     control what North Carolina merchants tell their customers. \n     But the United States Congress can and should do so. I urge \n     you to pass legislation immediately correcting this situation \n     so that other consumers do not have the same bad experience \n     we had.\n       In my opinion, you should require merchants who ship goods \n     to other states to inform those customers that taxes may \n     apply. The disclosure should be in writing, and the \n     customer's signature should be required. Any merchant who \n     fails to give the disclosure should have to pay 50 percent of \n     any penalties or interest that occur. I believe this would \n     discourage companies from failing to share important \n     information with the consumer.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you \n     on this issue. I hope that you will move quickly to ensure \n     that other consumers aren't misled the way my wife and I \n     were.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         John Dix.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3842-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3848-S3849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, one of the members of the \nPresbyterian clergy with whom I have had the chance to work on \nhistorical projects and other things is the Reverend Robert Tabscott.\n  He sent me some observations he made 21 years ago about our former \ncolleague, Senator Bill Fulbright. Bill Fulbright was a remarkable \npublic servant.\n  I had the chance to work with him on exchange programs and other \nmatters in the area of foreign policy.\n  To get a little more perspective on the impact of Senator Fulbright \non people, it is good to read what Robert Tabscott wrote almost 21 \nyears ago.\n  I ask that the tribute be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                            [November 1974]\n\n                              The Senator\n\n                          (By Robert Tabscott)\n\n       Reaching back in my memories I was first appreciative of \n     William Fulbright in the early fall of 1961 when he eulogized \n     the fallen Dag Hammerskijold. Six years later in Mississippi \n     I read his book, ``The Arrogance of Power.'' It was a \n     watershed for me: a provocative word in a hard and sterile \n     time. The book challenged the American dream of opulence and \n     power and called for a rediscovery of the values of Jefferson \n     and the American revolution. But more, it was a fervent \n     appeal for a new tolerance among us for people of differing \n     philosophies and cultures. The book shook my patriotic myths \n     and aroused a circumspection for which I shall always be \n     grateful.\n       So when it became possible to interview the Senator on one \n     of my recent visits to Washington, I was beside myself. \n     Meeting him in the privacy of his large comfortable office, \n     it was hard to imagine him as an international figure. He was \n     surrounded by half-packed cartons of books (a prelude to his \n     departure from the Senate), a cumbersome stack of magazines \n     and papers, several botties of mineral water and at least a \n     week's supply of health foods and vitamins. Entering the \n     office, I stood motionless. ``Sit down,'' he said in a \n     sonorous voice. I was extremely nervous and he waited for me \n     to gain my composure. ``You will have to excuse me,'' I said, \n     ``but this is quite an occasion for me.'' Graciously, he \n     coaxed me on. ``Well I am glad I could give you this time.'' \n     I described my work and the Rockefeller grant and asked if I \n     could take notes. He smiled and said, ``I don't know if I \n     will say anything important, but you may.'' And so I did.\n       J. William Fulbright was born in Missouri sixty-nine years \n     ago. But he grew up in Arkansas, enjoying the benefits of a \n     well-known and prosperous family. He won honors at the \n     University in Fayetteville and was awarded a coveted Rhodes \n     scholarship. His three years at Oxford were indelible. He \n     read Tennyson, Lord Byron, Dryden, inspected Norman Churches, \n     sought out Canterberry and Stradford and buried himself in \n     English history and political thought. In 1928 he settled for \n     a time in Vienna. From there he ventured with a friend to \n     Salonika, Athens, and the Balkans. But his mind probed even \n     further into Chinese history, Russian literature, and Creek \n     philosophy.\n       At 34 he became the president of the University of \n     Arkansas. Two years later during a political controversy he \n     was asked to resign by the governor. He refused and was \n     promptly fired. It was 1942. That spring, young Fulbright \n     decided to run for Congress. Contrary to almost everyone's \n     expectations, he was elected. By 1945 he had become the \n     junior senator from Arkansas and had launched a career that \n     would span thirty years and bring him international \n     prominence.\n       We probably know William Fulbright best as chairman of the \n     Senate's Foreign Relations Committee and for his untiring \n     efforts to achieve detente with Russia and a better \n     understanding of world Communism. For that he has been \n     labeled a liberal and Communist sympathizer.\n       His greatest and most difficult years were between 1950 and \n     1973. At times he stood alone as he did against the maniacal \n     red crusade of Joseph McCarthy, or as a persistent critic of \n     two Administrations' Vietnam policies. On other occasions he \n     has been painfully silent as he was during the Little Rock \n     crisis and throughout most of the Civil Rights movement. The \n     Senator is far from the hero his supporters have wanted him \n     to be. But what is significant is that he has remained a man \n     of conscience and integrity who has not sought to cover his \n     inconsistencies but has acknowledged the painful struggle of \n     public service and the burden of political compromise.\n       Two events illustrate that tension. On August 6, 1964, \n     President Johnson requested Fulbright to introduce the famous \n     Tonkin Resolution which gave the chief executive authority, \n     ``* * * to take all necessary measures to repel any armed \n     attack against forces of the United States and to prevent \n     further aggression.'' That action put us into a land war in \n     Asia. Only two Senators, Morse of Oregon and Gruening of \n     Alaska, voted against the resolution. But by February, 1965, \n     Fulbright had become disillusioned. He was alarmed, ``* * * \n     by the tyranny of Puritan virtues, of the dogmatic ideology \n     of false patriotism and a resurgence of manifest destiny in \n     American life.'' The Senator would later confess that the \n     Tonkin Resolution was one of the most regrettable mistakes of \n     his public life.\n       In 1957, 19 senators and 77 representatives from the eleven \n     states of the old Confederacy, drafted a manifesto attacking \n     the Supreme Court's historic decision on segregation. ``The \n     court,'' they said, ``had substituted naked power for \n     established law.'' The signers pledged themselves ``* * * to \n     resist integration through all lawful means and by any lawful \n     means.'' J. William Fulbright signed the Manifesto.\n       But there were reasons, he contended. It was an election \n     year and there was great pressure in the south. He could \n     leave his southern colleagues and go his own way or stay with \n     them and be assured of remaining in the Senate. Better to \n     compromise and to fight again. He was convinced that he could \n     not survive if he stood alone. He chose to remain silent. \n     Many were shocked and disappointed because of his actions.\n       But when you consider the events of the last decade there \n     were few men and women in public life who stood apart to face \n     the crisis of Little Rock, Vietnam, Selma, Kent State or \n     Attica. At a time when the South needed the wisdom of its \n     statesmen, not one major figure dared to challenge the old \n     myths. It was left to a heroic company of black men and women \n     and an unlikely army of students, teachers, ministers, \n     editors, lawyers, judges, and businessmen to stir the \n     nation's conscience and to open a way for politicians to \n     follow.\n       [[Page S3850]] William Fulbright is a scholar, a man of \n     reason and reflection. Some consider him a child of the \n     Enlightenment. Intellectually he is much like Adlai Stevenson \n     or Woodrow Wilson. He speaks of Jefferson and DeTocqueville, \n     but I would venture he is more Hamiltonian in his philosophy. \n     If he were to put this in theological terms, he would \n     probably say that God's special gift to man is his capacity \n     for reason.\n       A biographer has described him as ``* * * a complex human \n     being, at times, witty, erudite, earthy, sardonic, \n     melancholy, shrewd, innocent to the point of nievete, and \n     candid--but never indifferent.'' Someone else said, ``Fifty \n     years from now when they talk of Senators, they will remember \n     Fulbright.''\n       Great men and women are not perfected; they endure. They \n     survive the best and worst that is in them to become. In the \n     end, they stand apart because they are real, but in so doing, \n     they are always just beyond our grasp. Most politicians like \n     their constituents, lack the intellectual penetration to form \n     independent judgments and therefore accept the prevailing \n     opinions of their society. But there are always a few who, \n     assessing the circumstances, speak their minds and call us to \n     growth and maturity.\n       At the end of his book, ``The Arrogance of Power,'' William \n     Fulbright, wrote: ``For my own part I prefer the America of \n     Lincoln and Adlai Stevenson. I prefer to have my country the \n     friend rather than the enemy of demands for social justice; I \n     prefer to have the Communists treated as human beings, with \n     all the human capacity for good and bad, for wisdom and \n     folly, rather than embodiments of an evil abstraction; and I \n     prefer to see my country in the role of a sympathetic friend \n     to humanity than its stern and painful school-master.''\n       When you consider the recent revelations of our \n     government's involvement in the overthrow of the government \n     in Chili, Fulbright's words are apocalyptic. He stands apart.\n       When I left the Senator's office, the long shadows of an \n     October afternoon had filled most of the street. Already the \n     leaves had begun to fall and a tinge of cold passed through \n     the air. A season was passing. I walked on through the park \n     toward the Capitol, warmed and grateful for what I seen and \n     heard. I realized that I had been with a remarkable man whose \n     wisdom, if remembered, could make a difference in our \n     world.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3849-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con.

Mr. President, for a number of years, my Chicago \noffice was run by someone for whom I have come to have great respect, \nBettylu Saltzman.\n  Recently, she was honored by the American Jewish Congress, along with \nElaine Wishner, for her leadership.\n  That happened 6 or 8 weeks ago. Just recently, I had the opportunity \nto read her acceptance remarks.\n  Her eloquent remarks urge people to be sensitive and understanding, \nto reach out to all human beings, while being proud and sensitive of \nour individual traditions.\n  While the remarks are addressed to a Jewish audience, those of us who \nare Christians can learn from reading her remarks also.\n  I should add, Bettylu Saltzman, in these remarks, follows a great \ntradition. Her father, Philip Klutznick, served as one of our \nAmbassadors to the United Nations and served as Secretary of Commerce \nunder Jimmy Carter. But more important than the offices he held was the \nway he held them. He called for reaching out when it was unpopular, as \nBettylu mentions in her remarks.\n  I am proud to have a citizen like Bettylu Saltzman in the State of \nIllinois.\n  At this point, I ask that her remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       It's a great honor to be here tonight. And while I remember \n     Golda Meir's famous admonition--``Don't be humble; you're not \n     that great''--it's hard to avoid, when sharing an honor with \n     Elaine Wishner and joining the ranks of the other outstanding \n     women who have been recognized in the past seven years.\n       I don't know if I belong among them, but I'm proud to stand \n     with them, as they are truly people who have made a \n     difference--giving of themselves to make the world a better \n     place for all of us.\n       [[Page S3851]] Through their examples, they have advanced \n     the cause of justice which is an essential part of Jewish \n     values and Jewish tradition.\n       Since its inception, the American Jewish Congress has \n     personified that tradition. And for the past ten years, the \n     Commission for Women's Equality has provided valuable and \n     enlightened leadership.\n       I'm delighted to lend my name to that important effort.\n       But this evening also is gratifying because it marks a kind \n     of milestone in my own evolution.\n       Though I come from a family with a deep commitment to \n     Judaism and Israel, it is only in recent years that I have \n     really come to terms with what that means to me.\n       I am the only girl among five children and I believe that \n     is the reason I was largely deprived of the religious and \n     cultural\n      education that might have given me an earlier and richer \n     appreciation for Jewish history and tradition.\n       Like many contemporary Jews, I struggled with the relevance \n     of religion in my life, when religion seemed remote and \n     ritualistic. And, as a much younger woman, I tried to find my \n     place in Jewish life, in a community in which such \n     participation was strictly dictated by a few, so-called \n     ``mainstream'' organizations, in which men dominated and \n     alternative points of view were not particularly well \n     received.\n       My own metamorphosis began with the realization of the \n     underlying lessons and values that form the foundation of \n     Judaism--values that are as relevant and important today as \n     they were thousands of years ago.\n       We Jews believe that it is our responsibility to repair the \n     world--Tikkun Olam, and a commitment to justice is a \n     recurrent theme in our history. The entire prophetic \n     tradition commands us to show compassion and seek justice. We \n     do this not just for our fellow Jews, but for all human \n     beings.\n       Listen carefully to this quote from Leviticus inscribed on \n     the Liberty Bell--``Proclaim liberty throughout all the land \n     unto all the inhabitants thereof''.\n       That is why I'm proud to serve with Susan Manilow on the \n     board of Mount Sinai Hospital, where Ruth Rothstein labored \n     so long and hard to see to it that Chicagoans of all races, \n     religions and creeds are provided with excellent health care. \n     It is why I served on the board of the Crossroads Fund and \n     continue to serve on the board of the Jewish Council on Urban \n     Affairs.\n       Recently I was introduced to someone who recognized me as a \n     trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital--a position of which I am \n     justifiably proud. So, I was quite disturbed when this person \n     admonished me that I should spend more time worrying about \n     Jews, instead of poor people in the inner city.\n       Ethics, morality and the commandment to help others, are \n     central to our tradition and our way of life. Through such \n     activities, I have found my place in the Jewish community and \n     in the process I have come to understand my Jewishness in a \n     much deeper sense.\n       I share this thought because of the current debate on \n     Jewish continuity, and my belief that if we are to encourage \n     the perpetuation of Jewish awareness, we must discourage the \n     kind of thinking that would dismiss a Mount Sinai Hospital or \n     Jewish Council on Urban Affairs as an invalid way of \n     expressing one's commitment to Jewish values.\n       The same is true of attitudes toward how one can best \n     express support for Israel, and whether there is room for \n     different approaches and views.\n       Over a decade ago, my father Philip Klutznick, courageously \n     spoke of the need to bridge the chasm between Arab and Jew. \n     He said we cannot afford, nor should we want, Israel to live \n     in a perpetual state of war, and suggested that Israel's \n     survival demanded an end to the conflict.\n       Though he devoted much of his life to the Jewish community \n     and support of Israel, he was censured by some members of the \n     community, who accused him of treachery and betrayal.\n       Today, once again, there was an horrendous terrorist attack \n     at a bus stop north of Tel Aviv. Many lives were lost and \n     many more Israeli citizens were maimed. But does it behoove \n     us to give in to the enemies of peace, who perpetrate these \n     atrocities in the Middle East or any place else in the world? \n     I hope not.\n       I do not believe that due to the heroic actions of Israeli \n     and Arab leaders, my father's dream of peace is several steps \n     closer today.\n       I am vice president of the New Israel Fund, an organization \n     dedicated to promoting social justice and democracy within \n     Israel. I support the work of the Fund because it is \n     consistent with my belief that maintaining a civil and just \n     society takes vigilance and hard work, beginning at the \n     grassroots, and because continued political, economic and \n     moral support for Israel from America and the world community \n     depends upon its survival as a healthy and robust democracy.\n       This endeavor is the way I have chosen to act on my \n     commitment to Israel, though in the past, the New Israel Fund \n     was not an organization that was always warmly welcomed into \n     the Jewish community.\n       But my hope, as we carry on this debate about Jewish \n     continuity, is that we think more expansively, understanding \n     that there are many ways to demonstrate our devotion, each as \n     valid as the next.\n       If one chooses to invest time and resources in an \n     organization like the New Israel Fund, that is a triumph for \n     the community, because it means one more person committed to \n     justice, equality and the principles of Judaism.\n       In times when we are concerned about Jews in America \n     drifting away, we simply cannot afford to disqualify and \n     discourage those who are reaching out to find their place in \n     the community.\n       And I hope I don't offend, when I include in that category \n     the young couples, Jew and non-Jew, who ask a rabbi to join \n     them in marriage. By seeking rabbinic involvement they are \n     making an important choice. By refusing them, we simply \n     insure the likelihood that one more couple will be lost, and \n     one more family isolated from our traditions.\n       My point is that we cannot address the issue of Jewish \n     continuity without broadening our horizons and opening our \n     arms. Rigidity will not lead to greater Jewish \n     identification--inclusiveness will.\n       As the years go by, I grow more and more appreciative of \n     the meaning and value of Judaism, the sense of rootedness and \n     belonging, and the opportunity to participate in Jewish life \n     in ways in which I feel most comfortable.\n       That's a wonderful gift, which I want my children and \n     future generations to share.\n       But for that to happen they must embrace our traditions and \n     as a community we must enhance the attractiveness of a \n     variety of paths leading to meaningful Jewish experiences; \n     not devalue or marginalize choices that diverge from the \n     middle of the road.\n       Tonight, you have honored me for the manner in which I have \n     chosen to connect with those traditions, and in doing so, you \n     have sent an important message that there are many meaningful \n     ways to fulfill our obligations as Jews.\n       For that, as much as for this wonderful award, I thank you \n     very much.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/13/senate-section/article/S3850-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1995\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.
